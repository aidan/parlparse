<H2><center>Standing Committee E</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 12 February 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Dr. Michael Clark in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/100/1997100.htm">Regional Development Agencies Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It has been a while since I was with you last and I understand that some progress has been made—<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. We have made some progress, but before the Committee continues an important issue needs to be cleared up. Near the end of our last sitting, planning powers were discussed. I asked whether the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning was<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“arguing in his rejection of the amendment that the planning powers in the Bill are no wider than, and cannot be used on any land other than, that which is currently available to English Partnerships?”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Minister replied: “no”. I surmised that the powers cannot be exercised on any land other than that which was available to English Partnerships. To lay the matter completely to rest, I asked:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“So, to be absolutely clear, is the Minister telling us that the Bill does not allow RDAs to exercise planning powers over any areas of land that are not currently available to English Partnerships?”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Minister replied, “Yes.”—[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 10 February 1998; c. 268.]<P>
I made inquiries in the Library and was referred to section 159(1) and (2) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. Those subsections state:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The main object of the Agency shall be to secure the regeneration of land in England—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) which is land of one or more of the descriptions mentioned in subsection (2); and<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) which the Agency (having regard to guidance, and acting in accordance with directions, given by the Secretary of State under section 167) determines to be suitable for regeneration under this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The descriptions of land referred to in subsection (1)(a) are—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) land which is vacant or unused;<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) land which is situated in an urban area and which is under-used or ineffectively used;<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) land which is contaminated, derelict, neglected or unsightly; and<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) land which is likely to become derelict, neglected or unsightly by reason of actual or apprehended collapse of the surface as the result of the carrying out of relevant operations which have ceased to be carried out”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Does the Minister wish to add anything to his replies of Tuesday? It seems that English Partnerships is confined to the types of land to which I have referred. The Bill before us makes no reference to similar restrictions on the type of land over which RDAs may exercise responsibility. If the Minister can point out such a restriction in the Bill, I should be grateful, but I have searched the Bill in vain.<P>
If the Bill does not contain similar restrictions, there is a danger that the Committee will proceed on a rather misleading statement from the Minister, which I am sure was made inadvertently. Can he confirm on the record that the powers that RDAs may exercise at the discretion of the Secretary of State can be exercised in respect of land over which English Partnerships has never been able to exercise power?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not strictly a point for me, but a request for clarification. From the Minister’s body language, it seems that he wants to clarify the point, although it can be debated further under clauses 24 and 25.<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I want to put the record straight. We shall have a wider debate later on the substantial and probing amendments that have been tabled on clauses 24 and 25. Just to put the record straight, the Secretary of State will have power to designate areas in which RDAs may act as the local planning authority. The powers are essentially the same as those provided by section 170 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 in relation to English Partnerships. However, there are two exceptions. First, in the case of EP, the power is limited to an area<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“which is an urban area or which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is suitable for urban development”,<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
whereas for RDAs, the power could be used in any part of an RDA’s area<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is suitable for regeneration or development”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Secondly, EP’s use of planning powers given to it in that way would be limited by its statutory objectives. Its main objective is to secure the regeneration of land in England, which may include land that is vacant or unused. The RDAs’ purposes are broader.<P>
That is my clarification of that matter. We are prepared to debate it in its proper context when we reach clauses 24 and 25. My statement clarifies and supports what I said two days ago.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. As the Minister said, and as you, Dr. Clark have confirmed, it will be possible to debate this policy issue more widely when we reach clause 25 and succeeding clauses. I do not think, however, that he has confirmed his statement at column 268. In fact, he has directly contradicted himself. Nevertheless, I am glad that we have an accurate statement on the record confirming that RDAs will exercise powers that go substantially wider than those given to English Partnerships. That removes one of the Minister’s main arguments which he has used in debate after debate.<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>General financial duties</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> This is the first clause in the Bill to deal with financial matters. The White Paper was curiously silent on the issue of money and Ministers have been reticent about it. Perhaps that is not so curious, however, because it is clear from what little information is available that the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions has been totally outgunned in every Whitehall battle over RDA resources.<P>
Will the Minister confirm that not a single penny has been committed to the work of RDAs by any Department other than his own? If that is the case, it is no surprise that he was forced to plunder the Rural Development Commission’s budget, more than half of which has been removed to be subsumed into the mostly urban activities of RDAs.<P>
As for the wording of the clause, will the Minister explain the financial duties of the agency which the Secretary of State may determine? It is important to have that explained fully because we have established that the activities of RDAs will go much wider than those of English Partnerships. It will not be satisfactory for the Minister to say, “This is just the same as English Partnerships.” The RDAs have wider powers. We must be clear what financial duties the Secretary of State may determine.<P>
Will the Minister explain what different determinations may be made for different functions, as suggested in 9 (1)(b)? Will he confirm that the notice that the Secretary of State can give an RDA about its financial duties in 9 (2) (a) may be effective on a retrospective basis? Why would the Secretary of State need retrospective powers? In what circumstances will his powers be exercised on a retrospective basis? What are the supplemental provisions referred to in subsection (2) (b)? A few examples would be helpful.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> RDAs will be given substantial budgets, contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said, to meet their objectives. The final budgets will not be decided until later this year. I think the hon. Gentleman knows that a comprehensive spending review is being undertaken of all Departments to see whether value for money and prudence prevail in the expenditure of public moneys. Regeneration programmes and EP are subject to that review. My comments should be considered with the CSR in mind. <P>
Broad historical figures show that in 1997-98, the budget for regeneration programmes, which will be inherited by RDAs, is approximately £750 million, with a further £1 billion attracted through joint ventures with the private sector. That package will ensure that RDAs will be the key players in the development of their areas.<P>
Those are the ball-park figures. The comprehensive spending review will be completed later this year, before the RDAs become legal entities on 1 April 1999. There may be major changes in the allocation of moneys and in organisational structure. The relevant figures will be published in a financial memorandum, which will be issued by the RDAs, and it will be subject to public scrutiny.<P>
In broad terms, the budget for the Rural Development Commission is about £40 million, about £25 million of which is designated for the economic regeneration of rural areas. If my memory serves me correctly, about £750 million will come from the single regeneration budget. The RDC should use that £25 million skillfully and group together larger financial packages that will assist the local area. However, I cannot give specific figures. The comprehensive budget will be published in a financial memorandum, and it will be subject to public scrutiny.<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): Has there ever been a spending review—comprehensive or otherwise—that has left what was the Department of the Environment and is now the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions with more money than it had before?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Under the previous Administration, the answer is obviously no. That Conservative Government simply cut and cut again. the comprehensive spending review will consider precisely that matter. I am not at liberty to divulge details to the Committee, but that review is coming up with some very interesting points. The right hon. Member should consider the fact that for the channel tunnel rail link, which is located not far from here, a further £1.2 billion was requested. Quite honestly, I must question how public moneys were previously allocated and how some contracts were awarded.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Has the Minister finished?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In that case, I must repeat my questions. Will the Minister confirm that no other Department has contributed a penny to the running costs of RDAs? Never mind the comprehensive spending review—we are discussing the financial provisions for RDAs. Has he obtained one penny from another Department?<P>
The Minister said that the skills of the RDC would be better employed if they operated through a regional development agency. Will he confirm that no one in the RDC held that view when the removal of more than half its budget was announced, and that that view was imposed by the Minister because he could not find any other money?<P>
What are the financial duties of the agency, which the Secretary of State may determine? Will he give a few examples? Will he explain on what basis different determinations may be made for different functions? The Minister has not yet vouchsafed an explanation.<P>
Will the Minister confirm whether the clause will allow the Secretary of State to give RDAs retrospective notices about their financial duties? Under what circumstances does he expect such retrospective powers to be exercised? What supplemental provisions are envisaged?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I have already said that when the SRB—which will come under the RDAs—was being established, four Departments were involved: they were then called the Department of Employment—now the Department for Education and Employment—the Department of the Environment, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Transport In addition, the Home Office now also contributes to the delivery of the SRB, beyond what it contributed under the previous Administration. The public expenditure survey line from the Home Office follows through into the delivery of policies to ensure safer cities.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry decides the budget allocation for inward investment—the amount of public money assigned to investment arms in the regions. That responsibility will go to RDAs, which will be given powers to decide whether to keep agencies active or whether inward investment arms will be involved. I understand that discussions on that matter are taking place.<P>
The good handling of finances will be assured by the financial memorandum, which will be in the public domain. The hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) knows that that is how the House proceeds to ensure accountability and transparency.<P>
What was the hon. Gentleman’s final question?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Well, there were several more questions that the Minister has not yet addressed. First, I asked him to confirm that no one connected with the RDC has argued that its programmes would be more effectively packaged if the responsibility for delivering them were taken from it and given to RDAs. <P>
Secondly, I asked him to explain on what basis different determinations may be made for different functions. The Minister seems singularly reluctant to give an example, which is all that I require. I also asked whether the Bill gives the Secretary of State retrospective powers, and if so, under what circumstances the Secretary of State will exercise those powers retrospectively.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I have spent much time out in the field during the consultation period. Several people said, as did the RDC, that we need to move towards a more strategic view of the regions. The RDC’s submissions show that it welcomes the development of RDAs as part of a more comprehensive approach to its work, especially in regeneration. Those on the ground told me that partnerships with further and higher education and with the single regeneration budget would be far greater and would get a bigger bang for the buck if there were a strategic overview. They believed that that was the right direction in which to move.<P>
I do not know where the hon. Member for South Suffolk finds his information. One or two people who are now involved in the field may have expressed some anxiety; I do not say this disparagingly, but I must admit that when I was visiting some organisations, I bumped into several ex-Tory Members and MEPs. The plethora of rural organisations that benefit their little pockets needs to be examined.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> rose—<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Let me finish. The comprehensive spending review will examine how money has been dispensed and the methods and structures of bureaucracies that have been set up to deliver for rural communities, which are rather questionable. We shall examine those objectively in our comprehensive spending review, because we are intent on giving rural communities a far better deal than they have ever received before. Sticking people on quangos has taken a higher priority than examining the work of such organisations.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Can the Minister tell us how much of the RDC budget has been spent on employing former Conservative MPs and MEPs, if any?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I said that I did not speak disparagingly, but the chairman of the Countryside Commission was an MEP—<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We are talking about the RDC: do you know the difference?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This dialogue is wide of the clause—indeed, probably of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I take your guidance, Dr. Clark. I admit that I am tempted from time to time to explain and expose the previous Administration’s incompetence.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Bill does not anywhere refer to the Countryside Commission. However, several clauses, which we shall consider, are devoted solely to the Rural Development Commission, so it is relevant—although the Minister is probably as unfamiliar with those clauses as he was with the clauses to which he referred this morning when he corrected his earlier statement.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That question is pertinent to the comprehensive spending review, which I tried to explain to Opposition Members, but their thinking is so compartmentalised that they cannot think in a lateral way. The Government think laterally and are trying to address some of the serious issues related to public expenditure.<P>
The comprehensive spending review is comprehensive, it is about spending, and it is a review, but I cannot give any more detailed answers. It is unfortunate that Opposition Members have been thinking so narrowly. That is why we are not achieving the economies of scale that are necessary in the regions. For the past 18 years, the Conservatives have been more bothered about controlling from the centre and have displayed a dictatorial attitude which has lulled us all into a false sense of security.<P>
The measure dealing with exceptional circumstances is prudent and we do not expect to use it retrospectively, but if exceptional circumstances arise, they will need to be covered. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Suffolk would agree that Governments must take such actions. One cannot foresee everything, but at least one can legislate for certain events that may happen.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Opposition’s worst fears about the Government’s contempt for rural interests have been confirmed, because the Minister clearly cannot distinguish between the Countryside Commission and the Rural Development Commission. That will not pass unnoticed outside the Committee.<P>
I want to press the Minister on the circumstances in which the retrospective powers might be exercised. We are legislating for something that I find distasteful; giving Ministers retrospective powers. The Minister says that there may be exceptional circumstances in which those powers will need to be exercised, so can he give the Committee a single example of those exceptional circumstances?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> If I knew that, it could be included in the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> On the contrary, the Minister has consistently refused to include in the Bill provisions to deal with all sorts of circumstances that are wholly predictable, so he is clearly reluctant to do that. I am just asking him to give the Committee one example of circumstances in which he thinks it might be necessary to exercise retrospective powers. If he cannot think of a single example, why does he not remove the power from the Bill?<P>
<B>Mr Carbon:</B> Because an exceptional circumstance may arise, and we need to legislate for that. Any prudent Government would do the same—previous Administrations did so on several occasions—and it is responsible to include such a measure. If I knew what the exceptional circumstances were, I would tell the Committee, but I do not. The hon. Member for South Suffolk may have a vision of the future, but I do not.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have heard plenty about the Minister’s vision of other aspects of the future. It is extraordinary for the Minister to say that the Secretary of State must have these powers, but that he cannot envisage any circumstances in which they might be exercised.<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): Not even a Mongolian circumstance.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Quite so, not even circumstances involving Mongolia.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We are getting on to foreign affairs now.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Government grants</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in page 4, line 40, at end insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(2) The approval of the Treasury shall not be given under this section unless the House of Commons has passed a resolution that it is expedient for that approval to be given.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The amendment is about parliamentary control of expenditure and, in light of the fact that we have just approved a clause that gives the Secretary of State retrospective powers, its significance becomes all the greater.<P>
Clause 10 allows the Secretary of State to give regional development agencies any cash he can wring out of the Treasury or his ministerial colleagues in other Departments with the Treasury’s approval. The Minister’s form to date has been vague and any financial question is greeted with the answer that “these matters will be considered under the comprehensive spending review”. That animal seems to be as gargantuan as the integrated transport strategy, and we look forward eagerly to the results of all those deliberations—but expectations are being raised so high that we wonder whether they will take as long to appear as the consultation paper on the right to roam, which the hon. Lady once promised would appear shortly. That promise was made in a parliamentary answer at the beginning of November.<P>
There seems to be a certain lack of enthusiasm around Whitehall for contributing to regional development agency budgets. Against that background there will be anxieties about the possible consequences of the Secretary of State making grants to regionsal agencies. Is it right to presume that the Treasury will consent to the Secretary of State making such grants only if he makes savings elsewhere in his own budget? I suspect that that was the reason for dismemberment of the Rural Develop;ment Commission. In the light of the Minister’s slip of the tongue, I suspect that the Countryside Commission may shortly go the same way.<P>
I fear that the Secretary of State will have to cut other programmes in his Department to find more cash for regional development agencies. The natural place from which funds might be taken to meet the cost of grants is inevitably the revenue support grant—money that is available to local authorities in England. Will the Minister confirm whether the revenue support grant will be reduced in respect of part or all of the amount of any grants to regional development agencies? If the revenue support grant will be reduced only in part, by what proportion is it likely to be reduced relative to the size of the grants being made to the regional development agencies? How much do the Government expect to pay to regional development agencies by way of grant as the Secretary of State is empowered to do under the clause? What can the Minister tell us about the likely spending of an individual regional development agency?<P>
If the Minister is tired of displaying his lack of expertise in terms of the Eastern region, perhaps he will tell us about the West Midlands region to help my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). What steps does the Minister propose to take to inform Parliament about the grants that the Secretary of State will make to the regional development agencies? Will individual development agencies negotiate separately with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions for their grants, or will a collective decision be made on the total amount of grant to all the RDAs; and will that sum then be divided among them, perhaps using a formula modelled on the lines of the successful formula which governs the distribution of the revenue support grant?<P>
What will be the basis on which the Secretary of State decides to make these grants? Will they be performance related? Will they be dependent on the size of the private sector contributions which individual regional development agencies have been able to attract? Will they be dependent on the co-operation of local authorities in the region concerned? How does the Minister expect RDAs to spend the grants? Will the grants be confined to expenditure on predetermined items and, if so, what areas of RDA activity will be eligible for the grants; or will the RDA have complete discretion on how the money is spent once it has received a grant?<P>
We have had no clues about the answers to those questions and I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of explaining exactly what the Government have in mind.<P>

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> The amendment would make another round of parliamentary approval necessary before grants could be made. The power in clause 10 appears in many Acts of Parliament and enables the Secretary of State to pay grant in aid. That is all it does. It provides the power to pay Government money to another body for use as public expenditure. It does not authorise the payment of those funds, it merely confirms the power to do so. As the hon. Gentleman is a long-standing Member of Parliament and was a member of the previous Administration—I might add that he is a fellow ex-member of the Public Accounts Committee—he knows well how Parliament deals with such matters. The use of public funds to pay grant in aid is already separately approved by Parliament—it is approved annually with the passing of the Appropriation Act, when Parliament approves departmental estimates. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman knows well, the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office also have the power to audit and oversee all of these activities. That is how parliamentary scrutiny of public expenditure continues.<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would mean that two votes would have to be held on approving grant in aid, in this instance. That would be completely pointless. It would begin to unpick the system of approving grant in aid and appropriations that has been developed and approved by the legislature, and would lead to a lot of extra votes on things that Parliament had already voted for. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will realise that the amendment is pointless—what it asks to be done is already done by Parliament as a matter of course.<P>
The hon. Gentleman produced a familiar range of questions—we increasingly expect them from him—which asked us to predict the future, and to predict how, to what extent and in what quantity moneys will be allocated to RDAs. We cannot anticipate future budget decision-making processes at this stage. However, the initial phase of RDAs, which is made clear by the White Paper and the BIll, will use existing resources as a template. Any developments that take place in the future will depend on decisions made in future budgets, on allocations and appropriations, and also on the comprehensive spending review. As clever as all members of the Committee are, we cannot anticipate those things. In addition to the Appropriation Acts, which will make clear what grant in aid is going to RDAs and will be subject to Parliament’s positive approval, grants will also appear in the annual reports of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The process will therefore be transparent and open to any scrutiny that parliamentarians of the future see fit to put it under.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> On a point of fact, Dr. Clark, I have never been a member of the Public Accounts Committee.<P>
Another round of parliamentary approval would not be a bad idea if Parliament were allowed closer scrutiny, especially in the light of Ministers’ reluctance to answer questions about personal and financial matters. I am not sure why, given their majority, the Government should be so afraid of further parliamentary debate, although I regret to say that that seems part and parcel of their attitude on many issues. I still want answers to some of the questions that I raised.<P>
The Under-Secretary says that she cannot anticipate future budgets, but issues of principle are at stake. Do the Government intend to reduce the revenue support grant to meet the costs of regional development agencies? Many people on local authorities are afraid that exactly that will happen. Local authorities also have to make longer term plans about future budgets and need to know the extent to which their future funding will be put at risk by the existence of regional development agencies. If the Under-Secretary refuses to answer that clear question, which has been put to me by councils throughout the country, she will confirm those councils’ worst fears—that it is indeed the Government’s intention to plunder the revenue support grant, thus reducing the amount of money going to local authorities in England, in order to pay for the RDA’s?<P>
<B>Ms Jenny Jones </B>(Wolverhampton, South-West): The hon. Gentleman is talking about central Government plundering local authorities. Does he agree that the previous Government funded the city challenge programme by top-slicing local authorities’ urban funding programmes?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Lady mentions city challenge, a successful programme that—[Interruption.] That programme had widespread support. Her debating point does not in any way affect the Under-Secretary’s refusal to answer my question. Do the Government intend in future to reduce the English revenue support grant and, therefore, the money available to English local authorities, to pay for regional development agencies? That is a fair question. The hon. Lady will probably find that some people at her own council are concerned about that.<P>
<B>Ms Jones:</B> I sat on it for six years and I know what I am talking about.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Will the Under-Secretary answer my important point? Will she also answer the other questions that I have asked? Will RDAs negotiate separately with her department for grants, or will those grants be made collectively and carved up according to a formula? If it is the latter, how will the formula work? What relationship will there be between the size of grants made to RDAs and their ability to attract funds from the private sector? We already know that surplus funds may be taken back by the Treasury, so it seems fair to inquire whether agencies’ success in attracting private funds will affect how much money they receive. Will the grants be specific, or will the RDAs have complete discretion over how to spend them?<P>
I have asked those questions before. I ask them now for a second time. If I get no answers, I dare say I shall have to ask them a third time.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> First, I owe the hon. Gentleman a handsome apology. I am afraid that I mistook him earlier for Tim Smith. That was not intended to be insulting. The hon. Gentleman clearly did not serve on the Public Accounts Committee. Sometimes Conservative Members look like each other and it is difficult to distinguish them.<P>
I have tried to answer the questions put by members of the Committee, but when I am asked to anticipate the precise quantities of cash in future budgets and financial arrangements, I cannot always reply in other than general terms by setting out the principles that will apply. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I cannot say in detail how future financial settlements will be split. I am not attempting to evade his questions, but perhaps they were a bit ambitious in the first place. I have given a basic outline of where we want to go, but the Committee must understand that we do not have crystal balls.<P>
RDAs will be funded by Government grants in aid. That is what the clause is about. In the first instance, funding will be split between regions to meet existing commitments. Thereafter we shall adjust the current arrangements for financial settlements as time goes on. That is a general answer; I cannot give detailed answers on the quantities of cash that will be available in future. In setting budgets, we will take account of the needs and sizes of regions and of the performance of their RDAs. It is neither wise nor prudent to go into more detail in advance.<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones) did not make a debating point; she hit a bull’s eye. Those who made up the previous Government worry about top-slicing, but they did much of it themselves. They rate-capped every local authority in Britain. We do not need lessons from Opposition Members on local authorities. We are trying to devolve power to local authorities and to the new regional agencies. We want them to deal with issues that arise in their regions. We want to create a permissive structure in which local authorities will have as much leeway as possible within financially acceptable limits.<P>
I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman’s questions about intent. He cannot possibly expect me to confirm the shape of future local government settlements or the changes to formula by which they are developed. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Housing was as open about that as possible in the recent statement on this year’s local government settlement. Our direction on that policy has been mapped out by other colleagues.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Under-Secretary mentioned rate capping in a critical way. How soon can we expect a statement from the Government that rate capping is to be ended? The rate-capping regime has been maintained in every significant respect by the Government. When will it be abandoned?<P>
The Under-Secretary asked me to put questions in general terms. I am happy to do so. In general terms, can she offer any reassurance to anxious local authorities, which are considering her words carefully, on whether RDA financing will be achieved at the expense of cuts in the English revenue support grant? Yes or no? That is a general question. Will they have no need to worry because there will be no cuts in the revenue support grant, or will she be unable to give that assurance because there will be cuts?<P>
As for the Under-Secretary’s comments about city challenge, I am unclear whether the Government think that top-slicing is a good or bad thing. She implied that it was a bad thing, but she will not assure us that it will not form the basis of RDA funding. Let me repeat the question in general terms: will RDA grants be linked to specific activities, or will they be general and be left to the discretion of RDAs? I hope that that question is not too difficult.<P>
I expect the Government to have given some thought to that point of general policy. It will apply whether grants are £100 or £100 billion. In general terms, will the amount of RAD grants be affected by the success of those agencies in attracting private sector funding? I should like an answer in general terms.<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not commenting on whether top-slicing is good or bad, or whether I am indifferent to it. The hon. Gentleman was frothing at the mouth at the idea of top-slicing. He negleted to point out that his goverment regularly did it—as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West was right to point out. <P>
The Government’s intention is to allocate and identify some grants separately, such as that of the Rural Development Commission, which will stay discrete. Other grants will be more general. We want RDAs to have a flexible response to the needs that they want to address in their regions. The answer is that grants will be a mixture of the two. I cannot give him more detail at this stage.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Lady has said something quite interesting. She said that grants to the Rural Development Commission will remain discrete. Does she mean that, within RDA budgets, items will be identified as being for the Rural Development Commission?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes.<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I have been finding it difficult to follow our proceedings because of strange mutterings from the Gallery. To my surprise, they have been coming from the Minister, who has been conferring with one of his Back Benchers.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Day. I had noticed that the Minister was there, although I did not hear him.<P>
We shall now continue to discuss clause 10. May I point out to the Committee that because we have had a wide-ranging debate, I am minded not to allow a debate on clause 10? Therefore, if anyone wishes to speak on clause 10, they should do so now.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am most grateful to you, Dr. Clark, because earlier you enjoined me to reserve my remarks to a clause stand part debate and I was doing that again.<P>
I may be able to help the Minister. It is worth noting that the city challenge programme was top-sliced, but it was a local authority programme, open to local authority bids and, in all cases, the lead partners were local authorities. If the Under-Secretary thinks that does not work, I suggest that she read the detailed and independent report on the city challenge programme by Professor Michael Parkinson, which states that it was one of the most successful regeneration programmes ever mounted by Government in partnership. When the Government complete their review of the regeneration programme, I shall be most surprised if they do not revert to the city challenge type of programme to some extent.<P>
The amendments and the clause deal with money, and I turned to the notes on clauses for illumination, but failed to find it. Instead, I found a paraphrase of the text, which took me no further. Perhaps I can separate the issue into two parts. We all know that the development agencies will have two sorts of money. The first is money that flows to them from their constitution; that is, regeneration money from the RDC and EPs. Let us call that own resources, to use a familiar phrase from another context. That money is allocated to a development agency at its birth—its birthright, dowry, or bottom drawer.<P>
Certain questions arise from that. How much will it be? The Minister gave an estimate, but we need to know whether that money will be allocated broadly in accordance with current expenditure. If it will, some RDAs will be resource-rich at birth and others will have practically nowt. For example, very little money is being spent in the Eastern area, where regeneration programmes are thin on the ground, because it is a relatively prosperous area that has no major urban conurbations, as exist in Yorkshire and Humberside.<P>
The RDC is active but its money is thinly spread. Because English Partnerships is linked with regeneration, it will have a relatively limited spend in the Eastern region. So that region will be endowed with relatively little money at its birth, by comparison with the North-West region, Yorkshire and Humberside, the Northern region or even the South-West. If the Eastern area is to have sufficient resources to give it a dynamic base, it will have to look for additional resources. That is where the block grant comes in, as well as borrowing and the other methods detailed in this and following clauses.<P>
Will a regional development agency receive a block grant and, if so, will the block grant vary in function according to how much the agency already receives? Will the Government give it some notional amount? Will it have a regional allocation based on socio-economic factors? What will be the dowry-plus-grant for regional development areas, and how will it be determined? Will it be a block grant or related to specific demand? If a regional development agency is working on a scheme to create an industrial estate and needs additional funding, will it apply to the Treasury for a grant for that specific purpose? Is that how it will work? If it is, will there be a regionally allocated ceiling, so that one development area does not receive a disproportionate amount of funding? Will a total amount be stated as a limit? Could the grant be made in response to efforts to attract investment?<P>
What would happen if the Government received competing demands for grant from two regions trying to attract the same business? In the present difficult economic circumstances, with exceptionally high interest rates and a strong pound, it is difficult to see how the Government will attract much investment. If hey would only bring down interest rates and the level of the pound, they would do more to attract investment than all the regional development agencies put together, in my view, but that is not the route that they are taking. What will the Government do if they face competing demands for money, and how will they adjudicate between demands under competitive funding?<P>
Those are important issues and it is not acceptable for the Govern;ment simply to say that they cannot crystal-ball-gaze and look into the future. They must have a notion of the total resources that are likely to be available for the regions. They cannot set up an organisation and say, “We do not know how much money it will receive.” Governments should not operate like that, even with a comprehensive spending review. When they are looking for people to chair the agencies, they will have to tell them how much money they expect to be in the kitty. People cannot be asked to take on a job without knowing what it entails and how much money will be available.<P>
I do not believe the Government when they say they do not know how much money is available, that such details are hypothetical and that we must wait for the comprehensive spending review. I do not believe a work of that. If the Government are being responsible, they must have some notion of the resources which will be available and it is only fair that the Committee should be told before we go any further.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We should all refer to the notes on clauses. I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) seems so disappointed with them, but they are much as they were when I used to read them. The notes on clause 10 state:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This clause gives the Secretary of State, with the approval of Treasury, power to pay grants to regional development agencies and to set the terms on which they are are paid.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is the sole power that we are discussing. Without clause 10, there would be no money for regional development agencies and the whole Bill would be pointless.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is the Under-Secretary saying that the purpose of the clause is to govern the disbursement of funds already allocated under English Partnerships or development agencies—she said that without the clause there would be no money for the regional development agencies—or is it to make additional funding available?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The right hon. Gentleman needs to take a step even further back. The clause gives the Secretary of State power to pay grants. Without that power, no money could be given to any of the RDAs. In due course, decisions will be made by the Government on how to dispense the state aid that will be given. The clause merely gives power to the Secretary of State to give the money. It is one step further back from the matter on which the right hon. Gentleman is questioning me.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> But the hon. Lady will recognise that from that flows a further question. My original point was that certain regions will be relatively well endowed because there is a considerable flow of funds for existing programmes, and others will be relatively badly endowed. Those which are badly endowed will have precious little to do unless they are given additional resources. Does the hon. Lady envisage that the clause will be used to make available additional resources over and above the three funding flows that we have already identified as own resources?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The right hon. Gentleman raises a crucial point, which my hon. Friend the Minister addressed this morning. The final budgets will be decided later in the year, but in the initial stages—that is, in the current financial year—expenditure on the programmes which the RDAs will inherit is already being spent. We are in a transitional period, involving, as my hon. Friend said, £750 million and a further £1 billion of private and partnership money. That is the position for the first financial year. The right hon. Gentleman asked several legitimate questions about what might happen. With the best will in the world, it is not always possible to answer those questions in detail, although I have tried to give some idea of our approach.<P>
The comprehensive spending review, which is taking a fundamental look across Whitehall at current expenditure patterns and at ways in which they might be changed, has implications for many Government Departments. There is also going to be a review of the European structural funds, which will start in 1999. That money is often used in regeneration and economic development areas.<P>
I mentioned how the grant in aid would be decided in the light of the comprehensive spending review. We expect RDA money to be funded with block grants. However, as I said earlier, there will also be grants for specific purposes, so a mixture of the two approaches will be involved. That is all that I can say to the right hon. Gentleman at this juncture. Clearly, any allocation of funding or of grant is subject to approval by Parliament through the Appropriation Acts and through<P>
other well-established procedures by which Parliament gives permission to the Government to spend money. The clause merely gives the Secretary of State the power to give money. Parliament will either approve or disapprove of the allocations when budgets have been decided and when suggestions have been made.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Under-Secretary has jogged my memory about an important matter that we should have discussed earlier. Part of the regeneration funding involves European Community objective 2 money. That involves something of a problem because the EU’s cycle of grant-giving has not coincided with the  UK’s cycle, and it has sometimes been difficult to bring all of the elements together into a coherent package. Bureaucracy in Brussels has been excessive for anti-fraud reasons. As the Under-Secretary said, a review is under way. One does not need her crystal ball to see that the UK will come out with less—it is perfectly clear that we will. Objective 5b, as we already know, will be incorporated into some new objective 2, which will have to be spread much more widely because the Community will not increase its own level of resources. The UK is therefore likely to be a smaller recipient, which means that the funding that is available through the partnership programme—not necessarily funding that flows from Government—is likely to diminish rather than to increase. Does the Under-Secretary believe that one use of that power might be for the UK Government to provide some additional funding, which would make up for the shortfalls in European funding that will flow from the review? That would be important, and people would need to know about it. One consolation might be that discussions about Euro-PES could become somewhat less complicated than they are at present.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The right hon. Gentleman speculates about what might happen, as we are all free to do. The UK Government will play their full part in the review of European structural funds and we shall try to reach the most advantageous position that we can. Much of his speculations depend on the fact—the sudden fact—of enlargement, which might or might not proceed quickly. These are all very conditional matters, and all sorts of things can happen.<P>
I mentioned European funding to emphasise the present state of transition, which makes it even harder for me to give hard and fast answers to the Oppositions questions. The whole subject is open to review and discussion. We want to create a system at regional level that will give the English regions the best opportunity to maximise economic development. Money is important, but its allocation is not the only function of RDAs. Their role is also to develop regional strategies and to begin to co-ordinate a lot of current activity in the regions. Their effectiveness will not rely only on what they have in the bank but on their innovation, their creativity, their ability to create partnerships and their ability to have a vision for the region that they can begin to realise. It is not always a question of cash.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Since I last spoke, Dr. Clark, you advised us that you may not allow a stand part debate. I would therefore like to make a brief point that I had intended to make during clause stand part.<P>
First, however, I shall turn to the important questions raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. The Under-Secretary likes to speak about the vision of RDAs, but the clause refers to Government grants. It is a rather short clause and it is at the heart of the financial section of the Bill, which is why we have been trying to probe the Government’s thinking on the question of finance. When any Minister says that the success of an organisation does not depend mainly on the cash available to it—<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I said that it did not depend only on cash.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In my experience, when a Minister says that it does not depend only on cash that is nearly always a clear signal that not much cash will be forthcoming. This is the first warning to all those people who thought that they would get nice jobs on RDAs. Such people were looking forward to the unlimited salaries that the Secretary of State would be allowed to pay directors of RDAs under the Bill—our amendment to limit those salaries was rejected—and to the pensions that they would be paid for their service on RDA boards.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman is slipping below his own standards.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We suggested that these matters could be excluded from the Bill, but the Minister insisted on their inclusion. The Bill also allows for pay-offs to people who have fallen out with the Secretary of State: perhaps those people will be entitled to pour a bucket of water over him as well. Who knows what joys were already being conjured up in the minds of prospective RDA board members?<P>
The Under-Secretary has issued an interesting and timely warning before people become too enthusiastic about sending in job applications—there will not be much money. If I may paraphrase the Under-Secretary’s words and her fine phrases about the importance of visions and strategies, she said that the grants may be quite small. My right hon Friend teased out an important point, and frankly it would have been easier if the Under-Secretary had said that she did not know the answer to any of his questions.<P>
I would like to return to the wording of the Bill, which does not depend on the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. Clause 10, which is only one sentence long, states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, make to a regional development agency grants of such amounts, and on such terms, as he thinks fit.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Will the Minister explain what the terms will be for the making of such grants? Will they be repayable under certain circumstances? The Under-Secretary has effectively warned us that the English revenue support grant will be cut to meet the running costs of RDAs. Will local authorities that have their budgets cut as a result of that have a veto on grants to regional development agencies? Will the Treasury or Secretary of State consult those local authorities before grants are made to RDAs? Indeed, will the Secretary of State even inform local authorities in advance so that they can make appropriate adjustments to their budgets?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I should like to be saved from the paraphrases of the hon. Gentleman. His summing up of my words is a uniquely cynical and wilful misinterpretation. He demonstrates his experience in the previous Government, who were cutting everything all the time.<P>
The power exists under many Acts of Parliament for the Secretary of State to give grants in aid to appropriate bodies. That is all that the power provides. Without it, no money could be given. The clause does not say how much money will be given or how it will be given; it merely confers on the Secretary of State the power to give money.<P>
As I said earlier, Parliament will know about such grants through the usual procedures of the appropriation accounts and of checking by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. Details of grants will appear in the DETR’s annual report and will be available prior to their being given to Parliament so that they may be voted on as Parliament sees fit.<P>
Amendment No. 117 would confer on Parliament a duty to have another vote, in addition to the appropriations vote, before the money could be given to RDAs. It is a pointless amendment; it seeks to duplicate a parliamentary process that already exists. I hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk will withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We are uncovering an area in which the Under-Secretary is slightly uncertain about what the Bill means. I do not mind how many Acts of Parliament include that phrase: I want to know what the phrase means in respect of the grants that the Bill will empower the Secretary of State to give to RDAs. What is meant by the phrase<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“on such terms, as he thinks fit”?<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I repeat the questions: will those grants be repayable by RDAs if the Secretary of State thinks fit? If so, under what circumstances would they be repayable? Will those grants be subject to a veto process by local authorities in he region, whose budgets, the Minister has warned us, are now likely to be cut? Will the Treasury consult local authorities about the consequences of those budget cuts if it will not allow a veto? Will it even inform them?<P>
Rather unhelpfully, the Under-Secretary referred to the possible inclusion of information about such grants in the Department’s annual report. That document will appear more than a year after the start of the financial year in which the grants would be made, and probably about two years from the date budgets are set for local authorities who may be affected.<P>
The Under-Secretary seems not to want to contribute further to the debate. We have exposed the fact that Ministers have come to the Committee with an extraordinary ignorance of the contents of the Bill. We have already had a correction on a point of fact. the Minister, no doubt inadvertently, but none the less seriously, misled the committee about the implications of the powers available to RDAs—<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am not prepared to accept such an attack on my integrity. The innuendo is that I misled the Committee. I have not misled the committee; I have already put that on the record. I responded, I hope, positively. Standing Committees should have full explanations and I have tried to accommodate that principle this morning. To have my integrity attacked in such a way is unbecoming.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It will be clear to anyone who consults the Official Report that what the Minister said earlier this morning directly contradicts the specific answers that he twice gave me at column 268 on Tuesday afternoon. I am satisfied that what he said this morning is correct, and that what he said on Tuesday was incorrect. There is no innuendo: those are matters of fact.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Although I have not been in the Chair for the past three or four sittings, I have been following the proceedings in the Official Report. I have read the incident to which the hon. Member for South Suffolk referred.<P>
The Committee, which has so far been good-natured and progressive, does not want to start accusations of misleading. The Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for South Suffolk, may want to suggest that the Committee has not been fully informed, but we do not want accusations of misleading. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Suffolk would like to say a few more words.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am obviously ready to abide by an guidance that you provide, Dr. Clark. The Official Report will show that statements made at column 268 in an exchange that occurred at about 6.45pm on Tuesday have had to be corrected. The correction, which I welcome, is now on the record. I hope that there will be no need for similar corrections in future.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> There have been no corrections. Clarification was asked for, as you said, Dr. Clark, and clarification was given. We heard in the Corridor outside the Room that a point of order was to be made this morning and I did my best to make the situation absolutely clear. I think it right that Ministers should do so for any Standing Committee. What is said on behalf of Parliament is very important. I have acted honourably. Where clarification is needed, it should be given. I was not misleading the Committee. I have not given wrong information. I clarified a point. If the Opposition are going to perform as the hon. Gentleman has, we will have to respond in like fashion, which would not be good for the scrutiny of legislation. <P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I do not seek to impugn the Minister’s integrity. However, I must read out our exchange again as there appears to be some dispute. I asked:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“So, to be absolutely clear, is the Minister telling us that the Bill does not allow RDAs to exercise planning powers over any areas of land that are not currently available to English Partnerships?”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Minister answered: “Yes.”—[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 10 February 1998; c.268.] Today, the Minister has told us that RDAs will be able to exercise powers over areas that are wider than those available to English Partnerships. Today’s statement is the correct one. I welcome the fact that his previous statement has been corrected. I am sorry that the Minister is not man enough to acknowledge that what he told us on Tuesday afternoon was wrong.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I want to put it on the record that if the provision of information is to be treated in that negative way, we will, unfortunately, have to respond in like fashion. The Committee has been good-natured, as you have said, Dr. Clark, and we have been honest and transparent, going beyond what was necessary to explain various clauses and their backgrounds. We have not simply read out our briefs, as we have been accused of doing. We have tried to explain the case properly to inform the House of Commons.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I believe that the point under discussion was properly debated under the point of order made by the hon. Member for South Suffolk. I allowed a lot of leeway and debate on that point. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that his point was cleared up at the beginning of today’s sitting. We have had extensive debate on the clause, which is why I made my earlier statement. In retrospect, I may have made a mistake in allowing any debate at all on the amendment. <P>
Amendment negatived.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:-<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
{**ph3**}Borrowing<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 5, line 2, leave out from ‘temporarily’ to ‘from’ in line 3.<P>
Some of the earlier exchanges were unfortunate and time consuming. Let us press on quickly.<P>
We believe that this is a helpful and anticipatory amendment to an important clause. Instead of restricting resources, we want to enable RDAs to raise sufficient resources to carry out their vital tasks. Clause 11 appears to preclude the development of new financial instruments, such as regional bonds, by limiting RDAs to temporary borrowing in the form of an overdraft. It is specific about that. I presume that the phrasing is standard and has been used in other legislation.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We would prefer a more permissive and expansive clause which would allow RDAs to undertake other forms of borrowing, if they became available, but only with the Secretary of State’s consent and Treasury approval. The control and monitoring of borrowing would not be diminished. Such borrowing would have implications for the public sector borrowing requirement. New financial instruments may require changes to Treasury rules—for example measuring the budget deficit in terms of the so-called general government financial deficit.<P>
I accept that our proposal should be part of a wider debate on how the Government produce their accounts and how borrowing on open commercial markets by some public bodies should be treated. RDAs are breaking new ground. They will address local problems and the intention is that they should work closely with the private sector. They are part of a decentralisation exercise. It is important to consider what may happen in the immediate future.<P>
In November 1997, the Confederation of British Industry published a document entitled “A Question of Balance: A New Approach to Government Spending and Borrowing”. It suggested that there was potential for reform. The Bill could take account of developments arising from the debate on Government spending and borrowing, and thus reduce the need for further legislation. We know that that is close to the Minister’s heart because we have often discussed the need to avoid putting things in primary legislation.<P>
We may be anticipating developments in financial instruments. I hope that we will be able to encourage fresh forms of finance for business, especially for the small business sector which will play a large role in RDAs. We may see new forms of local venture capital funds or development capital companies, perhaps even the institution or revitalisation of a regional over-the-counter market. The development of organisations such as business angels would give us the opportunity to provide greater regional scope for new financial instruments, investment and development capital.<P>
The Government should undertake to consider the issue, especially as it affects RDAs, because it is an important aspect of available resources. A review could include other public bodies, such as London Transport and the Post Office, and would be welcome.<P>
The clause offers an opportunity to ensure that the rather narrow function of temporary overdraft borrowing is expanded to allow RDAs some flexibility. I emphasise, however, that all borrowing would need the Secretary of State’s consent and Treasury approval.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I have a lot of sympathy with the amendment. Clause 11 is restrictive and follows Treasury rules, but a great deal of accumulated experience in the United States suggests that the ability of organisations and local authorities to raise bonds has contributed enormously to the regeneration process. The Government keep telling us that a new day has dawned and everything will change when this sparkling new organisation is set up. Then the first thing that they do is lock it within existing Treasury rules. So perhaps it is not quite such a new dawn.<P>
Are we really trying to be innovative, or are we simply putting a new name on the old brew? At the moment, I think it is the latter. I accept that the amendment challenges Treasury rules, but I believe that anything that challenges Treasury rules is likely to benefit the people of the United Kingdom. Will the Minister seriously examine the experience overseas? I am not making a flippant point. There is a substantial body of experience, especially in the United States, which suggests that the ability of organisations to raise bonds and money on the longer-term market has contributed to regeneration.<P>
My second point is why may an agency borrow only in sterling, when in a few years we shall all have the euro? Will we have to change primary legislation in a few years when sterling does not exist because the Bill states that regional development agencies may borrow only in sterling? Will it be like the millennium bug, so that we have to go through thousands of pieces of legislation and remove the word “sterling” and add the word “euro”? Why cannot a regional development agency borrow abroad? Many quangos are competent to borrow and housing associations can raise funding abroad—I believe that London and Quadrant did so recently—so why does this pettifogging subsection say that agencies must borrow in sterling, no doubt in threepenny bits?<P>
We should allow borrowing in other currencies because that approach would be much more imaginative. If RDAs are to be comprised of dynamic business people, the pick of local authority members and everyone else, I am sure that they will have the necessary financial competence. After all, the financial director will be the most important appointment. It would be more imaginative to raise funds overseas and take advantage of the far lower interest rates available on the continent—in the United Kingdom, we now have cripplingly high interest rates and the Bank says that they are about to be winched up even higher.<P>
I should like the Minister to show a little imagination. The Government keep talking about vision, but when it comes to demonstrating vision, it ain’t there. They should be more imaginative about mechanisms for funding, look to the future, think where they are supposed to take the United Kingdom and consider the implications of the clause. Then we might find that we make progress. The Under-Secretary said that she was thinking laterally, which I interpret as tangentially, but the Government should go even wider. Let us hear something interesting for once.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I share my right hon. Friend’s view. Indeed, I find the phrase that the amendment would exclude surprising. In earlier debates, we heard of the Government’s reluctance to accept almost any limitation on the Bill and this subsection says that borrowing may take place only with the consent of the Secretary of State. That itself seems to retain adequate restrictive power to prevent RDAs from doing anything too imprudent in the financial markets. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Treasury’s approval will also be required.<P>
The clause is hedged about with all kinds of restrictions on what RDAs can do and activities for which they must have the Secretary of State’s permission, including borrowing. It is unclear why the restriction must be further spelt out with the words,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“temporarily in sterling, by way of overdraft or otherwise”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Like my right hon. Friend, I have some sympathy with the clause. I do not think that anyone could put a wafer between my views and those of my right hon. Friend on the single currency or on any other aspect of the European Union. However, I am not as confident as he is that sterling will have been subsumed into the euro on the timescale that he mentioned. There are signs that the Government are a little unsure about whether to go down that route, and the inclusion of the relevant phrase in the Bill may be further evidence of that uncertainty.<P>
The possibility of borrowing on other currencies is, I am sure, appealing to those financial organisations that might advise RDAs. That offers the chance to borrow at low interest rates and to play the markets of the more exotic currencies in the Asia-Pacific region, which have been so volatile recently. A borrower whose loans were denominated in the currencies of Korea or Thailand would be happy indeed. A borrower with a mortgage denominated in the Thai currency would have been able to repay a mortgage extremely cheaply recently. One thought behind the amendment might be the fact that the RDA in the western region could get some valuable advice and borrow skilfully in a currency that was about to be heavily depreciated. More substantively—<P>

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is the crystal ball again.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister refers from a sedentary position to the crystal ball. She has been singularly reluctant to look into her crystal ball to establish the likely expenditure of RDAs or the grant that the Government may make available to them. It would be redundant to include such a restrictive phrase in the Bill, and my sympathies lie with the amendment.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The Opposition appear enamoured of that approach, but they had many chances to change the Treasury’s rules during the 18 years that they were in power and they made no attempt to do so. Suddenly, in opposition, they have decided that the Treasury rules should be torn up and that RDAs should somehow become mini-casinos that speculate in foreign currencies. That may be their view now, but it was not their view when they were in power.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It is all this talk of lateral thinking.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Lateral thinking and vision are all very well, but such proposals need the Government’s approval. If the rules need reforming, that should not be done through an amendment to a Bill. I welcome the conversion of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, but I wonder why he showed no sign of holding his views when he was a Minister.<P>
The right hon. Gentleman made an important point about the way in which finance could be raised, which, as he well knows, is a matter that has to be carefully considered. It is important to control liabilities and to ensure that a reasonable rein is kept on the behaviour of bodies that dispense public money. We should also consider how that might impact on the PSBR and on other parts of our national accounts.<P>
I must congratulate the hon. member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) on moving what he called a modest amendment. However, he proposed a fundamental change in public expenditure accounts. That is an interesting proposal which we shall consider when the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs gives its response to the White Paper. We must not amend the Bill before there has been a proper debate, and in the meantime the Treasury rules should remain as they are. I hope that the hon. member for South-East Cornwall will help to continue that debate. We should establish how the matter is dealt with in other countries, what we can learn from them and what we might change. However, we must not introduce such a fundamental change through an amendment to a Bill. The hon. Gentleman raised an interesting matter that we all want to examine, but we must not try to run before we can walk. We must do the work before we move forward. The hon. Gentleman raised an interesting and important point, but we cannot amend the Bill at this stage.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Of course you can.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that we can, but we are a responsible Government. If we want to change the way in which public money is spent and accounted for, we shall do so following proper procedures—discussion with the Treasury, White Papers, debates in the House and so on—and certainly not in one small amendment to the Bill.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am happy to support the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon on inclusion of the euro; it is a shame that I did not think of that. If we want investment into this country from the European Union, sensible co-operation between the euro and sterling would have definite benefits. Widening the scope of the clause, albeit with the same authority of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, would also have definite benefits. The purpose of the amendment is not to suggest speculation, especially currency speculation, which should have no part in the function of RDAs. Holding foreign currency for sensible reasons with the usual policies covering risk may be prudent, but to hold currency as part of a speculative exercise, even to prevent funds from being grabbed back, would certainly not command my support.<P>
It is standard commercial practice to use a basket of currencies as part of a total investment programme; that is a prudent way of providing low-cost finance on a longer-term basis. Naively, I thought that by ensuring that the authority of the Treasury and the Secretary of State remained necessary so that they could retain the veto meant that the Treasury ruled okay. There would be no change in requiring a stamp of approval, but the amendment would add flexibility.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> RDAs could set up offshore trusts.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> We might well suggest a Cornish offshore trust.<P>
We are trying to flag potential opportunities for regional development agencies to break away from some of the previous Treasury rules and to consider innovative ways of developing new financial instruments to encourage the private sector; the possibility of bonds and development of a regional structure of finance. Our national banks will not be—and perhaps should not be—the only providers of finance to business. There should be opportunities for a regional tier of finance—perhaps connected with regional bonds—which could work closely with the regional agencies to bring together private and public sector investment for regeneration programme support of small businesses.<P>
The amendment is a modest attempt to introduce that idea into the public arena for the Government to consider. I recognise the huge implications for the Treasury rules, but perhaps we should start chipping away at the foundations of that great edifice, which has been built up over centuries, to bring about a fundamental change in the way in which the public and private sectors can work together. The RDAs are surely at the vanguard of such an attempt and giving them the opportunity to consider more innovative packages and financial instruments might be a step in the right direction. <P>
I hope that the Minister has found our contribution positive. There will be more debate at another time in another place. The RDAs’ involvement will be important to any debate on Government borrowing, accounts and the PSBR. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr .Curry:</B> I want to make a couple of points. First, if the United Kingdom becomes a member of the currency bloc and has the euro, will we have to pass primary legislation to redeem every reference to sterling, the traditional benchmark referred to in the Bill? How can we convert millions of references to sterling to something else? The technical answer will be interesting. Presumably there will be some all-embracing answer.<P>
Secondly, the notes on clauses state:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Subsection (6) provides that collectively agencies may not borrow more than £200 million”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Presumably, that is a £200 million overdraft. How was that sum arrived at? Will there be an allocation or will it be a matter of first come, first served?<P>
Some agencies may inherit programmes that are further down the track than others and may need to borrow to finish them. It may be that that limit has been hit before agencies getting projects off to a slower start find that there is a no borrowing availability left. They will have to ask for the limit to be raised so that they can have some money too. In what circumstances would the limit be raised? Are there notional allocations to the regions? Will the Department give each region a notional borrowing facility related to the size of its business or its budget?<P>
The total of £200 million is very small in comparison with local authority debt, which is about £40 billion. Several local authorities have debt in the billions. Birmingham’s debt is probably five times the borrowing authorisation that is being given to all the regional development agencies. How was the figure arrived at? How will the facility be used? What circumstances will trigger borrowing? Will there be an allocation to each agency? What happens if demand bumps up against the ceiling while other agencies have further demands?<P>
If the allocation can be increased, will the Treasury raise it by small amounts, or will cases be considered empirically? The Under-Secretary appears still to enjoy warm and friendly relations with the Treasury, which demonstrates that she has not been a Minister long, and I am interested to know how the position will develop.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I should like to develop the points that my right hon. Friend has made so eloquently and effectively. I, too, look forward to the answer to his first question, which he asked in a spirit of genuine inquiry.<P>
The £200 million collective borrowing limit is curious. I am surprised at its inclusion in the Bill. Ministers have consistently been reluctant to include other figures in the Bill. The Government will not set a limit on the costs of paying RDA employees or board members. They have been reluctant to give even the broadest estimate of RDA expenditure. It is intriguing that they feel able to include in primary legislation a maximum figure for the total collective borrowing of all nine RDAs.<P>
How was £200 million arrived at? How were the Government able to be so precise about the borrowing limit when they were so imprecise on other matters? According to the Under-Secretary’s earlier statement, the Government have not even decided how much money RDAs are likely to spend. It will all be settled by the comprehensive spending review. The Minister has not given us a clue about the level of expenditure or the amount that will be met by Government grants, but despite the Government’s ignorance on other matters, they know what the maximum borrowing limit should be. That is puzzling.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does my hon. Friend realise that the Bill specifies that RDAs may borrow from the Secretary of State? The Secretary of State’s Department may lend money. Will my hon. Friend probe where that money might come from, in particular, from which budgets?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend raises an interesting point which has two dimensions. First, why might the Secretary of State choose to make loans rather than grants when we have just approved a clause which enables him to make grants? Secondly, as my right hon. Friend says, those people who depend on every other programme for which the Secretary of State is responsible will be concerned. Local authorities are not the only bodies that need to worry about the possible impact on the English revenue support grant of the running costs and other expenditure of RDAs. All other programmes administered by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions appear to be jeopardised by the provision for the Secretary of State to lend money. This matter is extremely puzzling and I look forward to the Minister’s clarification of it.<P>
I want to probe the point touched on by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon about how the borrowing cake will be divided. There are nine RDAs, and the Government have refused to countenance any variation in the total number. will each agency be allowed to borrow £22,222,222? That would be fair because it would allocate money equally between RDAs. Or have the Government got in mind different maximum figures for different regions? A collective maximum will either be allocated evenly among all regions or it will not. Will the Minister explain whether Yorkshire and the Humber—<P>

<P>

<B>Mr Curry:</B> What is the borrowing requirement of the Scottish development agency?<P>
<B>Mr Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend asks an interesting question which may give us some clues to the relative importance attached to the English regions. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us what the maximum borrowing requirement is for the SDA, because that would be a helpful benchmark.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> And of the Welsh Development Agency?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Indeed. We could even refer to the Northern Ireland development agency. Some interesting comparisons could be made. It would be helpful for the Under-Secretary to shed some light on the comparative levels of borrowing in different regions. My constituents would be interested in whether the Eastern region would be given a higher or lower borrowing requirement than the North West region. The Under-Secretary’s answer would give us an interesting clue to the importance that she attaches to the work of RDAs in more rural regions. Hon. Members have already expressed concerns about that.<P>
If there are to be differences in the levels of borrowing permitted for RDAs, on what basis will those differences be calculated? As the Government are so sure that £200 million is the right figure for all the agencies, they must have an idea of amounts for individual agencies.<P>
I shall be grateful if the Minister will explain what criteria RDAs will have to satisfy before they are allowed to borrow. Will they have to provide security? Will the extent to which individual agencies have been successful in attracting private sector support be a factor in the amount of money that they are permitted to borrow? What are the purposes for which borrowing will be permitted? Will borrowing be permitted to buy land?<P>
I notice that the Secretary of State’s consent has to be forthcoming. I am not surprised by that in the light of the Secretary of State’s intrusion into more trivial matters. What factors will the Secretary of State take into account when deciding whether to sanction the borrowing that is requested by an agency? Perhaps more intriguing, on what basis might the Secretary of State’s consent be withheld from an agency that wants to borrow? Such questions, raised by the wording of the clause, are of great interest, not only to the Committee, but to people outside. No real answer to them is hinted at in the White Paper. I hope that the Under-Secretary can now give us the answers.<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am truly amazed that Conservative Members seem so intrigued by a limit of £200 million being included in the Bill. I should have thought that it was familiar to them: the same amount is specified in the English Partnerships legislation, with which some Conservative Members in the Committee were involved as Ministers in the previous Government. All Conservative Members voted for it when the legislation was presented to the House.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have just established that the functions and powers of the RDAs set up by the Bill go wider than those of English Partnerships. So the relevance of English Partnerships as the model for everything in the Bill is almost entirely destroyed. If the powers of RDAs go much wider, what is the use of referring to a borrowing limit for an organisation with more limited powers?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that English Partnerships’ history and achievements are nothing to be proud of? Its introduction was one of the most successful innovations of the previous Government. English Partnerships provides a best practice model for successful intervention to promote economic development in a public and private context to effect regeneration projects, including the reclamation of derelict land. In the previous financial year, English Partnerships attracted £630 million of private finance on a project-by-project basis. It developed existing joint ventures and established new ones with financial institutions. It was involved in public and private partnerships. We want RDAs to follow and develop such practices.<P>
The £200 million limit is the same as the borrowing that English Partnerships was allowed. It is a judgment about what is prudent. It is prudent to set a limit on borrowing in the Bill; £200 million is a prudent limit. It is important that Parliament knows that there is a prudent limit.<P>
However, it is an upper limit; it may never be reached. English Partnerships has never used all of its £200 million borrowing limit. It is there merely to prevent any problems that might occur about over-commitment. It seems to have worked in the past, and seems to be working now, and that is why it is included in the Bill.<P>
The right hon. member for Skipton and Ripon also asked what would be the implications for statute law if the euro came into existence. That is an interesting question, but we have faced a similar problem before, with decimalisation. One Act dealt with all references in law to the change in currencies. I expect that we will undertake a similar consolidation of existing statute law if the Euro comes into being and we join it. It probably sounds more awful that it will be to include appropriate modernised references to whatever the currency is.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Clearly, what would matter then would be the parity at which the euro was introduced. That is crucial.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That is nothing to do with the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That would clearly affect the borrowing limit. The limit would have to be changed from one currency to another, so the borrowing limit would be affected by parities. RDAs would have a clear interest in the parity at which sterling became part of the single currency unit and ultimately the euro, so it is extremely relevant to the Bill.<P>
The Minister has not informed us of what the borrowing limit is for the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, and I should be grateful for that information.<P>
Thirdly, the Government keep telling us how radical they are, but justify themselves by referring to the acts of their predecessor. The striving for continuity is perhaps endearing, but they should make up their mind whether they want continuity or something else. They seem to be trying to put both ends in the middle.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> First, the models of the Welsh and Scottish Development Agencies were put on the statute book by a Labour Government. We are not so narrow minded and ideologically driven that we cannot accept that subsequent events may have something to teach us about how best to bring about successful economic development. The way in which English Partnerships developed its role demonstrates best practice; and we see no point in re-inventing the wheel.<P>
The borrowing limit of Scottish Enterprise is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, but there is no limit in the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> That is an interesting reflection on the relative premium allowed to the English RDAs as opposed to their Scottish counterpart. I readily agree with the Minister’s warm comments about the successful record of English Partnerships. That success is one of the reasons for our scepticism concerning regional development agencies in all parts of England. English Partnerships has been doing an effective job of regeneration in the areas in which it is most needed.<P>
We must probe a little more the position of individual RDAs, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon referred. English Partnerships is a single entity which operates under one board with one management and one strategy. The nine RDAs will have their own boards, strategies and regional objectives, so the Minister must explain more clearly than he has so far been able to do whether there will be an order of precedence. Some regions may inherit programmes for which borrowing is appropriate. If so, what will happen if the borrowing limit is used up? Now that we have discovered that in Scotland there is no borrowing limit, but in England there will be a borrowing limit, we need to understand, as will the RDAs, whether they will have to rush into any projects that might involve borrowing to ensure that the headroom is not reached before they have been able to borrow the necessary money.<P>
In addition to the question concerning the order of precedence and the relative levels of borrowing permitted by individual RDAs, I must repeat my earlier questions. What are the criteria that RDAs will have to satisfy before they are allowed to borrow? Will they be expected to provide security for the loans that they take out? Will the extent to which private sector support has been forthcoming for their projects be a factor in the Secretary of State’s mind when deciding whether borrowing will be allowed? What are the purposes for which borrowing can be used? Under what circumstances will the Secretary of State’s consent to an RDA to borrow be withheld?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman’s questions are like asking a bank manager to explain to whom and why he will give loans in the future.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The Government do not have a policy.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> There is a policy.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Under-Secretary does not know what it is.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall have just one person speaking at a time, please, and it is the Under-Secretary at the moment.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark.<P>
Let me help the Opposition. There is a borrowing limit of £200 million. That is similar to the limit that English Partnerships has had and has never used. The capacity to borrow up to £200 million is in the Bill.<P>
If borrowing were required, which, on the past record, is unlikely, the Secretary of State would consider it on a case by case basis before approving it or not. The Secretary of State would want to be certain that any relevant project was worth lending money to. The hon. Member for South Suffolk can think for himself of what sort of project might qualify.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Under-Secretary says that we are asking questions that might be put to a bank. Indeed we are. We are dealing with a clause about borrowing. Banks have targets. They want to lend specific amounts on the housing market or to industry. Managers have allocations available for lending to different sectors and they regularly measure how close they come to achieving those allocations.<P>
I had hoped, perhaps vainly, that the Government would have taken the trouble to develop similar ideas. Inch by painful inch, we are dragging out the fact that if the Government do have a policy, the Under-Secretary does not know what it is and has not had time to consult her officials on it. Would it be helpful to adjourn the Committee for a few minutes while she takes the necessary advice? We are putting perfectly proper questions on behalf of people—taxpayers—who will have to bear the interest costs of borrowing and may have to repay the principal if borrowing proves imprudent. If the Under-Secretary would like an adjournment, we would not object.<P>
In the meantime, will the Under-Secretary tell us whether or not RDAs will provide security? Will the extent to which RDAs have been successful in attracting private sector support be taken into account when the Secretary of State decides whether to give or withhold consent for borrowing? Can the Under-Secretary give an example of the type of project for which borrowing would probably meet approval?<P>

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Clause 11 provides that RDAs may “borrow temporarily” from the private sector. Extra borrowing may be needed for particular projects in some circumstances. Borrowing may be needed to bridge a small time gap on a project that requires funds to pass from the private sector to the Government. RDAs are not expected to treat the Government like some sort of bank. Borrowing is meant to be exceptional. It is so exceptional on past experience that it has never happened. The hon. Gentleman is getting would up about something that we expect to be a rare event.<P>
No allocations are being made to individual RDAs. Borrowing will be dealt with case by case, with the usual questions asked: is the project viable; is it worth borrowing; is it going to collapse in a heap and lose the money? Those are obvious questions, of which any sensible person who is considering borrowing would think. They need not be set out in any more detail. The hon. Gentleman knows those questions. The whole Committee does.<P>
Borrowing is not expected to be used to the full. It has not been used at all in the past. It exists in case a slight temporary funding gap appears in something that an RDA is planning. It provides extra flexibility. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman all the information that he requires.<P>
Security may be needed by the private sector in the exceptional cases in which RDAs might borrow from the market. Clause 12 allows the Secretary of State to guarantee that borrowing.<P>
<H5>12.30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> As a former regional advances manager of a clearing bank, I understand entirely the need for prudence and the need for a limit. I had always thought of the overdraft in the true sense of the word namely, a loan taken out in case of need, to provide for difficulties in cash flow and for circumstances in which something did not work out as planned. I would expect the RDAs to operate within the limits of their grants for the vast majority of the time, so overdrafts would be a fall-back position for a matter of literally days or weeks rather than for a lengthy period. That is what I had assumed, and that is how the Under-Secretary has explained the matter.<P>
I am not trying to be pedantic or obstructive. I understand that an RDA might at any time want to borrow £100 million for just four days, for example. However, my experience as chairman of governors at a large secondary school has echoed in my mind. When we controlled our own budgets and the local education authority had less and less money, we started to build up prudent reserves to meet our expenditure requirements as we did not have the opportunity to borrow money. The reserves of all the local schools added up to a significant amount of money, and that money lay around doing nothing. I would like to think—this is a slightly different view of the borrowing requirement—that the RDAs could rely on the flexibility of the in-case-of-need overdraft so that they would not have to build up reserves to cover cash flow difficulties. It would be undesirable if nine regional development agencies set aside reserves that were not being invested in programmes. RDAs should have more opportunity to use the in-case-of-need facility so that they do not need the insurance policy of large reserves. That should perhaps be clarified in the guidance.<P>
The vulnerability of cash reserves to being taken back by the Secretary of State has been alluded to previously in the Committee. That would be obviated if RDAs were able to maintain lower reserves and borrow for short periods. A larger proportion of the moneys held by RDAs would be invested in projects and regeneration rather than being held back to meet any cash-flow requirements.<P>
Although English Partnerships did not use such a borrowing facility, its activities were different to those of the RDAs, which will have a much wider role. English Partnerships was engaged in project finance and the way in which that financing worked was precisely laid down. The cash-flow requirements were written so hard and fast into the legal agreements that it was almost possible to ensure that such a borrowing facility would not be needed. That will not necessarily be the case with RDAs; they will have a slightly more entrepreneurial role, at least I hope that they will. If that is the case, they may well have recourse to temporary, short-term, in-case-of-need borrowing if there is a conjunction—we do not like the word “conjunction”—<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): Heavenly bodies.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Or a confluence, or whatever. If two or three projects come together at a similar time, I am glad that that course of action will be available to them.<P>
If, in the fullness of time—perhaps only a short time will be involved—the £200 million proves to be too prudent a sum, would primary legislation be required to increase it, or could it be amended by statutory instrument? The £200 million figure may not apply to English Partnerships, but different provisions will apply to RDAs. Two or three RDAs with crucial projects on the go might want more than £200 million, perhaps for only a short time, and the future of those projects could be in jeopardy if the RDAs could not breach that figure.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> First, should the £200 million figure prove to be, as the hon. Gentleman put it, too prudent—although we do not anticipate that it will—it will be possible to change it by statutory instrument; primary legislation will not be required. I hope that he accepts our reassurance that flexibility is available if it is needed.<P>
Secondly, we would not expect the RDAs to have large reserves. They will get their grant in aid monthly and they will dispense it as they see fit. We do not expect reserves to be substantial. I hope that those points reassure the hon. Gentleman about the clause, which we have debated for a long time.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Government guarantees of an agency’s borrowing</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to raise a couple of points about the clause, which has become more important because of the uncertainty that clearly exists in the minds of the Minister and the Under-Secretary about several of the Bill’s financial provisions.<P>
The clause will give the Secretary of State the power, which is exercisable with the Treasury’s consent, to guarantee a repayment of borrowings—both principal and interest—that agencies may take out. Under what circumstances will the Secretary of State make such guarantees? The previous clause includes a maximum global collective borrowing limit for RDAs of £200 million. Why was no similar limit included for the sums that RDAs borrow from the private sector and that are guaranteed by the Secretary of State? Once such a guarantee is given, it may become an obligation on the taxpayer. If a guarantee is given by the Secretary of State, will that count as part of the £200 million? Will guarantees be given in respect of borrowings by individual RDAs that have been secured or by borrowings that have not been?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Let me take the opportunity to explain the clause to the Committee. That will probably answer the hon. Gentleman’s questions.<P>
Clause 12 sets out the Secretary of State’s power to guarantee an agency’s borrowing, subject to Treasury consent. Subsection (1) gives the Secretary of State the power to guarantee the repayment of the principal sum or interest on an agency’s borrowing subject to the consent of Treasury. Subsection (2) requires the Secretary of State to lay before each House a statement of the sum guaranteed. Subsection (3) requires the Secretary of State to lay before each House a statement relating to sums paid under the clause in each financial year until the liability is fully repaid with interest,. Subsection (4) requires an agency to make repayments to the Secretary of State of capital and interest on sums that he has paid in guaranteeing an agency’s borrowing, as directed by him, with the consent of the Treasury.<P>
The clause sets out the conditions under which Government may guarantee an agency’s borrowing. Without clause 12 it is possible that an agency would not be able to borrow the funds necessary to carrying out its functions. I hope that that answers the various points raised. The only other point is that, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said, borrowing would be dealt with case by case. It would go before both Houses of Parliament and require the consent of the Treasury. It would go before the PAC and the National Audit Office. The protection of public funds is covered.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Government loans</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I just want to ask a question. I understand that the Treasury must provide a guarantee so that borrowing by quangos can take place. It must be underwritten. If a guarantee is provided, however, why must there be a provision for a lender of last resort in the shape of the Secretary of State? Why does the Secretary of State need the ability to issue funds if the Treasury must approve original borrowing and issue a guarantee?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> To amplify my right hon. Friend’s question, and quite apart from the opportunity that RDAs would have to obtain a guarantee for borrowing, which makes it curious that the Secretary of State might lend the money, why does a Bill that gives the Secretary of State the power to make grants to RDAs include a separate clause enabling him to make loans? Clearly there must be some distinction in the Government’s mind between expenditure for which loans and grants would be applicable. It would be helpful to know what the Government’s thinking is on that distinction.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall run briefly through the subsections of clause 13, which gives the Secretary of State the power to lend money to RDAs. Subsection (1) gives the Secretary of State the power to lend an agency, subject to Treasury approval, any sums which it has the power to borrow from him under clause 11(4). Subsection (2) requires that any loan shall be repaid to the Secretary of State at times, by such methods and with such interest as he may decide, subject to Treasury approval. Subsection (3) requires the Secretary of State to prepare, for each financial year, an account of any sums loaned, in a form and manner determined by the Treasury. This should be sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General before the end of September of the following financial year. Subsection (4) requires the Comptroller and Auditor<P>
General to examine, certify and report on each account, and to lay copies of the account and his report before each House. Subsection (5) provides that the Secretary of State may receive sums from the national loans fund to make loans to the RDAs. Any repayments under subsection (2) are to be paid back into the national loans fund.<P>
The clause sets out the arrangements under which the Secretary of State may lend money to the RDAs and provides the necessary powers. It is essential to the Bill.<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked why the Secretary of State was the lender of last resort. I believe that the Treasury—the state—will be the lender of last resort. There could, however, be a guarantee for a temporary overdraft from a bank because that would help an RDA to get the best terms. The hon. Member for South Suffolk asked about the borrowing limit, which is £200 million. That is the maximum.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Despite the Minister’s attempts to turn himself into a talking book by reading out the notes on clauses—<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is what you are going to get after what has happened this morning.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Dr. Clark, I hope that you noted what the Minister said. If we get that response, we will continue to ask questions until we get explanations. But I hope that we will not enter that silly cycle.<P>
I am as capable of reading the notes on clauses as the Minister. The question was simple. Why is the provision necessary? I did not understand his point. If borrowing by agencies is authorised and guaranteed, why is there a requirement for a further provision? In what circumstances will it be used? Will the Minister repeat his explanation?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> An overdraft may be more convenient than borrowing from the Government.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> What? That is an epigrammatic and elliptical statement.<P>
RDAs will be allowed to borrow from the Secretary of State, which means from the Treasury—we all know where that money comes from. Why would they want to do that rather than use the facility to borrow commercially? Is it because commercial banks might not want to lend to them? Is that what is meant by last resort? The Minister implied that there was a sensible, technical reason for the provision; I just do not understand what it is. Will he be kind enough to add a few conjunctions to his sentences so that we can make some progress? Not all of us have his financial expertise, no doubt derived from the Sheffield supertram and other projects. My request is innocent but important.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> RDAs would not have to go directly to the Government. The Secretary of State may allow overdraft facilities. He needs a power to lend money which may not come directly from the Treasury. He would have the power to allow an RDA to take advantage of a bank’s overdraft facility in the short term.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I welcome the ability of the Secretary of State to provide a spectrum of resources to cover particular borrowing requirements. I understand that grants to projects will go out monthly. There is a safety net in case an RDA needs a temporary, short-term overdraft. I assumed that the reference to loans was a way of providing a more specific, longer-term facility. Clause 12 allows the Secretary of State to determine the rate of interest, which would be an advantage if clearing banks decided to charge an exorbitant rate of interest. It would provide an opportunity to assist RDAs in a better way. I did not see the devil in the detail. I thought that the clause would enable different resources to be provided.<P>
I assume that the loans are to be outside the £200 million limit and that they will not get caught up in it. The £200 million is in case of temporary need. Presumably, however, if they are sanctioned by the Secretary of State and the Treasury, the loans will not be caught within that ceiling. Will the Minister therefore give some guidance on the concept of the interest rate? I am more used to interest rates that relate to a bank rate, to a minimum lending rate or to a rate that relates to the Bank of England or to a central bank in Europe. Will the provision give such flexibility downwards as well as upwards? I broadly welcome the opportunity to provide a spectrum of different borrowing.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is exactly what it is. Clause 13 is the counterpart to clause 11. Under clause 11, RDAs may borrow from the Secretary of State; clause 13 gives the Secretary of State the power to lend to RDAs.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Is that separate from the £200 million limit?<P>
Mr. Caborn: No; the global sum within which RDAs can borrow is £200 million, whether by this method—<P>
Mr. Breed: Whether it is by loan or by overdraft.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is right.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 6, line 33, after ‘(1)’ insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘shall be drawn up having regard to the best practice of the accounts and records of public limited companies and’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 124, in clause 17, page 7, line 36, at end insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(2A) In making directions under this section, the Secretary of State shall have regard to best practice in the reports of public limited companies.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am sure that the Committee will agree that the debate that we have had this morning has rendered the amendments now under consideration even more important. The Bill makes RDAs essentially creatures of government—indeed, worse, it makes them bureaucratic, and often unaccountable, creatures—whose actions, words and even thoughts are subject to direction from the Secretary of State. Therefore how RDAs’ accounts and records are kept, how their annual reports are prepared and what such reports contain are questions that assume great significance.<P>
Amendment No. 143 would ensure that RDAs’ accounts and records were maintained not only to the standard specified by the Secretary of State, as stated in the Bill, but to at least the standard expected of a public limited company. Clause 14 is a prescriptive clause, giving the Secretary of State the power to dictate in considerable detail how RDAs keep their accounts and present them to the public and to the taxpayer. What requirements will RDAs be expected to comply with?<P>
Amendment No. 124 relates to clause 17, which deals with RDAs’ annual reports. Again, it is a prescriptive clause; again, the Secretary of State will direct what information the RDA board should include in its annual report. It is important, therefore, that the Committee be told the sort of information, the quality of information and the sort of detail that it can expect in annual reports.<P>
During the past 30 years or so, the level of disclosure in the annual reports of public limited companies has steadily improved. Regional development agencies will be able to engage in significant financial and commercial transactions, so it is necessary for annual reports to contain a high level of good quality information. I hope that the Under-Secretary will assure the Committee that, if she cannot accept the amendments, the Government will meet the aims embodied in them concerning the keeping of records and accounts, the presentation of accounts, and the content and presentation of annual reports.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.<P>
Clause 14 provides that RDAs must keep proper accounts and produce a statement of accounts giving a true and fair view of the state of affairs of their income and expenditure.<P>
Amendment No. 143 seeks to ensure that the statement of accounts would be drawn up having regard to the best practice of the accounts and records of public limited companies. I am surprised that the hon. Member for South Suffolk moved the amendment because it appears that he is not familiar with the normal accounting requirements for non-departmental public bodies, despite his history of service as a Minister in the previous Administration. It is already the usual practice to apply by analogy the accounting requirements of the Companies Acts to non-departmental public bodies, which is why clause 14(1)(c) requires RDAs to prepare statements of accounts giving a true and fair view of the state of their affairs and their income and expenditure. Public limited companies must also give a true and fair view of the state of their affairs—the wording is exactly the same—so the Bill and existing practice are already aligned with what the amendment seeks to put into the Bill.<P>
Clause 14(2) allows the Secretary of State, with the approval of the Treasury, to set out in more detail the form and content of the statement of accounts. Those requirements are set by the Secretary of State through an accounts direction. Those are public documents which are generally published as part of the annual report and accounts of the body.<P>
I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means by the best practices of public limited companies, but the standard requirements should meet his concerns. I assure him that we shall continue with those standard practices for non-departmental public bodies when compiling the accounts direction for the RDAs. That direction will be published as part of the annual report and accounts of the bodies.<P>
Amendment No. 124 would require the Secretary of State to follow the best practice of public limited companies in determining the form and content of the RDAs’ annual reports. The best practice might include, for example, setting out a fair review of the development of the organisation, and we shall ensure that such requirements are included in RDA reports. However, many subjects which are relevant to public limited companies—for example, the payment of dividends—will not be relevant to RDAs. Furthermore, we may ask the RDAs to report on matters such as co-ordination with regional partners or recruitment practices, which one would not expect to find in the reports of public limited companies.<P>
I assure the Committee that we shall follow the best practice of public limited companies in setting requirements for RDAs’ annual reports, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her reply. I recognise that some items of information which we expect to be included in the annual report of regional development agencies would not appear in the accounts of a plc. Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee whether the accounting procedures for non-departmental public bodies, to which she referred, are enshrined in statute, or are merely a matter of practice? Will she also assure the Committee that although the payment of dividends is not relevant to RDAs, the payment of surpluses back to the Department is envisaged and will be included as part of the information in the annual report?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not believe that accounting directions are a statutory requirement; they are established practice of NDPBs. The accounts will be as open, transparent and full as is best practice in both the public and private sectors.<P>
Amendment negatived.<P>
It being One o’clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.<P>
