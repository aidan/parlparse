<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I assure the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) that, having listened carefully to his remarks, I am prepared to consider his amendments again. Good reasons can be advanced for not making any additions to the document dealing with an application for permission to hold a public procession.
<P>
However, as I said to the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) in relation to amendments No. 115 and 116, I shall give the matter further attention. If I decide not to take the matter further on Report I shall write to both hon. Gentlemen's well in advance of that, setting out my reasons.
<P>
I hope that my reply will be an additional reason for withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 3, leave out line 41.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 219, in page 3, line 41, after `procession', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or other procession to or from a religious service'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 41, in page 3, line 43, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which classes and descriptions shall include--<P>
<p>
<br>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a funeral procession,
<br>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a procession to and from a religious service,
<br>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a procession by a band in a rural area where the purpose is for the collection of funds for the band,

<P></ul></font>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Clause 6 specifies exceptions to its provisions, such as funeral processions. If such exceptions are to be made we should consider in more detail the categories of organisations whose processions and shows are not contentious. Those should fall outside the ambit of the Bill. No doubt the Minister will think of spurious reasons for not accepting that sensible view.
<P>Amendment No. 40 would simply remove the reference to funeral processions from the clause. That is not to imply that we want the rigour of the law to be applied to funeral processions, although on the face of it that would be the effect. It cannot very well be judged when a funeral procession will take place. Certainly 28 days' notice cannot be given. We do not know who will be the unfortunate focus of such a procession in the next few months or weeks. That is, thank God, hidden from us.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 specifies certain classes and descriptions of procession that should be exempted, including funeral processions and processions to and from religious services--and no doubt the hon. Member for South Down could tell the Committee whether Corpus Christi processions such as those that take place in the Irish Republic are ever held in Northern Ireland. Other processions, such as fund-raising processions should fall outside the ambit of the Bill.
<P>
In addition to funeral processions, for which no one would dream of demanding applications for permission, the amendment lists the processions that should not be covered by the law. I have already mentioned
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession to and from a religious service''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are quite a few of those.
<P>
The next category relates to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession by a band in a rural area where the purpose is for the collection of funds for the band.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many processions in Northern Ireland are organised by Unionist, Protestant and Orange bands and by nationalist bands, such as those of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, to go to the dwellings of their supporters where they play a few tunes and collect a few pounds. They get into cars and move to the next area. Under current law, because the bands move from one house to another, their efforts are caught by the general description of a procession. That is unnecessary. Such bands visit houses in areas where they are welcome and they cause no problems. I do not see why they should be lumbered with the weight of the law.
<P>
The next categories include processions organised by youth organisations connected with the churches and uniformed children's bodies such as the Girls Brigade, the Boys Brigade and the Scout movements. I say ``Scout movements'', because the Catholic Scout movement operates in Northern Ireland as elsewhere. Similar groups include the Girl Guides and the Church Lads Brigade, which is an Anglican body and does not have many groups in Northern Ireland. However, there are many Boys Brigade, Girls Brigade, Scout and Girl Guides groups in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Many of those groups are attached to churches, and the Boys Brigade, in particular, has a strong religious ethos. Such groups hold cycles of religious services every year. The Minister cannot seriously contemplate placing such organisations under the heavy burdens outlined in the Bill. A simpler procedure should be enough. All they should have to do is tell a police sergeant or a local police station of their plans.
<P>
The next group listed is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession organised by a trade union''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some of them may be planned a considerable time ahead, but many trade union demonstrations and processions take place during a strike or as a protest against closures or job losses. I have never heard of a trade union holding a procession to celebrate jobs coming to an area, but they might not come to us often enough for that to happen. However, I am sure that the Committee understands the general picture.
<P>
Processions are also organised by the Royal British Legion. An atrocious attempt was made by a republican-IRA front organisation in Bellaghy to stop a memorial procession held there last autumn by the Royal British Legion. I include in the amendment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession organised for the purpose of fundraising for a charitable purpose''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There, I am thinking of the band procession that takes place in Garvagh in my constituency each year. It has always raised large sums of money for cancer research, a most worthy cause. There is no need to treat such a procession as potentially contentious. Everyone is welcome to the procession, and everyone comes. They are relieved of some of their hard-earned cash before they go away.
<P>
The amendment also refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession organised on a cross community basis''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that such processions take place in some parts of the country. I do not see why they should be caught by the law. The same is true of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession organised by civil authorities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have lord mayor's shows and those organised by the chairmen of councils. Finally, I include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession which is organised as part of a social function''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members will probably ask for examples. A church procession or a fancy dress procession could form part of a social function. Why should such events be caught by the Bill?
<P>
A large annual steam engine rally takes place in Northern Ireland. The proceedings end with a town procession of vintage steam engines.
<P>
Various vintage car rallies around the country entail a procession round the nearest town. A procession of vintage farm machinery and Clydesdale horses takes place in Garvagh every year and allows people to glimpse a bygone age. It is a popular tourist attraction.
<P>
As the Minister suggested this morning, a local football team might win a cup and want to celebrate with a procession. Although such a procession would be rowdier and more intoxicated than the other processions that I have mentioned, no one would want it to be caught by the measure. The list is endless. The category of processions that amendment No. 41 covers could be caught by the general language of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): Throughout our proceedings, the hon. Gentleman has presented himself as an expert on the organisation of marches. I do not deny his claim. In the light of his great experience and expertise, can he confirm that, by including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession to and from a religious service . . . a procession . . . where the purpose is for the collection of funds . . . a procession which is organised as part of a social function'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
amendment No. 41--would exempt from scrutiny every Orange, Black or other colour of parade in Northern Ireland? The Orange Order allegedly processes to and from church only for religious purposes. Most processions that I have seen took collections and could, by a leap of the imagination, be described as social functions. Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that all parades would be exempt if amendment No. 41 was accepted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Certainly not. I am surprised and horrified that the hon. Gentleman thinks that such a thought was in my mind. I described the sort of social functions that the amendment would cover. We do not want to tie those functions down as tightly as the Bill does. The words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession to and from a religious service''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would cover several, but by no means all loyalist, Orange processions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Drumcree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Well, yes, that procession is to and from a religious service, as are many others. The hon. Gentleman knows that. I cannot understand his objections. Why are we not allowed to go to church? The hon. Gentleman is being malicious.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Expert advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I am simply pointing out that people should be allowed to go to church.We allow people to go to church to bury a dead relative. Too many such journeys have been necessitated in Northern Ireland this week. No one objects to a funeral procession.
<P>
The Amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession by a band in a rural area'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It specifies ``rural area'', where there is no disruption of traffic or of the normal life of the community. Such processions are innocent and are often organised at short notice. The Bill adds to the burden of those procession organisers. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has attended social or church functions that entail a procession. The processions on 17 March and 15 August always seem to wind up at a Catholic church. The Roman Catholic chapel in Dungiven is a favourite venue; there is always a procession in Dungiven on St. Patrick's day, as there is also on 15 August. The processions go up and down the main street and back to the church for the mass. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Down has such processions--
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> He does not. His life is the poorer for that. He is grossly deprived if he is unable to attend such functions. I am sure that he would enjoy them. He is welcome to come to Dungiven for the celebrations on 17 March or 15 August, although he might find some that are closer. However, he would find many people in Dungiven who would agree with his views: the half that are the Roman Catholic population. The other half might not agree with him but that is his worry. None the less, he would have a warm welcome from the county board of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Its members might even ask him to say a few words from the platform. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Down would enjoy that. It might give him a clearer understanding of how people feel about processions. He has obviously been deprived of the education on such matters that every public representative in Northern Ireland should have. The hon. Member for South Down is in the poor position of not even knowing that he is deprived. As a public representative, he should cure that deprivation immediately.
<P>
The amendments are simple and straightforward and I hope that the Minister will accept them. They would relieve not only the people involved in parades of a considerable burden, but would also relieve the Parades Commission of much paperwork. The commission would have much less trouble as many elements of its business would be removed from the equation, and that would reduce the costs of running an entirely unjustified quango.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The debate has been useful because it has exposed the underlying purposes behind the amendments. I do not hesitate to call them wrecking amendments. I will explain my reasons for that conclusion in a moment.
<P>
At present, funeral processions and processions of the Salvation Army are exempt under an order made by the Secretary of State. As the hon. Member for East Londonderry showed in his explanation, the amendments are so widely drawn that it would be easy to design any procession so that it avoided the requirement to give notice. From a sedentary position, the hon. Member for South Down proved that clearly by simply saying ``Drumcree''. All hon. Members knew exactly what he meant by that. We also know what the impact of the amendments would be.
<P>
Many of the categories listed in amendment No. 41 are broad and would leave the door wide open to those with mischief in mind. For example, the category:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procession which is organised as part of a social function''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is so vague as to be meaningless legally. It could not possibly be defined.
<P>
The amendment also includes some bizarre anomalies. For example, bands in a rural area would need to give notice for normal parades, but if they showed a collecting tin that would classify the parade as one held for the purpose of raising money, no notice would be required. For bands in towns, fund-raising processions would continue to require notice. I can see no logical justification for such contradictory provisions. They would lead to chaos in practice. The Committee does not need to spend too long going through the details in amendment No. 41.
<P>
I want to stress a point that has been made before during our sittings. It is worth repeating that the Bill is not intended to make life difficult for organisations that wish to hold processions. Many of the organisations listed in amendment No. 41 hold successful and peaceful processions every year. There is no evidence whatever that those organisations are campaigning for exemption form the order. They comply with it and they recognise the good public order reasons for due notification. Those organisations want to operate within the law and, as I said, they are not asking to be exempted. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments. They are essentially wrecking amendments: in being so wide ranging, they would lead to chaos and undermine what the Bill is trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr Ross:</B> That is all very well, but I am alarmed to hear the Minister say that the Salvation Army is exempt. Why? Why should one specific religious denomination or sect be exempt while all others have to comply with the law? That is a simple question and I doubt whether it will get a logical answer. Why is the Salvation Army alone among religious groupings in being exempt from the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is no logical answer to that. I have asked the same question and the answer is that it has always been there. It would be churlish to end its exemption when it has always been exempted in the past. We would have to delve into history to examine the case that was advanced at the time by the Salvation Army. I have no intention of removing its exemption and I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman is arguing for that in any case. The Salvation Army is listed and it should remain listed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The Salvation Army has a clear theological stance, which might not be acceptable in all parts of the country. I hear my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) agreeing with me and I suspect that he knows more about theology than does the Minister.
<P>
The Salvation Army is a religious denomination that is admired throughout the community for its fine social work. However, we are not arguing about the social aspects of its work but about religious denominations being given a privileged place. A long time ago the Salvation Army was considered so unique--for whatever purpose--that it was given a special place. In this modern age we are always told that everyone must be treated in the same way. When every other denomination--the Boys Brigade, the Girls Brigade, the Girl Guide Association and the Brownies; and there hardly more harmless organisations than these--has to comply with the law, why should the Salvation Army be given a special place?
<P>
The Minister cannot be allowed to get away with smiling and saying that the Salvation Army has always been there. Many other organisations have always been there too, yet all at once they are being removed from the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson (West Tyrone):</B> It may help the Minister in looking back at history to note that at one time the Salvation Army was looked upon in exactly the same way as the Government seek to look upon Orange parades today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I dare say that in some hard-drinking pubs in some parts of the country, the Salvation Army might still be treated in the same way. Let us not be mealy-mouthed about it. One particular religious organisation, body, denomination or sect--call it what you will--is being given a special place in law. Surely that is inherently wrong: they should all be treated the same. The Minister seemed to exempt only a funeral procession. Very well, let him stick to that point of view; but let us not give a special place to any denomination, no matter how esteemed in the popular imagination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I hesitate to say it because it will probably provoke an even wider-ranging debate, but there has never been trouble with the Salvation Army. Before the hon. Gentleman says that there has never been trouble with other religious organisations, such as the Girl Guides, Boy Scouts and so forth, may I tell him that I am well aware of that. However, as I said initially, those other organisations have not sought exemption but they can apply to the Secretary of State and, if necessary, an order can be considered on its merits. It would be a matter for those organisations rather than for the hon. Member for East Londonderry to decide on their behalf to request exemption for them. If they requested it, due consideration would be given.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does not the Minsiter realise that under the European convention on human rights it may be difficult to designate, and include or exclude people. I would regard an organisation as legal and feel that it would be extremely difficult to claim that one organisation was better than another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If a breach of the ECHR occurred, the Government would have to take that on board. I shall check that and write to hon. Members. The European convention is complex and much of it has still to be tested. I recollect saying on Second Reading that we have an obligation to ensure that all states' legislation is compatible. The Government are charged with doing that in relation to the European convention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Will it be checked?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> It is clear that the Minsiter will have to reconsider and come back on Report because my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) has raised the wider question which the Minister will have to answer. We look forward to that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 225, in page 4, leave out lines 1 and 2.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment: No. 63, in page 4, line 2, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to such other person or persons that the Chief Constable deems appropriate, and the Commission shall ensure that a copy of a notice is immediately sent to such other person or persons that the Commission deems appropriate)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The hon. Member for South Down has also tabled an amendment, although his is longer than mine.
<P>
Amendment No. 225 relates to the commission's very existence. It seems quite ridiculous that the Chief Constable must ensure that a copy of a notice is sent immediately to the commission. Let us consider what will happen. A person who wishes to organise a procession completes the notice, gives it to the police sergeant--if he can be found, and we have heard of the difficulties that that might involve--who forwards it to his inspector, who gives it to the superintendent, who in turn forwards it to the subdivisional commander, who presumably forwards it to the commission--or perhaps to the Chief Constable because he has to see it first. After a week or 10 days it gets to the commission.
<P>
The police know that among 300 parades in a given area each year one might give trouble while others across large areas give no trouble whatever. What need is there for this provision? The only possible reason that I can think of for sending a notice might be that the commission is afraid of running out of work. I drew attention earlier to the mischief-making possibilities in the commission's brief in that it would immediately start to advertise and make inquiries throughout the country to find someone who might object.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot think of anything dafter in a volatile situation in Northern Ireland. I should have thought that the less hullabaloo was made of these things the better for everyone concerned. I do not know who thinks up these daft ideas. As I said this morning, the daft ideas that always look so good when they are conceived grow up to be ugly monsters.
<P>
The consequences of sending these things to the Chief Constable and getting him to send them out and run all around the countryside looking for objectors seem daft. The Government should have considered the possibility of the Chief Constable sending it to the commission if he thought it appropriate or necessary. That would mean he would have to do so only if there was a possibility of confrontation and violence.
<P>
Why go round looking for trouble? Why try to create a situation where trouble might arise and could be fomented? That is how people will see it. They will see this as a lot of busybodies running around trying to cause friction and problems between neighbours when none existed before and, far worse, bringing into perfectly peaceful areas large numbers of ill-intentioned people from elsewhere.
<P>
Of the processions that take place, 99.9 per cent. have no problem. We are told that the Government believe that there are only 20 or 30 anyway. What is being set forth here is certain to aid those with evil intent. It will ensure that they know the time and place of all the planned processions and can therefore say, ``There's that one, that one and that one. We'll leave those three alone and do those two. We'll get a few people down to every one. We'll set up a little committee and get them to start asking questions.'' If one goes out of one's way to create trouble, trouble is the inevitable consequence.
<P>
That was the thinking behind the amendment. The proposal is far too wide. It will cause immense difficulties for everyone concerned. Even if one thought that the commission was necessary--which I do not--this measure is quite unnecessary. The Government should take this subsection away and try to come up with a measure that would give the police some leeway on whether it is necessary to inform the commission.
<P>
Are we going to inform the commission about all the Boys Brigade, Girls Brigade and Royal British Legion processions that take place every year? Are we to tell it about every fund-raising function through the country every year? This is madness. There is no other way to describe it. The whole thing is mad anyway. If the Government have the slightest wit they will listen to what I say. They will take this away and come back with sensible measures on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> There is a complete dichotomy between the two amendments in this group. Amendment No. 225 seeks to ensure that the commission is not notified at all of any parade taking place by deleting the necessity for the Chief Constable to give it notice. I want to make the process more open, thereby making it more acceptable. Amendment No. 63 aims to give the Chief Constable the authority, on a permissive rather than mandatory basis, to give notice not only to the parades commission but to such other person or persons that he--or she if there is ever a female Chief Constable--deems necessary. The corollary is that when the commission gets a copy of the order from the Chief Constable, the commission in turn, by permission of the statute--it would not be mandatory--would send it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to such other person or persons that the Commission deems appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Openness is highly desirable so that there is no secrecy, as we discussed in an earlier debate on the period of notice. Pushing things through as quickly as possible, so that no one knows about them, leads to confrontation. The amendment would promote the opposite attitude: it would enable people to be aware of what is going on, to be consulted and, I hope, to come to an agreement on matters in dispute which, relatively speaking, are few. Openness gives the commission and the community a better chance of dealing with matters of contention. It is as simple as that. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry.
<P>
It seems there has been a problem in recent years in the line management of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, because everything has to be decided by the Chief Constable. When a parade is taking place policeman on the ground, whether he is a constable, a sergeant, or some other rank, has the power to take decisions. However, in the past few years the officers who police the areas where parades take place and who acted within their capacity as policemen and made recommendations, had their decisions countermanded by the Chief Constable. We suspect that that is often not for good policing reasons but because of political pressures or the Chief Constable's political ideology, which, unfortunately, he allows to influence his decisions. That is one of the trouble with policiing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Many parades would have taken place peaceably had the advice of the local police been taken and not contradicted and countermanded by the Chief Constable. It is appropriate that the copy of the document relating to the parade should go to the chief of police in the area where the parade is taking place. It is up to him to take responsiblity for the decisions on policing matters and not always to defer to the Chief Constable. That is what has eroded the confidence of the ordinary policemen on the street and that is why there have been diffculties. 
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down obviously believes that the more people who are told, the less trouble there will be. I believe that the reverse is the case. It is not those people's business who is marching the Queen's highway. The idea that we are to go out and tell every Tom, Dick and Harry where we are going and what we are doing is an insult to the intelligence of ordinary people. We would be advertising our plans to those law-breakers who are out to cause disruption and create trouble.
<P>
We fundamentally disagree with the idea that the commission should announce in April its intended decision for the parade in July. Nothing could be more stupid. Furthermore, the decision might be announced five days before a parade. If it is decided five day before Drumcree that the march will not go ahead, thousands and thousands of loyalists will be attracted to Portadown to ensure that the parade does go ahead. However, if it is announced that the parade is going ahead, Sinn Fein-IRA will ensure that every missile and petrol bomb will be there to attack the police when they try to enforce that ruling.
<P>
The Chief Constable's habit in recent years of announcing beforehand what he intends to do is most unfortunate. There is no obligation on the Royal Ulster Constabulary to tell anyone what it intends to do. By keepng its intentions secret until the day of the parade, fewer people, troublemakers and objectors will be attracted to the parade. If people do not know what is going to happen, they are unlikely to come in droves to stop or disrupt it. Amendment No. 63 should be disregarded and amendment No. 225 should be accepted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Before I deal with the amendments in detail, I want to deal with one of the remarks made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone. If I heard him correctly, he said that the Chief Constable brings his political convictions to his determination of matters relating to parades. That was a deeply offensive remark. The Chief Constable of the RUC has the toughest job of any chief constable in the United Kingdom and probably of the equivalent officer anywhere else in the western world. His job is complex and difficult. I meet him on a regular basis and I could not begin to say what his political convictions are--they have never been discussed and I have never heard him express a political point of view. He has a right, of course, to have political convictions, but I can say without reservations that I have never had any hint that the hon. Gentleman's accusation could stand examination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Minister has a right to his views; I have a right to mine; the people of Northern Ireland have the right to theirs. As far as the loyalist community is concerned, my view is their view.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is tortuous. I hoped that the hon. Gentleman had got to his feet to apologise for his unwarranted attack on the Chief Constable. I will draw his opinions to the notice of the Chief Constable, who I am sure will give them due consideration and weight.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down said that amendment No. 225 would delete subsection (6). That would mean that the Bill had no provision to ensure that the Parades Commission received a copy of the notice.
<P>
It is difficult to appreciate the basis of that argument. I assure hon. Members who have raised the matter that the RUC prefers the Bill as it is. The RUC wants the Chief Constable to take responsibility for passing the notice to the Parades Commission rather than leaving it to some unspecified officer. If such an officer did not pass on notification, he could be charged with not doing so. The Chief Constable himself has said that he prefers our way of dealing with this. Responsibility will lie with the Chief Constable, who will put in place adequate procedures to ensure that the Parades Commission receives the notices it needs to carry out its function. I am totally opposed to amendment No. 225 and ask that it be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment No. 63, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, seeks to ensure that the Chief Constable or the Parades Commission notify those deemed appropriate of any application for a public procession. There is nothing to stop them doing so anyway. The problem is how to judge who is appropriate. If notification were not passed on, anyone would have the right to say, ``I live in the area. Why did you pass me by?''.
<P>
Best practice will be developed on the ground. The Chief Constable and officers who are responsible for areas, and the Parades Commission once it develops knowledge from the function it must perform, will identify those to whom they wish to talk about particular parades. To put that duty on them by including the words ``deems appropriate'' could cause problems if someone was not consulted. If it is open, they can operate best practice on who should or should not be consulted. Amendment No. 63 does not stand up to examination and I ask that it be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister. He is far too touchy. He needs to calm down and deal with these matters in a more reasonable frame of mind. He gets over-excited when he disagrees with something and will never come to a sensible conclusion if he lets his emotions rule his logic. Let me take him back to what I actually said.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that the hon. Member for South Down is wrong. He flies in the opposite direction to us. We say that we should not make sure that the maximum number of people know. All we do by advertising events is to ensure that undesirable elements will take it into their heads that there is a chance to cause more mayhem. I intend that we limit notification. I am not struck on the wording of amendment No. 225 but the Government should consider giving the police--whether it be at local, divisional, sub-divisional or Chief Constable level--a measure of discretion on whether to pass each application through the whole machinery of the commission or to advertise it.
<P>
Many parades are minor. Years ago, they took place and no one ever bothered to inform the police. Now the police have to be involved, but I do not think we need to go any further than that. So depite his bad-tempered strictures and flat refusal even to consider the amendment, will the Minister please reconsider? If he is prepared to do that, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The Minister seems stuck to his seat, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg tomove amendment No. 222, in page 4, leave out lines 4 to 8 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(a) in respect of which he knows that the requirements of this section as to notice have not been satisfied, shall be guilty of an offence; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) which he knows has not complied with the provisions of the notice given under this section as regards date, time or route,',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 224, in clause 6, page 4, line 5, after `been', insert `reasonably'.
<P>
No. 42, in clause 6, page 4, leave out lines 18 to 19.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I start by referring to amendment No. 42, which I tabled to discover exactly what is intended--
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. Amendment No. 63 was neither moved nor withdrawn, so what is the position regarding that amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 63 was grouped with the lead amendment, No. 225, so when that amendment was withdrawn, amendment No. 63 went with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Thank you, Mr. Welsh. I find it extremely difficult to comprehend that the hon. Member for East Londonderry can withdraw my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman's amendment was out of my gentle care. I thought that given his addiction to his amendment, he might want to return to it on Report. He is now free to think about it, table a similar amendment on Report and vote on it if he wishes, provided it is selected for debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 would delete subsection (9)(b). What is intended by that? Would it mean that if someone did something that would otherwise be illegal, no charge could or would be brought if it came under what will become section 7? I am happy if that is so, but the other two amendments that I have tabled in relation to the same clause would make the Bill more satisfactory. At present, the Bill does not include ``reasonably'', which amendment No. 224 would insert. It may not be good grammar, but ``reasonably'' has appeared elsewhere in the Bill--we talked about it this morning in relation to a previous amendment and accepted that it should be included. That being so, I believe that reasonableness should be part and parcel of the entire approach. If that is the position why does not the Minister accept this sensible amendment? If a person is ``reasonably satisfied'', it might even wipe out the need to include lines 18 and 19. If the Minister objects to the inclusion of ``reasonably'', will he say why? In its deletion of lines 4 to 8, amendment No. 222 would, together with what I have already mentioned, provide the individual with another defence in law. If he did not know at the time that the event was illegal--it would be possible for a member of a large crowd not to know--he would have a defence.
<P>
As I said in earlier debates on the matter, an individual may come along to observe. You could come along yourself, Mr. Welsh, to observe. All at once, your name appears on television, and everyone would say, ``Good heavens! There is Andrew Welsh, the Chairman of the Committee, a Scottish Member of Parliament, taking part in an illegal procession in Northern Ireland! At least he is there.'' All at once, however, the individual would be taken to court. He would be guilty of an offence because he happened to be present at an illegal procession.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would prefer to participate in the debate rather than in its content. I would rather not be used as an example by the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he could cite plenty of other persons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Perhaps Hansard could delete reference to you, Mr. Welsh, and insert the Minister of State or his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington). The hon. Gentleman is very distinctive. The Under-Secretary of State is tall enough: we would all see him. He could be observing--and then, all at once, find himself in court. In such circumstances, I am sure that we would have every sympathy with the Minister, and that the Minister would have every sympathy with any other individual--a journalist or a television cameraman for example. God knows who could be there.
<P>
My point is that in such confused situations, there should be a need to prove that an individual knew that the procession was illegal. Someone who lives along the route might be merely proceeding to or from his residence. If he walks in the direction of the procession, he will be clobbered with being a member of that illegal procession. Such an individual should have a better defence than that available to him under existing legislation. The insertion into the Bill of the words that amendment No. 222 proposes would go a long way to meeting those concerns, which I share with many other people.
<P>
I remember one procession, many years ago, at which the police yelled at people through loud hailers. They have improved slightly since then. People who were 300 yards away knew what the officer said. The problem was that those who were close--as was subsequently proven in court--did not know what he was saying. All that they could hear was a huge wall of noise. The magistrate accepted that they could not possibly understand what was being said, and dismissed the cases in many instances. It is possible for someone to be there and not know. The amendment merely states that the people who know--the leading lights--rather than the mass of the population, would be found guilty.
<P>
A couple of years ago--I think that it was in 1996--the commanding officer of the RUC in Londonderry described rioting in the city during the Drumcree period as the worst and most vicious that he had ever seen. Those are strong words from a senior RUC officer. It was a difficult situation, with petrol bombs, sticks, stones, insults--whatever one could name, it was all there.
<P>
A vast crowd was outside the Strand road police station on that occasion yet I do not think that one person was ever taken to court. In such circumstances, the police seem to have a free hand about whether to prosecute A, B, C, D, E or F, the whole lot, or none of them. Whether one is prosecuted in those circumstances is an absolute lottery. It is often the minor fry who end up in court rather than the major players. In that situation the ordinary citizen should have a defence, and if the police, the Government or the Director of Public Prosecutions (Northern Ireland) are to take action, we must make it clear that that new line of defence is available.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The police should prosecute when they have evidence on camera. When there are vicious riots--such as those that occurred in Londonderry--I appreciate that there may be no police on the streets to see what is going on. However, they can observe from their lookout posts. I am sure that there are on police cameras hundreds of known folk who took part in the rioting in Londonderry last December and who have been identified. I do not know whether many of those people have been prosecuted--I read a few reports in the local press about people being taken to court and fined or sentenced to terms of imprisonment. However, that touches only a tiny proportion of the total.
<P>
The Government should ensure that all those who engage in rioting are taken to court. Those people should have the opportunity to say, ``Hold on a minute. I believe that I have a defence, and it is up to you to prove me guilty.'' We in Northern Ireland are not as advanced as in Scotland, where the verdict of not proven is available. In Northern Ireland the verdicts are only either guilty or innocent. Will the Government accept amendments Nos. 42, 222 and 224, all of which are reasonable?

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Amendment No. 222 states that a person would be guilty of an offence only if he knew that proper notice had not been given or that the date, time or route differed from that specified in the notice. However, clause 6(8) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In proceedings for an offence under subsection (7) it is a defence for the accused to prove that he did not know of, and neither suspected not had reason to suspect, the failure to satisfy the requirements of this section or (as the case may be) the difference of date, time or route.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill already contains a protection, and I do not see further merit in amendment No. 222. The points that were made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry are already dealt with, and the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 224 states that a person should be guilty of an offence only if the requirements about giving notice had not been ``reasonably'' satisfied. Clause 6 contains the statutory requirements about giving of notice. In particular, it states that notice should be given in a prescribed form. If the organisers of parades follow the straightforward requirements about giving notice they will have satisfied the requirements of clause 6. I therefore see no further merit in the amendment. Whether the notice requirements are satisfied is clearly a matter of fact. To include the word ``reasonably'' in the clause is therefore redundant--rather than making a positive contribution, adding that word could cause confusion about the range of circumstances that apply to the giving of notice, which are clear without the amendment.
<P>
No. 223, in page 4, line 13, at end insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> As the amendments of the hon. Member for South Down were tabled before mine, I had hoped that he would have first bite at this cherry, but that again falls to me. Two of the amendments were interesting. The hon. Gentleman has taken hold of the word ``reasonable'' and his amendments seem very reasonable. I look forward to hearing his comments.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 concerns a different issue. It refers to an organiser of a procession who is accused of breach of the requirements. The trouble is that the organiser of the show--we discussed the perimeter of the matter this morning--may not be totally in control of it at certain times and places and in certain circumstances. All I am asking is that we state in the Bill that the organiser of a procession cannot be held responsible for a breach that is caused by a person or persons not invited by the organiser to participate in the procession. Amendment No. 223 is tied in with amendments No. 115 and 116, which we discussed this morning, and I hope that the Minister will take on board my comments. I do not want the organiser to be clobbered because the procession is joined by another band, perhaps wearing regalia which may be offensive to the organiser, who may then be thumped in court because of it. People may take many precautions, but they do not always work in the current situation in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I am deeply concerned about amendment No. 226. Clause 6(8) states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is a defence for the accused to prove''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The accused is being asked to prove a negative and that is difficult. The amendment would omit the words ``to prove'' so that subsection (8) would state;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the accused did not know''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will follow my drift. It should be a defence for the accused if he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``did not know of . . . nor had reason to suspect''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because it would be somewhat easier for the accused to prove his innocence if the words ``to prove'' were removed. Those words are redundant anyway. I am curious to hear what the Minister has to say on this point, as I think that he understands the general issue that I am raising. It deserves the Committee's attention, as well as that of the Minister and his advisers, especially with regard to amendment No. 223, which should be considered in the light of amendments Nos. 115 and 116.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I propose to speak to amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 69. With your permission, Mr. Welsh, I shall deal with amendments Nos. 64 and 65 together. I shall deal with amendment No. 69 separately, for a reason that I shall state later.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to give an added defence and an added responsibility to a defendant. The intention of amendment No. 64 should be fairly self-evident--that a person accused under this section should have the defence that he had taken all reasonable steps to ensure that compliance, and that such compliance was outside his control. I do not think it necessary to labour that point at this stage. It should be an elementary aspect of a defendant's rights to say that he had taken all reasonable precautions for the delivery of that which he had undertaken to deliver.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 65 is to place some additional responsibility on a person who makes the defence that he should be excused because of ``circumstances beyond his control'' as in clause 6(9)(a). It would not be an excuse if the circumstances were beyond the person's control and he had failed to take reasonable steps to determine that a different time, date or route for the procession was intended. Therefore, this addition to the legislation would place an additional burden on the defendant to make reasonable inquiries about what was taking place.
<P>
I wish to refer to amendment No. 69 separately--I shall need guidance on this matter, Mr. Welsh--because of a typographical error. Amendment No. 69 refers--as far as I can judge--to clause 7, page 5, line 20, and not to line 7 as printed on the amendment paper. Clause 7(7)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person who knowingly fails to comply with a condition imposed under this section shall be guilty of an offence, but it is a defence for him to prove that the failure arose from circumstances beyond his control''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>My amendment adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``but not where a person has failed to take all reasonable steps to determine if it was intended not to comply with a condition under this section''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That places a further burden on the person, who will not just be able to give the bland excuse that it was beyond his control, and who will have to take the appropriate action within his power. I assume therefore that it is correct to address this particular amendment at this juncture, and I apologise for my error with respect to the amendment's description.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments are self-explanatory and do not require great persuasion in their support. I should like to think that the Minister will consider them appropriate improvements to the defence available and that will agree that they would promote a responsible attitude, so that there would be less chance of the person concerned washing his hands of any transgression of the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Clause 6(8) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In proceedings for an offence under subsection (7) it is a defence for the accused to prove that he did not know of, and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect''
<P>
</UL></FONT>that proper notice had not been given or that the date, time or route of the parade differed from that specified in the notice. As the hon. Member for East Londonderry said, amendment No. 226 would simply remove the words ``to prove'' from the clause. However, in relevant circumstances, the law would be broken by virtue of the fact that details of the procession were not notified. Clearly, the courts cannot read people's minds. The onus is upon the person who is alleged to have committed the offence to prove that he did not know of the circumstances. The argument would turn on that point.
<P>
Under amendment No. 223 it would be a defence for a procession organiser if any breach of clause 6 was caused by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``persons not invited to participate in the procession by the organiser''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, clause 6(9)(a) already provides a defence for the organiser that relies on proving that a breach of the requirements as to date, time or route resulted from 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``circumstances beyond his control''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Bill thus already takes account of the hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 69 would make it difficult for organisers of parades not to be prosecuted for occurrences that might be outside their control. Another event might intrude on the proceedings. There might be a delay to allow another procession to pass. It could be outside the powers of the relevant organisation to influence such events, but it could be penalised for them. This is not the usual state of affairs with regard to civil offences. The present formulation makes clear the extent of the organiser's civil reponsibility and that is the standard formulation in the civil law generally.
<P>
I shall consider the logic that the hon. Member for South Down has set out with respect to amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 69. There may be merit in the argument and I want to consider it more fully and set out the relevant legal position to assist the hon. Gentleman. That will give him the opportunity, should he decide not to press the amendments, to present them again on Report if he is not satisfied with my explanation. It is important to set out the strength of the existing clause in maintaining current civil practice.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for East Londonderry will withdraw the amendment and that the other amendments will not be pursued to a vote.

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> In view of the Minister's remarks and his undertaking to consider the thrust of amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 69, I shall not press them.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> As we shall return to this issue on Report, I propose to withdraw my amendments. However, I hope that the Minister will consider what I said about amendments No. 115 and 116 in relation to amendment No. 223.
<P>
I regret what has happened once again. We have moved from the position where someone in Northern Ireland was innocent until proven guilty to one in which he is guilty until proven innocent. I want to amend the Bill so that the police and the courts return to the correct approach. None the less, in the light of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 4, line 20, leave out `a' and insert `the senior'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall take the following amendments: No. 44, in page 4, line 21, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`not below the rank of inspector'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert `present'.
<P>
No. 183, in clause 7, page 5, line 21, leave out `a' and insert `the senior'.
<P>
No. 184, in clause 7, page 5, line 22, leave out from `Constabulary' to end of line 22 and insert `present'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The amendments would deal with the problems that may arise on a day when a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary below the rank of inspector is in charge of a parade or a minor procession. For example, it may be necessary to change a route if someone has dug up the road or blown up a bridge, and people may be on the road in a rural area or a small village with no senior officer present. It has been a defect in the legislation for many years that those taking part in many processions are expected to deal with someone of such seniority in the police.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the amendments, which refer to a senior member of the police, because on some parades, only an officer below the rank of inspector--for example, a sergeant--may be present? The wording of the clause also appears in clause 7(7)(b) which refers to someone
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not below the rank of inspector.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would tidy up the legislation. Of course, there may be wider reasons why they cannot be accepted. If so, I would like to know what they are. On many minor parades and processions the most senior officer present might be a sergeant, but any one of a hundred things--for example, the road may have been dug up--might mean that the parade could not go down the planned route. Will the Minister consider that problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This part of the Bill has been drafted on the best advice of the RUC, which has the necessary operational experience.
<P>
If a procession does not keep to the arrangements set out in the notice that has been given, the Bill provides for a defence only when an officer of inspector rank or above has issued instructions that give rise to the difference. To change the provision in the way suggested by the hon. Member for East Londonderry could have one of two effects. In extreme circumstances, a defendant could rely on the fact that an RUC constable had agreed to such a deviation. The RUC takes the view that it is more appropriate to reserve such strategic decisions to officers of the rank of inspector or above.
<P>
The amendment might also mean that parade organisers would have to wait until a police officer more senior to the rank of inspector--in the past it could have been an assistant chief constable--could be found. He may be elsewhere. He may have been seen around the parade and it would be assumed that the ACC or more senior officer was still there. A request would come from those who have to deal with the situation, but the more senior officer may not be available at that particular time. Such circumstances could result in a dangerous delay in carrying out police instructions. If the instructions were to result in a parade deviating from the commission's determinations, they would have been issued for public order or safety reasons where delay would be highly dangerous.
<P>
There are good reasons for the RUC to take the view that an officer of senior rank should be involved to ensure that police instructions are properly understood. Important strategic issues must be complied with to avoid dangerous situations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept what is not just my argument, but the best advice of the RUC, and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I understand the force of the Minister's argument. However, when he reads the Hansard report of our proceedings, he will realise that some of his arguments could apply with equal force in the opposite direction. My point was that at a particular stage of a procession it could be necessary to pass through a side street and the Minister will know that a senior officer is not always there. I appreciate that he is there normally, but not always. I hope that the Minister will examine my argument further and accept that it is applicable in some circumstances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 4, leave out lines 29 to 31.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 212, in page 4, leave out lines 32 to 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> May I seek your guidance, Mr. Welsh? The amendments would be consequential on new clause 3. Can we speak to that new clause now?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The provisional selection groups together amendments Nos. 211 and 212 first. New clause 3 can be discussed in our clause 7 stand part debate. Let us stick to the amendments first and raise matters relating to the new clause later. It would be inappropriate to debate new clause 3 now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> May I assume that if I withdraw the amendments, which are the consequence of new clause 3, it will affect the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If you withdraw the amendments, it is within your power to resubmit them later: they would remain intact on Report. If you wanted to, you could reintroduce them then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I shall seek to withdraw amendments Nos. 211 and 212.

<B>Mr. Norman A. Godman </B>(Greenock and Inverclyde): On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Has anyone complained about the inadequate central heating in the Room? I am nithered [Hon. Members: ``Nithered''?] and others may be too. It seems that a couple of hon. Members--the shirt-sleeved mob here--are much tougher. I find it cold and I am making a serious point about it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The point of order is well taken. I shall make inquiries to see what can be done to assist the hon. Gentleman. [Interruption.] I appear to be getting the opposite view. I am informed that engineering control is going to regulate the temperature. I hope that it will be regulated to almost everyone's, if not everyone's, desired level. The matter is being looked at.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments, I will withdraw my amendment and I will not move amendment No. 231. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 5, leave out lines 4 to 16 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) The guidelines shall in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of section 5(1)) provide for the Commission to recognise the requirement of allowing processions to be held, and to have particular regard to:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any disruption to the life of the community which the procession might cause;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any impact which the procession may have on relationships within the community;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) any previous failure of a person of a description specified in the guidelines to comply with the code of conduct;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) any undue demand on police and military resources;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and have regard to:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) any public disorder or damage to property which may result from the procession.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 215, in page 5, leave out lines 4 to 16.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Amendment No. 68 replaces subsection (6) which sets out guidelines on the matters to which the commission should have regard. One of the first things that strikes me about the Bill is that one is inclined to attribute order of importance to the order in which the paragraphs appear in the Bill. Amendment No. 68 repeats four of the five paragraphs verbatim and adds one new dimension, namely, that the commission should have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any undue demand on police or military resources''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is a reasonable proposition. Finally, it deletes paragraph (e) which concerns the desirability of allowing customarily held processions.
<P>
The amendment redirects the commission to the order of importance that should be attached to the matters on which it makes its decision. The most important aspect should be the possibility of disruption to the life of the community that a particular procession or parade might cause, followed by the impact that it might have on the relationships within that community. Those are the primary criteria on which the commission's decision should be based.
<P>
Obviously, if there is a history of failure on the part of the applicants or sponsors to comply with previous guidelines or with the code of conduct, that should also be an important consideration, followed by a consideration of the demands that will be made on the police and military if they are involved, and the risk to them and the community in terms of the violence that may result.
<P>
I have made paragraph (a), which is about any public disorder or damage to property, the last paragraph in my amendment. I may be forgiven for thinking that the welfare of the community is much more important than damage to property. It may be argued that they go hand in hand, but I am trying to give the commission a steer on the order of importance.
<P>
I should explain why I want to delete paragraph (e) which refers to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability of allowing a procession customarily held along a particular route to be held along that route.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is desirable that where parades and processions can take place without problems, they should be allowed to do so. I take a positive stance on that; I do not wish to be accused of negativism. A decision to impose conditions or to disallow them should be taken only after due consideration. The commission's attitude should be, first, that all parades should be allowed and, secondly, that it will consider factors that may influence its decision to allow them.
<P>
I am proposing the deletion of the term ``customarily held'' for a number of reasons. First, it requires definition. I previously gave an example of what was said to be a customarily held parade, and therefore a justified parade--``traditionality'' is another word for it. The traditionality in the case that I quoted involved a housing estate that had not even had its road made up; it was deemed a traditional parade despite the fact that the houses on the estate did not exist 24 months earlier. There is a huge problem with misuse of the word ``traditionality'' and its extension.
<P>
The second aspect of traditionality is that in Northern Ireland society it creates an inequality of treatment and consideration between the two communities. Traditionality is ascribed mainly to the loyal lodges and their marches but not to any other section of the community. If that were a heavily weighted argument on which the commission were to base its decision, then, like other matters, it might be subject to European human rights legislation and there might be conflict in the guidelines for policy appraisal and fair treatment--the PAFT guidelines--under which the quality of treatment and of appreciation must be the guiding factor.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with that. The only other organisation that compares with the loyalist organisations in Northern Ireland is the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and I know of no one in the Protestant community who considers its processions and behaviour on its days of celebration to be other than traditional. I certainly do not. Although it has decreased in numbers, and in power and influence, it is still greatly valued by adherents in places where it still exists. Its processions are traditional, and are treated and welcomed as such. The hon. Gentleman will recall at least three occasions last year when concern was expressed about whether the organisation should march through Protestant villages. The local Orange lodges said that it was very welcome to do so and that they hoped that it would.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has consistently suggested some sense of ``them'' and ``us'' equality, comparing the AOH with the loyal Orange and Black Preceptories and lodges. There is simply no comparison in terms of quantum. However the statistics are massaged and manipulated, the fact remains that there are more than 3,000 parades, of which about 2,500 are deemed to be Orange or Unionist parades. The statistics are in the North report and in parliamentary answers in Hansard for all to see. So we are not genuinely comparing like with like. If traditionality or the term ``customarily held'', is to be the driving force behind a decision to be taken by the commission, it will considerably disadvantage certain sections of the community--and will be seen to do so.
<P>
The commission's presumption should be to allow a parade, taking into consideration the matters in the Bill roughly in the order in which they appear. The amendment's purpose is to reschedule subsection (6), paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), to omit paragraph (e) and to insert the additional consideration of taking note of the requirements of the RUC and any Army back-up, if required, in order, as the hon. Member for East Londonderry put it, to allow a parade through a community that did not want it to go through.
<P>
Those are valid considerations, predicated on the assumption that permission should be given, but where matters override that presumption the commission should take note of the provisions roughly in the order in which they appear in the amendment. The order in which they appear in the Bill will be taken as the order of relative importance and the community is much more important than bricks and mortar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Everyone will agree--at least they should agree--that this Bill is fundamental to Northern Ireland. It deals with important issues, especially the rights and privileges of the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
I want to emphasise that my party believes that all parades should be peaceful and that provided a parade is peaceful, it should be able to go ahead. I challenge the Minister to say whether any other Drumcree parades broke the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. The organisers went to the police and they observed the law to the letter. On the instructions of the police they marched to the church; they completely satisfied the order every year. In the three years when there was trouble, there was no infraction of the law by the Orange Order parades.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Much has been made of Dr. North's report; it is almost as if God was speaking. The Minister quotes again and again from Dr. North. It is as if the Government do not have a mind of their own but have to follow meticulously Dr. North's views. We do not accept his conclusions. The Bill deals with rights, yet many of its provisions contravene the European convention on human rights. The right to march and the right to withold consent cannot both be accommodated.
<P>
We have mentioned the European convention on human rights on several occasions, but the Minister has been reluctant to deal with that point. He said that it would be tackled in future. I draw his attention to the White Paper entitled ``Rights Brought Home: The Human Rights Bill'', which outlines the Government's intentions on human rights. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bill provides for legislation--both Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation--to be interpreted so far as possible so as to be compatible with the Convention. This goes far beyond the present rule which enables the courts to take the Convention into account in resolving any ambiguity in a legislative provision. The courts will be required to interpret legislation so as to uphold the Convention rights unless the legislation itself is so clearly incompatible with the Convention that it is impossible to do so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The White Paper also states that whenever a Bill is presented to Parliament, the relevant Minister will be obliged to ascertain whether it contravenes the European convention on human rights. Has that been done in relation to the measure that we are considering?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Has a report been produced to show how the Bill conforms to the European convention on human rights? It is not acceptable for the Minister to claim that the Government will consider the matter later, or wait until someone makes an objection.
<P>
<H5>6.18 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.32 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I was talking about the European convention on human rights. The Government's White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A declaration of incompatibility will be an important statement to make and the power to make it will be reserved to the higher courts. They will make a declaration on any proceedings before them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a great danger that the Bill might be struck down by a higher court because it contravenes those rights.
<P>
I repeat that Ulster Unionist Members do not accept the argument, put forward by Dr. North, that there is a right to march and that there is a right to withhold consent. We do not therefore accept that it is necessary to find an accommodation between those two rights. We believe that under British law people have an almost absolute right to march the Queen's highway without let or hindrance.
<P>
I refer to Professor A.T.H. Smith's book ``Offences Against Public Order''. In writing about offences on the highway he noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In essence, a highway is not a road, as might be imagined, but `a way over which there exists a right of passage, that is to say a right for all of Her Majesty's subjects, at all seasons of the year freely and at their will to pass and repass without let or hindrance'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``One consequence of this, so far as the law of public disorder is concerned, is that a procession is prima facie lawful, since the participants are merely exercising en masse rights that they possess individually, whereas a static meeting has a more questionable status.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Professor Smith concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``What saves the procession from the taint of illegality is that by custom processions for religious, political and other ceremonial and celebratory purposes are a time honoured use to which the highway is put, and are prima facie therefore a reasonable use of the highway''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that people in a procession are merely individuals operating en masse and have individual rights. The idea that they need to ask permission or obtain consent and publicise to the world what they will do is a contravention of those rights. We believe that people have an absolute right--almost--to march the Queen's highway.
<P>
There is authority for that, too, from the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), a distinctive member of the Social and Democratic Labour Party who said in 1987:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I wish to preserve the absolute right to make a peaceful protest for every single person in the north of Ireland.''--[Official Report, 10th March 1987; Vol. 112, c.233.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We entirely agree, although we are never too happy with the hon. Gentleman's words ``the north of Ireland'', as he has never found himself capable of addressing Northern Ireland as Northern Ireland, not the north of Ireland.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is specifically about the guidelines. I hope that he will stay close to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I believe that what I am saying is necessary to give my reasons for a very important amendment, Mr. Welsh. The Government's attitude to the amendment will in many ways decree the attitude of the people of Ulster to the Bill.
<P>
The amendment seeks to replace clause 7(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission may issue a determination in respect of a proposed public procession imposing on the persons organising or taking part in it such conditions as the Commission considers necessary.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an extremely wide power. The clause outlines the type of conditions that the commission can apply. Clause 7(6) lists
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``any public disorder or damage to property which may result from the procession;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) any disruption to the life of the community which the procession may cause;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (c) any impact which the procession may have on relationships within the community;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (d) any failure of a person of a description specified in the guidelines to comply with the Code of Conduct (whether in relation to the procession in question or any previous procession); and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (e) the desirability of allowing a procession customarily held along a particular route to be held along that route.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The powers of the commission are extensive and go far beyond anything that appears in British law.
<P>
It is ironic that the Labour party is introducing this Bill. When the public order Bill, as it then was, was passing through Parliament in 1986, the Labour Party opposed it lock, stock and barrel. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley)--who then represented Hammersmith--opposed the measure absolutely. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``However, it is important that the House should consider a further reason for that which is that, if several provisions in the order become law and are challenged in certain circumstances in Northern Ireland, it will almost certainly end up with the United Kingdom again being found guilty at the Court of Human Rights . . . If as a result of the inadequate supervision of the order through the House we are once again found wanting at the Court of Human Rights, sooner or later the Government will have to alter the legislation . . . The point that troubles me is one that troubled us before the Act was passed in Britain, and it occurs in article 4, which deals with imposing conditions on public processions and open-air meetings. Sub-paragraph (a) says,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `it may result in serious public order disorder . . . serious damage to property . . . serious disruption to the life of the community.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>Those people who followed the original Act through the House and much of the evidence that was given in Committee will know that the Association of Chief Officers of Police, when asked what it meant by<P>
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `serious disruption of the life of the community.'</UL></FONT><P>
<P>came up with the answer,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`A demonstration that can lead to buses being delayed and having to be re-routed.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>The danger of that definition is one of the matters to which we are open to challenge in the European Court. The European Court will accept restrictions on the right to demonstrate, the right of assembly and so on, but those restrictions have to be much more serious than a serious disruption to the life of the community, which can be interpreted as making shopping or travelling to and from work more difficult than it is normally . . . Imagine going to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and trying to define a position in which it was argued that people could not have the right of assembly, which is guaranteed in the human rights charter and in the United Nations charter, because it placed undue demands on the police or military forces.The Government could not conceivably expect to win that case, and if they cannot expect to win it they should not leave the order unamended. We shall have to change it, and it is no good having to change it in the way that I have described. ``--[Official Report, 10 March 1987; Vol. 112, c. 245-7.]<P>
<p>
Those statements, which were made by a leading member of the Labour party, show that the Labour party objected to further restrictions and did not support the Public Order Act 1986 or the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. Now that it is in power, it is strange that it should seek to impose far greater restrictions on the people of Northern Ireland--and it is doing so with impunity. It is seemingly unaware of--or it does not care about--the associated difficulties and dangers and public order consequences that will result from such restrictions.
<P>
Under British law and the European convention on human rights, the Government should not be able to impose further restrictions on legal marches except for reasons relating to security and public order. That is why I sought to amend the clause.
<P>
New clause 3 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the Commission having regard to the time or place at which and the circumstances in which any public procession is intended to be held and to its route or proposed route reasonably believes that the likely actions of those taking part in the parade... may result in serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community, or... the purpose of the persons organising it is the intimidation of others with a view of compelling them not to do an act they have a right to do, or do an act they have a right not to do... it may issue a determination imposing on the persons organising the procession such conditions as appear to it necessary to prevent such disorder, damage, disruption, or intimidation, including conditions as to route of the procession or prohibiting it from entering any public place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is taken directly from the 1986 Act and incorporate provisions in the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It may be difficult for the Government to defend some of the interpretations, such as serious disruption to the life of the community, before the European court. However, that is the law as set out in the 1986 Act and the 1987 order.
<P>
The Minister should note the significant change. It is no longer a police officer who makes the determination, but the commission. That determination will not be based on significant, wide and numerous criteria, but will be judged on public order criteria only. That goes a long way to satisfy what the Minister said about accepting the commission.
<P>
It is true that we do not like the commission. We do not accept its independence. However, the Government will force it on us whether we like it or not. That is typical of the way in which Governments govern Northern Ireland. If the commission's restrictions are limited to public order considerations only, as envisaged in the new clause, the Bill would become more acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland. Will the Minister seriously consider that?
<P>
The Minister said in our first sitting that it would be unsatisfactory for the commission to get to the stage where it had to impose conditions. He is placing a great deal of emphasis on so-called accommodation, mediation and agreement, but that may be difficult. If the Minister is prepared to give serious consideration to my proposed changes, the commission would be established and mediation could take place. However, if a determination is required, it will not be as extensive as envisaged in the Bill. The acceptance of the amendment would go a long way to help the situation in Northern Ireland.
<P>
We have heard much about confidence-building measures in Northern Ireland, but they have tended to favour a certain section of the community. The time may have come to give a confidence-building concession to the Unionist people of Northern Ireland. The Minister could do that by accepting this most reasonable amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been speaking to new clause 3, and I shall note that in relation to the rest of the debate. I intend to break for dinner at 7 pm and return at 8.30, but I am told that there may be a Division in the House at 8.30, and if there is, we shall reconvene at 8.45.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): Mr. Welsh--it is Mr. Welsh, is it not? I have been confused by the number of people who have called you Mr. Walsh during the day and wanted to put them right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I might explain that Walsh is the Irish version and Welsh is the English; the Scots version is also Welsh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The amendments are important, Mr. Welsh, because they go to the heart of the Bill, but I regret that we cannot accept either of them because they would change the Bill considerably. To deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for West Tyrone, who said that there was an absolute right to walk--almost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Peaceably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> There was an absolute right to walk--almost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Peaceably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> There was an absolute right to walk, almost, peaceably--that is a very important issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): We have been over this ground before, and there is no absolute right of any kind. There is no prohibition on walking peaceably. There is a distinction because one is a rightand the other is a common law freedom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> That is simply brilliant. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right--perhaps what he said could be added to my speech to save me from repeating it. There cannot be any sort of absolute right because if anyone asserts himself absolutely, one gets into the situation that the North report describes--I think in chapter 5--as ``Where Freedoms Collide''.
<P>
There are very important rights, but they are always likely to be moderated. In Northern Ireland, there are competing rights, and the Government are attempting to respect that situation. The Bill takes into account the desirability of free assembly and the Unionists' wish to march according to their tradition. However, that must be within a framework that recognises other rights.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone also spoke about the European commisson on human rights as if it were something new that had just been discovered and would have a major impact on the entire Bill. Of course, the ECHR has existed and has been accessible to the British public, but it is not accessible enough because one must go to Strasbourg to assert one's rights. We are returning those rights to the United Kingdom, so that they can be obtained in British, rather than European courts. We have always had to take account in legislation of the ECHR to which the United Kingdom has signed, and have always had to ensure--to save embarrassment later--that our practices were in line with the European convention. That is what we have done with regard to the Bill. We took advice on the implications of the ECHR and we are satisfied that nothing in the Bill is contrary to the convention. It has always been open to the Unionist community, the loyalist community and the Orange Order to assert their rights before the ECHR and to test what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> What the Minister is saying is somewhat irrelevant. We are saying that the new restrictions imposed by the Bill are contrary to the ECHR, and the Minister has not yet addressed that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I addressed the matter in the sentence before the hon. Gentleman intervened, when I said that we have taken legal advice and every other sort of advice on whether there is anything in the Bill that contravenes the ECHR. There is not. There is an obligation on the commission, as a public authority, to use its powers in a way that is compatible with the convention, and it can be held legally accountable to the convention. That is an important point to bear in mind.
<P>
The amendments would have a peculiar impact. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was speaking to amendment No. 215, which is linked to new clause 3, and would omit subsection (6) in lines 4 to 16 on page 5. It would not remove the guidelines which the commisson will have to employ; it would make them be less transferable. We need guidelines and we are trying in the Bill to make them transferable by removing them from the Bill. The Government believe that the people of Northern Ireland have the right to know how an important body such as the Parades Commission will exercise its functions. Amendment No. 215 would remove from public knowledge the way in which the commission exercises its functions. That is why the guidelines are public--they have been out to consultation for three months. That is also why we have included in the Bill provisions on what should be contained in the guidelines because the guidelines will set out what the Bill will mean on the ground.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 would revise the factors to be set out in the guidelines on the basis of which the commission will need to make its determinations. My hon. Friend the Member for South Down wants to remove the importance that the Bill gives to the desirability of a procession customarily held on a particular route being a big factor to be considered by the commission. The amendment would also introduce a two-tier aspect to the conditions being asked of the commission. Public order and property would become less important factors.
<P>
We believe that the North report got it right and that the factors need to be balanced. Clause 7(6) lists five factors to be taken into account. I must contradict my hon. Friend because they are not listed in order of priority; they are simply a list of factors, all of which must be taken into account in the particular circumstances of the parade concerned. I can imagine some circumstances in which some factors will weigh more heavily than others because of the nature of parades in certain locations. If organisers have failed to comply with the code of conduct in the past, that would loom high for the commission. We believe that it would be wrong to have, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Down has said, a particular regard to some factors in certain circumstances, while in other circumstances only a general regard is necessary.
<P>
I think that I have covered most of the points that the amendments raise. However, the introduction of the criterion of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``demand on police and military resources''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in amendment No. 68 is, we feel, an inappropriate matter for the commission to consider. It should be a matter for the Government. It would be wrong for the commission to make decisions on the allocation of or appropriateness of resources.
<P>
We would not want to reach a situation, as implied by the hon. Member for West Tyrone, in which might is right, or in which those who are seen as having more force or power get their way. We regard that as a fundamental flaw in the present public order order. Public order should not be the sole consideration, which it is in the present circumstances. We must acknowledge the desirability, for instance, of allowing a procession that is customarily held along a particular route to be held on that route. That should be asserted, while being balanced with other issues. We therefore reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We shall reconvene at 8.30. If there is a vote at 8.30, we shall reconvene at 8.45.

On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> May I say in response to what has been said about new clause 3 that I am disappointed that the Government have not thought it right or prudent to take it on board? It proffered them a significant olive leaf. However, it appears that, through their intransigence and arrogance, the Government do not want an accommodation on this matter. When things start to go wrong in the Province, as they inevitably will under the Bill, the Government will hold full responsibility for what happens. I do not think anything more that is useful can be said now.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> On amendment No. 68, the Minister carefully made the point that the order of the paragraphs does not reflect the order in which they should be considered. They all stand pari passu together--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. Something is amiss on the other side of the Room.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I believe that the heating has just come on. That might be a good thing. We will have it checked.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Before I was rudely interrupted, I was saying that the paragraph in the amendment that the Minister called most deeply into question and singled out was that which related to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any undue demand on police and military resources''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He said that he would not take cognisance of that proposal because the commission would then be making decisions on police and military matters. That is not so.
<P>
I assume that the Chief Constable will give the commission advice and that it would be appropriate for the commission to take his opinion into consideration. It would not take decisions on police or military matters, but it would take account of what the Chief Constable, if he so wished, said to it. Taking such advice into consideration is an important aspect of the decision-making process. However, the Minister seemed to think that advice should not be considered by, or even be made known to, the commission. That is strange.
<P>
However, as the Minister said that paragraphs (a) to (e) in the amendment--but with the exception of (d)--rate equal consideration, I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. Given where amendment No. 229 stands in the scheme of things, I do not propose to move it. [Interruption.] This is a form of intimidation.

<P>
(a) prohibiting, for such period not exceeding 28 days as may be specified in the order, the holding in that area or place of all public processions or such classes of public procession as may be so specified; or
<P>
(b) permitting the holding in an area or place of a public procession specified in the order and prohibiting, for such period not exceeding one month as may be specified in the order, the holding in that area or place of any other public procession or of any class of public procession specified in the order.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Thompson:</B> This clause is an important part of the Bill as it deals with the powers of the Secretary of State. If the Bill is enacted the Secretary of State will have the greatest powers of any Secretary of State in the United Kingdom. The legal position has been that the Secretary of State could not unilaterally take a decision to ban a parade. He had to be approached by the police chief, who would tell him that he was unable to keep law and order despite the powers that he had exercised under article 4 of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987.
<P>
One of the important factors was that the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could never ban a parade because it meant that they could be accused of political interference and taking decisions because of political matters. That has always been one of the aspects of British legislation. Indeed, the Secretary of State did not have the power even in that instance to ban a particular parade. The Secretary of State only had power to ban all parades from a particular route or a so-called class of parades from a particular route. The Secretary of State never had the power to ban a single parade.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State dictatorial powers. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If, in the case of any proposed public procession, the Secretary of State is of the opinion''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that any ``serious public disorder'', ``serious disruption'' or ``serious impact'' may be made on the community, or any ``undue demands'' may be placed on the police, if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is necessary in the public interest to do so, he may by order prohibit the holding of that procession.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A dramatic power is being conferred on the Secretary of State, which should not be allowed in any democracy. That is why I have proposed new clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> Is it not the case that the Secretary of State for Scotland has similar if not identical powers to ban marches anywhere in Scotland, if he thinks fit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That is not the case in Scotland. There, application is made to the local council which, in certain circumstances, can ban a parade. In that instance, the people who want to hold the parade have a right of appeal to a judge--or whoever it is in Scotland--and to a higher court regarding a question of law. That situation is not comparable to the Secretary of State's powers in Northern Ireland. Under the legislation the Secretary of State will take a decision and that will be it. There will be no appeal comparable to what exists in Scotland.
<P>
To deal with the Secretary of State's dramatic powers, I have proposed new clause 4, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If at any time the Secretary of State is of the opinion, in consequence of information furnished to him by the Chief Constable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, it must be initiated by the police, not by the Secretary of State of her own volition, which is an important safeguard. It will be a public order matter rather than being at the whim of some Secretary of State who may not like parades and who may seek to ban them for political reasons.
<P>
The new clause also provides under paragraph (a) for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prohibiting, for such period not exceeding 28 days as may be specified in the order, the holding in that area or place of all public processions or such classes of public procession as may be so specified''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, if the Secretary of State wants to ban a particular parade, all such classes of parade in a particular geographical area will have to be banned. Even that may be subject to European legislation. Under paragraph (b), it is possible to permit the holding of one parade but ban other parades. The new clause makes the Bill more effective in comparison with England, Wales and Scotland.
<P>
The Secretary of State's powers are dictatorial. It would be extremely serious if the Secretary of State were to seek, without proper consultation with and notification from the police, to ban any single parade. That would open the Secretary of State to the charge of political intervention.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is very strange. The Labour party should stand for liberty and freedom and for the restriction of laws that are imposed on the people, yet the new Government have introduced many measures and imposed them on the majority of the people of Northern Ireland without their consent. So much for Labour principles and for what Labour has stood for in the past. In Opposition, Labour Members always spoke against restrictions of this sort. They said that the restrictions in the 1987 legislation were so severe that they would amend them or do away with them when they came into office. They are now imposing far more severe restrictions on the people of Northern Ireland. It is a disgrace and a terrible reflection on the historic principles of the Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was anticipating that we would receive the wisdom of the hon. Member for East Londonderry, but I see that he is collecting his notes together, so perhaps he will speak after me.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone tabled amendments Nos. 233 and 234 and new clause 4. He argued that they would replace the existing provisions with a banning power based only on public order grounds. The North report recommended that the Secretary of State should also be able to take into account the wider impact of a parade on the community. As my colleagues and I have said in earlier debates, the Government fully support the report's recommendations, which are reflected in the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 236 and 237 would create considerable confusion. The hon. Member for West Tyrone seeks to delete provisions that make it clear that the banning order supersedes any previous determinations by the commission. It is desirable that the Bill should include those provisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 would remove the requirement that the Secretary of State should consult the Chief Constable. That would be ridiculous. It would be nonsense for the Secretary of State not to consult the Chief Constable, who is able to give the best advice on matters relating to public order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I accept the Minister's arguments. Why not put those matters in the Bill? Legislation in Scotland and in England includes the provision that such matters should be decided by the Secretary of State. The Minister has said that decisions about banning orders would not be made without consultation with the Chief Constable. Why not include that in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am a bit lost. I might be missing the point. My understanding of amendment No. 235 is that it would remove the requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> My amendment includes the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State is of the opinion, in consequence of information furnished to him by the Chief Constable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Secretary of State can act only in consequence of information furnished to him by the Chief Constable. The Bill says that that is not necessary and that the Secretary of State can ban a parade, of her own volition, without consultation with, or without any information from, the Chief Constable. That is an intolerable situation. If no Secretary of State would make such a decision without the input of the Chief Constable, why should not the Bill provide for that?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is referring to new clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Of course, Mr. Welsh. Clause 10(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Wherever practicable the Secretary of State shall before making an order under this section consult . . . the Commission; the Chief Constable; and the committee of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I may be missing the hon. Gentleman's point. I shall write to him and other members of the Committee to explain the background to the provision. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, he will have an opportunity to return to the matter on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Without wishing to put words into the mouth of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone, I believe that he means that, hitherto, the Secretary of State has relied implicitly on the Chief Constable to state publicly the reasons for a decision on whether a parade should take place. Subsection (5) states that the Secretary of State will ``consult''. Under the Bill, we will never know what advice the Chief Constable gives the Secretary of State. In the case of a political decision, the Chief Constable will be told to keep mum. That is fundamentally different from the current position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful for that helpful explanation. My mind must be confused because I have clearly missed some points in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The matter goes further than the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) suggested. In the past, banning could occur only at the instigation of the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable could not ask the Secretary of State to ban one particular parade, but he could ask for several parades that used a specific route to be banned. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State can decide, of his or her own volition, to ban a single parade. That is a tremendous difference, which means that the Secretary of State can make a political decision to ban a parade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps I can explain. I shall deal first with the point of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. Current legislation does not provide for making public the Chief Constable's advice. To reply to the hon. Member for West Tyrone, the Secretary of State does not have to rely on the Chief Constable's advice in order to ban; she can do that without any input from the Chief Constable.
<P>
The clause tries to reflect as accurately as possible the main thrust of the North report. The hon. Members for West Tyrone and for East Londonderry believe that we are hiding behind the North report. I reiterate the defence for that report, which was an in-depth study carried out under the previous Administration, and which enjoyed support in the wider community.
<P>
It was always inevitable that the report would find its way into statute, provided it could be approved by both Houses of Parliament, either under the previous Administration or the incoming Labour Government. The Government's intentions were always clear and it would have been helpful if the necessary measures had been set up earlier. We would then have been better placed to deal with the forthcoming marching season because of our experience of the previous year. The Parades Commission will be starting fresh upon that experience and we can only wish it well with a difficult job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister is now getting a little political--if not a great deal so. I want to give him time to obtain the answer from his officials, but perhaps he would tell the Committee what part of the North report contains the recommendation that the powers of prohibition should be the Secretary of State's? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will find it as quickly as he can. I shall give him plenty of time and keep talking so that he can get the note, but I can find no such recommendation that the Secretary of State should for the first time enjoy those fundamental powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is a very comprehensive report in which to try to find the item to which the hon. Gentleman refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is not just the Minister, but his officials, who are having difficulty. My goodness, it is not even in the body of the report; it is in a footnote on the back page.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Of course, the proposed powers of the Secretary of State are no greater than those in current legislation. Paragraph 36 of the summary of recommendations, on page 211 of the report, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We recommend that no change to Article 5 of the 1987 Order is necessary, other than the amendment to the statutory criteria proposed in recommendation 14.``<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not a new recommendation by North.
<P>
<B>Helen Jackson </B>(Sheffield, Hillsborough): It is supporting the status quo.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As my hon. Friend says, it is supporting the status quo. What I have referred to is not a full examination of the question, but North has accepted the existing state of affairs and recommended it accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Is not one of the purposes of the legislative change to shift the relevant powers to a body that will, it is hoped, command vast cross-community support? How does the Minister see that as compatible with maintaining the status quo? The status quo with respect to the powers of the Secretary of State appears different from that in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are not dealing with other parts of the United Kingdom when we debate Northern Ireland matters; we are talking about highly specific circumstances that apply there. Some of the legislation that has developed in Northern Ireland--some of it recently--has been intended to deal with its specific problems.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) will know that there are many differences between Scottish law and English and Welsh law because of the difference between the two legislative frameworks. There is not a unified body of law for the United Kingdom. There will be variations and differences. In Northern Ireland, experiences and events have created a demand for a different legislative approach. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I do not think there is much more to be said about the amendments and the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for West Tyrone. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment, but if he does not do so I ask the Committee to reject it. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that conversations and sedentary interventions do not help the debate. I ask hon. Members to comply in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I certainly take on board what you have said, Mr. Welsh. I am often guilty of making sedentary interventions, especially when a lot of nonsense is being talked, which happens frequently in this Committee. [Interruption.] There we go again. One can move these folk to react, but unfortunately not in a wise or sensible way.
<P>
I shall speak to amendment No. 207, the first of several in my name, which would delete lines 24 and 25. It relates to the issue of undue demands which the procession may cause to be made on the police or military forces. There is no definition in the Bill of the term ``undue demands''. Perhaps the Minister, who must have considered these matters in great detail before producing the Bill, has some sort of criteria by which we can judge whether there are undue demands. Of course, it might be the counter demonstration that is creating undue demands--whatever they are--on the police and the military forces. The Minister said earlier that there is no such thing as a counter demonstration; it is another demonstration or procession. If I recall it correctly, he said in the early sittings of this Committee that a procession is a procession, whether or not it is the initial one or the one organised to oppose it. In such circumstances we should remember that it is not the original procession that may cause undue demands. However, I would like to know what is meant by ``undue demands''.
<P>
Amendment no. 209 would delete lines 28 and 29, which read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any area and any period of time not exceeding 28 days''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am curious to know why the period of 28 days has been decided upon. It simply means that a band could submit another application on the 29th day or on any following day. Stating the period suggested would be an invitation to some people to create mayhem.
<P>
The Minister should recall that under the 1951 legislation processions could be banned for a period of up to three months. It was during such a long period of processions that the events of January 1972 took place. A blanket ban had been imposed to stop confrontations, which the loyalist organisations accepted. There was opposition to the existence of the Northern Ireland state. All that led to the horrendous events in Londonderry on that day. Twenty-eight days is probably a long enough period, but I am curious to know why the Government have decided on that. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me why. I notice that the clause applies ``to any area'', so we must assume that that could encompass the whole of Northern Ireland if the Secretary of State so desired.
<P>
Amendment No. 129 uses the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in relation to that area''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder whether ``that area'' is the correct description. My amendment refers to ``any designated area'' because something more precise is required, as the term ``that area'' might limit the Secretary of State to the area where the first procession was to be held, rather than road B instead of road A, with the whole process having to be gone through again. Perhaps the Minister will let us have some thoughts on why the Government used the term ``that area'' rather than ``any designed area'' or something more precise. It is better to be more precise.
<P>
Amendment No. 130 would in essence remove the whole sequence of events that may occur relative to the holding of all public processions. Amendment No. 172 reverts to non-traditional public processions. Essentially I am saying that these powers should apply only to a completely new procession--to a coat-trailing exercise which, as I have said, would cover events that ventured into a new area, for example, an extension of an existing procession--a point which exercised the hon. Member for South Down during previous debates and earlier today. That might bring us to a much wiser way of dealing with these matters.
<P>
At present, the Secretary of State can simply ban any public procession--not on the basis that those who participate in it will cause trouble, but because others may do so. I make no apology for saying that hon. Members who have heard me throughout our debates know that I believe that that is where one of the Bill's main problems lies. It is much easier to allow all existing processions. If restrictions are to be put on any processions, they should apply to new processions and extensions to existing ones where it is intended that they should go into areas where they are unwelcome.
<P>
My amendments are sensible in that they ask a number of questions that should be asked. If the Minister initially feels that he cannot accept amendment No. 172, he should reconsider carefully, after which he will surely see that I am proposing the wisest way of proceeding. Of course, it might mean a retraction of undertakings given publicly or privately to those who have opposed Orange processions, because of keeping them in the talks. But as these people are busy murdering every day, and as other elements such as the so-called Protestant paramilitaries are also busy murdering people, it seems that there will be some difficulty justifying thier representatives being kept in the talks process.
<P>
Many of the foundation stones on which this edifice has been erected have been blown away this week, so the sooner the Government recognise the truth of what I am saying, the better for us all. The rest of amendment No. 172 simply repeats, to a large extent, what was said about subsections (1) and (2) of the clause. If the Government were wise enough to consider what I am saying, they would realise the force of my argument and the good results that could be achieved. I am the first to confess that they will not immediately appear--it will take time for them to work through the system--but it would certainly be a far sounder foundation than what is in the Bill as it stands.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone has already spoken to the amendment, but I should like to hear answers to the questions that I have posed on amendments Nos. 207, 209 and 129, never mind amendment No. 172. No. 130 is consequential on amendment No. 172.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal with the point about the phrases ``undue demands'' and ``in that area'' as they appear in clause 10, and which have caused the hon. Member for East Londonderry some concern. The relevant phrases that apply are a straight lift from the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, so it is a translation from existing legislation that has been tried and tested. There was no justification to amend the spirit and intention of that order. The hon. Gentleman raised a point what I had said earlier about counter demonstrations. If I heard him correctly, he was interpreting what I said as being that a counter demonstration is the same as a procession. I have not had time to look at my exact words, but I said that a procession is a procession is a procession. That is clearly understood. I also said that people would know what a counter demonstration was when they saw it, but that the definition of a counter demonstration was when they saw it, but that the definition of a counter demonstration would prove to be the difficulty. We had a detailed debate about that aspect of the Bill and I said that I would consider the points that were raised and examine the weight of the argument to see whether we could find ways of dealing with some of the specific issues. I think that the hon. Member for East Londonderry was paraphrasing what I said. That is my recollection of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I was not paraphrasing what the Minister said. If a procession is a procession is a procession and he is now saying that there is a difference between that and a counter procession or a counter demonstration, will he tell us what difference he perceives?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have just done that. In that particular debate, we were trying to define a counter demonstration. I said that everyone would know what a demonstration or a counter demonstration was when they saw it and that I was not minded to put a definition in the Bill. However, I said that I would consider the strength of the arguments and would return to the matter on Report, if necessary. Hon. Members also have the right to return to the matter.
<P>
There is a self-contradictory element in amendments Nos. 207 and 172 because the hon. Member for East Londonderry is trying to remove the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``undue demands . . . on the police or military forces''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In one amendment, the hon. Gentleman argues that that measure is undesirable, but in amendment No. 172, he wants to write that provision back in. Therefore, he must be supporting the need and purpose of the measure. He may have done what the Government have done, which is to recognise the provisions of the 1987 order, which he is transferring across.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 129, the period of 28 days is included because the period within which a ban can be imposed must be the same as the period within which the Secretary of State believes that there is a danger of disorder, disruption and the other factors that she must take into account.
<P>
As I understand the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, it would, in theory, allow parades to be banned over a different period, in which there was no threat of disorder. That cannot be what he intended. We have tried to make the time scales compatible, but the amendment would change that, making the period indefinite and less well defined, which would not be helpful.
<P>
The overall thrust of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, if I interpret his amendments correctly, is to reduce the Secretary of State's power to ban parades, so that it would apply only to individual parades--it would take away the power to impose so-called blanket bans. The hon. Gentleman reminded the Committee that the Stormont Assembly, which was Unionist controlled, imposed a blanket ban in 1972, so obviously the Unionists once thought that blanket bans could produce important gains. That was a long time ago, but direct rule was imposed soon afterwards, on the back of some of the unfortunate experiences that Northern Ireland faced at that time.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendments would restrict the Secretary of State's power to ban public processions, so that it covered non-traditional parades only. Under the amendments, it would be impossible to ban a traditional parade in any circumstances, which runs contrary to the spirit and recommendations of the North report. I believe that it would be dangerous to accept the amendments, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> What the Minister has said clarifies one thing--that he does not know what is in the Bill. Throughout the Committee's proceedings he has hidden behind the North report, saying that everything in the Bill is according to North, as if it were God speaking. He has failed to deal with the more important issues, in that many of the report's recommendations go completely against the principles that the Labour party has always advocated.
<P>
Now the Minister has gone even further and introduced to the Bill something that is not in North. According to North, the only change that needed to be made to existing legislation was the addition of a provision to cover the extra elements that the commission has to take into account in making a determination. The Bill goes further than that. It removes the stipulation from the 1987 legislation that those decisions must be made under the responsibility and advice of the Chief Constable.
<P>
Furthermore, the Minister has added another stipulation: that the Secretary of State can now ban a single parade. The Secretary of State never had that power before. The Minister must explain why he maintains that only a simple change is being made to the article in the 1987 order, following the recommendation of the report, when, in fact, the clause represents a major change.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred to the United Kingdom. Am I right to say that the Minister said that Northern Ireland was not part of the United Kingdom? We must read Hansard to find out exactly what was said.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman) that, in Scotland, under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, the council may ban a parade.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consulting the chief constable in respect of a procession notice of which notice has been given or falls to be treated as having been given'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That Act then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An appeal to the sheriff shall lie at the instance of a person who, in accordance with section 62 of this Act, has or falls to be treated as having given notice | An appeal under this section shall be made by way of summary application''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the sheriff. In other words, there is an appeal to the sheriff. Even after that, there is a right of appeal in law to a higher court. However, all that can be done only after consulting the police. In England, that power can be taken only on the insistance of the police. The Bill changes all that in another part of the United Kingdom and goes far further than the existing article under the 1987 order. The Minister need no longer hide behind the report, but say that the Government have taken even more powers than were recommended in the report.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response to the ponts that I made. I am surprised, as was my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone, to discover that he was unable to give us, among other things, a definition of ``undue demands''. ``Undue demands'' could be objective or subjective. I am unclear as to whether there is any objective measure of ``undue demands'' the Secretary of State, the police or the Army can say that too great a demand is being made because one or two other processions are taking place and, therefore, they can ban everything else in sight. If the Minister is serious in trying to give an answer, he should tell me exactly what ``undue demands'' means and how the decision will be taken at any given time.
<P>
I think that the Minister was mischievous to say that I was arguing against the amendment. He said that the amendment would remove part of the Bill only to insert it in another place. All I ask him to do is to define the term ``undue demands''. If I am satisfied with his explanation, I should be happier with the Bill. As I have heard no explanation, I am beginning to wonder whether one is available.
<P>
As well as hiding behind the North report, the Minister has hidden behind the fact that certain terms were contained in the 1987 order. The Unionist parties in Northern Ireland ferociously opposed the 1987 order, and the hon. Gentleman's party was not especially helpful then. After all, that order changed the onus from marchers having a democratic right to carry on with their procession to encouraging the fellow down the street to come out and stop them. That was the fundamental flaw in that order. We opposed it during its passage to the statute book and afterwards in order to highlight what we thought was wrong. It has resulted in confrontations in the street, so we contend that our opposition to the 1987 order was absolutely correct, and has been proven so by the consequences that have flowed from it.
<P>
If the Minister, who is sitting smiling, does not understand that, he should take a far closer look at how matters have developed since then. The Bill contains an incitement for people to oppose processions. The police, even more than under the 1987 order, will say, ``who has the most marchers?'' and will bow to that. That is surrendering the streets to the biggest mob, and I do not believe in doing that.
<P>
The real reason that such a situation has been the norm in one form or another during the past 25 or 30 years is because of an armed terrorist insurrection against the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. All that the Bill is trying to deal with is but a symptom of that--there has been a failure to deal with that root cause from the inception of the present struggle in Ulster. You may think that I am wandering far from the amendments, Mr. Welsh, but I am setting out the background to the Bill and the consequences of what has gone before it. I hope that the Minister will take on board what I have said and that he will be able to give me a better answer.
<P>
I do not read amendment No. 129 in the way that the Minister appears to read it. It represents a demand that the area be precisely designated, so that any blanket ban that is imposed in an area clearly delineates that area, rather than applying simply to ``that area''. An area must be specified for any ban, unless it is to cover the whole of the Province.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal with some of the facetious points made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone about Labour party principles. However, I shall not be tempted too far down that route because we are dealing not with clause 4, but with clause 10. The point made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone was that somehow or other the Bill is incompatible with the fine traditions of the Labour party. I do not know how the hon. Gentleman comes to that judgment. I should not have thought that he had much knowledge of the fine traditions of the Labour party, not being a member of it and not having given sustenance or support to it. The conscience of Labour Members of Parliament will not be slighted in any way by the Bill.
<P>
To clarify one point, the hon. Member for West Tyrone gave the impression that I had said--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should like the debate to continue in good order. The Minister has the Floor; I would appreciate being able to hear what he has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Thank you, Mr. Welsh. The hon. Member for West Tyrone suggested that at some point I had said that Northern Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom. That is not what I said. I was explaining that it is a different part of the United Kingdom. There is no point my trying to remember my precise words, because they will not come out in exactly the same way as they did when I responded to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but the hon. Member for West Tyrone can read exactly what I said in the Official Report. I know that he would take the view that Northern Ireland is a different part of the United Kingdom from Scotland, Wales and England--an odd bit of the country that I keep forgetting. My point was that legislation has grown up differently because different circumstances apply.
<P>
The hon. Members for East Londonderry and for West Tyrone have said constantly that the powers in clause 10 are greater than those in place previously. That is a matter of judgment. I would say that they are different, not greater. As before, the Secretary of State can exercise her powers on the basis of advice from the Chief Constable, or of her own judgment. The power to ban individual parades is a lesser power than that of imposing blanket bans. The maximum ban is now less than that contained in the 1987 order.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I want to consider the point of view of Ulster Unionist Members. One has to remember that, although it has individual characteristics, the system of law in Northern Ireland is derived from common law. To that extent, it bears far more resemblance to the Welsh and English systems than to the Scots. I would not seek to pronounce on Scots law because I am aware of its differences, but it has certain freedoms. Because of the peculiar conditions in Northern Ireland, that is what I might describe--the Minister might concur--as a pro-consular provision, giving powers to the Secretary of State that, in an ordinary setting of people enjoying freedom under the law, would be unusual. It might be hoped that as matters progress, it could be kept under review because in so far as the legislation aims to bring about a normalisation of something that might usually be a matter for the Commission and the Chief Constable, the way in which the clause operates--I accept that it has operated in that way for some time because it reflects the problems in Northern Ireland--is nevertheless a departure from the practice in other common law jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman intended to be helpful, but because the phrase ``pro-consular powers'' has connotations that different people could interpret differently, I shall take advice before saying that I agree with everything that he said. The point was made in previous debates that legislation will always be kept under review; that was also one of the hon. Gentleman's arguments. Any Government worth their salt would do that, especially where new legislation is being introduced and where the experience on the ground may change dramatically.
<P>
If a normal society prevailed in Northern Ireland in the future--there may not be any need for a Parades Commission--``normal'' in the sense that no great disputes or contentious issues arise that, sadly, result in many people being injured and killed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I should like to follow the useful intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. The point is not that we are considering a reworking of the 1987 legislation but whether any previous Secretary of State exercised the powers that were incumbent upon or available to him or her under that legislation. The question for the future is whether those fairly onerous powers will be used by an incumbent of the office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The powers were used once in recent years, in 1996, at the time of the march around Londonderry's walls. That power was exercised by the Secretary of State--
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Once.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is what I am advised. The powers are severe, and it is always desirable to try to avoid exercising them. That is why we are putting in place the Parades Commission and why we are trying to take a different approach. North came up with his recommendations to try to find a new, different way forward because what has happened in the past has been damaging to Northern Ireland. We therefore have to find a new framework, strategy and approach that can help to achieve a better situation in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry has left his place but he asked me about the definition of undue demands. He could have extended his point to any one of the subsections and asked me to define ``serious'' in 10(1)(a), (b) and (c) and 10(2)(a), (b) and (c). Clearly, the use of phrases such as ``serious'' or ``undue demands'' are matters for the Secretary of State to decide in the circumstances of particular cases. When the hon. Gentleman proposes including the word ``reasonably'' in certain clauses, what does he mean by ``reasonably''? That must be judged by the person making the decision at the time.
<P>
Under subsection (1)(d)--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``undue demands which the procession may cause to be made on the police or military forces''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding are the best people to give operational advice, and in making an assessment they would be required to consult the people on the ground. What constitute ``undue demands'' must be determined by those who have full knowledge of what is likely to happen, taking into account the forces that they can deploy.
<P>
Any Secretary of State would have to take such decisions. Sometimes that may be easy, but in my experience at Drumcree last year, assessing what was happening daily up to the 11th hour was very difficult. Very tough decisions had to be taken and fine judgments made. In that case, the decision was made by the Chief Constable. I cannot divulge everything that was said at the time, but there was a great flow of debate about what each section of the legislation meant, how it was to be interpreted and its implications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I should like to return the Minister to what he was saying about the difference between the Bill and the 1987 order, because I believe that he acknowledged that there was a difference. That contravenes the recommendations in the report. However, I must congratulate him on the ingenuity of his reasoning in defending the banning of a particular parade. His argument is that if one has the power to ban many parades, one has a lesser power if one can ban only one parade. The reason why a single parade cannot be banned in the United Kingdom is because it would leave the Secretary of State wide open to the allegation that he acted for political reasons. That is why there has never been such a power in Britain.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I make a plea for shorter interventions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> This is a significant additional power and that is why we object to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman has done no more than restate arguments that have already been advanced, showing his total opposition to the aims of the Bill. We had a Second Reading debate and an earlier debate in Committee on some of those issues and principles, which I do not want to repeat because you, Mr. Welsh, would call me to order.
<P>
I have tried to answer the points that have been made. I am sorry that the hon. Member for East Londonderry was not in his place when I explained the reasoning behind the phrase ``undue demands'', but I shall not repeat that either. On the basis of the explanation that I have given, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I shall read with great interest what the Minister said as soon as the Offical Report is published. I hear what he says and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment standing in my name.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is in the name of Mr. Thompson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Welsh. I have been so used to withdrawing amendments in the past few days.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> This is a small group of amendments; it is clear what they mean. I want to ensure that the commission and the Secretary of State have to justify their decisions to Members of Parliament representing Northern Ireland constituencies. If the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Home Secretary had to ban a parade, they would not do it without a discussion or without giving some information to Members of Parliament representing Scotland or the rest of the UK. Given the direct rule under which we suffer in Northern Ireland, my request is very reasonable. All we are asking is to be consulted.
<P>
Amendment No. 167 would insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and other persons and organisations as appear to be affected by such prohibition.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a reasonable request. If the Secretary of State believes that it is necessary to ban a procession for one of the reasons set out earlier in the clause, she should be prepared to defend that decision to those who wish to process. The organisations involved would often be fairly responsible. The Secretary of State was able to talk to some persons in prison a week or so ago to see whether she could make them behave. Her decision on whether a procession should go ahead could lead to violence and serious disruption. It could have a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``serious impact... on relationships within the community''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and place
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``undue demands... on the police or military forces''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It could lead to ``serious damage to property''.
<P>
I would have thought that in such grave circumstances the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would have been happy to enjoy the support of Members of Parliament representing Northern Ireland. What has she to fear from such consultation? Why should not the Government accept this reasonable amendment? The hon. Member for South Down believes that the Secretary of State should talk to other people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> The question of giving Members of Parliament the right to be consulted is interesting. What about local authority representatives?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Of course, but there are a great many local authority representatives. The Secretary of State would find it a profitable exercise to consult the local authority in Portadown.
<P>
As some of the processions draw their supporters from far away--some people travel 30 or 40 miles to be insulted by an Orange procession going past--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If hon. Members wish to continue their conversation, they must withdraw from the Committee.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Thank you, Mr. Welsh.
<P>
In such circumstances, all Members of Parliament could be consulted and could put the views of their constituents. Why not? We are encouraged to talk to each other right, left and centre. Indeed, I would have thought that such an idea could have been discussed in the forum. The SDLP, however, does not want an elected body in Northern Ireland and apparently refuses to take part in the forum or to talk to people. I sometimes wonder whether that is because it is frightened that lesser known groups might reach agreement with Unionist politicians--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I was explaining the background, Mr. Welsh, which is always worthwhile. Some of us are not going home tonight, so why should we worry?
<P>
I notice that the hon. Gentleman who speaks for the official Opposition, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, wants to bring in at least one of the groups to which amendment No. 167 refers, so it would seem that I enjoy cross-party support and that the hon. Member for South Down goes part of the way with me.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 refers to schedule 2 and would require the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consult with the Members of Parliament representing Northern Ireland before laying''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the draft instrument. I am not sure what sort of instrument is referred to, but at an earlier sitting we discussed instruments covering the code of conduct, procedural rules and the guidelines. The Secretary of State should have some discussion with Members of Parliament from Northern Ireland before laying such important documents. Surely that would be conducive to good relations between Northern Ireland Members and the Government. It was stated earlier that the Secretary of State wants to consult everyone in sight. This important Bill covers important issues but Members of Parliament are being treated as if they were mere children and unworthy of any consideration.
<P>
We have the opportunity to discuss the matter in Committee, but the problem is that the code of conduct, rules, guidelines and so on are still in draft form, and from what the Minister said it seems that this is our only chance of discussing them. I would have hoped that the Secretary of State would be prepared to have meetings with Members of Parliament, if only in private, to hear their views. Why should that not be done?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and perhaps take on board those tabled by other hon. Members on this general issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I tabled amendment No. 73. Clause 8(5) states that any amendment of an order by the Secretary of State shall be deemed to be an amendment by the commission. By a quirk of the Committee's procedure, I did not have an opportunity to argue the matter when amendment No. 71 was discussed, and presumably I shall not be allowed to do so now. Mine is a probing amendment because clause 10(5)(c) contains the first reference to consultation being made to the committee of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. It is a mystery to me that the Bill should suddenly require the authority to be consulted.
<P>
The Police Authority for Northern Ireland does not have a great reputation for operating effectively in any of its fields of competence. In fact, it is a nonentity with regard to policing in Northern Ireland as far as I am concerned. The requirement on the Secretary of State to consult is mandatory. Clause 10(5) states that the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall before making an order . . . consult . . . the Commission''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the Chief Constable. I understand both of those requirements, but for the life of me I do not understand why it goes on to say that he or she must also consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the committee of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain that? Amendment No. 73 would delete that paragraph from the Bill and empower the Secretary of State to consult ``such person or persons'' whom he or she thinks it would be valuable to consult. Subject to an explanation of the intrusion of the Police Authority, I recommend the proposals to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I seek your guidance, Mr. Welsh, about amendment No. 105, which is in my name. Does the fact that it uses the words ``counter demonstration'' mean that it should have been considered in our debate on clause 1, when we discussed the implications of counter-demonstrations in relation to all the clauses? I am happy to detain the Committee for a few minutes to discuss that matter. The use of the phrase ``counter demonstration'' relates more to our earlier debate about counter-demonstrations and protests, and it is more in keeping with the amendments that we considered then than with those with which it is grouped. The amendment does not refer only to the group representing the organisers of a public procession, and I feel that I cannot discuss it only in relation to clause 10.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman's assistance is appreciated.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I have just examined carefully the amendment that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire discussed--likewise, the hon. Gentleman pays close attention to my amendments. Sometimes when one looks at the wood one does not see the individual trees, and I fell into that error on this occasion. I know exactly what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do: his aim is the same as mine in amendment No. 167. If he reconsiders the matter, he will realise that amendment No. 105 should refer to the end of line 14 rather than to line 18.
<P>
The amendment that is in the name of the hon. Member for South Down is very different because it relates to the committee of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. I understand that there is such a committee, which met last year during the disturbances at Drumcree. Did that committee properly reflect the balance of the communities in Northern Ireland? What is the Government's view of that committee's role in relation to other proposed changes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendments would considerably extend the Secretary of State's duty to consult before prohibiting a public procession. The Bill's flavour has been one of consultation from beginning to end. The North team undertook extensive consultation while it was building up its knowledge and collecting the evidence that later found its way into the report.
<P>
Previous Governments and this one have had an ethos of considerable consultation. The attempts that I and ministerial colleagues make to consult a wide range of opinion in Northern Ireland seem never-ending. That includes elected representatives, church leaders and so on, and it is important that Ministers engage with wide cross-sections of opinion in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Consultation is an important feature of the Bill. We could have done it through Order in Council, but decided that that was not desirable. The Bill is going through both Houses of Parliament so that it can be examined and debated. There are clearly deep-seated concerns about what the Bill tries to achieve.
<P>
There is an ethos of consultation among the North team and the Government, but there is a limit and there are times when consultation is not practical. In those circumstances, the Secretary of State might decide to ban a parade. If there is a tight time scale, decisions must be taken. If everyone suggested by the amendments had to be consulted, what would happen--I ask the hon. Member for East Londonderry--if a Member of Parliament could not be found?
<P>
I can say without contradiction that Ministers make many attempts to consult when a decision has been taken and an announcement is ready to be made, and find it difficult to do so for good reasons. Perhaps a Member is in his or her constituency, but he or she may be in London or elsewhere. How do we consult a Member who is abroad? Decisions may be needed quickly. If there was a requirement to consult but we could not, would that negate the decision?
<P>
There is a clear obligation on the Secretary of State to consult the commission because it will make the original determination. The Chief Constable will be consulted, for obvious reasons. The Committee of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland is covered in the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Wherever practicable, the Secretary of State shall, before making an order''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under the relevant paragraph
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consult the Committee of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same phraseology is used in clause 10(5) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Wherever practicable the Secretary of State shall before making an order under this section consult''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the various bodies that I have mentioned. The words ``wherever practicable'' show that there are some difficulties in consulting those immediately concerned with decisions when we deal with tight time scales.
<P>
At Drumcree last year, the public order committee was consulted. I cannot answer the hon. Member for East Londonderry on who was there that evening; I do not know off the top of my head and I do not know whether that information can be divulged as it may be affected by other parts of the legislation. The hon. Gentleman asked about balance and whether the balance of cross-community interests was reflected. We are trying to make the Police Authority as broadly reflective as possible of opinion in Northern Ireland. This is as much about whether people are willing to serve on the body as about who the Government appoints to it. If more people representing Northern Ireland interests would serve on it, the authority would be wider ranging. It will not be long before we are back in Committee--perhaps with you in the Chair, Mr. Welsh--to deal with a police Bill that will consider aspects of the Police Authority.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the points that were raised. It should be clear from the tenor of my remarks that I do not intend to accept the amendments. I ask that they be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The Minister has given me an explanation as to why he cannot accept amendments Nos. 137, 167 and 105. The explanation that he gave for those three amendments, however, does not cover amendment No. 53. That amendment concerns a different part of the Bill and a completely different issue, and there is no reason why hon. Members representing Northern Ireland should not be consulted on the matter. I hope therefore that the Minister will carefully examine that part of the Bill again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if I did not touch on amendment No. 53. The documents to which the hon. Gentleman refers, however, are already subject to consultation and, while I would not wish to embarass him, I sent him a copy of them. The documents had been available for some two or two and a half months before that. The Government have been trying to consult, but the hon. Gentleman had not availed himself of the documents on which he now requires consultation. I was guilty of an omission in not referring to them, but I do not think that the Government can be criticised for the proposed legislation or the various codes. I therefore think that my explanation has been more than adequate, and I would ask the hon. Gentleman not to proceed with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not intend to keep the Committee long. I tabled 23 amendments to clause 10. They were discussed at some length under clause 1, in relation to counter-demonstrations, protests and so on. I do not intend to revisit those particular issues.
<P>
I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone who said that the Secretary of State has additional powers under clause 10, which are over and above those in the 1987 order. I challenged the Minister to tell me where the recommendation occurred in the North report, and I commend the officials for the alacrity with which they found the particular recommendation--recommendation 36--to bail the Minister out. The Minister had no clue as to where to look for that recommendation, and I am not surprised, as it is extremely difficult to locate. I am delighted and grateful that the Minister was able to tell me where the connection was between earlier legislation and the basis for the directions in clause 10. Recommendation 36 does refer to article 5 of the 1987 order, and tels us to refer to recommendation 14. Recommendation 14 says that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``statutory criteria set down in Article 5 relating to the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers over parades (but not open-air public meetings) should similarly amend.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Article 5 of the 1987 order and clause 10 are, of course, significantly different. Schedule 3--I know, Mr. Welsh, that you will jump on me from a great height if I dwell on this point--refers to amendments to the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. In the Bill there are significant changes to that order relating to article 5 and to the Secretary of State's powers.
<P>
The hon. Minister for West Tyrone was correct in saying that there seems to be an extension of powers under this important clause. I recollect that as a Northern Ireland Minister I had other responsibilities and was not drawn into such matters. The Minister of State, however, is at the heart of such problems and knows how difficult it is to be in that position.
<P>
In the Meetings that I attended, I was always convinced by the then Secretary of State's belief that all decisions relating to parades and, essentially, to public order, should always be determined by the chief constable, on the ground of the public order issue. He was always terribly cautious, if not afraid, to have any perceived political input into decisions governing this important matter.
<P>
If there is an extension of powers, in the interests of even-handedness and fairness, the Secretary of State should be extremely cautious in ever using those powers, especially as those powers have been extended since the 1987 order.
<P>
Article 5 of the 1987 order is part of a public order order. This Bill is, by extension, more than a public order Bill. It gives powers to a new commission. The thrust of the Bill is to change the emphasis to give powers to an independent body--independent of the political machine and of the Chief Constable of the RUC. However, as a sort of backstop, if the commission does not work, we roll out the Secretary of State to sort out the problem.
<P>
That is a problem: those who are intent on causing disruption and opposing parades know that if they cause sufficient problems, the commission will not be able to handle it. The Secretary of State will then have to step in. We are giving powers to that new body--I am not saying that we should not--but if ultimately we have the huge backstop of the Secretary of State's intervention, those intent on mischief, mayhem and disorder will simply push at that open door until those powers are invoked. It is a problem; I am not saying that it is easy, but the question needs to be answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> The hon. Member for West Tyrone talked about the ``draconian'' powers given to the Secretary of State by clause 10 and by other provisions in the Bill. I think that he goes too far, as always, but I readily acknowledge that the powers are formidable.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry made comparisons to legislation and practices elsewhere, in England and Scotland. I need hardly remind you, Mr. Welsh, given your experience of such matters, that councillors in England and Wales determine whether parades or demonstrations take place. My wife, a city councillor, and her colleagues determine whether to allow or to ban a parade. In her experience, it is rare that an appeal is taken to the sheriff. The sheriff knows that in the overwhelming majority of cases, that decision is best left to local authority representitives.
<P>
If our constituents in Scotland suffered 100th or even 1000th of the experiences of the hon. Members for East Londonderry and West Tyrone, every Member representing a Scottish constituency would demand that our Secretary of State be given the same powers to protect the interests and look after the concerns of our constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal with the issues that were raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. He rightly mentioned the complexity of the matters with which the Parades Commission, the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable will have to deal. Problems exist and the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 is there to deal with them.
<P>
The clause, and the Bill, do not seek to extend the Secretary of State's powers in the way that the hon. Gentleman described. The Secretary of State can always take decisions on her own account--that is not new. The power to ban individual parades is a minimalist provision in the Bill. The time limit for a blanket ban has been reduced from three months to 28 days, so it could be argued that the clause represents a reduction, rather than an extension, in powers. As I said earlier, the powers are different; they are not an extension. They should be considered in that context.
<P>
Like North, the Bill is an attempt to find a new way of dealing with contentious and difficult issues. It is an attempt to avoid reaching a point where the Secretary of State or the Chief Constable would have to use their powers because of a possible serious breakdown in public order.
<P>
The Bill will create a new framework, which I hope will receive the full support of the Opposition. They considered such measures when they were in government. I repeat a point that I shall probably repeat again: that it would have been better if the North report had been presented to Parliament in the form of a Bill before the election. If that had happened, the Parades Commission would now be up and running.
<P>
If an Act had been in place, it might have prevented the problems at Drumcree, and Northern Ireland might be in a better overall position. We cannot prove that argument, but I hope that it will flow from the Bill and clause 10 in particular. The clause provides a last resort, but it involves a reduction in some powers.
<P>
The Secretary of State must take account of a range of factors in reaching a conclusion. An important factor is the effect of a parade on relationships within the community. Difficult judgments will have to be made, but it is probably best that such decision-making powers reside with the Secretary of State, who will consider the problem not merely on the ground of public order.
<P>
The Government are charged with the responsibility of administration and governing, and they have to make difficult decisions that may have a deleterious impact on individual communities. They should not run away from or shirk such decisions and the Government have no intention of doing that. That is why we are not ashamed to give the Secretary of State the powers that the clause confers.
<P>
The clause should not be judged in the pejorative way that it was judged by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. He did not use the words political interference, but he suggested that there was a political overlay. Governments must govern and take tough decisions that they hope will be for the betterment of everyone in Northern Ireland. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The provisions have been available for many years and have never been used and I wonder why the clause has been included. I read it again carefully for the first time in many years and decided that it has never been put into practice because it is practically impossible to register bands.
<P>
There are all sorts of difficulties about what constitutes a band. We drew attention earlier to the possibility of a one-man band and ad hoc bands of people travelling along the street together but not part of a regular band. There is also the possibility of those in a band that was behaving in an unacceptable way changing their names and turning up week after week in different areas.
<P>
The fact that the provisions of the clause have been on the statute book for so long and have not been used clearly shows that the Government and the police recognise the grave difficulties in this area which are impossible to overcome. Therefore, they have never made any effort to implement the provisions. The Government may think that at some point they have to try to implement them, but if that is as difficult as I believe, the whole thing could turn into a dreadful mess. It would simply mean that matters would be a thousand times worse than they are present.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm or deny my views because we need to know what the position is and why this has been kept on the statute book when it serves no useful purpose. If the Government ever try to implement the registration of bands they will run into the most horrendous difficulties.
<P>
I could say more about this matter but as there are no amendments to the clause we cannot really go into it in detail. The issues raise as many questions as they answer, and probably many more in this field. Perhaps the Minister could let us know the Government's thinking in retaining this provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that some bands go from Scotland to Northern Ireland each year. For some of our constituents who are bands men and women, it is quite an occasion. It is part of their annual holidays to go to Northern Ireland. If Scottish bands are to come under the provisions of the clause, could that information be made known to Scottish bands men and women who go across to Northern Ireland each year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Before the Minister replies, perhaps I could set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. The Grand Lodge of Scotland has already been in touch with the Minister and received a satisfactory reply on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That just shows that my letters are read and widely circulated. The Grand Lodge has been in touch with me on the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde and I have replied specifically on that. I would be happy for a copy of that letter to be made available to the Committee if the Grand Lodge agrees. I am sure that that would help my hon. Friend.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry raises an interesting point. The clause is part of existing legislation and has not been used before. We heard in a debate on a previous amendment about the Secretary of State's banning powers being used only once. Some parts of the legislation may never be used because the circumstances that were envisaged when they were drafted never arise. They constitute a fail-safe or fall-back position. That applies to clause 11.
<P>
The commission has sufficient powers to tackle the mischief that some bands cause. The commission will know through formal notification which bands will attend a procession. The commission may impose conditions such as which bands can attend and how they conduct themselves. Those powers are sufficient up to a point. However, the North report recommended that a code-based scheme should be included in the Bill. Therefore, it was decided not to remove the provision.
<P>
I do not hide the fact that implementing the clause would be difficult. However, it is a fail-safe provision, which, I hope, we will not have to use. If we have to implement the clause we shall have to consider ways in which to ensure that it is properly applied. Considerable thought has been given to the form of the clause. Its precise terminology is still being considered. We may return to that later. The hon. Member for East Londonderry made an useful point for which I am grateful. However, I commend the clause to the Committee.
