<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) had begun his point of order when we stopped our proceedings for lunch; unfortunately, he is now out of the Room for a short time on urgent business.
<P>
Perhaps I could say to the Minister, on behalf of my right hon. Friend, that we are concerned because we have not seen any published material on admissions. We are most anxious that such information is made available to the Committee before we debate the relevant clauses, given that it will be difficult to debate the issue without our having the necessary material. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could tell us when we might receive the information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am sure that the Committee would be interested to know when the Minister thinks that the code of practice for LEAs will be published.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Obviously, those are not points of order for me.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I draw the Committee's attention to the commitments that I gave at our first sitting on 20 January 1998. I referred specifically to the code of practice on admissions and said that it was different from the other regulations, details of which I would be disclosing. I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clause 75 on the code of practice for admissions is slightly different." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 20 January 1998; c. 25.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will be aware that clause 76 provides that the House will have the opportunity of debating and voting on the code of practice when it is formulated. It will be a discreet parliamentary procedure. That is why we shall not be bringing details of admissions before the Committee.
<P>
As for the point of order of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), we shall be providing the details to which I referred at our first sitting when we table a Government new clause dealing with the code of practice.
<P>
Clauses 28 to 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Statutory proposals: procedure and implementation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 107, line 22, leave out from "promoters" to the end of line 24, and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"paragraph (2) shall apply as if references therein to an authority were references to such governing body or promotors.".
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) [Interruption.]
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is supposed to be a Committee, not a rabble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I certainly will not be describing my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough as my associate that word has other connotations in this Committee. Earlier, my hon. Friend was chided by the Minister for not having read in its entirety the Eduction Act 1996. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend has now kept to his commitment to read it in the same way that we hope the Minister has kept to his commitment to learn his seven-times tables. I have no doubt that there may be a connection between the answer to the amendment and the answer that was given to my hon. Friend.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that the amendment would achieve a level playing field. It would apply the same requirements to governing bodies and promoters as those placed on local education authorities in respect of the handling of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"objections to any proposals published under section 27, 28 or 30."
<P>
In simple terms, it appears that if there are objections to a proposal introduced by an LEA, the LEA is reasonably expected to respond to the objections before it is subsequently sent to the school organisation committee for determination.
<P>
There is no similar or parallel requirement that will enable school governors to respond to objections before their proposition goes to the committee. There should be a level playing field in that respect. No doubt the Minister will tell us that the matter is covered in another proposal, but it will be helpful to have his assurance that that is the case.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is very important that the school organisation committee receives representations about proposals, as it is the decision-making body under the new procedure. It is not appropriate for information to go from a governing body to an LEA, for example, although we take the view that LEAs will consult about any proposals that they want to introduce. That consultation will no doubt be reflected in representations that they make to the school organisation committee. Representations should go to the body that takes the decisions at the end of the process in this case, the school organisation committee. That is the appropriate way to deal with the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Judging from the Minister's response, there appears to be a misunderstanding about the purpose of the amendment. Will the Minister look again at paragraph 2 of schedule 6, which deals with proposals published under the various sections to which I referred? Paragraph 2 provides that an LEA will be able to comment on objections to its published proposals before they go to the SOC. In the case of proposals published by a governing body, it has no similar ability to comment on objections before they go to the committee. Although we are not happy with the[Mr. Foster]
notion of a committee, we believe that in both cases the matter should go to the committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The effect of the amendment would be that any objections would be sent to the proposers for their comments, rather than to the relevant SOC. It is far better that the SOC, as the decision-making body, receives those representations. That would not be the case if the amendment were accepted and I ask the Committee to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> There is confusion between the two sides of the Committee. I do not want to proceed with an amendment that would have the effect that the Minister describes. Before I ask leave to withdraw it I hope that the Minister will give me an assurance that the governors or promoters of a proposal made by a school governing body, which subsequently goes to the committee for determination, shall be given an opportunity to make their response to any objections known to members of the committee. That would put their proposal on a level playing field with the proposals made by an LEA. It should not present any difficulty. I merely seek the Minister's assurance that that is the intention of the Bill, although it is not expressed in words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We will expect the school organisation committee to receive the views and comments of those who object to proposals. It will put them on the same footing as local education authorities. I give that undertaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The confusion continues. Of course the committee will receive all comments from objectors that is reasonable and perfectly proper. My point, covered specifically in the schedule, is that if objections are made to an LEA proposal, the LEA will have an opportunity to comment on those objections before the proposal goes to the committee. However, if objections are made to a school proposal, the school has no comparable opportunity to comment on those objections before the proposal is considered by the committee.
<P>
That seems to be an unevenness in the playing field and, in the amendment, I seek a levelling off. We need to discuss the matter at a later stage. Because there is still some confusion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we come to amendment No. 211, I caution hon. Members especially the hon. Member for Bath that if a Member gives an indication of a wish to withdraw an amendment, either I must put the Question or the debate continues. Other hon. Members cannot speak until I have put the Question. I know that the hon. Gentleman was a little tentative about his intention to withdraw the amendment. I issue the caution merely to avoid confusion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 108, line 52, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6)A governing body shall have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State within 21 working days of being notified of the LEA's determination.
<P>
(7)No action shall be taken by the LEA in respect of the determination until the Secretary of State has announced the outcome of the appeal.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 4 to schedule 6 relates to statutory proposals and the point at which the LEA's determination reaches implementation. It has already been stated that we do not share the Government's view that the school organisation committee should be the final body to which appeals should be made. The amendment therefore has two parts. First, when the LEA decides to implement changes particularly about the alteration or discontinuance of schools we believe that the governing body should have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State, within 21 working days of being notified of the LEA's determination. Secondly, having made that appeal, we believe that no action should be taken by the LEA until the Secretary of State has announced the outcome of the appeal.
<P>
It is proper that the governing body should have a right of appeal, but there is another aspect to be considered. It is not the prime reason for the amendment, but one that I am sure many members of the Committee will find familiar. If a local school is facing significant change or even closure, it creates an awful lot of local unhappiness, especially among parents. As democratically elected representatives of the people, Members of Parliament usually have the opportunity to represent their constituents. When such a proposal is put to the Secretary of State, hon. Members would usually represent their constituents, through the governing body, either by speaking personally to the Secretary of State or, as I have done, by taking the head teacher and governing body as a delegation to see the Secretary of State in person.
<P>
It is an important part of the democratic process that Members of Parliament can make local representations on behalf of their constituents. However, that accountability will clearly no longer be available in such cases not even if an hon. Member was to raise the matter of a particular closure in an Adjournment debate. The Minister could stand at the Dispatch Box and hide behind the idea that the school organisation committee had made the decision and that there was therefore no direct accountability to hon. Members or to Parliament in such situations. Hon. Members will know how emotive such a proposal is and, under the auspices of the school organisation committee, it will cause even more unhappiness locally.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, everyone recognises that the Secretary of State sometimes finds in favour of a school's closure. I remember taking the governing body of a local primary school, which had only 13 pupils, to see the Secretary of State. Obviously, as their Member of Parliament it was my duty to put as strong a case as I could on their behalf, but the Secretary of State did not find in their favour. Nevertheless, it is an hon. Member's right to have such contact with the Secretary of State.
<P>
If the amendment is not accepted, we will be denied what we, as democratically elected representatives, previously have been able to do through the democratic process. Therefore, I urge the Government to reconsider. The final stage in the process should involve the Secretary of State receiving such representations and having the final say in an appeal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This issue goes to the heart of one of this morning's debates that is, whether it is appropriate to devolve powers from Whitehall, Westminster and the Secretary of State to local level. Although the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) has said that it should be a Member of Parliament's right to raise such matters with the Secretary of State, there is a better way to proceed devolving those powers to local communities and the people who are closely involved in the process.
<P>
From my limited experience of holding this office for eight or nine months, I know the extent to which Members of Parliament lobby in favour of individual schools, but I am not sure that that is the best way to make progress. There is a better way, which does not involve being approached in the Lobby at 10 o'clock during a Division.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No. I shall make my point and then give way. Sometimes an hon. Member will ask, "Will you meet a delegation and hear my constituents?" As a matter of principle my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I always meet such delegations; we regard that as our responsibility. However, there is a better way to deal with sensitive school reorganisation matters. That is what we seek under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I said that the amendment's prime purpose was not that Members of Parliament should take representatives of governing bodies to see Ministers although that is an important aspect of our duties as democratically elected representatives but to give governing bodies a final right of appeal directly to the Secretary of State. I did not have in mind just grabbing someone in the Division Lobby for a couple of minutes. Such cases are usually complex, the meetings involving written presentations. I am delighted to hear that the Minister and his colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment receive representations from Members of Parliament, but the Opposition's experience is that some of his colleagues in other Departments are not so willing to receive us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friends would not wish to give up the delight of the hon. Lady accosting them in the Lobby for a couple of minutes. However, I am prepared to make that sacrifice in the interests of devolving powers to local communities.
<P>
An important principle is involved. Parliament has taken powers to itself over many years. The right hon. Member for Charnwood has criticised us for giving the Secretary of State powers to raise standards but we are dealing with structures and school reorganisation, and such matters are best determined locally.
<P>
I can understand the argument about a governing body thinking that it is vulnerable compared with a mighty local education authority. That is why we make it clear that if a governing body objects to an LEA's proposal, the LEA cannot then take a decision the proposals must go before the school organisation committee. That is the safety device that we are building in to the new procedures on devolving powers to LEAs and local communities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May (Maidenhead):</B> In circumstances where the majority of people sitting on the school organisation committee are the same people as those sitting on the local education authority where, for example, they are both members of the authority and representatives of the churches how would the school organisation committee provide that safety device?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If the hon. Lady looks at the proposed membership of the school organisation committee in the document that we circulated a few days ago, she will realise that it would be an unusual set of circumstances where a majority of the school organisation committee were members of the LEA. It should be borne in mind that if there is a failure to agree at the school organisation committee, the matter goes to the independent adjudicator. There is a device to protect the minority, whether it is a governing body or Church authority. It will protect those who may feel that their wishes are not being listened to. Finally, there will be the independent adjudicator. We believe that that will be far better than having the Secretary of State determine these matters.
<P>
There is a provision to safeguard the interests of an individual governing body. It can put a block on a local education authority determining its own proposals just one objection will ensure that the matter has to go to the school organisation committee. If there is not a unanimous view on the school organisation committee, it will go to the independent adjudicator. Safety devices are built into the process. I hope that I have been able to reassure the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton and that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am not convinced. It is a sad reflection on the Government that they do not recognise the needs and rights of governing bodies, in this last stage of the appeal process, to have the Secretary of State determine the matter. I cannot help but feel that when the independent adjudicator makes an unpopular decision the Secretary of State will hide behind it with a, "It's nothing to do with me Guv", or some more suitable ministerial phrase. He will be kept at arm's length from every unpopular decision made by the adjudicator. I therefore intend to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 154, in page 116, line 23, leave-out "or promoters". [Mr. Hain.]
<P>
Schedule 6, as amended, agreed to.
<P>
Clauses 31 and 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rationalisation of school places</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I beg to move amendment No. 218, in page 29, line 20, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and for such proposals to be made by him".</font></ul>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe the Government's intentions as to the Secretary of State's role in presenting proposals after he has formed the opinion that school places in a local authority area need to be rationalised. The notes attached to the Bill make it clear that the power covered by clause 33 and schedule 7 a power that I believe was first established in 1996 enables the Secretary of State to survey school provision in an area and to take action, particularly if unfilled places have accumulated and constitute an expense without providing education for children. It also enables him to satisfy himself that proper provision is made for areas with growing school populations.
<P>
Under schedule 7, if the Secretary of State initiates the relevant process an LEA is responsible for preparing a set of proposals in response to his analysis of excessive or insufficient provision. I accept that arrangement the previous Government established it as a longstop provision and I have no difficulty with the idea of its extension.
<P>
The aspect of the matter that I do not understand concerns the circumstances in which part III of the schedule will come into effect. The amendment is to probe the meaning of the words in clause 33,
<P>
</ul></font>
<ul><font size=-1>
"and for such proposals to be made by him".<P>
</ul></FONT>
<P>
If the Secretary of State identifies insufficient or excessive provision, he places the LEA under an obligation to present him with plans for dealing with the problem. In what circumstances must he present his own proposals? I should like clarification of that. It would seem preferable that an LEA should prepare a plan that would reflect local circumstances, local engagement and all the issues of locals national balance that we have been discussing. That would surely accord with the Government's rhetoric, but part II of the schedule suggests that having received the LEA's plan the Secretary of State is to present his own proposals. Do the Government intend the Secretary of State to present proposals or to deal with those of the LEA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the Government's approach to surplus places the main issue of concern and ways to ensure that local education authorities provide adequately for areas of growing population. In a debate a few weeks ago, the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Madel) raised the question of surplus places and the planning role that local education authorities should be playing. It is clear from the examples that he gave to the Committee that the issue is a pressing one and that the action that local authorities take or perhaps fail to take must be addressed.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Audit Commission has already drawn attention, in a couple of publications, to the detrimental effect of holding a large number of surplus places within the school system. The district auditor raised the issue nationally and with several local education authorities. The Department now carries out an annual survey to identify the percentage of surplus places within a local education authority area.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Charnwood said, the prime responsibility for the removal or expansion of places must rest with the local authority itself. We are keen to encourage local authorities to review provision within their own areas. School organisation plans will provide a good opportunity for that to happen and we were able to debate that matter earlier.
<P>
The difficulty is what to do with a local authority which, for whatever reason it may be for political convenience is reluctant to opt for substantial school reorganisation or closure for rationalisation. Those who have experienced school reorganisations will know that at the time it is not a popular route on which to embark. Where there is a surplus of school places, but the local authority fails to act, there is a need for the Secretary of State to have reserve powers.
<P>
This measure was first introduced in the Education Act 1993 and was consolidated in the Education Act 1996. It has proved a useful incentive it concentrates the minds of local education authorities if they realise that a blanket refusal to act can be overruled by the Secretary of State, who will have a reserve power to bring forward his or her own proposals.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I half expected the Minister to take that line that it is a reserve power for use when an LEA has not responded to a call for a plan. However, paragraph 5 of the schedule does not say that; it says that the Secretary of State will prepare his own plans either when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"proposals have been published in pursuance of the order"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the time allowed under the order for the publication of the proposals has expired".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In what circumstances will the Secretary of State publish his own plan when the LEA has itself already published a plan in other words under the first of those alternatives?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We would do that if the local authority were not making a reasonable attempt to remove surplus places or provide for expansion in a particular part of its area. It would be too easy and would constitute a loophole if a specific local authority weregiven the power to come up with a modest set of proposals that denied the Secretary of State the opportunity of using the reserve power contained in the Bill.
<P>
Rather than provide such an opportunity for a local education authority, it would be better to allow the Secretary of State to exercise this particular power. In those circumstances, he could bring forward his proposals but with the important difference that the Secretary of State's proposals will now have to be dealt with by the school organisation committee. It will not be for the Secretary of State himself to determine such proposals.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): I am paying particular attention to what the Minister is saying because we have had an acute problem in Bedfordshire which has drifted on since 1981. Is it the duty of the local education authority to tell the Department for Education and Employment that, although it acknowledges that there is a serious problem, it cannot agree what to do about the problem? Noting a failure to agree could trigger action from the Department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is possible that because of political differences in a local education authority area, no consensus emerges about reorganisation proposals. In those circumstances, the Secretary of State might be prepared to use the powers in the Bill. The important difference is that his proposals will have to go before the school organisation committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> May I pursue the point that I made in my last intervention? The Minister claims that the Secretary of State should be able to make proposals. Why cannot the schedule specify that the provision covers circumstances in which the Secretary of State is not satisfied that an LEA's proposals deal adequately with surplus or deficit problems? The schedule states that the Secretary of State can draft proposals in all circumstances, even if the LEA proposes competent measures for tackling the problem. If the provision is a longstop proposal to empower the Secretary of State to intervene when he is not satisfied with LEA proposals, the schedule should specify that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am happy to place on record the way in which the provision should be interpreted. It is to be used if the LEA fails to present reasonable proposals to remove surplus places, to rationalise, or to provide additional places. If the power did not exist, and an LEA failed to discharge its statutory duty, we would have to pursue the matter through the courts. That is a long-drawn-out process which we do not favour.
<P>
The measure reflects proposals that the previous Administration introduced in 1993. Those proposals have provided a useful incentive for local authorities to look long and hard at the need to remove surplus places. They have proved helpful, so we have repeated them in the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's assurance about the circumstances in which the power is intended to be used. I had hoped to persuade the Minister to improve on the excellent record that he inherited from his predecessors. The amendment provided an opportunity for tighter drafting. However, in the light of the Minister's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 217, in page 121, leave out lines 17 and 18.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to test the circumstances in which it is possible to challenge the Secretary of State's conclusion about excess or inadequate provision. The two lines that we want to eliminate state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It shall not be open to the inquiry to question the principles specified in the order under paragraph 2 or 3."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The inquiry refers to that conducted by an adjudicator after a school organisation committee has considered the Secretary of State's proposals. The paragraphs call for preparation of the plans.
<P>
The Secretary of State's identification of a problem of excess or inadequate provision that had not been tackled by the LEA in, for example, the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire, might be disputed locally. The Secretary of State might introduce proposals for school rationalisation according to his perception of excess provision, without satisfying local people that he was right. He could prepare a plan with which the school organisation committee did not agree because local representatives were not convinced that there was excess provision. In those circumstances, the case would go to the adjudicator. The two lines that we wish to eliminate would provide that, at the inquiry held by the adjudicator, there would be no discussion of the basis of the disagreement between the local community and the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State would deem there to be excess provision and deem it necessary to act.
<P>
All through the process, local people could contest that. However, when the matter reached the public inquiry which was supposed to resolve the dispute and, presumably, to secure some measure of public support for the adjudicator's decision the adjudicator would be debarred by the two lines in the clause from considering the fundamental disagreement which was the reason why the case reached him in the first place.
<P>
I do not understand why the adjudicator should be debarred from analysing whether there is excess provision. If he is debarred from doing that, he is debarred from examining whether the Secretary of State was justified in using what are relatively heavy-handed powers to intervene over the heads of people who disagree with his analysis.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> The right hon. Member for Charnwood, when speaking to the previous amendment, pointed out that the provision builds on the Education Act 1993 and the[Ms Estelle Morris]
Education Act 1996. This was one example of when we found it difficult to improve on what the previous Administration had done. The two lines that the right hon. Gentleman now proposes to delete are, to the word, lines that are included in those Acts. We could not improve on them; our predecessors were right to have placed them there, and we wanted to ensure that the principles which underlie the Secretary of State's decison cannot be questioned by the adjudicator.
<P>
I do not foresee those principles including justification for excess places; they will be matters such as ensuring that proposals reflect schools' relative performance and taking opportunities to enhance schools that are popular with parents. As my hon. Friend the Minister said in a previous debate, the issue of whether there are excess places will be a matter for the Department's annual review of surplus places. The principles that underpin the Secretary of State's proposals include enhancing popular provision, rather than building up schools that parents appear not to want their children to attend something which we have previously debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Under-Secretary is making an important point, if she is correct and she may like to consider that. Paragraph 2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This paragraph applies where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that the provision for primary or secondary education in maintained schools ... is excessive."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the Under-Secretary saying that if local people disagree with that analysis which is the founding principle on which the whole schedule is based they will be able to argue at the inquiry provided for in paragraph 9 that the Secretary of State is wrong in his belief that school provision is excessive? If she is right to say that, it is an important point, and I would be grateful if she would put that on that record. If she is not, my argument still applies.
<P>
While it is nice to say across the Committee, "You did it", and so on, it behoves all of us to consider the Bill and decide whether its provisions are right. It is not right to give the Secretary of State the power to deem places to be excessive and to act without, at any stage of a long process, allowing public discussion of whether his fundamental analysis is right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even interventions from the Front Bench are supposed to be interventions.

<B>Ms Morris:</B> To return to the original point, those two lines have stood the test of time and have not been found wanting.

<B>Ms Morris:</B> I will happily give way to my hon. Friend in a moment.
<P>
I referred to the principles that underlie the Secretary of State's proposals which might be, let us say, providing more places or removing places. The principle might be, "Thou shalt take into account which schools have been popular with parents". I was referring to that when I was talking about principles.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that we were prepared to concede some of the ideas introduced by the previous Government in the 1993 and 1996 legislation. That shows that the Government have adopted a non-dogmatic approach to the Bill. We have not rejected everything that was done by the previous Administration; we are prepared to consider those elements that have worked well. We are prepared to endorse aspects of the previous legislation through certain sections of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> My hon. Friend is right. He, I and every other member of the Government are reasonable people, who take the best of what has been successful in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Is it correct that one of the principles that is debarred from discussion in the inquiry is the basic analysis that there are excess places? If the Secretary of State says, "I believe that there are excess places", can that be argued about in the inquiry? Could the Under-Secretary answer that point directly?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I shall seek guidance on that point. I would have thought that if matters had reached the stage when the Secretary of State had published his or her proposals, the local authorities would have made representations before that point, if they did not think that there was a need to publish proposals because there was no excess or shortage of places. I would be surprised if, having gone through all the different stages, local authorities had not introduced proposals by that last stage. They would have been recalcitrant and they would have argued with the Secretary of State, so it would be surprising if the argument about whether there was a shortage of places was brought up at a public inquiry. My understanding is that the principles behind the proposals would have been put forward by the Secretary of State; it would not be a debate about whether there were excess places. However, if it is different I shall inform the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for the tone of her response. The fact that I am prepared to propose amendments to legislation introduced by the previous Government is evidence that the Conservative party is not dogmatic. The Opposition are prepared to examine our record and to identify those aspects of it that could be improved. I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's undertaking to write to me if she comes to a different conclusion after further reflection. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 7 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>School changing from one category to another</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The purpose of clause 34, and the accompanying schedule 8, is to allow any school that is allocated to the new category, as determined by the Government, or any former grant-maintained school that opts for a new category, to be able to change its status. The provisions are important, given the Government's change of view following consultation in the summer. They said originally that all schools should have a choice about the category to which they were allocated, but they have now concluded for reasons that I half understand that they do not want every school in the country to be arguing about its status at the same time.
<P>
I said that I half understand the reasons because I am fully aware, as is the Under-Secretary, that part of the drive for that change of stance came from local government interests. There was concern that many LEA schools that would be allocated community status under the Bill have been showing considerable interest in opting for foundation status. It is important to understand the genesis of that change of mind. Given that the Government have changed their stance, it is essential that flexible, easy-to-operate provisions are included in the Bill to allow a school, which chooses to do so, to change its status.
<P>
I want to probe what is meant by subsection (2), which states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Schedule does not apply at any time before the end of such period as may be prescribed."
<P></ul></font>
What does that mean? When do the Government expect the provisions for change of status to come into effect? May we have a clear statement from the Minister that, as of that date, the provisions of schedule 8 will apply without qualification and that any school that starts life under the new regime and in a particular category, but wants to change its category, will be free to do so? Will the choice about the relative merits of the different categories be left to be determined by schools, according to their experience?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am more than pleased to clarify the present thinking of the Government on those issues. Depending on when the Bill becomes law subject to the approval of this place and of the House of Lords we intend that the new framework of school organisation be effective from September 1999. Grant-maintained schools, which will have an indicative allocation of either the foundation or voluntary sector, will be able to determine their position some time before that.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Charnwood correctly said, there is a period of time for the Secretary of State to introduce regulations, during which other schools will not be able to change category. Our present thinking is that 12 months from September 1999 is appropriate, so September 2000 will be the date from which all other schools may change status, if they so wish. That gives those schools the opportunity of studying how the new status would affect them and of viewing how other categories are working within the framework. If they felt that the existing category was unsuitable, they could make a decision on an informed basis. That is the present thinking, and we shall introduce regulations to achieve that time scale. I hope that that has clarified the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. It clarifies the matter, although it is fair to say that, "This is the Government's present thinking", is a fairly qualified clarification. The Government began by saying that every school should have a choice; now, they are seeking legislative authority for provisions that, at some point in the future, will give schools a choice. All that the Government are offering at this stage is their present thinking on when that choice should be deferred until a choice that was originally promised from the beginning of the process.
<P>
The Government are shifting their position a long way. I would hope that, on reflection, the Minister will give us a firm undertaking that such a choice will be available to schools from September 2000, if not before. We should remember that, as of July 1997, schools were promised that choice with effect from the enactment of this Bill. I hope that the Minister will give us an undertaking, rather than an indication of present thinking, that the choice will be available to schools, within the terms of the schedule, from September 2000.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 29, line 35, after "Schedule 9", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) Where more than one school occupies the same site, two or more of the schools may decide to have a joint governing body, which shall be a body corporate constituted in accordance with Schedule 9.".<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I hope that I can deal briefly with the amendment, especially as we now have a non-dogmatic Government and Opposition. I assure the Committee that ours is a non-dogmatic Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
We cannot understand why the Government [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be listened to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> That is probably why the Government do not understand 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is the only person who knows what he is going to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> You would have done brilliantly in my school, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
We cannot understand the Government's thinking on joint governing bodies. While it is obvious that schools should have the right to decide whether to have a single governing body, sometimes it is advantageous to have a joint governing body. I give the example of an infants schools and a junior school on the same site. Tensions could arise between them because of their having to share facilities. Governing bodies choosing to unite and become a single body would be a reasonable option. On a campus site, there could be primary and secondary schools, again using the same facilities and sharing common objectives. The opportunity to have a joint governing body might again be extremely useful, if the bodies so decided. Our amendments merely try to elicit from the Government a commitment that schools that choose to have a joint governing body should be allowed that.
<P>
Clause 10 provides for education action zones EAZs where schools will be encouraged to work together, and can, if they wish, have an umbrella governing body. Foundation schools have been provided for in clause 21, yet the opportunity is being denied to a small number of schools probably no more than two which may wish to join together with a single governing body. We hope that the Minister will see the sense of allowing such governing bodies to unite if they need to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We are sympathetic to the two amendments. However, I should like minor clarification from the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. I assume that where a primary and senior school came together under one governing body, the hon. Gentleman has taken into account there being no restrictive practice as regards admissions to the senior school from the primary school.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I can give the hon. Lady that assurance, because the Secretary of State's code of practice would cover the point about admissions. The admissions policy would apply in the same way as it would elsewhere in a local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We are talking about separate schools. The Government's view is that as they are separate schools, managed separately, they should have separate governing bodies. The amendments demonstrate confused thinking about the role of governing bodies certainly those of the future which will be to monitor standards in schools and, in particular, the performance of head teachers. We think that that would be more appropriately done by a governing body with specific responsibility for an individual school rather than two schools, two head teachers and two groups of pupils. We consider it inappropriate to move towards joint governing bodies in the manner outlined by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. There should be a clear distinction between the management of a school and a governing body that has responsibility for it. That is one of the issues referred to in the technical consultation document that was circulated last August.
<P>
Most local education authorities expressed no objection to the idea that we would no longer allow group governing bodies to operate but were prepared to support individual governing bodies for individual schools. The Local Government Association has expressed the view that there should still be discretion to allow group governing bodies. I regret that the Government do not agree with that approach.
<P>
This is an important matter of principle. It reflects the new approach that we want governing bodies to take, which is to monitor and to be responsible for raising standards within one school. For those reasons, we are not minded to accept the amendment. If it is not withdrawn, I shall ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am rather disappointed by the Minister's response. It shows a narrowness of thought that is not part of his general approach. We fully accept that the vast majority of schools will want to have individual governing bodies and to carry out their affairs in an individual way. But the Minister implied that the main role of a governing body is simply to monitor standards. If that is to be the future definition of governing bodies, even fewer people will want to serve on them. Surely it involves a great deal more than that.
<P>
The governing body should encourage the ethos of the school, it should become involved in the life of the school and it should encourage in a thousand ways the education of young people. To limit its role to monitoring standards is rather narrow. We accept that most schools will want single governing bodies. The amendment simply sought to keep open the option that where schools wish to join together they should be allowed to do so. The Government are clearly determined that that will not be the case. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 29, line 40, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A)The governing body of any maintained school shall give an officer of a local education authority all assistance in connection with the exercise of his functions which they are reasonably able to give.
<P>
(3B)The governing body of any maintained school shall give an officer of a local education authority access to meetings and proceedings of the governing body.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will have been interested in the Minister's comments about the role of the governing body. We certainly hope that that will be developed to cover the much wider range of issues to which my hon. Friend referred, but if governing bodies are to concentrate on monitoring and helping a school to raise standards it is vital that we recognise that the governors are not the only people with a responsibility for those issues. Indeed, we have discussed at some length the role that central and local government have to play in that process.
<P>
A couple of weeks ago we agreed a new clause that gives LEAs a specific responsibility for monitoring and raising standards in schools. If this is to be a partnership approach between central Government, local government and schools, it is clearly important that we get right the nature of the relationship between the LEA and the governing body as well as the relationship between central Government and the LEA.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give the Committee some assurances that the concerns that I wish to share with the Committee will be covered in the new clause that the Government have said they will introduce on the code of practice for LEAs. Some of those concerns may be picked up, but if I do not get those assurances I will take the amendment further. So far we have not had any explanation from the Government of the nature of the relationship between the LEA and the governing body. There is nothing in the Bill that enables us to get a feel for how they see that relationship.
<P>
We know that in previous clauses, especially in clause 8, there is a reserve power I acknowledge that it is a reserve power for central Government, through the Secretary of State, to intervene and become involved in the work of a local education authority, if it is failing in its duty. We should consider whether the LEA should have a similar power to become involved in the work of a school, if it is failing. The Minister will say that powers in the Bill allow LEAs to do that. For example, they can remove delegated budgets, impose additional governors and so on. It will be very difficult for an LEA to know whether problems are arising in a school if it is not involved in the work of the governing body or, more important, if it is not able to give it professional advice.
<P>
We fully appreciate that the LEA can have a representative on the governing body, but he is there as a lay governor, in a sense, and not to give professional advice to the governing body. I am worried whether it will be possible for the local education authority to give professional advice directly to the governing body of an individual school.
<P>
The Government have said and we support them that they intend to remove much of the complexity that exists in the current articles and instruments on the governance of schools. In doing so, we are conscious of the fact that regulation 21 of the Education (School Government) Regulations 1989 can be interpreted in such a way that the governing body has the right to exclude a chief education officer from meetings of the governing body. There is nothing in the Bill that would reverse that position and allow the governing body even to invite the local education authority's chief education officer to give advice. Certainly, there are no powers that would enable the chief education officer to attend a meeting of the governing body. That is only one example of the Government's uncertainty about their intentions regarding the relationship between the governing body and the local education authority.
<P>
The amendment is worded in similar not identical terms to the power that the Secretary of State has to become involved in the work of an LEA. We believe that there is a need for greater clarity about the power of the LEA to give professional advice to the governing body and the LEA's ability to become involved in its meetings, so that it can see what is going on.
<P>
It is important not to use the argument that the LEA has a representative on the governing body, because that confuses the difficult relationship and functions between a governor and a professional adviser. It is interesting to note that, as the Bill stands, the LEA not only cannot have someone present at the governing body meetings, but will not even know when those meetings are taking place.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will say that some of the issues that I have raised will be covered by the code of practice and code of conduct for LEAs, and I look forward to his response.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We are rather disappointed that the Liberal Democrats have tabled the amendment, especially as it follows the two previous amendments, which we support, that would give governing bodies that have sufficient managerial expertise the freedom to choose to combine and become one governing body.
<P>
Statutory powers in other parts of the Bill entitle LEA personnel to be involved in a professional capacity with a school and its governing body. Notwithstanding those powers, the amendment would include in the Bill a proposal that the governing body shall be under a statutory obligation to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"give an officer of a local education authority access to meetings and proceedings".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Individual members of governing bodies have statutory obligations; their managerial skills should be acknowledged if governing bodies are to have managerial status. Managers should be allowed to manage; when they need the expertise of an LEA or other organisation they are well placed to take a voluntary decision to call upon that expertise. I regret that the amendment does not give governing bodies the status or the flexibility that the previous amendments suggested they were capable of assuming.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I share the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton about the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. I caution the hon. Gentleman; he referred to the local education authority representative on the governing body. He was right to draw a distinction between a person sitting on the governing body as a governor and someone who might attend a meeting to give professional advice. However, the role of an LEA representative is somewhat different from that suggested by the hon. Gentleman. LEA governors are appointed by the LEA only to governing bodies; once they are on the governing body they bear no responsibility to the LEA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I entirely agree with what the hon. Lady said, which is why I distinguished between the LEA representative governor and an officer of the LEA who gives professional advice.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> If the hon. Gentleman agrees with me, I am not sure why he continues to refer to an LEA representative. Nevertheless, I take his word that he accepts that the LEA governor has no responsibility to the LEA to support its policy.
<P>
The amendment raises other anxieties, especially whether governing bodies are to be trusted with the responsbility of running their schools. I believe that they should have that responsbility. When governing bodies fail to justify that trust, other parts of the Bill give authorities such as the LEA, or the Secretary of State if a school is failing, the power to intervene. Governing bodies run schools on a day-to-day basis.[Mrs. May]
We should give governors the benefit of believing that they are capable of running their schools. Members of governing bodies are chosen from a variety of categories: there are LEA-appointed governors, parent governors, teacher governors and so on. They have been chosen by people who believe that they have the ability and the capacity to be on a governing body and to run a school. We should therefore have trust in them.
<P>
The amendment is very prescriptive. Good governing bodies will seek professional advice when they require it. However, they may choose to take that advice from the LEA or from another, outside, body. In Berkshire, the county council is being abolished; as from 1 April there will be six unitary authorities. The head teacher of a primary school in my constituency told me last week that when that happens, some of the people who worked for the county council in the education department plan to set themselves up in a separate organisation, aside from the unitary authorities. The head teacher may choose to buy professional advice from that group rather tha take it direct from the LEA, as the new unitary authority. It is essential that governing bodies have that flexibility.
<P>
The amendment would require governing bodies to give an officer of the LEA access to meetings and proceedings. That is prescriptive, and it worries me. There will be occasions when a governing body not just in matters of professional advice but because it will wish to discuss something with the LEA will see fit to invite a representative of the local education authority to a governors' meeting. Schools should have that flexibility and should not be required to give that place to the LEA. We believe that governing bodies are the right choice to run schools; we should trust them to do just that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Member for Bath was right to say that it is a question of getting the balance right between the roles and responsibilities of governing bodies and the new duties and responsibilities of local education authorities. Attaining the right balance will not be easy. Many conflicting views will be expressed on which direction should be taken. The local education authority code of practice will clarify several questions raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The code of practice will be based on the major principle that we want co-operation, not coercion, and that partnership is far better than imposing legal rights. The code of practice should therefore not be overly legalistic; it should seek to build on good practice and should recognise that the prime responsibility for raising standards and for managing their own affairs must rest with schools.
<P>
The Committee has heard more than once that the key role and the prime responsibility in our new education system lies with individual schools and with the teachers in front of their classes. Everything that we do in connection with the code of practice [Interruption.] I think that I can hear bells. It must be a sign of age, but I am not altogether sure.

On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Before we were able to exercise our democratic right to vote on some amendment or other, we were debating the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Bath on the powers of local education authorities, especially those of chief education officers. We must strike a balance between the responsibilities of local education authorities and the rights of individual governing bodies. The Bill strikes the right balance. We shall debate the code of practice later.
<P>
Under clause 41, governing bodies will be required to provide LEAs with the information that they need to discharge their responsibilities, including those of raising standards under clause 5 and of intervening if a school begins to fail. That strikes the right balance.
<P>
It would not be appropriate to give chief education officers the power proposed in the amendment. In producing the code of practice, we hope to demonstrate how LEAs should discharge their responsibilities. There is no question of LEAs being kept in the dark; there is a requirement, which can be exercised under schedule 11, for a governing body to make available its draft minutes as a matter of urgency to the LEA. The minutes can be made available even before the governing body agrees to them.
<P>
We are trying to strike the right balance, as we shall make clear when we debate the code of practice, which we shall do towards the end of the Committee's sittings. The amendment goes a step too far, and I urge the hon. Member for Bath to withdraw it: if not, I shall ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Perhaps I pre-empted some of what he said by saying that such matters might be dealt with in the code of practice, which we have not yet had an opportunity to see. In looking at that code of practice, it is important to bear in mind the first part of the amendment. I am sure that no member of the Committee would want a governing body to impede an officer of the local education authority in carrying out his or her functions. That is not the intention, which will no doubt become clear when we debate the code of practice. Given that we shall have an opportunity to deal with such matters in that debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): At the beginning of chapter III, we should pause to consider the role of school governors. I realise that I could have spoken in a later debate, but this seemed a suitable point to consider that role.
<P>
During my visits to schools in my constituency, much concern has been expressed about the burden that is already placed on school governors, especially on the chairmen of governing bodies. Concern has also been expressed about how that burden will increase substantially as a result of the Bill. It is striking that although we demand much of school governors, we do not provide them with the same reassurance on indemnities that the Bill will give to people who sit on school organisation committees or, indeed, to adjudicators. Paragraph 8 of schedule 4 and paragraph 6 of schedule 5 deal with indemnities and make that point clear. If it is appropriate for members of a school organisation committee and adjudicators to be indemnified under schedule 4
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in connection with any decision or action taken by them in good faith in pursuance of their functions as members of the committee",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
why do not Ministers consider it appropriate for school governors? If they act "in good faith" the critical condition governors should be indemnified. If they are to be subject to legal action, bearing in mind the scale of their responsibilities, people could be discouraged from becoming governors. Much power rests not with them but with other bodies such as school organisation committees and adjudicators and power rests, above all, with the Department.

We are not talking here of one of the Leafy Lane high schools in Surrey described by the Minister for School Standards in a previous sitting. The school in question is in the centre of town; English is the second language for many children there; and many parents whose children attend the school are in difficult financial circumstances. I do not understand how the governors of such a school are supposed to cope when the rearrangement of the formula by which money is distributed has taken more than 100 million from Surrey's county council and put it instead into metropolitan areas.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not the responsibility of school governors. I repeat that we are supposed to be dealing with school governors.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The fact is that responsibility comes back to school governors when they have to reach the new targets set by the Minister for School Standards. In Surrey, we agreed to raise our literacy target for 11-year-olds from an impressive 68 per cent. to 90 per cent. Yet the funding necessary to achieve those goals is being cut from under our feet. The Minister for School Standards suggested ways in which the LEA could cope with that, but they will not work as my letter makes clear.
<P>
There will be problems for governors and, if they are denied reassurance or indemnity when they act in good faith, not only I, but they, will need a deep and rich sense of humour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The clause should stand part of the Bill because I am sure that governors in Surrey will welcome the new powers and responsibilities that will be given to them. They should ask Surrey local education authority why, with an education spend of 314 million, Surrey needs to spend more than 3 million on administrative costs to run its education committee and to have a chief education officer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not see what that matter has to do with school governors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was saying that the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) was drawing the Committee's attention to the difficulties that Surrey was experiencing and the burden placed on governors.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I make it clear to the Committee that, when the the hon. Member for Guildford was doing that, he was not of order. I do not wish the Minister to go down the same road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall certainly not do that. The burdens being placed on governors constitute an important issue. The Government acknowledge that governors will play an important role in respect of the responsibilities that we will expect them to discharge under the Bill. Governors will have additional responsibilities and we want them to focus on raising standards. They have a key role to play. That means that we must extend governor training and we shall be committing additional resources to do that. I shall be making an announcement on Friday at a joint conference sponsored by the Department and Ofsted about how we shall extend governor support and governor training.
[Mr. Byers]
<P>
Members of the Committee will see that paragraph 6 of schedule 11 introduces new regulations to improve the allowances that are made available to governors to acknowledge that many of them incur considerable personal expense when discharging their responsibilities. We are moving towards valuing the role that governors play and reflecting their new responsibilities. We want to provide them with training to ensure that they can discharge those responsibilities effectively.
<P>
Above all, we want to redirect the attention of governors, so that they become part of the Government's crusade to raise standards. I believe that governors will welcome the opportunity of doing that, even those in local education authorities such as Surrey, who were having 3 million taken off them by the actions of their local education authority.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We come now to a serious omission. At least I hope that it is an omission and not a deliberate Government policy. It concerns the representation on the governing body of representatives from parish and town councils. The Secretary of State claimed in his foreword in the White Paper that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Partnership for change means commitment from everyone:
from the family and the wider community".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those of us who have lived in small communities, such as rural parishes or small towns will know that a sense of community does not have to be learnt. We do not need to send Minister to America to find out what community is all about. At the heart of small communities is the local school or schools.
<P>
Amendment No. 185 requires the LEA to consult with the district, town or parish council in the area served by the school when it is appointing a governor. When I first began to draft the other amendments Nos. 213 to 216 I thought that I would require an overhead projector. I am grateful to the Clerk for his assistance in drafting them in a format that I hope members of the Committee will clearly understand. It is intended that the amendments should make additions to the charts displayed between pages 127 and 131 in the schedule. In each category of school the amendments would add a governor representing the parish or town council.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I put the hon. Lady's mind at rest. Overhead projectors, flip charts and the like are not in order in a Standing Committee. If one cannot describe it, it cannot be included.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam; that fact makes me particularly grateful for the assistance that I received in overcoming what I thought would be an insurmountable problem. I hope that hon. Members will take the point that no provision has been made in the charts in the schedule for representation of town or parish councils on their local schools. Many parish councils have expressed concern about the matter, and made it clear that they consider their local schools to be the heart of their community.
<P>
Among the representations that we have received is one from the clerk to Riverhead parish council in Sevenoaks. He writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In Riverhead, representatives are appointed by the Parish Council to serve on each of the primary schools' Governing Boards, ie Riverhead Infants School and Amhurst Junior School. These representatives are highly regarded by the Headmistress and Headmaster of the Schools ... Governors are not appointed solely for their educational interests or because their children attend the school, but for the general knowledge and experience they can contribute to the school. By removing this right, the link between the school and community is lost."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A similar letter came from Corfe Castle parish council near Swanage in Dorset. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The school forms a central part of the village community, which the democratically elected Parish Council represents. The Parish Council would very much regret the loss of a direct formalised link with its village school. It considers that the loss of the present very strong accountable link between the Parish Council and the school would be to the disadvantage of both, and of the whole community. If the Bill is passed in its present form, the Parish Council, and through it the community, will have to rely on the goodwill of the Governing Body to co-opt a representative of the Parish Council, and this might not necessarily be forthcoming."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We hear a lot from the Government about community. Notwithstanding the point that the Minister has repeatedly made about the priority to be given to raising educational standards something that we support I remind him that if communities are to value and play an active role in their local school it is important that that should be specified in the Bill. Failure to do that will send a clear message from the Government to the communities concerned that they are not needed any longer to play that active role.
<P>
I appreciate that in some circumstances the town council representatives may not have much educational expertise; they may not be professionals. However, they often bring something that is important in the mix of a governing body a concern with pastoral care for the children in a localised community. Such involvement would be sadly missed, as the letters that I have quoted suggest.
<P>
I ask the Minister to consider the amendments because failure to do so will have an impact on many town and parish councils that are concerned about their role on governing bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We sympathise with the aim of the amendments that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton tabled. Later, I shall refer to a problem with the amendment. However, we, too, have received several representations from councils. I shall not read out all 17 of them, but it is important to stress some of the issues that they raise.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Lady agrees that school governing bodies have included members of parish and town councils for a long time. It is a tried and tested formula, which is much appreciated. In north Yorkshire, there are many examples of parish councils that use their precept facilities to add to those of the village school. If we lose that connection, local schools will lose an arm in financing small but important extras.
<P>
The Government appear to have decided to axe parish and town council representatives from school governing bodies to create more places for parent governors. However, there is a shortage of parent governors in north Yorkshire. In urban areas in other parts of Yorkshire, such as Leeds, where I worked recently, it is difficult to persuade parents to take on the responsibilities of school governors. But there are no vacancies for parish representatives throughout north Yorkshire. Those representatives are easy to find because they see the link between the parish and the local school.
<P>
We received a letter from the Conwy Association of Local Councils. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"These proposals go against the Government's stated wish to enhance local community life and the present arrangements have worked well without attracting criticism. These proposals were not presaged at the Election and local Councillors stand ready to continue to play their part in school governance and if present proposals are adopted there may well be practical difficulties in finding enough suitable candidates for parent governor positions."</UL></FONT>
<P>
Both Opposition parties have made that point.
<P>
However, the amendment highlights a problem, which exists especially when a small school draws children from several parishes, or when a secondary school takes children from many parishes. That happens often in north Yorkshire. In those circumstances, it is difficult to choose the appropriate representative. With that proviso, we support the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, and hope that the Government can incorporate the amendment in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I want to speak briefly in support of the amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton tabled. It is important to consider the community as a whole. In many villages, the school, the parish council and often the church form the spirit and core of the local community. That is important to many people. It cannot be brushed aside lightly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred to the problems of obtaining parent governors compared with the ease of finding parish or town council governors. There is a difference between the interests of a parent governor and those of a parish or town council governor. We value parent governors, and believe that it is important to have a parental voice on governing bodies. The parent represents parents' interests on the governing bodies, whereas the parish or town council-appointed governor represents the wider community interests when studying issues relating to the school. That is an essential part of the jigsaw for local schools, which it is important to retain within the existing system.
<P>
As we have heard, the system operates successfully and is highly valued by the parish and town councils and, I suggest, by those schools that are able to have such an extra link with their local councils and communities. I hope that it is a sin of omission rather than commission by the Government and that they will see the error of their ways and recognise and reinforce the importance of the local community by accepting the amendment and putting the ability to appoint parish or town council governor representatives into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I also support the amendment, which is in keeping with the Conservative party's tradition of supporting the small platoons in our country, compared with the big brother approach of the Labour party. We have seen that approach creeping into the Bill in so many ways, despite the Minister's protestations of reasonableness.
<P>
It is important to support the amendment because it is yet another way in which the running of the school could be anchored to the local community. Local communities best understand the way in which schools can be run. Not so many minutes ago, the Minister's crass remarks about Surrey LEAs demonstrated how difficult it is for those at the centre of a huge Department to understand the way in which matters are progressing. The Government have demonstrated that there is little understanding of how efficient LEAs are run, let alone how efficient schools are run, in the context of local circumstances. Parish councillors understand local circumstances, which is why they get on to the Parish council and are re-elected. They are eminently qualified to play a part in the running of their local school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> On this occasion, I have been invited to speak for England, not just for Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): And Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> No, Scotland does not come within the provisions of the Bill. My appearance is probably a prize for my voting record having increased by about 600 per cent. today, according to the Government Whip.
<P>
There is a great deal of common ground between the Government and the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties the argument is about the way to achieve a common objective. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton stressed the importance of the community and suggested that the Government were not committed to the concept or had to go to America to learn about it.
<P>
I gently remind the hon. Lady that there are no stronger communities than those in Wales. I live in a former mining village and I know how organic the link is between the local community and the schools. I chide her with the fact that there is no reference in her amendment, nor was there in her speech, to community councils in Wales. Together with town councils, they[Mr. Hain]
exist all over Wales, unlike in England where there is patchy representation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) seemed seemed to think that we were retreating from our support of the community and were treading all over community interests. The hon. Member for Guildford, whose rich sense of humour is becoming almost comedian-like, talked of small platoons versus big brothers and other such fanciful nonsense. In fact, there is a great deal of common ground.
<P>
It is helpful that the amendments have been tabled because they allow the Government to make it clear that we want the extremely close relationships between parish, town and community councils in relation to Wales and their schools to continue. They are not being axed, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, and this is a good opportunity to correct what has been a wrong impression. We intend to ensure an opening for minor authority representation. We recognise its value. As Opposition Members have explained, it can add to the strength and cohesion of governing bodies. I do not disagree with any of the sentiments behind that.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The key difference is that governing bodies will be able to choose for themselves whether to co-opt a minor authority representative. Instead of the relationship being ritualistic and automatic, representation would be earned. It would be based on a real relationship between the school and the town or parish council, or, in Wales, the community council. I believe that that will strengthen the relationship.
<P>
Our proposals will also cut delays in the making of minor authority appointments and will allow governing bodies to decide for themselves which minor authority best reflects the needs of the local community. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough mentioned that the catchment areas of some schools in his constituency cover several minor authorities, which could lead to disputes and other problems that we would wish to overcome.
<P>
To introduce a new category of governor, as amendments Nos. 213 to 216 would do, would increase the size of all governing bodies, particularly those of voluntary-aided schools, as a parallel increase in foundation governors would be required to preserve their majority. That may make it difficult for some governing bodies to conduct their business effectively. Taken together with amendment No. 185, there would be two clear routes of entry into governing bodies, which is unnecessary and could create an element of confusion.
<P>
I have some sympathy for the force of argument behind amendment No. 185, but it is far better that that objective a common one is reflected in guidance and good practice. I shall say more about that in a moment. I agree that, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate for LEAs to appoint minor authority nominees as their representatives to use up their allocation by bringing on parish, town or community council representatives. In other circumstances, it may not be appropriate.
<P>
Some primary schools may already have co-opted a minor authority representative and some LEAs may appoint only one or two governors under the Bill. The amendments would considerably restrict the freedom of LEAs to appoint the best person for a school. The Government therefore believe that it is best to allow LEAs to decide their own arrangements in the light of their own circumstances and practice.
<P>
I assure the Committee that we have taken on board what has been said, that we will consider how to reflect that in the guidance, and that we shall consult with interested parties. For example, we intend to make it explicit in regulations that primary school governing bodies should consider co-opting minor authority representatives. We shall make that explicitly clear in regulations. The regulations will also provide for voluntary-aided primary schools to co-opt governors nominated by minor authorities, although there is no general provision for those schools to co-opt governors.
<P>
Through guidance, we shall encourage governing bodies to consider co-opting representatives of town, parish or community councils on to governors' committees, which can include non-governors in their membership. That would offer an additional route into the work of a school, if not formally on to the governing body. We shall also encourage local authorities to consider using one of their appointees from a minor authority if they have the room to do so.
<P>
In all, we shall be taking positive steps by regulation and in guidance to local authorities to encourage and strengthen the relationship between schools and their governing bodies and the parish, town or community council. That link is vital. We want it to be strengthened. It should be organic and genuine rather than projected through legislation, which would be unnecessarily restrictive and bureaucratic.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I apologise to the Welsh Under-Secretary I accept what he says about communities in Wales, which epitomise the very point that I made about communities and the community spirit that exists around the village school.
<P>
I am disappointed with the Under-Secretary's reply. He says that there is common ground, but I disagree. He told the Committee a short while ago that the present right to appoint will be withdrawn and that it will be at the discretion of those who have not had to earn their place on the governing body to appoint representatives from a parish or town council who, in his words, will have to earn their place on it. There is no common ground in that taking away a right and making it discretionary certainly does not strengthen the link. The hon. Gentleman should have accepted the amendment, which would strengthen the link. It would certainly maintain the status quo and demonstrate clearly to parish and town councils, and to small communities, that the Government recognise the important role of a parish or town council in the governing bodies of its school or schools.
<P>
The Minister's reply has been very disappointing. I wish to press the amendment to a vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We have heard much in Committee from new Labour about new-style LEAs, new-style schools and new-style governing bodies. I hoped to tempt them that little bit further to talk about new-style elections of representatives and members on governing bodies.
<P>
The new-style Labour Government new Labour has seen fit to acknowledge something that my party has long argued that when people are elected as representatives of constituent groups, it is necessary to have a fair electoral system giving maximum value to individual electors' votes. New Labour has accepted that witness the fact that its Government has introduced proportional elections for the National Assembly for Wales. If the Bill currently being considered in the House goes through, proportional elections for the Scottish Parliament will be introduced. Proportional elections for Europe have also been accepted.
<P>
New Labour has acknowledged the need for PR by setting up a committee, under the chairmanship of my noble Friend Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, to consider proportional representation for United Kingdom elections. It therefore follows logically from all that that there should be new-style electoral systems to ensure a fair voting arrangement, the most effective of these being the single transferable vote. I therefore hope that Labour Members at least will support the amendments so that governors elected by constituent groups will be elected in that way.
<P>
I, for one, am delighted that those involved in elections will be not only parents and teachers we are used to that but non-teaching staff governors, who the Government have now seen fit to include as a separate category. That is warmly to be welcomed. However, if those individuals are to feel that they are properly represented, their representatives must be elected by proportional representation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if we are to retain the balance in the new Labour majority, we ought to hear the views of the Welsh Under-Secretary on the future of proportional representation? We look forward to hearing his view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Indeed, we look forward to that; knowing the Welsh Under-Secretary's views on proportional representation, we expect him to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> I could not fail to accept the generous invitations extended to me by the Opposition to respond to the debate. About 15 years ago, I wrote a book called "Proportional Misrepresentation" which referred to the House of Commons, not to the Welsh Assembly.
<P>
The argument is about whether a voting system should be made mandatory. STV may well be appropriate and local authorities and governing bodies may well choose to adopt it. Indeed, I understand that the London borough of Sutton has adopted it. It may not be an entirely unrelated fact that the authority is Liberal Democrat-controlled. For all I know, the system may work well.
<P>
We will prepare guidance for LEAs and governing bodies on the conduct of governor elections, and we are happy to include a reference to the use of STV in that guidance [Laughter.] It is a matter for local authorities and governing bodies. I thought that the Opposition were pressing me to adopt that course.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Bath wants to write to my hon. Friend the Minister, concerning England, or to me, concerning Wales, setting out his views on what reference might be made in that guidance to STV as one option for LEAs or governing bodies, we would be happy to consider his suggestions. However, it should be a matter for LEAs and governing bodies to determine; we should not impose a rigid system that could complicate arrangements that have run smoothly in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. I feel that in some way I have been bought off, but I have not quite worked out how. In order to give me time to reflect on the deal, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I want to ask two technical questions about the category of staff governors, to which the hon. Member for Bath referred. In the previous debate, I was considering what might happen in a small primary school where you might have a very limited number of non-teaching staff perhaps two or three. [Interruption.] I was interested in the operation of the single transferable vote in such circumstances [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are always to be deplored. On the use of the word "you", I certainly do not have a small primary school with a staff of one, although I am told that schizophrenia can be quite comfortable.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam, for that inadvertent slip into incorrect language.
<P>
The schedule defines the staff entitled to stand for election as staff governors and refers to those employed under a contract for services. A contract supervisor might be allocated work in a certain school or throughout an LEA. Does the definition include staff providing, for example, school meals or cleaning under a contract across an LEA, or does it include only those who work within the confines of a school?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I would be grateful if the Minister would give the clarification that I sought earlier. Unlike schedule 4, on school organisation committees, and schedule 5, on adjudicators, the schedule provides no indemnity for school governors. Can the Minister explain why that is so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Obviously, I shall ask the Committee to agree to the schedule. As the hon. Member for Maidenhead said, staff governors will include those employed under a contract of employment or a contract for services. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should either switch their pagers to go off silently, as I have done, or take out the batteries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Provided that an individual works for part of the week in the school in question, he or she can become a staff governor in that school. Through the contract for services route, such people have links with individual schools.
<P>
The question of indemnity for governors is more difficult. The general rule is that, provided governors act in a reasonable manner, there is no personal liability. If a governor fails to act in a reasonable manner, he or she incurs personal liability as a governor. That is wholly appropriate. We do not want to give people the green light to act unreasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does not the Minister recognise the risk that a governor might act in good faith and believe that he or she is acting in a reasonable manner, but a court of law might find that that action was not reasonable, so the governor would be inadvertently exposed to serious liability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This issue arises in courts of law fairly frequently. When people act unreasonably even though they thought they were acting in good faith, the courts must judge what a reasonable person would do in similar cirumstances. If the court were to decide that a reasonable person would have acted in that way, the governor would be in the clear.
<P>
We cannot allow people to act unreasonably even though they think that they are acting in good faith. In such circumstances, a court would not find in favour of the governor. I hope that I have clarified all the matters raised under schedule 9, and that it will be agreed to.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mine went off as well, but silently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> My hon. Friend's bleeper just vibrates a lot when it goes off.
<P>
Amendment No. 57 is a serious amendment, even though I have begun my remarks rather light-heartedly. I refer hon. Members to schedule 10 paragraph 3(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The governing body may do anything which appears to them to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of, or in connection with, the conduct of the school."
<P>
That is a bold statement. I do not believe that the Government intended it to be included unqualified. I clearly understand that sub-paragraph (8) makes [Interruption.]
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that members of the Committee are getting a bit hungry, but the hon. Gentleman is entitled to be listened to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I accept that sub-paragraph (8) provides some qualification of the provision. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) have effect subject to <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any provisions of the school's instrument of government; and
<P>
(b) any provisions of a scheme under section 46 which relates to the school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, without amendment, the provision could give rise to all kinds of disputes and challenges in a school. In most schools, disputes between the head and the governing body are rare. However, they happen occasionally and existing legislation primary or secondary could well bring a head and staff into conflict with the governors. I am sure that that is not the Under-Secretary's intention and the amendment is an attempt to limit that possibility. It would make the provision subject to both the Bill and all other Acts in force. The governing body would thus, in exercising its powers, have to take cognisance of all legislation in effect at the time.

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> It is entirely reasonable to expect governing bodies to act as the hon. Gentleman outlined. It is so reasonable that the amendment is not needed. Governing bodies, like all other groups or individuals, must abide by the law of the land. I am happy to state in Committee that there is no need to add the words in the amendment [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A mobile telephone seems to be switched on in the Committee Room now. Those are equally deplored by Madam Speaker and if the item is not in the possession of a member of the Committee, I shall have to clear the Gallery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for her comments and agree that it is expected that governing bodies will and that the vast majority do act reasonably. Given her assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 221, in page 133, leave out lines 30 and 31.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 222 and 223.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The amendments are all linked. They are intended to remove an unintentional extension of the Secretary of State's power over governing bodies' ability to dispose of land. We consider that the Secretary of State should exercise such powers only where the land has been purchased or improved with public money. If no public money has been involved, we consider that governing bodies should have the freedom to sell or dispose of land without the approval of the Secretary of State. A Government new clause will be tabled later in our proceedings to deal with playing fields. The amendments deal only with land that has been improved with public money, and only in those circumstances will the Secretary of State have the power to approve of disposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I very much welcome the amendments, which bear a marked resemblance to amendments that we tabled and the Committee discussed last week. They require a distinction to be drawn between the assets of schools that are financed by public funds and the assets of schools that come from within the revenue of the local community and the institution of the school. I agree with the Minister and I welcome the fact that the Government have tabled amendments that reflect the thinking that informed the amendments that we tabled last week.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e) prescribing the levels, and means of payment, of remuneration to clerks.".
<P>
The Committee will be aware that part III refers to the appointment of the clerk to the governing body. It covers the way in which the appointment will be made, how the clerk may be dismissed and arrangements for what should happen if the clerk fails to attend a meeting. It is important that, in the regulations, reference is made to the remuneration and the means of payment of the clerk, which is why we tabled the amendment.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> We want to resist the Liberal Democrats' centralising tendency. As members of the Committee know, clerks carry out an exceptionally important job, but the type of job they do, how much work they do and what they are expected to do varies from school to school and from local authority to local authority. The appointment of a clerk and other such matters are best left to local decision making and we ask the Committee not to accept the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) This section shall not apply to those schools where articles of government already exist in accordance with Chapter VI of the Education Act 1996."</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to one of the provisions that has been inadequately justified by the Government. The clause, and supporting schedule 12, will remove many of the freedoms that existed under grant-maintained school legislation, in particular, and under other legislation, for schools to develop a system of government that reflected their objectives and the specific circumstances of the local community.
<P>
The amendment would allow articles of government that had been the subject of considerable discussions between the Department and schools, not all of which would be related to a school's grant-maintained status; many of them would be related to nitty-gritty issues concerning the management of a school. The Bill will sweep all that away, without taking proper cognisance of both the work that went into the process and the thinking that lay behind it.
<P>
Schedule 12 defines in narrow terms the scope of the instrument of government envisaged by the Government. It will confine excessively narrowly the capacity of those engaged in the drawing up of an instrument of government to determine several issues that are of concern to governors, teachers, parents and the community when they are thinking about how a school will evolve. For example, paragraph 1 refers to the capacity of an instrument of government in the context of a school with a religious character to describe the ethos of the school. Will the Minister explain why the capacity of an instrument of government to define[Mr. Dorrell]
the ethos of the school should exist only in schools of a religious nature 
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a Division in the House. I said earlier that I would suspend the Committee until 8.30 pm. In the business motion on the Floor of the House, provision is made for a Division at 8.30 pm. I shall therefore suspend the Committee until about 8.40 pm.

<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>8.41 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Before we suspended, I was developing the argument in support of amendment No. 219, which would amend clause 36. Its purpose is to probe the reason why the Government are anxious to introduce a uniform article of government to replace the different articles of government that were negotiated under the terms not of chapter VI but of chapter VI of part II of the Education Act 1996.
<P>
Paragraph 1 of schedule 12, for which the clause is essentially the paving clause, says that the article of government of a maintained school shall set out a number of things: the name of the school; the category of school; the name of the governing body; the manner in which the governing body is to be constituted; some details about foundation governors, where relevant; and details of its status as a community special school. It concludes with sub-paragraph (g):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where the school has a religious character, a description of the ethos of the school; and
(h) the date when the instrument takes effect."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The implication is that those are the only issues that are relevant to an article of government in the Government's vision of the world. That is a very narrow document. Under existing arrangements, terms are enshrined within articles of government of schools. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee some assurance that the work that was done to develop those statements of ethos and manner of proceeding within a school should not all be thrown away. They reflect the view of those directly engaged in the school of the type, history and objectives of the school that they are seeking to run.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I hope that I can assist the right hon. Gentleman. I am very conscious of the hard work that many schools have put in to develop their own articles to reflect their priorities and ethos. It would be a mistake to deny those schools the opportunity to incorporate those provisions in the new arrangements. It also illustrates why we need to have at least a common set of procedures, through the instruments applying to all schools. That is what the Bill proposes. There is nothing to deny schools the opportunity of adding to those procedures the detail that might at present be included in the articles of government.
<P>
The previous Government commissioned an investigation through Professor Harris at Liverpool John Moores university to look at the extend to which articles were being used by individual schools and the variations within them. Many of them were found to be out of date and would not have stood up to legal scrutiny if they had been challenged. The Government took the view that it would be better to remove the requirement to have articles and instead have a common instrument of government, details of which are in schedule 12. That would provide a narrow and focused set of requirements and there will be nothing to stop individual schools adding to them. In the light of the comments made by the right hon. Gentleman, I would like to point out that the Government will be introducing regulations to guide and assist schools. We can then build on the good practice that many of us have seen in articles developed by individual schools over the years.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Although the articles are enshrined in the 1996 Act, will the Minister point out where in the Bill it states that the Government are repealing the articles of a school? I cannot see that in th Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am not sure whether there is a specific measure to repeal; if there is, it will be towards the end of the Bill in the section that deals with measures to be repealed. No, I remember it is dealt with in clause 120(4). We are moving to a situation in which instruments, rather than articles, will be the method. We can ensure, by regulations, that we provide a vehicle for governing bodies to add to their instruments those aspects that they have found helpful over recent years. The instruments offer a narrow framework, and, to answer the right hon. Member for Charnwood's question, the regulations will give schools the flexibility to add to the instruments the sorts of detail that they found useful in the existing articles.

<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I was encouraged that the Minister said that if the school's existing articles were useful, practical and beneficial, there would be nothing to prevent their incorporation into the new instruments of government. If there was an objection from the local education authority, which did not wish to see those articles incorporated within the instruments, would the Secretary of State intervene on the side of the school, to ensure that its articles would continue to be allowed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The instruments are set out in schedule 12. The Government take the view that provided that the instruments are reasonable and have been in operation over recent times, there is no reason why a school should not be able to add to them. The regulations will be the vehicle that allows individual schools to do that.
<P>
I hope that my comments have clarified the matter to the satisfaction of the right hon. Member for Charnwood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who has been helpful. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) raised the important point that a school's established custom and practice should prevail, even if that were contested by some forces locally. I hope that the Minister's comments can be taken to be a presumption that that would be the case, and that we do not move to a position in which all the agreed details would have to be renegotiated into the instrument of government.
<P>
I am grateful that the Minister has recognised that instruments of government can cover a broader range of subjects than those set out in paragraph 1. If that is the position, the wording is slightly odd. Paragraph 1 does not state that the instrument of government for a maintained school "shall include", but:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The instrument of government for a maintained school shall set out",
<P>
which could create the impression that it is an exhaustive list. I hope that what the Minister said implies otherwise.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Byers:</B> Our aim is that regulations will provide the vehicle for adding the instruments and details contained in schedule 11. The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that as it now stands, a device may not be specifically referred to. However, we shall make regulations to allow the addition of material that individual schools might find helpful and that may be reflected in their present articles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not want to pursue the matter further at this stage, but a written clarification by letter would be helpful. If the effect of schedule 12 is, as the Minister implied, to create an exclusive list of subjects to be covered in the instruments of government, I cannot see how it can be extended by regulation. The Minister has agreed to the substance of our criticisms and the Government may be willing to amend the schedule on Report. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Willis:</B> This is an extremely important amendment and I would be grateful if the Government would consider it carefully before opposing it. In reply to our debate on amendment No. 219, the Minister said that it was important to have common sets of procedures. That argument was put when rejecting the right hon. Member for Charnwood's amendment.
<P>
The relationship between the head teacher and the governing body is crucial to the effective running of a school. Nothing is more important, particularly if we consider the relationship between the head and the chairman of governors.
<P>
I was late entering the House yesterday because I attended the funeral of a fine chair of governors, Mrs. Sybil Mansell, an ex-Conservative county councillor in north Yorkshire. The Minister will know that she was the chairman of governors of St. Aidan's school in Harrogate. I am eternally grateful to the Minister for announcing that under the Government's new deal, a 24-year plea for new classrooms for a modern language block will be realised. That was one of Sybil Mansell's great ambitions, so I should like to put on record my thanks and those of St. Aidan school for making one of her dreams come true before she sadly passed away.
<P>
Sybil Mansell epitomised, in many ways the qualities of a good chair of governors and demonstrated the great effect that such a chair can have on a school. The amendment would ensure that the regulations would not represent an optional extra, but would provide a clear statement of the responsbilities of the head teacher and the chairman of the governing body.
 <P>
Amendment No. 58 would change the word "may" to "shall". Most head teachers would value knowing exactly where their operational responsibilities lay. It is like the relationship between a chief constable and a police authority although for North Yorkshire, that is perhaps rather inappropriate. For a good police authority, however, there is a very clear definition between the role of a good police authority and that of the chief constable. It is crucial that each school should know exactly where it stands. We want to see that enshrined in regulations.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 arises from what has happened in grant-maintained schools. The Minister was generous enough to say that the Government have learned from examining the good practice of GM schools. The governing bodies in all GM schools have operated under standing orders. Again, head teachers value enormously a good relationship with the governing body.
<P>
The amendments are sensible. They would clarify roles and enable schools and the governing body to be run effectively with a minimum of challenge.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I acknowledge the tribute that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough paid to Sybil Mansell from St. Aidan's school, whose funeral he attended yesterday. I did not know the lady, but I know of chairs of governing bodies and governors who make a real difference to their schools. The loss of a chair of the governing body can have as significant an impact on the community as the loss of a good teacher or head teacher. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will extend our sympathy to the school, with our thanks for her work.
<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough wants to achieve. The relationship between the governing body and the head teacher is important. That key factor does not need defining until things go wrong, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to let us include that in our consultation on the regulations. It is an important matter and we want to get it right. The Department has already begun the process of drawing together the regulations on which we want to consult. We shall report to the House on that consultation.
<P>
As for standing orders, nothing can stop those schools that have them from continuing to use them. I do not want to say that all schools should have standing orders; that would be too prescriptive. However, as part of the consultation process, we will be happy to test the water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> With those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): I would like an explanation of the regulations. Am I right in thinking that if we do not get it right first time, Ministers automatically will have the power to amend the regulations? I hope that we are not stuck with having to get it right the first time.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Of course, Ministers always get it right first time I am talking about the present Government, not the previous one. Ministers accept that circumstances change, so if there is a need to review and change regulations, we have the facility to do so.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I rise briefly to ask why the Government are drawing a distinction between the power to determine the school term times of foundation and voluntary aided schools, which rests with the governing body, and community schools, which rests with the LEA. The Under-Secretary has made many speeches about the need to delegate decision making, yet the Government are drawing a distinction between those different types of school. For the life of me, I cannot understand why a community school is not deemed capable of deciding its own term dates.

<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am seeking guidance. I do not know whether the position has changed from the previous system for local authority-maintained schools. I am not sure of the answer to that question and shall be happy to clarify it, but I suspect that it has to do with the nature of the different relationship between community schools and local authorities, as opposed to other groups of schools and local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sure that that is right, but the Government are creating new types of school. They say at every opportunity that they want to encourage delegation. We are considering community schools, voluntary-aided schools and foundation schools and I do not understand why the Government are making a conscious policy choice to distinguish between foundation and voluntary-aided schools, and community schools. Why should term times not be decided locally in all cases?

<H4><center>Annual parents' meetings</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I rise briefly to ask Ministers to give some thought on Report as to whether or not it might be appropriate on some occasions, for the governing body of a maintained school to decide that it is impractical to hold a meeting in a particular year, without there being a further requirement in subsection (3)(b) that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at least 50 per cent. of the registered pupils at the school are boarders".</UL></FONT>
<P>
The vast majority of members of the Committee are concerned that the governing body is seen to be accountable. That is extremely important. However, many of us know from both personal and constituency experience, that the best form of accountability is not the annual governors meeting for parents, which is often poorly attended. It is not unusual to find only six or seven parents on a wet Thursday night sitting on undersized chairs in a school hall. It is not an effective form of accountability. While I do not want to propose a detailed amendment, it is an issue that the Government must consider carefully. The Government may want to consider including a requirement that such a meeting be held if a certain proportion of parents request it if they do not want one, they do not have to have one and that the annual report be published and circulated to parents.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> My concern also relates to subsection (3)(b) and involves the fact that the governing body may decide that holding the annual parents meeting is impractical if at least 50 per cent. of the registered pupils are boarders. That would particularly affect schools which provide for children with special educational needs, and I suggest to the Minister that it would not be impractical in the interests of openness and involving parents for such an annual meeting to be held on the last day of term. That is common practice in the private sector.
<P>
The last day of a term or a year is often the only time when parents come to the school to collect their children, as they often do from boarding schools and therefore presents a good opportunity. I would not want a governing body to use the clause as a cop-out for not holding an annual meeting when that would provide an ideal opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> On the final point raised by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, the provision reflects a measure enacted by a Conservative Government. However, there is merit in what she said; I take her point and will reflect on it. As is the way with such things, this measure consolidates previous provisions. The hon. Lady has made a good point, and we will reflect on it and seek ways to return to the matter on Report.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Bath, we all know that some annual parents meetings are a bit ofa disaster; but some are highly successful, and we need to learn from the best. It may well be that in the new climate and under the new procedures introduced in the Bill with targets being set for individual schools and with schools being included in the local education authority's education development plan there will be greater interest among parents about the targets for individual schools and whether they are being met. We must wait to see whether that is the case.
<P>
We need to encourage good practice and to show schools what works in neighbouring schools. I have been struck by schools in some of the most deprived parts of my inner city Tyneside constituency that get a good attendance at their annual parents meetings because they make a real effort and link them to a social event something that is a bit more fun. As the hon. Member for Bath says, once one has sat on an infant-sized seat for five minutes and one's knees have cracked, it becomes difficult to concentrate on what is going on. Occasionally, there is a deliberate attempt to make it unattractive for parents to attend the meeting.
<P>
I would be reluctant to agree to removing the requirement for an annual parents meeting. That does not mean that the Government believe that they are all working well at present. They are working well in some cases, but not all. If we can promote good practice, that will be constructive.
<P>
With those comments, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 42 should stand part of the Bill.
