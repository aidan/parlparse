						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000201"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> May I say, Mr. Chope, that it is a great
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship&#151;there was no
opportunity to say that formally in the morning&#146;s evidence
session? I also thank the Financial Secretary and her officials for
their assistance this morning. It is the first time that I have
conducted an evidence session of that sort, and I think the same goes
for the Financial Secretary. It was an interesting experience, enjoyed
by some but possibly not by
others.</div>
					<a name="08011672000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
discussing amendments Nos. 1 and 5 in detail and what precisely we are
trying to do, it might be helpful to touch upon the broader issue that
we discussed this morning. Although we welcome the simplification of
the system and share the Government&#146;s view that the objective of
aligning national insurance with income tax is desirable, one of our
concerns, which we seek to address with amendment No. 1, is that the
way in which the Bill is drafted could lead to a substantial reduction
in Parliament&#146;s ability to scrutinise legislation in those
areas.</div>
					<a name="08011672000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we discussed this morning and questioned the officials, national
insurance contributions&#151;their rates and thresholds&#151;are
generally amended by secondary legislation within a framework of
restrictions laid out in primary legislation. One of those restrictions
is that the upper earnings limit must be between six and half and seven
and a half times the primary threshold. That restriction is being taken
away. I put it to the Financial Secretary this morning that she was
&#147;dismantling&#148; those restrictions&#151;a word that she
did not disagree with. We are left in a position in which a Government
are capable of increasing the upper earnings limit through a simple 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>affirmative resolution procedure, which has not previously been
possible. Consequently, personal taxation could be increased by 11 per
cent. for all earnings over &#163;43,000, with very little
parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="08011672000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
Members might welcome that as a desirable policy. My point is not to
argue the pros and cons of that particular policy but to argue that it
would be wrong to make such an increase without proper parliamentary
scrutiny. It is worth stressing that there is a strong body of opinion
within the governing party that there is an argument for increasing tax
rates. I will not dwell on that, but there is the Fabian Society paper
&#147;Narrowing the Gap&#148;, launched in March 2006 by the
Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families, which called for a 50p top rate tax. Also the Exchequer
Secretary&#151;who spoke on Second Reading&#151;was asked, at a
Fabian society fringe event at the last Labour party conference, if her
party faced a challenge from its opponents regarding the top end of the
tax scale; she replied that it did and that she for one hoped that they
would be doing a bit of talking about it. Here is an easy way of
legislating for just that&#151;one affirmative resolution and we can
have, effectively, a 52 per cent. top rate
band.</div>
					<a name="08011672000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011672000202"></a>
							<b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): Can the hon.
Gentleman talk us through that a bit more? My understanding is that if
one takes, for example, the lower earnings limit of &#163;100 which,
using the current ratio of seven and a half, would cap the upper
earnings limit at &#163;750 a week, and then one changes that ratio
to eight and a half, the figure would go up from &#163;750 to
&#163;850. For some taxpayers that would, in fact, be a tax cut,
because the point at which they would start to pay 40 per cent. tax
would move from &#163;750 to &#163;850 a week. Is that not contrary
to what the hon. Gentleman
said?</div>
					<a name="08011672000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000203"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He could
easily bring me on to one of the other amendments. To answer briefly,
there is nothing in the Bill that means that an increase in the upper
earnings limit for national insurance contributions will also mean an
automatic increase of the point at which people will start to pay
higher rate income tax. We will discuss that in greater detail in a few
minutes. Were such a thing to exist, his logic would be absolutely
right. But it does not exist and therefore it would be perfectly
possible to abolish the upper earnings limit on the basis of an
affirmative resolution and consequently have a much higher rate of tax
on personal income. That was, essentially, the policy of the Labour
party in the 1992 general election, which was when the Financial
Secretary and one or two other members of the Committee were first
elected to Parliament. <i class="I">[Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">] </i>Many moons ago the
Financial Secretary says, and I know that that is not her position now.
I think that that policy was abandoned after the 1992 general
election.</div>
					<a name="08011672000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested, looking at <i class="I">Hansard</i> from 16 December 1993, to see
that my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)
took an intervention from the then hon. Member for Liverpool,
Broadgreen&#151;now the Financial Secretary&#151;in which she
said:</div>
					<a name="08011672000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The hon.
Member has spoken about the need to ensure that those contributing to
the fund contribute enough to pay benefits. Why is it that the
Government's proposals retain the ceiling on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>national insurance contributions, which throws the greatest burden on
people on lower
earnings?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011672000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
then asked the then Member for Liverpool, Broadgreen if that was Labour
party policy, and the response
was:</div>
					<a name="08011672000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is a
question of fairness and the importance of ensuring that people
contribute fairly to the national insurance
fund.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 16 December 1993; Vol.
234, c. 1327.]</div>
					<a name="08011672000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
argument is not to take on the merits of that case, although I disagree
with it and I think that the Financial Secretary disagrees with it; it
is not stated Government policy. However, it is perfectly possible for
a future Government, if not the current one&#151;but certainly not
one that I would be involved in&#151;to say, &#147;We wish to
raise&#148;&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>I am touched by the
views of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West on where the
future may lie. The fact is that the Bill will enable such a momentous
policy and a substantial change in the way taxes are calculated to be
carried out by simply abolishing the upper earnings limit. There is
nothing within the proposed structures to prevent that from happening,
and we therefore seek to deal with that objective in some of our
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011672000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I also
discuss the issue of the ratio that we discussed a little this morning?
We pursued the matter with officials to try to properly understand what
the requirements are and whether it is necessary to change the current
arrangements. I think that there was some uncertainly in all parties as
to what the exact numbers would be. I have gone away and done some sums
on what the upper earnings limit would be on a weekly basis. The then
Chancellor in his budget speech of 21 March 2007, <i class="I">Official
Report,</i> columns 826-27, stated that the top rate of income tax from
April, 2009 will start at &#163;43,000. I am not quite sure what
methodology the Treasury used to translate that figure into a weekly
amount, but if that is done on the basis of dividing that by 365 and
then multiplying by seven, we end up with a figure of &#163;824.66.
If in those circumstances in 2009-10 the primary threshold is
&#163;110&#151;we do not yet know if it will be that, but we know
it will be &#163;105 the previous year&#151;the ratio of seven and
a half which exists in the current legislation, would actually be
sufficient.</div>
					<a name="08011672000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
fair, if the sum was done in a slightly different way&#151;by simply
dividing &#163;43,000 by 52&#151;we would end up with a figure of
&#163;826.92. That would be slightly over the limit. So, as the hon.
Member for Taunton pointed out, seven and a half looks to be there or
thereabouts. It might not do quite what is necessary, but it is very,
very close. Is it therefore necessary, in these circumstances, to
completely throw out the structure that we have, and could we not
simply widen the ratio to somewhere between six and eight rather than
six and half to seven and a half? Were we to do that, we would not only
comfortably be able to meet the requirements on the basis of the
numbers we have, but there would be quite some leeway.</div>
					<a name="08011672000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even on the basis of the
primary threshold for 2009-10 remaining at &#163;105&#151;that is
no increase at all from the year before&#151;that would still enable
the upper earnings limit to be raised to &#163;43,800, well in
advance of the &#163;43,000 that we have in mind. If the primary
threshold were to rise by &#163;5 to &#163;110 and we had a ratio
of eight, we could increase the upper earnings limit to
&#163;45,886.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>
					<a name="08011672000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011672000204"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): One of the attractions of
keeping the seven and a half multiplier as the upper limit is that if
the Government want more leeway at the top of the scale, they would
need to increase the bottom number&#151;the &#163;105 or
&#163;110 figure. That would have the helpful benefit of assisting
some lower earners, who have missed out due to other tax changes in the
Budget.</div>
					<a name="08011672000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000205"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, and, of course, this
would be another option available to the Government if they were to
find themselves short by a relatively small amount. That is an argument
for maintaining the current ratio. It is a reasonable argument, and the
criticism that could be made of amendment No.1 is that we are being too
generous to the Government by allowing them to widen the bands in this
way. But that is the intention behind amendment No.1, as well as
amendment No. 2, which applies the same provisions within the
equivalent legislation for Northern
Ireland.</div>
				
					<a name="08011672000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011672000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should say a
word about how the amendments work. Anyone who has just picked up the
amendments and looked at amendment No. 1 could be forgiven for thinking
that it is somewhat curious, because all it does is omit
&#147;half&#148;. I should explain that in context. Section 5(3) of
the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, as amended by
the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, states that the upper
earnings limit is seven times the primary threshold or that
it</div>
					<a name="08011672000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exceeds or falls
short of 7 times that sum by an amount not exceeding half that
sum&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011672000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confess
that the first time&#151;indeed, the second, third and fourth
times&#151;I read that, I was somewhat confused. At one point I
thought it meant something different. I will say, reasonably
confidently, what I think it means. The &#147;that sum&#148; is the
primary threshold: so, we are talking about seven times the primary
threshold and about an amount not exceeding half the primary threshold.
The primary threshold is &#163;100 at the moment, so if the upper
earnings limit is not seven times that, which is &#163;700, then as
long as it is within half of &#163;100, or &#163;50, then it
complies with the ratio. I hope that makes it all terribly clear,
Mr.
Chope.</div>
					<a name="08011672000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis,
by deleting &#147;half&#148;, I have not done much for the elegance
of an already inelegant clause or section but, essentially, that means
that as long as we are within an amount equivalent to the primary
threshold on either side of seven times the primary threshold, then we
comply with the ratio. That mechanism expands the ratio from between
six and half and seven and a half to between six and
eight.</div>
					<a name="08011672000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
behind the amendment, and subsequent ones, is to attempt to provide
some protection for Parliament. It does not prevent the Government from
making the changes to the tax system that were outlined in the 2007
Budget. We will hear whatever objections will be made, but all of us,
on both sides of the Committee, believe that Parliament has an
important role, particularly in the area of taxation, and should guard
that role carefully. The current proposals give too much freedom to the
Executive and too small a role for Parliament. Politicians from all
parties have spoken about the importance of Parliament. Here is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>practical example of where there is a problem. The amendment is, in some
respects, a small but technical measure, but could prevent the sort of
abuse that I outlined at the beginning of my remarks, where a
Government may come in and make a fairly substantial change to the
taxation system but through a means that involves little parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="08011672000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000206"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> May I take the hon. Gentleman back to omitting
&#147;half&#148;, which I have been pondering? He will correct me
if I misunderstood what he said&#151;that omitting
&#147;half&#148; would change the ratio from between six and a half
and seven and a half to between six and eight. My understanding is that
the &#147;half&#148; is a margin of error figure, so that it is
around 7. So, if one omits &#147;half&#148;, it has to be spot on
7, it does not expand it to between six and
eight.</div>
					<a name="08011672000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000207"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a fair point. That is how
I understand it. He is right that section 5(3)(a) says that it has to
be seven times, before then going on to the margin of error. I have not
deleted that in its entirety. What I have deleted is
&#147;half&#148;, where the margin of error is half the primary
threshold. If we take out &#147;half&#148;, we just have the
primary threshold. I hope that that clarifies the position. The margin
of error&#151;it was helpful of the hon. Gentleman to use that
expression&#151;is widened, becoming the value of the primary
threshold both up and down, rather than half the primary
threshold.</div>
					<a name="08011672000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
modest amendment, which will not prevent the Government from achieving
what they have set out to do. However, it will permit parliamentary
scrutiny to continue and prevent any large-scale increase, or indeed
abolition, of the upper earnings limit without appropriate
parliamentary scrutiny.</div>

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):
						</b> Let me
add my words of appreciation to those offered by the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire and say what a pleasure it is to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. This morning was an
interesting experience&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I
apologise if it was not quite as interesting for some members of the
Committee as it was for others, but I certainly need debriefing about
it to see how valuable it was. As I said, I had not expected a number
of the questions. Sensibly, a lot of questions dealt with the figures,
which was absolutely appropriate, and we had a thorough sitting. I hope
that that means that we will have a fairer wind than we might otherwise
have done this afternoon.</div>
					<a name="08011672000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made an elegant speech and he is always thoughtful when
challenging what the Government are doing. He talked about a momentous
change in the way in which the Government are allowed to set the rate
of national insurance contributions. He said that nothing in the new
structures would prevent a future Government from using the Bill as a
lever significantly to increase tax rates. He was also concerned about
parliamentary procedures and the opportunity to consider proposals
properly.</div>
					<a name="08011672000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to go too wide and I shall come to the amendments, Mr.
Chope, but let me say at the outset that the Government&#146;s
reforms of the welfare state 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>since 1997 reflect our aim of eradicating child poverty and supporting
people to balance their work and family lives. The personal tax package
that we discussed at some length this morning represents the next stage
in our programme to reform the tax and benefit system. The Bill is
required to ensure that those changes can be fully implemented and that
the benefits of that package can be fully realised.</div>
					<a name="08011672000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why we cannot introduce a new ratio to calculate the
upper national insurance contribution limit. We see no reason to
reintroduce an arbitrary ratio, given our proposal that future changes
to the upper earnings limit will be subject to approval by both Houses
of Parliament. As we have made clear, removing the restriction on the
upper earnings limit will provide for significant simplification and
allow the two main rates of income tax and NICs to apply to the same
bands of income, creating one of the simplest personal tax structures
in any developed country.</div>
					<a name="08011672000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
commitment, I see no reason why the 11 per cent. level at which
employees stop paying NICs should be subject to legislative
restrictions, when the point at which they start paying NICs is subject
to none. We could apply a cap of a multiple of the primary threshold in
the way that we have done, but there is no similar restriction on the
level of the primary threshold, and we touched on that this
morning.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000209"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> The Financial Secretary raises a fair point about
the restriction at the bottom end. Ideally, if one is going to have a
restriction at the top end, one should have a restriction at the bottom
so that one could lower it in such a way as to break the ratio. The
Financial Secretary&#146;s criticism is that there is no restriction
at the bottom end, but there is of course a ratio. So, it would not be
possible to reduce the primary threshold to a low figure unless the
Government also reduced the upper earnings limit by a correspondingly
low amount. In that sense, the continuation of the ratio protects both
the top and the
bottom.</div>
					<a name="08011672000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000210"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point. As we discussed this morning, the lower earnings threshold is
aligned with the lower income tax threshold. We have been working to
keep those in alignment for a considerable time. We are now seeking to
align the upper level. Our primary goal is the policy objectives I was
talking about earlier. Simplification being one of the major drivers of
those, we will establish that link, and seek to maintain it. To
reintroduce a legislative restriction on it would limit the Government
in its work towards achieving its
objectives.</div>
					<a name="08011672000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, each year Members of both Houses will have the opportunity to
debate the increase in the upper earnings limit, as the regulations
will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. It was made
clear at the introduction of the primary threshold that it was
introduced to ensure that the point at which income tax and mixed
liability begins is the same. The advantages of our approach are clear.
It will reduce the burden on future legislative programmes, while
retaining proper accountability to the House and an opportunity to
debate the issue.</div>
					<a name="08011672000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire used quotes from one of my
earlier speeches as a rookie in 1993. I have a quote for him, although
it is not one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>of his. It is interesting how rapidly hon. Members,
when in Opposition, adopt a certain position. On 18 February 1997, when
the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) was
Secretary of State for Wales, during the debate on the Welsh
Development Agency Bill about the removal of the borrowing limit
imposed on the Agency, he said
that:</div>
					<a name="08011672000042"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Bill
provides that future increases of the financial limit shall be made by
secondary legislation, using the affirmative resolution procedure. The
advantages are clear.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011672000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seized upon those advantages. The
speech
continued:</div>
					<a name="08011672000044"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
will reduce the burden on future legislative programmes while retaining
proper accountability to the House and an opportunity to debate the

					<a name="08011672000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
absolutely fair and proper that the Opposition express concern and seek
to defend the right of the House to proper scrutiny of the
Government&#146;s actions, but secondary legislation is a perfectly
proper, well tried and tested route by which to do that. I do not have
any reason to believe that what we are proposing will undermine the
ability of either this House or the other place to scrutinise
legislation or Government decisions. I know that the hon. Gentleman has
put the amendment forward in a probing manner and I ask that he not
press it to a

I do not think that that will surprise the Financial Secretary. I know
that she says that there is a Government commitment to ensure
that national insurance contributions are linked to higher rate income
tax&#151;indeed, we will turn to an amendment that relates
specifically to that&#151;but no protection will exist in
legislation. It came out in the evidence session this morning that the
purpose of the previous legislation was to prevent an abrupt increase
in the upper earnings limit irrespective of national insurance
contributions.</div>

							<a name="08011672000233"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> The amendments essentially relate to the
same issue. There is no need to repeat the full arguments, but there is
a dismantling of the restrictions that apply to increases in the upper
earnings limit for national insurance contributions and, for that
matter, the primary threshold. We think that that is undesirable and
wish to address it.</div>
					<a name="08011672000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 2 would remove
clause 1(2). That in itself&#151;the Minister might have been
inclined to point this out&#151;weakens the position because it would
remove regulations specifying the upper earning limit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>from the list of those subject to the affirmative
procedure. However, the amendment must be taken with amendment No. 3,
which would carve out from those matters that can be dealt with by
regulations, whether subject to the affirmative or negative procedure,
any increases in the upper earnings limit in excess of the retail price
index for the previous
year.</div>
					<a name="08011672000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been
reasonable enough under amendment No. 3 to permit increases in the
upper earnings limit in line with prices. However, if amendments Nos. 2
and 3 were agreed to and the Government wished to increase the upper
earnings limit by a higher rate than the rate of inflation, which
presumably will not be a routine occurrence, they would need to do so
through primary
legislation.</div>

							<a name="08011672000237"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> Indeed. While we are finding out&#151;inspiration
comes to us all&#151;I will address amendment No. 4, which is the
most persuasive amendment in the
group</div>
					<a name="08011672000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary has reiterated today that the Government&#146;s policy
objective is to align the upper earnings limit with the point at which
higher rate income tax starts to be paid. Indeed, that is what the then
Chancellor said in his Budget speech of 21 March 2007. Earlier, the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said that if one prevents any
increases in the upper earnings limit, one somehow prevents people from
having a reduction in taxes. There was a reasonable assumption that
this Bill would confirm the policy objective that the Government have
maintained ever since the 2007 Budget: the link between the upper
earnings limit and higher rate income tax. However, there is no link in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011672000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, subject to any comments, suggestions or criticisms about its
technical quality, would enable the Government to increase or decrease
the upper earnings limit as they thought fit, but, when doing so, the
higher rate income tax band would vary with it. It would formalise the
policy objective that the Government have announced, which we support.
The argument in the Budget was that this will simplify matters and we
will have two rates on personal income. Amendment No. 4 would ensure
that that happened.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>
					<a name="08011672000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard today from officials
the view that announcements about the threshold for higher rate income
tax will be made in the autumn statement&#151;or the pre-Budget
report, as it now is&#151;at the same time that announcements are
made for national insurance contribution thresholds. So, from a
practical point of view, it appears that the Government are rightly
going to follow up on their policy announcement. We heard from the
Minister a couple of moments ago how they have maintained the link for
the lower earnings limit. All that we are seeking to do is to formalise
the link so that it is detailed in the Bill. If the Government ever
wished to change their mind and break that link&#151;if they wanted
to abolish the upper earnings limit, to give an extreme
example&#151;they could always do so through further primary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08011672000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 4 is essentially supportive of the Government&#146;s objectives.
It would merely formalise things and protect the position of
Parliament, once again, by enabling it to scrutinise any departure from
stated
policy.</div>

principle.</div>
					<a name="08011672000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group
includes amendments that are equivalent to amendments Nos. 2 to 4 in
respect of the Northern Ireland provisions. I will be particularly
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on formalising the link
between the upper earnings limit and higher rate income
tax.</div>

							<a name="08011672000241"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I am grateful for the way in which these probing
amendments have been put&#151;she says hopefully! I shall talk about
the group of amendments and perhaps mention amendments Nos. 3, 4, 7 and
8, which are intended to retain some form of restriction in primary
legislation on the level of the upper earnings limit that can be set by
secondary legislation. The rationale appears to be&#151;again, it is
similar to the debate that we have just had&#151;that that provides a
greater level of parliamentary control than is provided in the draft
legislation. We debated that earlier, but I will come back to
it.</div>
					<a name="08011672000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 3
and 7 would amend clause 1 so that the upper earnings limit may not be
increased by secondary legislation to a figure that is in excess of the
retail prices index for the month of December in the preceding tax
year. As clause 1 only applies to Great Britain, it appears that
amendment No. 7 mirrors this restriction by amending clause 2 which is
applicable to Northern Ireland, which is one of my favourite
places.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>
					<a name="08011672000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a particular difficulty
with amendments Nos. 3 and 7 in respect of linking the upper earnings
limit to the retail prices index. These amendments would not allow the
Government to align the upper earnings limit from 2009-10 with the
point at which higher rate income tax becomes payable, which is one of
our objectives, because they would not be able to raise the upper
earnings limit in 2008-09 by &#163;800 plus RPI. That would remove
the main purpose of the Bill and a significant
simplification of the national insurance contributions
system.</div>
					<a name="08011672000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
use the September RPI when calculating pensions and benefits uprating
and the mixed re-rating procedures. That needs to take place before the
beginning of the tax year. Those figures are also used in preparing the
annual Government Actuary&#146;s Department report. It would not be
possible to use the December RPI figure and still have the necessary
legislation and amended guidance in place in time. There would be a
knock-on effect for software developers and employers. The hon.
Gentleman should perhaps take the advice of my hon. Friend the Member
for Wolverhampton, South-West about the amendment. The cost attached to
accepting the amendment would be significant; we anticipate it could be
around &#163;700 million. I have talked about the fact that we
currently use the September retail prices index and that using the
December retail prices index would create real difficulties for
employers and payroll developers in amending their software ahead of
the start of the new tax
year.</div>
					<a name="08011672000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 4
is interesting as it also amends clause 1 and appears to be an
alternative to amendment No. 3. However, I understand why amendments
Nos. 4 and 8 are grouped together. Amendment No. 4 aims to restrict the
upper earnings limit so that it cannot be increased by a secondary
legislation above the level of earnings at which the higher rate of
income tax becomes payable.</div>
					<a name="08011672000176"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08011672000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the logic behind amendment No. 4, but both theoretical and practical
difficulties are associated with it. Income tax is an annual charge and
is calculated on a cumulative basis, but national insurance is based on
an earnings period that is normally weekly or monthly. Liability is
calculated each time earnings are paid, which means that, in
legislation, the upper earnings limit is a weekly figure whereas the
level at which the higher rate of income tax becomes payable is an
annual figure. If amendments Nos. 4 and 8 were accepted, the weekly
upper earnings limit could be set at any figure up to &#163;39,825
based on the 2007-08 tax year. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;A week?&#148;] Per week. The upper earnings limit for 2007-08
is currently &#163;670 per week. The amendment would allow the upper
earnings limit to be increased by up to 60 times its current level,
which is far in excess of what we want to do. It could allow the
Government of the day to raise millions of pounds of additional
national insurance contributions and I am sure that is not what
Opposition Members
intended.</div>
					<a name="08011672000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
reason why the amendment is substantially flawed is that the level at
which the higher rate of income tax is to be set does not become law
until after the upper earnings limit for that tax year has been set.
The weekly upper earnings limit is set by regulations that come into
force on 6 April each year, which means 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>that the regulations must be laid before 6 April. Income tax is subject
to the Finance Bill procedure and the Provisional Collection of Taxes
Act 1968, which allows for changes to apply from the beginning of the
tax year. I am not sure whether Opposition Members intended to bring
the national insurance system into the Finance Bill but, as we
discussed this morning, it would take primary legislation to do that.
It is certainly not the Government&#146;s intention to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08011672000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment Nos.
2 and 6, the upper earnings limit can currently be raised by
regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure. Under our
proposals there would have to be a debate in both Houses before it
could be raised. Amendment No. 2 seems to remove the
requirement for the affirmative resolution procedure if either
amendment Nos. 3 or 4 find favour with the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08011672000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change proposed in the Bill
should not give cause for concern in terms of parliamentary scrutiny.
The House always considers the affirmative resolutions that come before
it extremely carefully and I assure the Committee that, as the Minister
who often has to reply to such resolutions, one feels thoroughly
scrutinised as a result of those debates. The amendments taken together
or separately to leave the upper earnings limit to the RPI or to the
higher rate of tax are unworkable for the reasons I have explained. I
understand why the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire wanted to
probe the Government&#146;s position on some of those ideas, but I
recommend that the Committee resist the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011672000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000242"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful for the Financial Secretary&#146;s
informative explanation. As I mentioned, amendments Nos. 2 and 6 need
to be taken with amendments Nos. 3 and 7 because, as she rightly says,
in isolation, amendments Nos. 2 and 6 would weaken the
position.</div>
					<a name="08011672000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments Nos. 3 and 7, her remarks that September should be used for
the date as opposed to December make a strong argument. I will read her
remarks carefully, but if the amendments that we tabled had referred to
September rather than December, I am not sure whether there would be an
overwhelmingly strong argument against them, given what we heard this
morning. If the Government are able to align national insurance
contributions and income tax, it ought to be possible to look at the
way in which the upper earnings limit is increased, in such a way as to
provide a restriction on it in the same way as increases in thresholds
for income tax have been since the days of the Rooker-Wise amendment,
somewhat before my time. We will not press amendments Nos. 3 and 7 and
consequently will not press amendments Nos. 2 and
6.</div>
					<a name="08011672000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments Nos.
4 and 8, I take the technical point that the Financial Secretary raises
with regard to income tax being done on an annual basis and national
insurance contributions being done on a weekly basis. As a consequence,
technically it would appear that these amendments would give the
Government greater flexibility than we intended and would, to all
intents and purposes, be consistent with the Labour party&#146;s 1992
manifesto. They would effectively enable the
abolition of the upper earnings limit if any
Government wanted to do so.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>
					<a name="08011672000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
are therefore ineffective, but we will look at this issue again. If the
technical point can be resolved and if there is an opportunity to look
at this matter in a corrected form, we will do so. Given the comments
about the interpretation of amendment No. 4 that presumably come from
the Treasury, we will not press it and I apologise to my hon. Friends
who might have been looking forward to another valiant effort in
defending parliamentary accountability.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000247"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> The amendments relate to the discussion that we
had, not so much in the evidence session today, but on Second Reading
before Christmas. One of the major points that was discussed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>was that the Bill is part of an overall package of pension reform. It is
a key component of a pension reform that achieved cross-party
consensus. We raised our concern that in the Budget and pre-Budget
report, which signalled the Government&#146;s desire to bring forward
the beginning of flat-rating of the state second pension, there seemed
to be movement from the original pension reform package that we had
agreed. That package came out of the Turner commission report and out
of a desire, as the Government said, to try to simplify the national
insurance and income tax system. We supported the pension reform
package. At the time, although we had concerns about taking away the
link between the extra additional earnings contributions people paid
and what they then got back in the state second pension, we recognised
that the pension package was a question of give and take and of what we
wanted to achieve overall. Our concerns related to the fact that this
was the &#147;take&#148; part of that package, and there was a big
question mark over the &#147;give&#148; part, which was the
re-establishment of the earnings link.</div>
					<a name="08011672000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">These clauses try to tease out
from the Government whether we can make progress on getting some
certainty about re-establishing that link. On Second Reading, Members
raised concerns about the lack of certainty as to when that will
happen. We discussed the fact that the impact assessment provided by
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs identified 2.1 million people,
who would have been paying income tax above the upper earnings limit
and who would have been contracted out of the state second pension.
Those individuals</div>
					<a name="08011672000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
either see a reduction in their take-home pay as they will get a lower
rebate on their national insurance contributions than would otherwise
have been the case or a reduction of the money that goes into their
pension scheme&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011672000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
clearly many people&#151;2.1 million, to be precise&#151;who are
assessed as losing from these changes. We must know that the gains are
going to happen, and when. The timing of that link was critical, and I
am concerned that we have not had much certainty from
the Government about whether they view
re-establishing the earnings links as being affordable, or when
that will happen.</div>
					<a name="08011672000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on the evidence session
today, my greater concern is that, at the time that the alignment of
the upper earnings limit and the upper accruals point took place in the
Budget 2007, there was not at all a clear understanding as to what
impact this would have on people. Not only were options still being
discussed as to how to deliver on this 2030 time frame for achieving
the flat-rate state second pension, there was apparently no costing of
the options because they clearly had not been worked up at the time. It
seems the Treasury waded into this national insurance change without a
good enough understanding of the breadth and nature of the impact it
would have, particularly given that many of the people affected will be
the very same people whom the Institute for Fiscal Studies has
identified as losers from the Budget 2007.</div>
					<a name="08011672000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">These amendments are therefore
all the more important in trying to bring some certainty to the process
of delivering the pension reform package. Before I talk about the
amendments themselves, can I ask the Minister to talk about the 2030
time frame 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>when she responds, and why that particular date is so important? One of
the other ways of achieving flat-rating would have been to make the
changes that were made at the Budget, but then to allow the flat-rating
to continue as planned, aligned with the re-establishment of the
earnings link, and then have that flat-rating achieved at a slightly
later date than 2030-31. Many Conservative Members would like to
understand a little better why that 2030 time frame is so important
that we have to create even more losers than we would have done if the
Government had taken no
action.</div>
				
					<a name="08011672000177"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08011672000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading we were only given limited assurances by the Minister about
when the earnings link for the basic state pension would be
re-established. During my time serving on the Select Committee on Work
and Pensions, the Secretary of State gave us, in the evidence session,
what was I think his annual departmental review. I pressed him on when
he would be able to re-establish the earnings link and he used a phrase
that has been much talked about, that essentially the earnings link
would be re-established at 2012, or at any event by the end of that
Parliament, subject to affordability. I spent what felt like a long 15
minutes trying to get the Secretary of State to say whether he felt
that the affordability aspect of re-establishing the earnings link took
precedence over the 2012 time frame that was clearly the
aspiration&#151;if I can call it that&#151;of the Government. I
also asked him whether, if re-establishing the earnings link in 2012
was viewed as unaffordable given the length of economic cycles, he
thought that perhaps by 2015 the economic cycle and economic situation
would have turned around so much that re-establishing the link would
suddenly become affordable in a long-term
sense.</div>
					<a name="08011672000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did not make any progress&#151;if anything, the message I got was
that affordability was critical. That is why it is of particular
concern now, given that the Government are obviously concerned about
inflationary effects to the extent that police officers and prison
officers have had their review board pay rises turned down or not
accepted. Perversely, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families has today accepted the pay review board outcome for teachers.
Conversely, only last week in Parliament the Secretary of State for
Justice said that he had not accepted the report of the prison
officers&#146; pay review body because of the &#147;exceptional
economic
circumstances&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011672000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is very important therefore for the Minister to talk about what her
assessment is, from a Treasury perspective, of the affordability test
that the Government have set themselves for re-establishing the
earnings link. Because of that uncertainty, the amendments are trying
to provide some certainty. If the earnings link is not re-established
and we continue with the debate, we should not allow the Bill to mean
that all that is being delivered for people in this country is
giving&#151;paying more national insurance contributions but not
getting anything in
return.</div>
					<a name="08011672000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
alternatives. Amendment No. 9 essentially leads to an annual
reassessment of the Bill, to give the House a chance to understand
whether the re-establishment of the earnings link is on the
Government&#146;s agenda and will happen, or whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>there is simply continued rhetoric with no delivery. That would mean
that in the time frame in which the Government has said that it will
look to re-establish the earnings link&#151;mooted as 2012 to around
2015&#151;we would annually have to reaffirm the impact of that part
of the Bill. In terms of delivering the overall pension reform package,
that would provide a safeguard for those people who are paying
more&#151;that they would not be paying more to get nothing in
return.</div>
					<a name="08011672000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
10 is harsher in many respects. It says that there is a time frame of
2012. Unless at that point resolutions have been put before the House,
clearly guaranteeing when the earnings link will be re-established, the
Bill would, by definition, have to lapse. The consensus would have been
broken and the decoupling of the changes to national insurance and to
the basic state pension would have been done to such an extent that the
pension reform that we all agreed would not have been delivered. I hope
that the Financial Secretary can use the opportunity to give us more
assurances about the Government&#146;s thinking on when they see the
earnings link being restored. The amendments are designed to tease out
how confident the Government are that they can deliver on the words
that we have listened to in the House about re-establishing that
earnings link.</div>

On the more substantive point, I thank the hon. Member for Putney for
making something exceedingly clear to me. Hon. Members on this side of
the House have long thought that affordability for the state bears no
relationship whatsoever to Conservative spending plans and does not
enter the equation. It does with this Government and we are absolutely
right to bear it in mind with whatever measures we propose to improve
our society even further than we have in the past eleven and a half
years.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I rise to support the
amendments, because I felt that the evidence given by the Financial
Secretary and her officials at the interesting pre-legislative session
did not cast any further light on the Government&#146;s willingness
to commit themselves to any form of timetable for restoring the
earnings link. The amendments are designed to tease that out, and I
hope that the Financial Secretary will address herself to that point in
her remarks. My near neighbour, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West, is being a little harsh on the Opposition in his assault on
our willingness to accept fiscal rectitude and spending diligence. It
is correct that we have been calling for the Government to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>restore the earnings link and to come up with a definitive timetable for
doing so. That is, frankly, all we are trying to do in this debate in
relation to these amendments. I look forward to what the Minister has
to
say.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000252"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I wonder which party disconnected the link in the
first place.</div>
					<a name="08011672000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has
been a useful debate and I will address my remarks to the amendments. I
am conscious that we may be interrupted, but I will try and deal with
the amendments as succinctly as I can. The hon. Member for Putney made
her case in a well argued and reasonable way. She asked why withdrawing
the earnings-related state second pension by 2030 is so
crucial&#151;why that date? It is quite straight forward. The date
2030 was recommended by the Pensions Commission in order to give
defined benefit schemes time to adjust to the withdrawal of
contracted-out rebates. It is part of a costed package of measures. If
we extended past 2030, we would need to revisit the cost. It is also
needed to provide certainty to savers about what their pension position
would be.</div>
					<a name="08011672000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000253"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for
letting me intervene so early. She is cherry-picking a little; that
same Pensions Commission actually suggested re-establishing the
earnings link in 2009-10 and by 2012 at the
latest.</div>
					<a name="08011672000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000254"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I will come to that point shortly when I talk
about the earnings link. I shall deal first with amendment No. 9, which
is concerned only with 2012 and beyond. I am a little confused: it is
bit strange that hon. Members seem to be agreeing with me about the
early introduction of the upper accrual point from 2009, which will
allow us to keep to the timetable for state second pension flat-rating,
but they now seem to be opposing the consensus achieved during the
passage of the Pensions Bill last year by scuppering that same
timetable when we get to 2012. I am not going to make a big issue about
the consensus as I appreciate that, in the context of this Bill, we are
actually debating the matter in a very good humoured way. I am not
going to make big accusations about where people stand on the
consensus. However, the amendment requires the upper accrual point of
&#163;770, as set out in the Bill, to cease to have effect between
April 2012 and March 2015. What it does not do is to give any hint
whatever about what is to happen after that date. Importantly, the
amendment introduces uncertainty for many employers, who need to know
in advance what the upper accruals point will be and who cannot wait
for the matter to be settled by long and unnecessary debates&#151;if
you will forgive me, Mr. Chope&#151;as I believe would be
in this case, in the House.</div>
					<a name="08011672000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the amendment as
drafted is also fundamentally flawed. The effect of preventing clause 3
from operating in this way would mean reverting to the position as set
out in the Pensions Act 2007. The Committee will recall that that Act
gave us the power to set the upper accrual point from the flat-rating
introduction year at the rate of the previous years&#146; upper
earnings limit, or any other amount so determined.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>
					<a name="08011672000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I turn to amendment No.
10, I want to deal with the point made by the hon. Lady about creating
more losers. We touched upon that this morning, but I want to get it
into the record at this point of the discussion. It is important to
remember that the impact assessment to which she referred looked only
at the national insurance changes in the Budget 2007. Most employees
earning at the upper earnings limit, or above, will be better off using
the 2008-09 tax year, and I gave a detailed example of that this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08011672000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment No. 10, dealing with the earnings link. An unintended
consequence of removing the cap on state second pension accruals would
be that all earnings above the lower earnings limit would count for
state second pension purposes. That would also have a knock-on effect
on contracted-out rebates, which are paid on the same band of earnings
as that on which state second pension accrues: that is, the rebate will
be paid on all earnings over the lower earnings limit. The purpose of
amendment No. 10, and in part amendment No. 9, as we have accepted, is
to bring about a discussion on the timing of the up-rating of the basic
state pension with earnings. I am delighted to cross swords with the
Opposition on that. During the next Parliament, we will link the
up-rating of the basic state pension with average earnings over the
long term. Our objective is to do that in 2012, but in any event, we
are required by the Pensions Act 2007 to do it by the end of that
Parliament at the latest.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000255"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I have a sense of d(c)j  vu because
I remember asking this question to the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions. What the Minister is saying is that if there is an assessment
in 2012 that re-establishing the earnings link is unaffordable, and
that assessment persists to the end of that Parliament, a possibly
outgoing Administration would re-establish the earnings link, knowing
full well that it was unaffordable for the country, and that that
commitment to re-establish at any event takes precedence to
affordability. Which is the most important driver: is it affordability,
or is it this commitment at any event by the end of the Parliament to
re-establish the earnings
link?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000256"></a>Jane

						</b> We made clear that our commitment is subject to
affordability and the fiscal position. However, we in this party are in
a better position to look forward and say that, given the way that we
have had success in managing the economy to date, we believe that we
can introduce the earnings link in the next Parliament. Our proposals
give people a legislative guarantee that that will happen and they have
been costed on that basis. We do not make spending commitments such as
this, certainly not Treasury
Ministers&#151;</div>

Does she not accept that she has used the word
&#147;guarantee&#148;? This is anything but a guarantee. There is
uncertainty in the system, not least because we do not have fixed-term
Parliaments and have no idea whether 2012 will be at the end of a
Parliament or at the start of one that might lead all the way through
to 1217, at which point the affordability trigger comes into place. She
used the word guarantee, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>but this is anything but a guarantee. There is a great deal of
uncertainty, and the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Putney tried to add a level of certainty to that uncertain
picture.</div>

						</b> We have already committed to make an announcement
at the beginning of the next Parliament, specifying well in advance of
2012 the date for introducing the earnings link for the basic state
pension. We basically have a straightforward disagreement here. We
believe that we will clearly be in a position to take forward the
re-establishment of that link.</div>

2012 is arrived at not in the next Parliament, but in the one after
that.</div>

						</b> I remember an enjoyable by-election campaign in
Eddisbury in Cheshire, which the current hon. Member for Eddisbury of
course won. Our campaign, however, was based on a creative slogan,
&#147;Vote Labour or the fox gets it.&#148; I distinctly remember
the debate, which was a flagging up of our commitment to a totally
separate issue, which I do not intend to debate today. I mentioned it
because, given the degree of concern that the Opposition clearly have
about whether their policies would allow them the affordable
environment within which to re-establish the link, we could well
approach the next general election with a clear campaign.</div>
					<a name="08011672000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
committed to doing that and have demonstrated our ability to deliver an
economic environment within which it would be possible to do it. As far
as the Conservative party is concerned, all we have is the fact that it
was that party that decoupled it in the first place. I would be keen to
let the British people make their choice about that issue, based upon
the history.</div>
					<a name="08011672000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee knows, our first priority has always been to tackle pensioner
poverty. As a result, more than 2 million pensioners have been lifted
out of absolute poverty and more than 1 million have been lifted out of
relative poverty. Over the past 10 years, we have increased the amount
of money received by pensioners faster than earnings have increased
year on
year.</div>

						</b> You are absolutely right, and thank you for that
guidance, Mr. Chope. With regard to the amendment, we have
already put into legislation, as I have said repeatedly, the commitment
to up-rate the pension credits standard minimum guarantee in line with
earnings. Earnings up-rating is part of a package of complementary
reforms that balance affordability with fairness, and that includes the
abolition of contracting out on a defined, contribution basis and
simplifying the state second pension. Trying to unpick the timing of
this element with those reforms fundamentally changes that
package.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>
					<a name="08011672000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are bringing forward the
introduction of the upper approval point only to keep us within the
pension reform timetable. I accept that we have had a rousing debate on
our commitment to restoring the link, but other issues have been in
there as well. I hope that this has been helpful and that my hon.
Member for Putney will not press the amendment to a
vote.</div>

Greening:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for running
through her arguments, particularly those relating to
the 2030 time frame, which I found especially helpful. I feel that, in
picking out that date, she has cherry-picked from the Turner
commission&#146;s proposals with regard to time frames for when
particular things should happen. As I said in my intervention, the
Turner commission proposed re-establishing the earnings link much
sooner than will possibly happen.</div>
					<a name="08011672000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I feel that we have not made
any progress on understanding the certainty with which we know the
earning link will be re-established and am disappointed by that. I
clearly understand the Minister&#146;s argument. The phrase about
re-establishing the earnings link by the beginning of 2012, but in any
event before the end of the next Parliament, subject to affordability,
is intellectually inconsistent, for the reasons that I have laid out.
Something that is not affordable in 2012 may well not be affordable in
2015, so putting that in place may be irresponsible for a Government
that may be calling an election
shortly.</div>

Kennedy:
						</b> To deal with the issue now&#151;it is about the
delay to implementation, which is what the hon. Lady is talking about.
The Pensions Commission&#146;s judgment was that a short delay beyond
2010 would not seriously undermine the overall direction of the
proposed reform, although a five-year delay probably would. Should her
amendment not be considered in that
light?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011672000265"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point, but a
five-year delay for Turner would take us up to 2015, which is one of
the dates when the earnings link could possibly be re-established. I
remember that at the time the delay was flagged up by many people,
inside and outside this place, as one of the possible problems with the
pensions reform&#151;that it was not happening fast enough. I am
still not clear on the affordability test and how important that is
vis- -vis the term used of a &#147;guarantee&#148; for the
earnings link.</div>
					<a name="08011672000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not going to press the amendments to a vote, because I am sure that the
debate about re-establishing the earnings link and when it will take
place will continue in this place and in the other place. My objective
with the amendments was to see if we could get any more certainty. We
have not managed that, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Marris:
						</b> We have all grasped the broad direction of the
Bill. If the changes proposed were not made, some people, because of
the accumulating effect, would get higher rebates as the thresholds
went up. That would benefit the wealthy in society, who would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>getting those higher rebates from opting out of the state second
pension. Alternatively, if not opted out, they could be getting a state
second pension based on a greater amount of earnings than
intended.</div>
					<a name="08011672000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
to my right hon. Friend bears in mind not only her current position but
her previous one as a Minister for Northern Ireland. Another
distinguished Member, my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham,
was also a Minister for Northern Ireland and is with us today. My
understanding is that clause 3 and the schedules consequent upon it do
not apply to Northern Ireland. That is in contradistinction to
Scotland, where national insurance contributions are reserved
matters&#151;similarly in Wales. In Northern Ireland, under the
Northern Ireland Act 1998, they are in a different category. Therefore,
such issues fall to be dealt with by the Department for Social
Development in Northern Ireland&#151;I stand to be corrected, but I
think that the Minister is Margaret Ritchie. What discussions have my
right hon. Friend or her officials had with the people in Northern
Ireland, including the Minister for Social Development, as to whether
they propose, within that jurisdiction under the devolved powers, to
bring in an upper accrual point similar to the one that will certainly
be introduced for England under the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="08011672000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
they do not do so&#151;they have power not to, as I understand
it&#151;we could have in the United Kingdom individuals who are
higher rate taxpayers getting more rebates in Northern Ireland for
opting out of the state second pension and/or a higher state second
pension in due course. In Northern Ireland we could have no flat
rating, as we call it, until 2035, rather than 2031, which would be the
import of the Bill in England were the changes to go through. I
foresee, perhaps wrongly, that we might have all kinds of complications
for people who work in England and then get a job in Northern Ireland
and start paying or opting out or whatever at different levels and so
on, or somebody who works in England for a lot of their life and then
retires to Northern Ireland, perhaps because of family connections,
with a different state second pension regime. I would like to know from
my right hon. Friend what kind of liaison there has been with Northern
Ireland because we could get into a situation where, perhaps without
having thought a great deal about it, we would have two-tier provision
within the UK. That seems to me, with regard to pensions, a somewhat
surprising position to be in, with the full jurisdiction that we have
within our country.</div>

							<a name="08011672000267"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I do not intend to go into too much detail on the
clause, but the question that my hon. Friend asked is a useful one. He
is right that the upper accrual point relates to the state second
pension, which is a transferred matter under the Northern Ireland Act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>1998. It is therefore a matter on which the Northern
Ireland Assembly can legislate. Although Northern
Ireland has a separate body of social security law, it operates in
parity with the rest of the UK. It is anticipated that provision to
introduce an upper accrual point for Northern Ireland will be made by
the Northern Ireland Assembly.</div>
					<a name="08011672000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend asked me specifically what liaison there has been with the
authorities in Northern Ireland. Obviously, officials in HMRC and the
Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland have discussed
the matter in detail, including in the autumn, but I am hoping to pay a
visit to Northern Ireland to discuss one or two issues relating to
HMRC. I have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Members
in Northern Ireland, but it may be that if I can arrange a date for
that visit, I will do so as a result of his prompting today, for which
I am grateful.</div>
