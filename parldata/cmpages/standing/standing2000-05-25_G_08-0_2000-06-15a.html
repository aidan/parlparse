<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 10, line 45, leave out ``made'' and insert ``served on the person registered.''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:

<P>
No. 171, in page 11, line 9, at end insert ``and appropriate authorities''.

<P>
No. 172, in page 11, line 18, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In this section ``served on the person registered'' means delivered to that person or affixed to the establishment in respect of which the person is registered or, in the case of an agency, to the premises at which the business is carried on.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to raise a couple of points on the amendments.

<P>
Lines 44 and 45 on page 10 refer to an order, variation or imposition having effect from the time when the order is made. The implication is that a registered person whose registration has been cancelled would be committing an offence at the moment that the justice of the peace makes the order. It is entirely reasonable and consistent with general legal practice that a person should not be put in a position where they might commit an offence without knowing it. Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to propose that the order come into force when it is served on the registered person-at the moment that he has notice of the fact, he must cease and desist from the activity as required.

<P>
In order not to allow such a provision to become a loophole that allows people to play games and to evade the notice server, we have tabled consequential amendment No. 172 to define ``service''. Therefore, if the person cannot be found, the notice can be nailed to their front door. That answers the obvious objection that the provision would be used to avoid the intended effect of the subsection. It is not acceptable to place a person in the position of committing an offence when unaware that the order had been made.

<P>
Amendment No. 171 would do something slightly different. Members of the Committee will have noticed that, as a result of debate in the other place, the Government saw the wisdom of inserting a provision in subsection (3) requiring that a registration authority seeking the cancellation of a registration should notify the appropriate authorities, which would include the health authority and the local authority social services department. There is an obvious reason for that: cancellation of a registration is likely to result in people who are being cared for finding that they have no place in which to be cared for, requiring the appropriate public authorities to make urgent alternative arrangements. That is entirely sensible, but if the appropriate authorities are notified at the time that the registration authority applies for an order to cancel registration, it is logical, consistent and, in fact, necessary to notify them, as subsection (5) states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as soon as practicable after the making of the order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the authorities would be informed that the registration authority was seeking cancellation, and subsequently that cancellation had been ordered by the magistrates court.

<P>
I can envisage the argument that, once the relevant authorities are aware that the process is taking place, they will engage with it, be closely involved, certainly know when the matter is going to court and be right on top of it, and that there is no need to notify them that the order has been made. Those of us who are aware of the pressures that health authorities and-even more so-local authority social services departments are under know that that is an idealised view of the world. The reality is that most people are trying to do about six jobs at once and it is quite possible that, having been notified that an application for cancellation had been made, they would lose sight of the exact process and timing of the court hearing. I hope that the Minister will consider that the insertion into subsection (5) of a requirement to serve notice on the appropriate authorities that an order had been made is a sensible change and consistent with those made in the House of Lords.

<P>
While we are discussing the issue of notice and cancellation, will the Minister reassure the Committee on the wider issue of the procedure for deregistration? It has been drawn to my attention that the mere service of deregistration notices by health authorities or local authorities under the Registered Homes Act 1984 may lead-not under the Act, but under the terms of contracts that registered homes hold with local authorities-to the automatic termination of the contract. That is my understanding of the reality, as built into many local authority contracts. The sequence of events is that a notice of deregistration is served by the health authority or local authority, the owner or manager lodges an appeal, but the contract ends immediately.

<P>
Notwithstanding any problems with bank and mortgage lenders that that may cause the person operating the home, by the time that the appeal is heard, the person is no longer operating a home, because he or she has no patients, no clients-all having been removed on the termination of the contract. Therefore, it is no longer possible for the tribunal to hear the appeal precisely for the reason that the Minister outlined when he moved one of his technical amendments on Tuesday: the legislation is phrased in the present tense, thus the appeal cannot be heard and, by definition, cannot be won.

<P>
I am seeking from the Minister a confirmation that he will use guidance or whatever other necessary means to ensure that the initiation of the deregistration process, either under clause 19 or under the more routine cancellation procedure in clause 13, will not be allowed to be used as an automatic ground for the termination of a contract by a local authority or health authority with care.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): I am a little confused by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. He is suggesting that, having decided that a place was inappropriate for anybody, a local authority should continue to want to place its residents there. Is that not inconsistent?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Under our legal system, there is a requirement to presume innocence until guilt is proven. I imagine that the Minister would expect the procedure under clause 19, from the service of a notice to a hearing in the magistrates court, to be rapid. The guidance note calls it ``an urgent procedure'' for cancellation. I am not suggesting that it should not be open to an authority to build into its contracts provisions that allow them, whenever they are not satisfied, to withdraw the contracts, but I am concerned that an automatic provision will be built into a local authority or health authority contract, so that if the registration authority were to issue a notice, the contract would automatically terminate; it would be a condition of the contract that no notice to initiate the procedure had been served.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): My query is the same as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster). How many weeks or months does the hon. Gentleman think it appropriate for elderly people to continue in unsuitable accommodation, about which serious doubts have been raised? Does he envisage 16 weeks, 26 weeks? If he is arguing that he does not want an automatic cut-off-and I can conceive of circumstances where that would make sense-how long should we tolerate circumstances about which we are extremely uneasy and unhappy?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point. What he said perhaps refers more specifically to applications for cancellation under clause 19 where there is perceived to be a serious risk to a person's life, health or well-being. I am phrasing my question more widely to embrace the cancellation procedure under clause 13, which, by definition, is not the urgent procedure and therefore covers circumstances in which there is not such immediate or serious risk.

<P>
There is a balancing act to be performed; an appeals procedure is built in. I will be honest and say that I do not have personal, detailed knowledge about the information to which I seek to draw the Committee's attention-it comes from outside the House. I have been told that, under the Registered Homes Act, the right to appeal can become meaningless. I do not think that that is what the Minister wants us to understand about the right to appeal under this Bill.

<P>
We have already debated the inability of a person facing deregistration to appear in person to defend themselves at the initial stage. That is a new departure; under the Registered Homes Act, they had the right to do so. The Minister has told us that that has been the basis of abuse and avoidance of procedure, but that there will, of course, be a right to appear in person at a tribunal. I suspect that the Government's law officers' advice to the Secretary of State, who placed his certificate under the Human Rights Act 1998 on this Bill, is that the right to appear in person at appeal to the tribunal will save the provision from falling foul of that Act. That must be the position on which the Government seek to rely.

<P>
However, if people faced with the procedure are able to demonstrate that the right to appeal is in practice a spurious one and does not aid or enable them to make their case and continue their business, the Government will find themselves back at square one with a problem under the Human Rights Act. I want to explore with the Minister the mechanisms that he is proposing. What methodology does he intend to use-guidance or the regulations themselves-to ensure that the automatic cancellation facility is not built into contracts to create an unintended jeopardy for care home owners?

<P>

<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): With your indulgence, Mr. Illsley, I should like to explore the transfer period between the suspension or revocation of a registration and a home being closed, and the moving of the clients. There are clearly circumstances-rare, one hopes-where immediate action has to be taken to protect the safety of residents and one would have to accept the disturbance created by a sudden move from a home where someone may have been living for years, to another.

<P>
However, there are situations-unfortunately not rare-where it is clear that a home is not being run adequately or has gone into liquidation, in which the residents are not immediately at risk, but transfer time is needed to prepare them for a move or to make alternative arrangements for the running of the home.

<P>
At the moment, certainly in my constituency, the joint registration and inspection unit would put in its own managers in such circumstances. I cannot see anywhere in the Bill whether that will be one of the opportunities to apply a more regional inspection and registration system. I should welcome some feedback on how the Minister envisages that such circumstances would be coped with under the new arrangement.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</b> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) has tabled several important amendments and made some fairly substantial points. It might be helpful if I explained one or two aspects of the arrangements which he does not seem to have grasped fully. I hope that he will then feel reassured about the way in which the Bill has been put together.<P>

<P>
A registration authority will be able to apply under the clause for an emergency order to cancel, vary or impose an additional condition on a person's registration where it believes there is a serious risk to a person's life, health or well-being. All members of the Committee will accept that it is essential in those circumstances that the order takes effect as soon as possible so that service users can be removed from any danger. That is why the order should take effect as soon as it is made. That is the right way to go about things.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has implicitly recognised by tabling amendment No. 172, if we accepted amendment No. 170, we might introduce unwelcome delay in taking the necessary preventive measures. I assume that is why he tabled an amendment to require service of the notice at the premises. The point that he was making was that, if we left the Bill as it stands, the care home owner could be unreasonably prosecuted if he carried on running a registered home after the order had been made, as he would do. It is entirely unlikely and almost beyond the realms of possibility that in those circumstances the commission would want to prosecute the owner.

<P>
The order must be served as soon as possible. That would be the time when any decisions about prosecution would be considered. There is no serious possibility that the National Care Standards Commission would want to initiate a prosecution covering the time from the making of the order to when it is drawn to the attention of the care home owner.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am still concerned. What does the Minister envisage will happen in practice? Does he want the person running the care home simply at the moment that the order is made to put his coat on, tell the staff that they are no longer being paid and leave, so that everything will collapse immediately? The reality is that public authorities can take some time-hours, or perhaps even a day or two-to get their act together and to ensure a smooth transition. How does the Minister intend to deal with that problem?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Those are not new problems; they are currently dealt with by local authorities, although not, I am glad to say, routinely. Sadly, many have experience of dealing with and managing such situations. I am not going to say that within an hour of an order being made, all the arrangements should be in place and vulnerable residents moved out of the care home-that is not the nature of the real world. Every case will be managed and resolved on its facts. It would not be helpful or constructive for me to put together a framework now in Committee specifying the nooks and crannies of those operations. We are entitled to expect the statutory social services authorities to exercise their responsibilities properly, effectively and speedily. In the main, that is what happens.

<P>
There is a difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's amendment, which is recognised in his subsequent amendments. It could build in unreasonable delay; we should make sure that that does not happen. I do not think that there is any chance of prosecution in the circumstances that he has outlined. I would not expect the National Care Standards Commission to discharge its functions to police the regulations by initiating prosecutions in the circumstances that he outlined. Amendment No. 171 provides that the order would take effect only when served on the registered person. As I said, that is not the right way to proceed. I hope that, having reflected on the matter, the hon. Gentleman will reconsider his position. Amendment No. 172 is also probably not needed in the context of clause 35, which already makes provision for the service of documents. Amendments Nos. 171 and 172 should therefore not form part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 19(3) already provides that a registration authority must notify the local authority, health authority or other statutory bodies with an interest of its having made an application for an emergency order. In practice, there will be very little time between making an application and finding out its outcome. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that there would be a time gap. We would normally expect orders to be made within 24 hours of a successful application. I am therefore not sure that amendment No. 171 would add anything of value. It is inconceivable that a registration authority would not keep any appropriate authorities informed of developments, especially as to whether an application was successful. The amendments are not necessary.

<P>
If I understood the arguments of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge correctly, his final concern related to local authority contracting arrangements with care home. He had discovered the practice that many authorities have adopted of automatically ending a contract as soon as an application to deregister is made. He acknowledged that those concerns should have been addressed when we considered clause 13, which covers more routine, not urgent, circumstances. My hon. Friends the Members for Hastings and Rye and for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) responded well to the point about circumstances in which there is an urgent need for a home to lose its registration status. The hon. Gentleman has considered the Bill carefully and is helping us to tidy it up as we go along-that is welcome and helpful of him-but he will be aware that there is no requirement under clause 13 for the commission to notify the local authority when it intends to deregister, so his conerns may be misplaced.

<P>
On a wider level, our concern is to make sure that we do not unreasonably fetter the discretion of a local authority to take whatever action it considers appropriate to safeguard the interests of residents of care homes. I am certainly not persuaded that it would be reasonable for me to issue guidance or instructions to local authorities, under the Secretary of State's limited powers, that under no circumstances should they insert a clause into a contract with a care home owner which would allow them to remove their residents if an application were made to deregister the care home.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has chosen his words carefully. He does not think that it is reasonable to prevent local authorities inserting a clause that would allow them under any circumstances to consider deregistering a care home owner. I was addressing not that situation, but one where the contract clause provides for automatic termination on an application for deregistration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I have tried to address that concern by reminding the hon. Gentleman of clause 13. There
is no obligation on the National Care Standards Commission to notify a local authority when it seeks to deregister a care home under the provisions of clause 13. The position is very different under clause 19. There should be an obligation to notify the local authority, because they have the ultimate responsibility for taking the necessary measures to protect and safeguard the well-being of residents in those care homes.

<P>
My general point-perhaps I am not making the point to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction-is that we should preserve the freedom of local authorities to take appropriate action, when necessary, to preserve the well-being and welfare of residents in care homes in their areas. If we went down the hon. Gentleman's path, we might not secure that objective. I am interested in the important issues that he has raised and will take further advice from my officials about them, but if the hon. Gentleman is asking me to make a commitment today to take a specific course of action, sadly, I cannot do so.

<P>
For reasons that I have tried to spell out, the amendments are unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be at least partly reassured by what
I have said and will seek to withdraw amendment
No. 170.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am reassured by the last 30 seconds of the Minister's speech, because he has at least said that he will reflect on the matters, but I am afraid that I found his arguments dismissing my final remarks about automatic termination of contracts slightly disingenuous. Local authorities will ultimately have the duty to re-house people who are displaced as a result of a cancellation under clause 13, and the Minister has drawn the Committee's attention to the lack of provision in that clause to require the commission to inform the relevant statutory authorities. Unless that is a gross defect, it must be envisaged that in practice the commission's regional or local office will be in fairly close contact with the statutory authorities and will keep them informed. The Minister cannot have it both ways. He says that I do not need to worry about the possibility of a local authority automatic termination clause being triggered, because a local authority might not find out, as there is no requirement in clause 13 for the commission to notify the local authority, but that as the local authority will have to deal with displaced residents if a registration is cancelled, we must assume that the commission will inform the local authority, notwithstanding the fact that there is no requirement for it to do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that there is a change in relationship between the registration unit and the local authority under the new arrangements and that it is imperative that negotiations take place before an order is served to ensure the relevant support for the residents of the home that is at risk of closure? The Minister did not address my concern; will the hon. Gentleman explore the matter a little further?<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; the relationship between the commission and local authorities remains to be seen. It will be a different relationship from that between local authority inspection units and social services departments.

<P>
I too am disappointed by the Minister's comments on amendment No. 170. He seems to be relying on the argument, ``Don't worry, because in practice it won't happen. In our uniquely British way, we shall muddle together and there won't be a gap. We'll sort it out somehow''. Technically, registration ceases on the making of the order and I envisage a gap. There may need to be a more precise procedure to ensure a smooth transition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways either. He repeatedly asks me to clarify the Government's intentions and when I do so, he says, ``That's not what we want''. It is an issue that he must address. I have tried to explain how we expect the commission to exercise its functions. We do not envisage that prosecutions will arise in the circumstances that he described. I cannot make it clearer than that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that; I assume that we shall see clear guidance for the commission that prosecutions should not occur in that circumstance. We have also explored what would happen in practice. The registered person would cease to be registered from the moment when the order was made. What would that mean in practice? Who would pay the staff? Who would pay the rent? What would be the management's responsibilities for the establishment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is confusing two totally separate issues. We are addressing a person's legal ability to run a care home. Cancelling the registration of that home will have no impact on the care home owner's wider responsibilities as an employer or tenant; he must discharge those legal responsibilities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We have an awful lot of amendments to consider this morning and, as the Minister has promised to reflect on these matters, it might be better for me to do likewise. I am not entirely sure that what he has said is right, especially if local authority contracts with automatic cancellation clauses are operating. The first effect of such a provision would be an immediate halt of the income stream, so there may be practical difficulties with it. However, as we have a lot to get through this morning, I shall not press the amendment. I hope that these matters will become clearer to us when the Minister has had a chance to reflect and when I have considered his remarks and read the Official Report of our proceedings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 174, in page 11, line 42, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Before making regulations under this section the Minister shall undertake such consultation as he shall consider appropriate and place a summary of the responses to that consultation together with a list of the persons and organisations consulted in the Library of the House of Commons and the Library of the House of Lords.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would insert into the clause a specific provision on the consultation that the Minister shall undertake and the public information that he shall issue about its results and responses. We seek to require the Minister to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>place a summary of the responses to that consultation together with a list of the persons and organisations consulted in the Library of the House of Commons and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-in response to the Minister's sensitivity on behalf of the other place-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the Library of the House of Lords.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an entirely reasonable requirement for the Minister to fulfil.

<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee about the make-up of the groups, as they are currently constituted, that will consider and make recommendations on regulations made under the clause? I am disappointed to see that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), is no longer in the Room, as she, too, has been closely involved in the procedure. Who has decided which bodies will be consulted and which will join the consultation groups that are currently working with officials on draft regulations? Is the Minister prepared to publish and to circulate to Committee members a list of the groups that are currently working on this aspect of the Bill and of the organisations that are represented on them? By what process of appointment or self-appointment have the bodies come to be represented on the committees that will consider the various aspects of the regulations?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made another useful point. He asked about the membership of the advisory groups. I think that he was referring to the General Social Care Council and the National Care Standards Commission. Obviously, we are happy to publish for the Committee's benefit full lists of the membership of those groups. We have no problem about that and I am quite happy to publish the lists. Of course, the appointments are ultimately made by the Secretary of State, as that is the way in which all Departments function. A wide variety of organisations and individuals are serving on both the advisory groups, one of which, I am pleased to say, is chaired by Baroness Keighley. Tom Burgner, whose reputation and standing are unquestioned, is chairman of the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
I am prepared to accept the spirit of the amendment, although I cannot accept its precise wording. We shall certainly table a similar amendment on Report in order to impose a statutory requirement on the Secretary of State to consult before the regulations are made. I am not sure whether our amendment will include the specific requirement to place a copy of the documents in the Libraries of the House of Commons and House of Lords, as the amendment proposes, although we intend to do just that. I accept the general spirit of the amendment and will table a similar proposal on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance, which will reassure not only Opposition Members but outside organisations, which will be pleased to see the requirement to consult included in the Bill.

<P>
I return to what the Minister said about the groups that have already been set up. I am particularly interested in the consultation group set up to consider the development of regulations and standards for private and voluntary health care, about which I have written to the Under-Secretary. I have some queries about the bodies represented on that group, and I also have a constituency interest in a particular body that is not represented.

<P>
A constituent of mine-I have mentioned him before-who suffered a bereavement as a result of the improper management of procedures in a private hospital, has established a group known as Action for the Proper Regulation of Private Hospitals. I understand that another group represents victims of medical accidents in private hospitals. However, neither group has been included in the list of users' and patients' representatives to help officials to develop standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I misunderstood the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's inquiry. I thought that he was talking about the advisory groups that are helping us to establish the National Care Standards Commission and the General Social Care Council. I apologise to him and to the Committee.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman will know we have already published a list of those organisations and individuals who are helping us to develop standards in private health care. The group that he mentioned, APROP, will be on one of the sub-groups that are helping to develop standards in acute private hospitals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful that the Minister was able to make that announcement today, as it will enable me to write to my constituent to reassure him. It is important that organisations that genuinely represent victims and aggrieved parties have an opportunity to make their views known. They do not have extreme views. APROP is run by professional people with knowledge of the health care system and it is able to make a useful contribution.

<P>
I was surprised to see in the users' and patients' representatives list the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales and the NHS Confederation-not because there is anything wrong with those organisations, but because the Minister and his colleagues specifically and explicitly sought to differentiate between the systems that govern the private sector and the NHS. We are told that NHS patients in the private sector will still be the responsibility of the Commission for Health Improvement, which is also a member of the consultation group.

<P>
The locus of the NHS Confederation in relation to the development of standards for private and voluntary health care is not immediately clear. To include the Commission for Health Improvement under the heading ``Inspectors and Quality Assurers'' but no other quality assurers-for instance, the British Standards Institution-seems to have an NHS focus that sits uncomfortably with the stated purpose of the group. However, in view of what the Minister said, I shall be delighted to withdraw the amendment, so that he can table a substantive amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 12, line 1, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) make provision as to the inspection of arrangements for the management and use of medication in care homes;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Subsection (2) contains a long list of issues that may be regulated. We are disappointed that medication in care homes has not been included in the list. It might be included under subsection (2)(d), which deals with making provisions for ``securing the welfare''.

<P>
A specific mention should be made of arrangements for medicines, for two reasons. First, a system should be in place to verify the distribution of prescribed medicines by care homes and managers, so that the prescribing doctor knows that the drug has been given. Secondly-and perhaps more importantly-a system of inspection and advice on medication should be in place to ensure that prescriptions are appropriate to the needs of the individuals in the care homes rather than being geared to the desires of the people running them.

<P>
People are concerned about the extent of the prescription of psychotropic medicines for older people. They also fear that people are placed inappropriately in homes and kept there through the use of prescribed medicines rather than good management. The national health service would be the appropriate agency to consider the issue. It should be involved in checking the registration details so as to ensure that care homes have made the right arrangements to obtain medical and pharmaceutical advice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) for tabling the amendment. I assume that it is intended to probe whether the Government intend to issue regulations on the issue. I can confirm that we will. It is an important issue and he is right to draw the attention of the Committee to the concerns of many hon. Members, especially about the use of neuroleptics in care homes. The Government will use the powers under the Bill as it stands-without the amendment-to make regulations covering those particular areas.

<P>
I refer the hon. Gentleman to particular provisions in the Bill. The Bill already provides largely for those matters through the power to make regulations on the keeping of records under subsection (6)(c) and, more generally, on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the management and control of the operations of an establishment or agency<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under subsection (2)(f). The registration authority has the power of inspection under clauses 29 and 30.

<P>
The amendment has one slight problem. I do not mean to be horrid to the hon. Gentleman-[
Interruption.] He is my greatest fan on the Committee, as everybody knows, because he is always looking forward to what I have to say. He may be my only fan.

<P>
The amendment sadly refers only to care homes. The Government want to ensure that proper arrangements are in place for the management and use of medication in other settings-for example, in private hospitals. I reassure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the Government will use their regulation-making powers to cover precisely the issues to which he has drawn attention. The amendment may be too narrow because it would confine the regulation-making power to care homes. We want to ensure that it can be applied more widely.

<P>
<B>Mrs Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I rise briefly to speak in support of the spirit behind the amendment. We should not kid ourselves about what goes on in some care settings and the risks that they present. This is a developing situation. Increasingly, older people are not cared for by family members but instead go into a more impersonal, institutional setting, often with conditions, such as dementia, that are difficult for families to cope with. As this is a new and developing situation, relatives often have concerns about the use of medication.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady is making a good point. She may be reassured to know that the National Care Standards Commission will have specialist pharmacist inspectors who will consider whether residents are receiving the right drugs.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> That answered what I was just about to say. I wanted, in support of the spirit of the amendment, to make sure that those who would oversee the risk from medication would be qualified. When I visit a residential care home and see the drugs trolley coming round and the drugs being dispensed, I sometimes wonder whether the care assistants who dispense them understand the power of the medication. Establishing a pharmacist at national level to oversee matters is a start, but I should be happier if I knew that the level of qualification of the people dispensing the medication in the home was being given attention. I should like dispensing to be regularly reviewed by a doctor. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight can certainly speak with some authority on the matter, but without such safeguards there is still potential for abuse. The involvement of a pharmacist for the registration authority is a step in the right direction.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am much reassured by the Minister's remarks. We specified care homes because it is implicit in nursing homes and private hospitals that some arrangement for medical care and the distribution of drugs should operate. In care homes that issue is often forgotten or considered of minor importance. I should still have liked something on the face of the Bill making the distribution of medicine and the review of drug regimes part of a registration system. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that and perhaps table a Government amendment, but, in the light of his reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 12, line 2, leave out paragraph (a).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendments Nos. 175, in page 12, line 2, leave out ``fit'' and insert ``suitable''.

<P>
No. 179, in page 12, line 13, leave out paragraph (f).

<P>
No. 184, in page 12, line 21, leave out paragraph (j).

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The amendments are intended to provide an opportunity to probe the Government's thinking. Generally, we do not argue that the paragraph in question should be removed but want the Committee to understand what the Government intend by it before it is included.

<P>
As we have said, the structure of the Bill provides an awful lot of meat, with the detail to be provided in regulations. I ask the Minister again for reassurance about the scrutiny that we shall be allowed to exercise when regulations are published. For example, if the statutory instrument under which regulations relating to clause 21 will be published will be separate from regulations under other clauses, we shall have a better chance in the miserly hour and a half available to a delegated legislation Standing Committee to explore the issues. I expect that the Minister would acknowledge that a set of regulations under clause 21 will be very meaty, and that not much serious scrutiny of them will be possible in an hour and a half.

<P>
To make a general point, perhaps the Minister would explain the effect of subsections (2) to (7), given that subsection (1) creates a general power for the Minister to make such regulations as he sees fit. Does the laying out of a series of matters that might be included under the use of that general power expand the Minister's scope for regulation making, or does it in practice constrain him? Are we to understand subsections (2) to (7) as qualifying the general power granted by subsection (1) or as merely listing a series of examples? If the latter, do subsections (2) to (7) express an exhaustive list of the Government's current intentions for regulations under the clause, while reserving the power to make further regulations under subsection (1) later? It would be interesting for the Committee to understand what precisely the architecture means in practice.

<P>
Amendment No. 176 would leave out subsection
(2)(a), which allows that regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision as to the persons who are fit to carry on or manage an establishment or agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of tabling the general amendment is simply to probe the Government's intentions as to who is in, who is out and who decides. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee information on that front.

<P>
Amendment No. 175 is slightly different in that it would replace the word ``fit'' in paragraph (a) with ``suitable''. Again, I have no particular axe to grind with regard to having ``suitable'' as opposed to ``fit'', but I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the term ``fit'' is used in clause 21, ``competent'' in clause 54(3) and ``suitable'' in new section 79B(3) and (4) in clause 68. The reason is that the terminology of another piece of legislation is being picked up on. Clause 68 inserts additional sections into an Act. Is there any distinction between the terms? Are they to be read interchangeably or do they have different meanings of which the Committee should be aware.

<P>
Amendment No. 179 would omit paragraph (f), which allows regulations to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision as to the management and control of the operations of an establishment or agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 184 would omit paragraph (j), which allows regulations to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision requiring the person carrying on an establishment or agency to appoint a manager in prescribed circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would like to know what circumstances the Minister has in mind for requiring the appointment of a manager.

<P>
There is general unease regarding the regulations. As we start to consider provisions at the bottom of the list regarding management, the control of operations and the appointment of managers, we start to get into what might be called micro-management. Without wanting to reopen a much wider debate for which we do not have time this morning, I will say that some of us feel that problems in the NHS are due to too much attempted micro-management from the top.

<P>
It will be clear to all members of the Committee that one of the Government's objectives in pushing the Bill through and creating the level playing field for care homes is to harvest the economies that independent sector care homes have demonstrated that they can deliver. They typically have significantly lower costs than local authority care homes. That is partly because the management structures, the staffing regimes and the flexibility of practice in local authority homes is generally different from that in private sector homes.

<P>
I am concerned that, in levelling the playing field, there should be no intention to use paragraphs (f) and (j) to impose across the sector the rigidities and thus the costs that the local authority sector suffers. Money that could be saved by the use of more efficient providers could be recycled to provide more placements for people who need care.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has given me the opportunity to put on the record the extent of Government thinking on how we intend to exercise the regulation-making powers. I shall allay his concerns before addressing the specific substance of the amendments.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman expressed concern that the Government would deliver a van load of regulations,
6 ft high, to the House. No one would be able to read them all, but we would have to process them in an hour and a half. He should get real. Of course we would not do that-

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> He would.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Indeed. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight-whom I might have to start calling my hon. Friend. He should join us on the Labour Benches and save us all a great deal of trouble in the future.

<P>
The concerns of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge are unwarranted. We intend to lay the regulations for each regulated service separately to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny. He can expect to see draft care home regulations, draft children's homes regulations, agency regulations and so on in turn. We will also publish each set of standards separately and in turn.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman alluded to the practical issue of what final form the sets of regulations and standards will take when they are published. Many parties-independent providers, local and health authorities, service users and those who support them, inspectors and those who work for the new commission-have an interest in this important matter. We aim to publish regulations and standards together for each service so that we produce volumes similar to those that emanated from the Children Act 1989. That is the way to proceed. We will act sensibly and not short-cut proper parliamentary scrutiny, which is clearly necessary and appropriate. The arrangements will be clear and comprehensible to everyone-industry, the private sector, local authorities and so on-who has a legitimate interest in exploring the issues with the Government.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was worried about different terminology-``fit'', ``suitable'', ``competent'' and so on-but he is using different parts of the Bill to argue that its language is inconsistent. He referred to clause 54, which relates to the registration of an individual with the General Social Care Council. It is appropriate to consider the issue of competence in that context.

<P>
There is a wider problem with the amendments. I assume-the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge confirmed this-that they are probing amendments to discover the Government's intentions. However, it did not take four amendments to have this debate; one would have done. My wider concern arises from the analysis of how the Conservative Opposition dealt with the matter in another place. They tabled amendments-six in all-to extend the regulation-making powers in clause 21. The hon. Gentleman tabled 13 amendments a couple of days ago to narrow the powers. He should explore with his noble friends whether the Opposition want to narrow or extend the arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister is developing that argument, will he answer my first question? Will subsections (2) to (7) constrain or extend the scope of ministerial action? What is their status?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I intend to answer that question. If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I shall make my own speech, dealing with things in the order that I want-

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The way that is written here.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, that is a silly point. If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I shall make my speech in my own way. His concerns and those of his hon. Friends in another place need to be reconciled. At the moment, I am none the wiser, nor are my hon. Friends, about whether the Opposition are in favour of the proposed regulatory arrangements or whether they believe that they should be narrower or wider.

<P>
I may as well deal with the question now, because the hon. Gentleman is obviously concerned about it. He will know how the clause has been developed, and that subsection (1) sets out the general power to make regulations, but he has tabled no amendments to it. What is he up to? I do not know, nor do my hon. Friends. Those paragraphs of subsection (2) to which the hon. Gentleman referred do not narrow the scope of the regulatory-making powers. They are not intended to do so. They are intended to be entirely helpful, not only to Members of Parliament but to those interests to which he referred-some commercial, some in the public sector and those who represent residents, patients and others-who want an idea of when and how the Government intend to exercise their regulatory-making powers.

<P>
What we want to achieve will be for the convenience of the House. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has spent a lot of time saying that it is an empty box. We are trying to fill the box by giving some indication of when we shall use those regulatory-making powers. I do not want to labour the theme, but the hon. Gentleman cannot have his cake and eat it. Either he wants it to be clear in the Bill, in which case it should include an indication of how we intend to travel, or he wants to remove all those subsections, which is what the amendments would do. I and my hon. Friends do not understand exactly what he has in mind.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge laboured the point when speaking to amendment
No. 175, which would substitute the word ``suitable'' for the word ``fit''. I see no great difference between those two words. We prefer the word ``fit'' because it has resonance with the provisions of the Registered Homes Act 1984, and the care home sector has become familiar with it. We see no justification in changing it, and no one has asked us to do so-except the hon. Gentleman. The word ``fit'' is appropriate, and I believe that we should stick with it.

<P>
The other amendments do not make much sense. They would remove the Secretary of State's power to make regulations. If that is the hon. Gentleman's intention, perhaps he would share it with us. He may wish to probe our intentions, and I hope that I have reassured him in that respect. The care home sector certainly needs to see that sort of helpful information in the Bill. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will say whether he believes that the Secretary of State should make regulations in those areas. I suspect that that is the reason for the amendment. I want to keep the regulatory-making power in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister's language will confuse the Committee. He is saying that he would reject the amendment because he wants the Bill to include the provisions that allow the Secretary to make regulation. He knows very well that they are probing amendments, but even if they were accepted, the Secretary of State would still have the power to make regulations under subsection (1). In other words, subsection (2) adds nothing to that power. That is what I have been trying to elicit from the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That rather confirms what a pointless debate it has been. Perhaps I have confused the hon. Gentleman. I shall restate the argument. I was trying to paraphrase his remarks about my use of the word ``power''. I thought that he felt that if the power to make regulations was deleted from the Bill, the opportunity to make regulations would not exist. I made it clear earlier that we already have a regulatory-making power and that removing the provisions of subsection (2) would not detract from it. Those provisions are designed as helpful indication to all who have an interest in when we intend to use those powers. The ``beyond any reasonable doubt'' declaratory argument is available, should any difficulties arise. There is logic behind it. The present structure is sensible and I hope that hon. Members will feel confident in voting for it.

<P>
I certainly cannot accept amendment No. 179, which, subject to remarks that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight might want to make, would have the effect of removing the power to make regulations about the management and control of operations of establishments and agencies. In my response to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, I have already given hon. Members one example of how we intend to use the power. The hon. Gentleman asked for regulations to be made about the management and use of medication in care homes. I assured him that we would use the regulation-making power to do that, and I would like to keep my word to him. Of course, if the Committee were to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment, it might be more difficult for me to do that.

<P>
I could set out similar arguments about other aspects of the hon. Gentleman's amendments, but I do not want to detain the Committee. I hope that I have been able to assure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about how we intend to use the regulation-making power under clause 21. We have some specific objections to his amendments, partly because they would make less obscure the intended use of the powers, which would not be helpful. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that he does not need to persevere with his arguments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not know what the Minister had for breakfast this morning, but he is uncharacteristically aggressive. He knows very well that these are probing amendments, designed to elicit from the Government some clarification about what they intend to do in the clause. I asked him generally whether pages 12 and 13 add to or detract from the first four lines of the clause. I understand that the Minister told the Committee that those two pages add nothing and subtract nothing from the Secretary of State's powers, so what is their purpose? The Minister seems to be saying that their purpose, for which I should be grateful, is to clarify the Government's intentions with regard to the scope of regulations made under the clause. I concede that it is helpful, both to the Committee and to outside bodies, if the clause contains an exhaustive list. However, if I have a general power to do anything and then qualify that by quoting a list of the things that I intend to do under that general power, that is informative only if the list is exhaustive. If I intend to do other things that are not included in the list, the list then becomes the opposite of helpful and obscures my intentions. I am not suggesting that that is the Government's purpose, but I hope that the Minister will understand why the question has been asked.

<P>
As the Minister well knows, various subsections have been attacked by amendments, not because we think that they should not be included-indeed, to remove them would make no difference whatsoever to the Minister's powers, as he himself has said, so it is not that we believe that the Minister should not have power x or power y-but in the hope that the Minister might tell the Committee how he intends to use the powers to make regulations. He gave one specific example to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. Given that he understands why we tabled the amendments, I had hoped that he might give the Committee a more comprehensive list of the sort of things that he intends to do. For example, he might have told the Committee what sort of people are likely to be considered fit to manage an establishment or, more importantly, what type of people are likely to be considered unfit, so that we would have a little more idea of what he has in mind. With the singular exception of the Minister's response to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, we are none the wiser.

<P>
The question that I raised about the use of language throughout the Bill, including the words ``fit'', ``competent'' and ``suitable'', was not initiated by a fetish for words. It was a response to a briefing submitted to Committee members by the Association of Directors of Social Services, who wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ADSS believe a more comprehensive and consistent definition based on this framework will be needed so that there is no scope for legal uncertainty and to ensure adequate protection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That genuine concern was raised by a reputable organisation, and I tabled an appropriate amendment in pursuit of more information.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I chose not to speak at length on that issue because I was sure that we would return to it later. However, his amendment would leave out how to define a fit person. I could set out a list of issues that we might want to take into consideration-for example whether a person has a criminal record and is not included under the Protection of Children Act 1999; that the person is of generally good character, established by a series of references; or that he or she has the appropriate qualifications and experience. It is important that the regulation-making power should define exactly what we mean by ``fit''. That would be a useful step forward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. He has done what I hoped he would do and given the Committee a cameo of the sort of issues that he intends to cover in the regulations. We have gained some useful information from the debate and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 177, in page 12, line 6, leave out paragraph (c).

<P>
The amendment would leave out paragraph (c) regarding the fitness of premises to be used as an establishment or for the purposes of an agency. That raises a substantive point. For the record, I am not asking the Minister to agree that the Bill should include no provision for making regulations about the fitness of premises, but as we have already explored to some extent, there is an interaction between the regulation that the Minister will introduce under clause 21(2)(c) and the standards that will be published under clause 22. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that relationship. When we touched on the issue a couple of days ago, the Minister was kind enough to write me a short note, in which he explained the distinction between the regulations under subsection 2(c) and the standards to be issued under clause 22(4).

<P>
The Minister told us during the previous debate that the regulations and standards would be published together, which is very useful information, but I want to understand how the two will interact. A statement of minimum standards will be published, and I assume that the regulations to be published under clause 21(2)(c) will require different types of establishment to comply with the statement of minimum standards. Therefore, it would be a breach of the regulations to operate in premises that do not comply with the statement. So far, so good, although we might want to return to the issue of what those standards should be when we reach clause 22. However, clause 22(4) says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The standards shall be taken into account  in the making of any decision by the registration authority under this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The decision concerned is whether to register a person in respect of an establishment. The language of clause 22(4)(a) seems to allow a certain amount of discretion because the requirement to take something into account allows for discretion in how the decision is made. I imagine that the regulation will be very precise-``You must comply with this minimum standard and if you do not, you are out.'' Will the Minister explain, as he explained in his note to me, how those different approaches will interact?

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked a number of perfectly fair and reasonable questions in relation to clause 22(4). I imagine that he will want me to deal with them when we reach that part of the Bill. I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will be patient. We shall have the discussion then.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that this is a probing amendment. I assume he seeks some indication of how the Government intend to use the powers. He will be aware that regulations already exist to make provision for the fitness of premises under the Registered Homes Act 1984. It will be important to ensure that the provision continues under the new arrangements. The Government will need such a power, so will make the necessary regulations. The residential care homes regulation 10(g), for example, provides that the registered person should keep all parts of the home occupied or used by residents in good structural repair, clean and reasonably decorated. The new regulatory arrangements similarly will need to ensure that establishments are kept in good repair and are clean and reasonably decorated.

<P>
Regulations will also need to ensure that the location of an establishment's premises is appropriate. It would not be appropriate for a residential rehabilitation centre for adults with learning disabilities, for example, to be in the middle of the countryside, miles from anywhere else, with no regular transport connections to the nearest town. That provision is not new. Section 9(b) of the Registered Homes Act 1984 expressly makes provision in relation to the situation of premises too. Establishments will need to have lifts where premises are of more than one storey. That is especially important where residents' or patients' mobility is limited.

<P>
Right across the public, private, voluntary and independent sectors, a consensus exists about the need for those types of regulations. I hope later today that the Committee will be able to come over to the Department where we can continue our discussions over lunch. Indeed, I hope that we can do so in future as we move on to other parts of the Bill. Hopefully, then, the need to secure a consensus on the necessity of minimum standards and their content will be clearer than has perhaps been the case so far. It is important that a genuine consensus is established on the minimum standards and how those should be embodied in the regulations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister outlined a number of perfectly reasonable issues that he wishes to cover in the regulations. They were probably areas covered in the proposed statement of minimum standards. Does the Minister envisage the regulations incorporating the minimum standards and then going further into those other areas or does he not envisage the regulations under the subsection incorporating the statement of minimum standards?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We certainly do not envisage the regulations going further than the national minimum required standards. That would be inappropriate. The regulations will be the mechanism by which the minimum required standards are given teeth. That is the essential feature of the arrangements that we are putting into place. I have not indicated anything that goes beyond ``Fit for the Future?'', for example, in what I have been saying. The basis on which we are trying to reach a satisfactory conclusion to the issues is the development of a set of minimum required standards that are affordable, practical, realistic and which will command a genuine consensus. We are anxious to reach that consensus for many of the reasons we have discussed on previous occasions when the issues have come before the House and the Committee. We should be able to do that and I am optimistic that we will. At the end of the day, we should all be clear. I am sure there is clarity on the matter in the industry and elsewhere that the issue here is in the public interest, not commercial interest. We need a consensus because the standards have to be realistic and affordable. However, the interests that must be paramount at all times are those of the residents of nursing homes, children's homes and residential care centres. Their interests must be paramount as we develop the national minimum required standards. I am sure that there is agreement on that.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment has been helpful, giving us the opportunity to discuss some of the issues. However, I am sure that, as with the other amendments that he has moved, he will not feel it necessary to divide the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is right and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 178, page 12, line 8, leave out paragraphs (d) and (e).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 180, in page 12, line 14, at end add-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) make provision for the monitoring, recording and reporting of incidents of infection or other conditions requiring medical treatment acquired by a person during a period of accommodation in an establishment;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 17, in page 12, line 29, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) as to the promotion and implementation of effective infection control policies;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 24, in page 12, line 30, after first ``the'', insert ``active''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Amendment No. 178 is a probing amendment and would leave out paragraphs (d) and (e). The intention is simply to elicit from the Minister an indication of the scope of the regulations that he envisages for securing the welfare of adults and children who appear to be being dealt with under a different subsection. I had better emphasise that point in case I am attacked for wanting to remove a measure that provides for the protection of people's welfare. There is no suggestion that we do not need such regulations, but the Committee would like an idea of the way in which the Government intend to secure people's welfare, which is a massive undertaking.

<P>
Amendment No. 180 would do something different. It is intended to probe the Government on their views as to whether there needs to be proper monitoring, recording and reporting of incidents of infection and other conditions, including pressure sores, acquired during a period of accommodation in an establishment. I ask the Minister that question because the area is one of concern: the Liberal Democrat amendments in the group will address the same issue.

<P>
I am concerned about that issue in relation to the national health service and not merely to the private sector. One of the large care home operators has told me that it has a specific target of zero in-house generated, pressure sores and that it is close to achieving that target-the present rate is low. However, there is a high incidence of pressure sores on arrival among patients referred to its homes directly from NHS hospitals. The Minister might want to dispute the statement, but I would be prepared to share with him its source to let him verify it. That rate of incidence is a problem, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge, not just because of the inconvenience to the patient. It must be obvious, as it is to me, that we must ensure as a priority when resources are constrained that patients get better and not worse when they go into hospital. We must stop a practice that tends to make people worse and which requires us to spend lots of money getting them better again. That practice cannot be helpful for anyone.

<P>
The independent sector clearly has good practice in relation to pressure sore management; I do not know about infection control management. I would hope that the Minister would be favourable to the idea of the independent sector being required to record and report incidents of infection and other treatable conditions acquired by people while in an establishment. I am not seeking to trap the Minister. I will tell him up front that I hope that, having accepted the principle for the independent sector, he will find it impossible to resist the argument that the same should apply to elderly patients in the national health service, so that we could start to see best practice spread in both directions. Independent sector practice in the management of pressure sores could be more effective.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Amendments Nos. 17 and 24 are in the spirit of amendment No. 16 in that they involve the inspection regime and home owner, encouraging the use of expertise available elsewhere. Viable regimes for infection control-not just standard cleanliness as defined by environmental health departments-are important. The treatment of bedsores, for instance, requires awareness of modern practice, the disposal of clinical waste and similar issues. I support the argument behind amendment No. 180, which relates closely to our amendment No. 17 in that it would provide for a verifiable regime that could be audited. All care should involve an audit cycle. That is a part of caring as well as training.

<P>
Changing the term ``health promotion'' to ``active health promotion'', as amendment No. 24 would do, seems a slight alteration. However, I have seen too many places where lip service is paid to health promotion. A few fly-blown leaflets from the health promotion authority are stuck on the wall, probably for five or 10 years, and nothing is done. Residents are allowed to sit around and vegetate. I should like a requirement to demonstrate active promotion of well-being, involving socialising, activities, attending to whether the diet is interesting as well as sustaining and, to return to the subject of our previous amendment, the review of medication. That is all part of allowing people to live an active life, even if they are less able to do so and need residential care.

<P>
In the spirit of the previous contribution by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge I urge the Minister to make a commitment to the issues that I have raised. They will have resource implications for other agencies for which his Department is responsible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can satisfy my curiosity about amendment No. 24, which has been burning since he tabled the amendments? What is the Liberal Democrat concept of passive promotion?

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is an interesting line. My description of passive promotion was ancient leaflets pinned up where no one sees them, enabling it to be claimed that something is being done, although it is certainly not active. Perhaps what I am interested in is hands-on, ongoing promotion, rather than just statements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I was having a very nice conversation with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I am sure that the arguments that the hon. Gentlemen were just engaged in were excellent, and although I did not hear them I shall try to respond, such is my Department's ability.

<P>
Amendment No. 178 would delete paragraphs (d) and (e) from subsection (2). I remind the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the power to make regulations in the relevant matters replicates similar provision that already exists for residential and children's homes. Regulations under the Registered Homes Act 1984 make provision for the registered person to arrange for the home to be run so as to make proper provision for the welfare and care of residents. We do not want the Bill to provide for anything less than is currently required under the Registered Homes Act 1984. Examples of the possible use of the regulation-making powers might include the need to assess residents or patients, with a view to meeting their care needs, and to ensure that a proper care plan is drawn up and followed. Of course, residents should always be treated with dignity. It is not acceptable to undress residents in front of their peers or for staff to leave a lavatory door open so that they-and anyone else who happens to be nearby-can keep an eye on the resident using it. Personal and intimate care must be delivered in private.

<P>
Subsection (2)(d) and (e) should be read in conjunction with subsections (4) and (5) which specify other circumstances in which the powers could be exercised-for instance, with regard to the control and restraint of adults and children. The commission will want to be sure that the staff employ appropriate methods of physical management of residents, whether adults or children.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 180 was tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. It would require establishments to monitor, record and report incidents of infection. Establishments will be expected to keep records of all medication that is administered to service users and make adjustments to the individual's treatment or care plan to take account of an infection or any other condition that the individual develops in the establishment and which requires treatment. Powers in clause 21 provide for that. Subsection (6)(c) allows regulations to be made on the keeping of records. Subsection (2)(d) and (e) create a similar power for care plans. The amendment would delete those paragraphs.

<P>
It is important that providers report incidents such as outbreaks of salmonella, as well as notifying the registration authority of any accidents-for example, if a resident breaks a limb. Clause 21(6)(d) makes specific provision for that. The hon. Gentleman mentioned bedsores. He referred to the record of one care home provider in the private sector who is moving towards a zero tolerance of bedsores. That is excellent. Everyone would want to replicate that for all patients in the private and public sectors. The private sector is not alone in providing outstanding care. Superb care is being given to older people in the national health service. We want a universal high standard in both sectors. The Bill addresses aspects of that, but it is also part of the Government's wider health and social care policy.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 17 and 24 were tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight to amend the power in subsection (2)(d). It is important that registered establishments, independent agencies and domiciliary care agencies have effective procedures for dealing with and controlling infection. The Government will ensure that effective infection control is promoted and in place where appropriate. Clause 21(2)(f), which covers the management and control of operations, and 21(6)(a) contain powers to make those regulations. The policies and procedures that we will require establishments to adopt will include the provision of proper equipment and protective clothing relevant to the service that is being provided. Private hospitals and nursing homes will need to have proper arrangements for the safe disposal of used syringes and other nursing and surgical waste products.

<P>
Amendment No. 24 would ensure that regulations provide for the active promotion and protection of the health of people accommodated by, or receiving services from, establishments or relevant agencies. I agree entirely with the spirit of the argument. Clause 21(4)(a) makes the welfare regulations in clause 21(2)(d) refer to the promotion and protection of the health of service users. We amended clause 21 in the other place so that regulations could be made to require registered people and their staff to promote the health of the service users, not just to protect it. That shifts the emphasis from reactive to proactive care management. In the light of those changes, the amendment adds nothing that is not communicated by the words ``promote'' and ``protect''.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It was a probing amendment. I am grateful for the Minister's response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 12, line 15, leave out paragraph (g).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 182, in page 12, line 18, leave out ``training'' and insert ``qualification''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I sense that the Committee is anxious to make progress, but I have one quick question. The amendment-for probing purposes only-would remove paragraph (g) which provides the power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision as to the numbers of persons, or persons of any particular type, working at an establishment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will staffing ratio requirements work? I ask that question as I do not think that people are entirely clear about the ability to distinguish between sub-classes of establishments. We discussed the definition of a care home during consideration of an earlier clause. It goes without saying that the staff numbers and types that are required differ according to the type of residents. Under the current regime, a distinction is made between residential care homes and nursing homes. I imagine that the Minister will want an ability to prescribe different numbers and types of staff in the regulations, depending on the type of residents and their level of need.

<P>
Does the Minister envisage a multi-tier approach, rather than the two-tier approach that might be adopted under the current regime? Will he give us a clue on the evolution of his thinking? I ask not for precise numbers, as I appreciate that he has probably not yet reached that stage, but for an indication of the degree to which he expects to make distinctions, especially within the care homes category of establishment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall not detain the Committee by rehearsing the arguments against the amendment, with which I am sure that it is familiar, as we have advanced them several times.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked how we intended to set up a minimum required standard, which could be based on a ratio of qualified to unqualified staff. The matter is very complex. We made it clear in a Westminster Hall debate several months ago that we were not persuaded of the need for a fixed ratio of qualified to non-qualified nursing staff. We also made it clear that we would develop a way of ensuring that we could relate the needs of people in a particular care home to a requirement for round-the-clock availability of professionally qualified nurses, in exactly the manner that the hon. Gentleman described. We are currently undertaking that complex piece of work, but I am not in a position to give any further particulars about its progress. We are actively exploring how we can make such a standard tool a clear and transparent part of national minimum required standards. As the work is on-going, I cannot give further information, but if the hon. Gentleman wants to come to the Department to speak to myself and my officials about its progress, we will be happy to entertain him.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister's remarks were interesting and I am glad that the issue has been raised. His invitation to visit him and his officials in the Department is generous, but we may return to the issue sooner, during consideration of clause 22 and probe him a little further on how the approach will work in practice. However, he has given helpful guidance, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 12, line 19, leave out paragraph (i).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 186, in page 12, leave out line 45.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This amendment is slightly different. It is another probing amendment, but it is a little more aggressive in its probing. The earlier proposals to leave out provisions on securing welfare did not imply the belief that regulation-making should not exist in relation to it, but I am less persuaded that it is right and proper or appropriate for the financial position of an establishment or agency and the keeping of accounts to be subject to regulation. As part of a Bill that is about maintaining standards of care, the clause strays too far in that respect.

<P>
I return to the familiar level-playing-field argument. We hope to create a level playing field between different types of providers: local authorities, voluntary organisations and commercial providers, which will have different financial standings. Commercial providers come in all shapes and sizes, large and small, and local authorities have a completely different financial status. Some voluntary organisations might have great difficulty in meeting any tough objective tests on financial standing. It does not seem appropriate for the Bill to regulate such matters. Furthermore, the financial position of independent care homes is linked almost entirely to the payments that they receive from local authorities. There is a circularity in suggesting that regulations should specify the financial position that people are required to have to be allowed to operate a care home.

<P>
The registration criteria should deal with standards of care. A local authority could, quite properly, set out a contracting requirement for information on the financial standing of a potential contract partner. However, it is not proper to include such a provision in the Bill, as it does not relate directly to the issue of quality of care provision.

<P>
Likewise, amendment No. 186 would delete the provision enabling regulations to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision as to the keeping of accounts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why on earth should the Bill provide a power to make regulations on the keeping of accounts? This is control freakery gone mad. There are plenty of other requirements on account keeping, such as the Taxes Management Acts, VAT legislation and the Companies Acts. Why on earth does the Minister want to be able to lay such regulations? I have racked my brains in vain to think of the person whom the law does not already require to keep accounts. If there is such a person and it is not necessary for law on taxation and other such matters to require him to keep accounts, why on earth does the Minister want him to do so now?

<P>
Will the Minister tell us how such provision is relevant to care standards and whether he has considered its impact on voluntary organisations? I do not believe that he is thinking of asking all organisations, including local authorities, to maintain accounts on establishments that are run on a commercial basis, in order to ensure transparency across all types of provider. Perhaps he has such an approach in mind, but it would be helpful to know why such an intrusive power is necessary to the core purpose of the Bill, which is to ensure care standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I rise briefly, as this was meant to be an intervention. The matter about which the hon. Gentleman is speaking is fundamental to care standards. Surely the most important standard of all is the ability of the operator of a home to run it in the long term and to offer the residents security, stability and the knowledge that it will carry on in future. I can think of nothing more distressing for older people, disabled people or other vulnerable people than a scenario in which the home to which they have made the absolute commitment of their long-term security goes financially bust and in which they have to find somewhere else to live.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. Does he accept the logic of the circularity that the approach involves? The viability and long-term survival of any individual independent sector home will depend on the fees received from the local authorities that are purchasing care. The logic of his argument, which is based on the idea that one has to be absolutely sure that an institution can survive and continue to provide care in the long term, is a reversion to local authority direct provision. That is because local authorities are not constrained by commercial forces, the possibility of the bank foreclosing or the other risks faced by providers in the private sector. I understand the hon. Gentleman's intention, but he will not be able to create a risk-free environment unless we go back fully to local authority provision.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> This is life. One cannot create a risk-free environment. Inevitably, no home can continue in exactly the same form, but we are looking for substantial commitment and some evidence of a home's ability to continue.

<P>
<B>Mrs Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Does my hon. Friend agree that the funding of private-sector homes is not simply about the fees that they receive from local authorities? The mortgages and other financial arrangements that they have with the banks are important and are part of a much wider picture. Many homes close suddenly because the banks have foreclosed on mortgages. The financial viability of an establishment is important.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. Let us not beat about the bush: we are unequivocally committed to a mixed economy for care, recognising that high quality care can be provided by the public, voluntary and private sectors. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should be making such a to-do, because we should all be concerned about the fundamental issues.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) who has said what I was about to say. I shall not need to make those arguments again. I agree with him 100 per cent. about why we need to make regulations. He said that establishments or agencies providing care must be financially sound, otherwise those who depend on those services could easily be put at risk. It is essential to avoid that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge might like to know that that principle was recognised in a recent judgment relating to fitness under the Registered Homes Act 1984. In that case, the registration authority proposed to refuse registration because of a lack of financial viability. The case was referred to the High Court for judicial review. The High Court upheld the registration authority's decision. It held that the home must make the means available to provide the facilities and services. It is a fundamental point, which was made also by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is necessary.

<P>
I turn to amendment No. 186. It is important that establishments and agencies keep proper accounts. Accounts can provide useful evidence of compliance with other regulatory requirements. It is essential that the commission is able to check that a home is keeping residents' personal money in accounts separate from those used for the running of the home. I accept that such information is potentially commercially sensitive. It is necessary to provide such information to the commission, if it is to do its job of protecting the public interest, but it must be held under the strictest confidence and security.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I did not raise the matter of commercial confidentiality. The Minister anticipates something that I did not say. I am dumbstruck by his response. Can he tell us what will be required to demonstrate financial capability-the ratio of income against borrowing? What does he envisage?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall not be drawn into providing my own definition of what is a viable business. That is an issue that we will need to address when we come to exercise the powers. Then will be the time to hold the discussion.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is a business man. He must have his own theories and thoughts about the matter. We will have to develop our approach in consultation with the industry. I have made it clear that there is nothing particularly new about this. It is not the issue of substantial principle that he claims it to be. We do not intend routinely and intrusively to gather information that is unconnected with the main purpose of the National Care Standards Commission, which is to safeguard and ensure the welfare and well-being of people who are resident in care homes or use other regulated services under part II.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre made a fair point-and one which was recognised in a recent High Court judgment-when he said that the information is fundamental. The ability of the National Care Standards Commission to carry out its job properly would not be helped if the Government adopted the hon. Gentleman's view that the issues are unconnected with the quality of care provided. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre made the point well that the issue of financial viability is fundamentally connected to the issue of quality of care. It is perfectly reasonable that the Government have the power to make the regulations.

<P>
I wish to reassure the hon. Gentleman both on the security with which the information will be held and on intrusiveness. I made the point about commercial sensitivity anticipating that he would make it. I agree that I was perhaps not paying close enough attention. He did make the point. It is obviously the case that the information is commercially sensitive. Any information collected will be held in the strictest security and confidence. We will ensure that those conditions are fully met.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not reassured by the Minister's remarks. Indeed he has alarmed me. I shall address the question of why the issue becomes one of principle. It is an issue of principle in relation to a structure that otherwise appears to be trying to create a level playing field. There will be different providers. Whatever the Minister says, the requirements about financial capability and keeping accounts are targeted at one particular sub-group of providers: the private sector. That seems to be the case to me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> There is nothing in the Bill that allows the hon. Gentleman to draw that inference. The requirements will be applied on the basis of the approach that we have already identified-a level approach between all providers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Technically, I am sure that the Minister is right. However, the financial arrangements of local authorities to secure their future ability to deliver a service are of a different nature from those of independent providers. The Minister will know that there are some complex borrowing and property leasing structures in the care home industry. That is why the Minister's remarks alarm me. I can see the development of sets of regulations that will be similar to the ratio requirements that banks typically put into lending agreements-if revenue falls below certain ratios of debt-service costs, the loan is in default. That is my concern at present.

<P>
The structure of borrowing and lending in the industry is complex and many operators are highly geared, as the Minister knows. It would be easy to argue that a large proportion of the care beds in England are not particularly financially viable. In view of the evolution of local authority payments and its consequences on the businesses' revenue streams, and the precariousness of any future growth in revenues, many a bank manager would say-and, indeed, has said-``I do not regard this as a particularly viable business or a particularly viable industry. It is not an industry that we want to lend to''. Many lenders who have been active in the sector have over the past couple of years pulled out having made bank manager-like business decisions that the businesses are not particularly solid. There is an inevitable circularity. The remedy lies in the public sector's hands. If the fees paid are adequate to cover the sector's borrowing and operational costs, the businesses will be viable. My concern, as I am sure the Minister understands, is that the power could be used to discriminate against certain types of independent provider.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We will not use the regulation-making powers to discriminate against providers in the independent sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am reassured by the Minister's statement of intention, but this aspect of the Bill should be kept under close scrutiny. We shall want to examine the draft regulations carefully and consult those in the business of providing loans to the sector. I should not want businesses that were regarded by the banking sector as viable to be regarded under the regulations as non-viable. I am thinking on my feet because the Minister's response was not what I anticipated, but what I have mentioned is, broadly, the relevant dividing line. If a business can persuade a bank manager that it is viable, it is not Ministers' business to say that it is not.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is thinking on his feet, but does he accept that different distinctions could be made? The bank manager has a narrow definition of economic success. In respect of regulations, is not quality of care to be considered? Could not there be different effects?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The points made by Labour Back Benchers seem to relate entirely to continuity-the danger that a business will cease. That is always a risk in using any independent suppliers. They take business risks and will sometimes fail. The result is generally lower prices to the public sector purchaser. It is supposed to work in that way. Perhaps the regulations will not prove to be as alarming as has been suggested. I am particularly concerned about the common borrowing practices of the independent care sector. Labour Members' comments have suggested that such borrowing practices might result in a business being regarded as non-viable in the longer term.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman might inadvertently have read more into my remarks than I intended. Perhaps there is an explanation for that, but I do not know what it is. As to why on earth the National Care Standards Commission should want to second-guess the bank's judgment about the viability of a business, of course we do not want that to happen. The hon. Gentleman asked about the issues that might be taken into account in determining viability. I should expect the bank's reference to be one of the most important factors informing any judgment. In most cases, the bank's view that the business was viable would be good enough for everyone else.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If I inadvertently misinterpreted the Minister's remarks, as he said, there cannot be a reason for it. What he has just said is helpful. Perhaps we are coming back from the brink. I did not expect a major problem with the amendment. However, I hope that I have now flagged up a serious concern. I expect that the independent providers will want early reassurance from the Minister, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Regulations under subsection (2)(a) may, in particular, make provision for prohibiting persons from managing an establishment or agency unless they are registered in, or in a particular part of, one of the registers maintained under section 52(1).'.-[Mr. Hutton.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 12, line 46, after ``of'' insert ``documents and''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 70, 71, 73 and 74.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The group of technical amendments is simple and straightforward. Subsection (6)(c) allows for regulations to be made about the keeping of records by registered establishments and agencies. Questions have been asked about whether that power could be used to cover the keeping of documents as well as records. To put the matter beyond doubt, we have decided to table a specific amendment to cover the keeping of documents.

<P>
The Committee might be interested to know what documents will be covered by the provision. A care home, for example, will be required to keep a gas certificate to show that all gas appliances are safe and have been serviced annually. If the home has lifts, it will need to keep certificates to show that those, too, have been serviced regularly. All establishments will of course need a certificate of insurance showing their public liability cover.

<P>
The amendments to clause 29 will allow the registration authority to inspect and take copies of documents required to be kept under clause 21. Inspectors will also be able to require the registered person to produce documents for inspection on the premises, wherever they are normally kept. The amendments to clause 41 give similar powers to the commission to inspect and to take copies of documents relating to a local authority's discharge of adoption and fostering functions covered by part III.

<P>
I hope that hon. Members will agree that it is important for the commission to have that power and will agree to the amendments.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 13, line 1, after ``events'', insert ``of a description specified in regulations''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 188, in page 13, line 6, after ``agency'', insert ``for a continuous period of 96 hours or more''.

<P>
No. 189, in page 13, line 10, at end add ``for a continuous period of 96 hours or more;''.

<P>
No. 190, in page 13, line 11, leave out paragraph (g).

<P>
No. 191, in page 13, line 18, leave out from ``as'' to ``any'' in line 19 and insert ``shall be calculated by the registration authority from time to time to be sufficient to meet the cost of dealing with''.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> We will try to rattle through the amendments to help us make good progress. They are grouped without necessarily being directly related, but that will help to speed up the process.

<P>
Amendment No. 187 is a small, probing amendment intended to find out what was in the Minister's mind with regard to the word ``events''. All Members of Parliament will know that Macmillan offered stern advice to Governments: events could knock one off course. The term is too loose in the context-establishments could be required to give notice of social and fund raising events, for example. I presume that the Minister means ``incidents'' such as those that we discussed earlier in relation to an outbreak of infection or, more seriously, those concerning the conduct of a member of staff in relation to a resident in care. We feel strongly that ``events'' should be more tightly defined in the regulations. However, we do not want to require staff in establishments to record minutiae. Too often, staff in health care establishments complain bitterly about the amount of time that they must spend on activities such as filling in forms and writing up reports. We do not want to add to a culture in which that situation becomes worse.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 188 and 189 seek the same goal. There is nothing magic in our choice of a period of 96 hours. They are probing amendments to ensure that regulation is not taken to absurd lengths. The failure to define what constitutes a reasonable time for a manager's absence might, for example, require notice to be given if a manager nips out to the post office. The probing amendments are designed to discover what is meant by ``absence''. My example is different to that of a registered manager going on annual leave, when clear arrangements would have to be made for shifts in their absence, specifying who would assume responsibility.

<P>
In practical terms, the matter could be resolved, as in many care establishments, by a clear notice to the public on the notice board at the entrance, giving the name of the manager on duty. At the moment, as drafted, that is insufficiently clearly defined. Regulations should envisage a period of absence that makes sense for the formal handing over of the manager's powers.

<P>
Amendment No. 190 probes whether the paragraph is necessary. Surely a new manager would have to be registered with the registering authority. Therefore, the commission would automatically see the change of name of the registered person in respect of an establishment or agency. We wonder whether there is some duplication. When the Minister replies, I am sure that I shall be clearer about why the paragraph is needed.

<P>
Amendment No. 191 is designed to simplify the process of recovery of a fee for the cost of any notification made to the registering authority. The fee should simply cover the cost of dealing with that notification: nothing more and nothing less. Being prescriptive about such fees might theoretically result in a fee being fixed that turns out to be too much or too little. Perhaps the Minister should find a form of words that makes sure that the fee just covers the cost.

<P>
I look forward to hearing what those guideline amendments produce from the Minister's copious notes, which will reveal all.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady is right that my notes are copious. However, she can be reassured that I do not intend to go through them word by word. I hope to deal with her amendments fairly briefly.

<P>
Amendment No. 187 is certainly unnecessary. We could not devise the regulations properly without specifying the type of events that need to be notified. It would be absurd to expect all events to be notified to the National Care Standards Commission. Only relatively few events will need to be notified. Those might include the death of a resident, which we all agree is important. Another would be an outbreak of any infectious disease, such as salmonella. Burglaries, fires or floods would need to be notified. I reassure the hon. Lady that we will not be requiring care homes to notify the commission about their summer fairs.

<P>
Amendment No. 188 is also unnecessary as there is no question of a requirement to notify absences of less than 96 hours. The current regulations require notification to be given only where the manager proposes to be absent for four weeks or more. We intend to make a similar requirement.

<P>
Amendment No. 189 is slightly different and I have more concerns about it. It does not matter for how long the manager is to be absent. Even if it is for only a few days, adequate arrangements would be expected to be made to cover that absence. Those might include, for example, the appointment of a named deputy. It is very important that there must always be a person who is responsible for what is going on and who can take any necessary decisions. There certainly could not be a period of four days without someone being responsible for running a care home.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Would a named deputy, therefore, have to be a registered person under the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, I do not think so. I will confirm that with the hon. Lady.

<P>
Amendment No. 190 would remove an important power. The commission will need notice that the manager or the person carrying on the service proposes to leave. That major change could affect the way in which the service is run. A person taking over the establishment or agency, or a new manager, will still be required to apply to the registration authority for registration. The authority will then need to carry out checks to ensure that the individual is a fit person and that other regulatory requirements are still being complied with. Regulations made under paragraph (g) will help to ensure that.

<P>
On amendment No. 191, it is important that the authority knows of all those individuals directly associated with the running or management of an establishment or agency. Subsection (6)(h) ensures that the commission will be alerted to changes in the ownership of corporate bodies or the identity of its officers. It will then need to carry out the appropriate fit person checks. Paragraph (i) allows the appropriate Minister to make regulations setting a fee to cover the cost of this work. The amendment would mean that the registration authority itself would determine the level of the fees that might be payable. This might sound fair as the commission will have a good idea how much it has had to do to update its records. However, the issue of regulatory fees has been debated already this week and many of the arguments that I used then continue to apply here. The Secretary of State will set and structure fees to cover the reasonable costs of regulation and ensure the commission operates within its means, making the most effective use of its resources. I think that is the best way to proceed.

<P>
I can confirm to the hon. Lady that I was right and that the named person would definitely not have to be a registered person under the terms of this registration, so I hope that she is at least in part reassured. We do not want to use this regulatory power unnecessarily or in ways that are over-bureaucratic or burdensome. However, there are important issues where we need this regulatory power. I hope that I have reassured her about our intentions as to how we would use that regulatory power.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the clarification and for the common sense being exercised in relation to which events should be notified. The illustrations he gave were in an entirely different category from anything superfluous. They are all important events that should be notified. The clarification he has given, written into Hansard, will serve very well as guidance on which events should qualify for notification.

<P>
I am also grateful for the clarification that the current notification of absence is four weeks or more. Again, Hansard will provide guidance. However, I remain concerned about deputisation by someone who is not registered. Certainly, in practice, a manager may have several periods of leave in the course of the 365 days of the year and may not be tied to 20 working days' holiday. In practical terms, when the manager is absent for periods of one or two weeks, well within the notification period, there can be concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Lady is asking us to require that the deputy manager of a care home be a registered person as well. I refer her to clause 21(2)(b) which might well provide the reassurance that she seeks. We will be able to make regulations providing for the fitness of persons who work at an establishment, so those workers will clearly be covered by the regulatory arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The Minister has a mind like a butterfly that jumps ahead of what a person is just about to say-a quality that one would expect from a Minister. I was about to say that of course my interest lies in the fitness of the person to occupy the position of deputy. That is very important, not least because very often a deputy, in the hierarchy of management within an establishment, has fewer powers of influence, and when the cat's away, the mice play. Therefore, the fitness of a deputy to practice is very important. I am glad to hear that the Minister has anticipated my concern on that point and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 192, in page 13, line 25, after ``agency'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``, including arrangements for referral of complaints to an appropriate independent body where the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of a complaint made under the procedure described above''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is important. It is the one that would include in this clause arrangements for an independent complaints procedure. The weakness of the procedure on the face of this Bill is that it remains an in-house complaints procedure. The complaint is being made to the manager in the care establishment who may himself or herself be the subject of the complaint. In my experience of a variety of care homes, the question of raising complaints is difficult. Elderly or vulnerable residents are often reluctant to complain because they fear that their subsequent treatment will deteriorate. That is well documented in the research undertaken by Age Concern and it is right to raise the problem at this stage.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment would make it possible for the complaint to be heard by an independent body. The capacity to do that is important. In the last analysis, the complainant should have the ability to refer his or her complaint to the National Care Standards Commission and, finally, in the hierarchy of the complaints process, to an ombudsman. Complaints can sometimes be serious and if the procedure remains in-house and stops with the manager in the care establishment, there is insufficient objectivity and independence. An independent procedure would improve the present situation.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I congratulate the hon. Lady on tabling the amendment. When the Select Committee on Health looked at the problem in relation to the private sector, it found that the complaints procedure was not made apparent and explicit in the prospectuses of private hospitals or care homes. There was an assumption that one would complain to whoever managed the establishment, but we felt that it was important that the private sector provider should also make it absolutely clear that the commission could also be referred to and that a contact number should be made available on the literature.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) made another important point. The only time during this Parliament that the Select Committee on Health was divided was over the ultimate stage in the complaints procedure-unfortunately there were at the time no Conservative Members taking an active part in the debate. It was felt that the national health service ombudsman was not the appropriate person to look at clinical care, other than that provided through the national health service, and that the private sector itself should fund an ombudsman system.

<P>
Having lost that battle, it is important that the Government take the opportunity provided by the Bill to specify clearly what ombudsman arrangements will be made for the private sector and what will be required of it. Will the Minister tell us what pathway people can follow should they have a complaint and whether it will be clearly spelt out in the various documents that should be made available to patients, clients and their carers?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I can reassure the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman that the regulations will require all establishments and agencies to have a comprehensive and thorough procedure in place for investigating complaints. In relation to nursing homes, this will be for the first time, because the current regulations do not require them to have or operate a complaints procedure, and that is a loophole that we intend to close.

<P>
If complainants are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal procedure, they will be able to refer their complaint to the commission, which will have the power to investigate complaints about possible breaches of regulations or standards or registration conditions and we fully intend that it will do so. The commission is a fully independent body.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight raised an issue about the remit of the ombudsman and the procedures involved. I made it clear to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge earlier in the Committee that the ombudsman who will have the oversight responsibility will be the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. We have in place a triple lock: the local complaints procedure that we shall require people to set up under the regulations, the role of the National Care Standards Commission and the wider overview provided by the Parliamentary Commissioner. That is a comprehensive framework.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I appreciate that the organisation will be in place. Clause 21 and the amendment deal with the publication of the arrangements. I should like it to be explicit that the further steps are published by the organisation providing the service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not know to which amendment the hon. Gentleman is referring. It is certainly not the one that I am looking at, which is amendment No. 192. That makes no provision for publication. Perhaps we can deal with the point later in the proceedings. The amendments are well intended, but unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am not sure, but the hon. Member for Isle of Wight looks as if he may want to come straight back on that.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Clause 21(5)(j) requires
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that person to take steps for publicising the arrangements;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am keen that the arrangements should be publicised, including the subsequent stages of the complaints procedure.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am still unclear after what the Minister has said. I need to be clear, because it is an important point.

<P>
At an earlier stage in the Bill, in reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the Minister said that, in the event of maladministration by the National Care Standards Commission, the relevant ombudsman would be the Parliamentary Commissioner. In relation to the complaints procedure, however, when a patient has a complaint about a private health care establishment, would the Parliamentary Commissioner be the relevant arbiter of that complaint? If so, may I draw the Minister's attention to the remarkable variation in the way in which some ombudsmen deal with complaints? One of the problems with the NHS ombudsman, in practical terms, is that, as a parliamentarian, the period after which he regards a complaint from the health care sector to be out of time is comparatively short. Sometimes, when a complaint arises in a health care establishment-relating to cosmetic surgery, let us say-several years may elapse before the practice that led to the problems finally produces symptoms and leads to a complaint being made.

<P>
One of my difficulties is to be sure about which ombudsman will deal with the complaint and to know that when a complaint is generated in a health care or care establishment, it will be clear to the person who has the bad experience what procedural route to follow. I need clarification on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> On this occasion, I shall write to the hon. Lady to give her the clarification that she seeks. The role of the Parliamentary Commissioner will relate to the functioning of the commission and its operations. I may be more specific in my correspondence with her.

<P>
I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. I made the point that amendment No. 192 does not refer to adjustments to the procedures
 for publication, whereas paragraph (j) does. Establishments and agencies will be required to inform complainants who want to take a complaint to the commission that that route is open to them. To all intents and purposes, that is effectively publication. I hope that he is satisfied.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The Minister's response to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has satisfied me. For that reason, and looking forward to his letter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
