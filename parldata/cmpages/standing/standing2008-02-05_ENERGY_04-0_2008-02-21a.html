Chairman:
						</b> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets. Please
would all Members who have mobile phones or pagers ensure they are

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000189"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b> Good morning. It is
good to get into the Committee stage proper, although the evidence
sessions are an interesting innovation. It is a great pleasure to serve
under your Chairmanship, Mrs.
Humble.</div>
					<a name="080221101000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me introduce clause 1. Under part V of the United Nations convention on
the law of the sea, coastal states can claim certain rights within an
area known as the exclusive economic zone, which extends from the edge
of the 12 nautical mile limit to the territorial sea for a further
distance of 188 nautical miles. Article 56(1) of the UN convention
provides that these rights include, among other things, the exploration
and exploitation of the sea bed and its subsoil and the waters above
it. It also provides jurisdiction for the establishment and use of
installations and structures in the area. The UK has previously claimed
a number of rights under article 56(1), such as rights to the offshore
generation of electricity, under the Energy Act 2004, but has not yet
claimed rights in relation to unloading and storing gas.</div>
					<a name="080221101000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
makes provision to claim those rights by providing for the ownership to
be vested in the Crown within areas designated as gas importation
storage zones by means of an Order in Council. Subsection 2 sets out
the activities to which those rights relate&#151;namely, the
unloading of gas to installations or pipelines, storing gas whether or
not it will be recovered and exploring for suitable sites for unloading
or storing gas.</div>
					<a name="080221101000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the fact that the clause covers
both the storage of combustible gases, such as methane and butane, and
the storage of non-combustible gases, such as carbon dioxide. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>Without this provision, it would not be possible to
implement the licensing regimes set out in chapters 2 and 3 of this
part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080221101000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000190"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Will the Minister confirm
that nothing in the Bill will affect existing foreshore-right owners,
where the foreshore is not vested in the
Crown?</div>
					<a name="080221101000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000191"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> If other hon. Members are going to speak to the
clause, I may have the opportunity to give the hon. Gentleman a
definitive answer to that question in due course. I hope that that is
acceptable to him. My instinct is that the Bill will not do so; but if
my instinct is wrong, perhaps I will return to the
question.</div>
					<a name="080221101000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000192"></a>
							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I join the Minister in welcoming
you, Mrs. Humble, as our Chairman, and I thank the Minister
for the way that we went through the evidence sessions. It is the first
time I have gone through an evidence-taking session. They have been
extremely useful; they have given industry and others a very good
opportunity to tell us what they think, and that has helped us work
more effectively together as a Committee.</div>
					<a name="080221101000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding of these
Committees was that the Government would normally stuff them with
placemen, who would simply vote with everything that the Government
wanted, but what is very encouraging is that it is actually a Committee
full of Members who understand energy, who care passionately about
different aspects of it, and that is very good in terms of the issues
that we need to
debate.</div>
					<a name="080221101000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another thing
that came out of those sessions was a sense that many of the things
that we have concerns about are not included in the Bill, such as smart
meters, feed-in tariffs and the role of Ofgem. I hope that the Minister
will give us an opportunity&#151;particularly in the light of
today&#146;s news on British Gas&#151;to have wider debates about
fuel poverty and social tariffs, because they are clearly matters of
great concern to people.</div>
					<a name="080221101000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you said, Mrs.
Humble, there are no amendments to these early clauses, but we wish to
have some questions answered before we give the go-ahead to individual
clauses. We certainly agree with the Minister that more needs to be
done to make those areas outside territorial waters available for gas
importation and storage.</div>
					<a name="080221101000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister tell us his
assessment of the long-term role of the Rough gas field storage
facility? Does he believe that it has a long life? Does he expect it to
be there for many years into the future, or is part of his
concern&#151;and part of the reason for introducing these
provisions&#151;a feeling that the Rough gas field will have reached
the end of its useful life before long? Will the Minister elaborate on
how the process of identifying such zones will work? Who will be
responsible for that and what process of consultation must be
undertaken before approval as an appropriate zone for such work? Can he
also provide some detail on the types of installation that such
exercises will involve, especially the above-water structure?</div>
					<a name="080221101000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been recent media coverage and some discussion during the evidence
sessions about the Ministry of Defence&#146;s objections to some of
the offshore wind farms; not so much the actual objections&#151;we
all understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>the need for radar and national security&#151;but on the timing of
some of those objections. Clearly, if significant parts of the new
structures will be above sea level, the MOD might have concerns about
them. Perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for the Minister to
address those issues. These are simply a few points of clarification;
but, in general, we have no objection to the
clause.</div>
					<a name="080221101000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000193"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): Does the Minister
feel that enough is known about the storage of carbon dioxide below the
sea in the cavities from which oil has been excavated? Will he support
future research by the organisations that are already involved, to
ensure that such carbon dioxide storage will be safe
indefinitely?</div>
					<a name="080221101000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000194"></a>
							<b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Good morning, Mrs.
Humble. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.</div>
					<a name="080221101000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is very striking, having
observed the procedures on the Bill so far, is that most of the
attention has been focused on what is not in the Bill, rather than what
is. Obviously, we will look at the detail. However, the balance of
amendments tabled so far reflects the fact that we in the Committee are
not particularly exercised with most of the Bill, but we do feel that
it is a missed opportunity. I hope that there will be time during our
proceedings to discuss those issues, some of which were raised by the
hon. Member for Wealden.</div>
					<a name="080221101000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister give us
slightly more context to the clause and this part of the Bill? I
appreciate that clause 1 is very limited, but rather than repeat that
on each clause in this part of the Bill, may I refer the Minister to
the Department&#146;s press notice that relates to those clauses? Is
says that</div>
					<a name="080221101000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The current offshore
regime for gas infrastructure projects is complex and a barrier to
investment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221101000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister expand on the measures in this part of the Bill, of which
this is obviously the first clause? What exactly is deemed complex
about the present regime by those who have to deal with it? How will
the changes in these clauses address those complexities?</div>
					<a name="080221101000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often, we find that complexity
is there for a reason. It may be possible to achieve the same objective
more simply, but often something has been specified in detail to
address a particular problem. How sure is the Minister that, by
simplifying the regulation, we will not allow things to happen that
were perhaps not meant to be allowed when the original regulations were
framed?</div>
					<a name="080221101000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister can give us more of an overview of this part of the
Bill&#151;this is probably the right time to do so&#151;it may
speed up our consideration of subsequent clauses. Certainly, on the
substance of the clause, I do not think that we have any substantive
objection.</div>
					<a name="080221101000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000195"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I understand the concern expressed by the hon.
Member for Northavon about the need to set out the context. I hope that
the Committee will be patient with me, as I was going to set that out
when I introduced clause 2, which introduces a family of clauses that
hang together.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>
					<a name="080221101000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I just
confirm to the hon. Member for East Devon that my instincts were right?
The Bill will not affect the territory that he was discussing; indeed,
the clause will only affect rights beyond the 12 miles of the
territorial sea.</div>
					<a name="080221101000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative spokesman asked me about Rough storage facility. I am
advised that that is a commercial matter. However, to be helpful, our
understanding is that Rough storage probably has quite a long life
ahead of it. The more strategic point however is that there is sense in
which the UK continental shelf, especially in the North sea, has been a
natural store of gas and, indeed, oil for the
UK.</div>
					<a name="080221101000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">

Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con)

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000197"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Let me just finish my paragraph&#151;although it
could be a long paragraph, I do not know, depending on what the hon.
Gentleman is going to ask, and I cannot guess. As the UKCS starts to
decline and given the fierce international competition for energy
resources, many of us feel&#151;I think that this will be shared in
the Committee&#151;that we need more gas storage facilities, and the
market is indeed coming forward with proposals. I think I am at one
with the Conservative spokesman on the importance of
that&#151;indeed, much of the Bill will enable it to be facilitated
by an appropriate regulatory
regime.</div>
					<a name="080221101000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
types of installation, above water, they will be injection platforms
and involve the recovery of stored gas&#151;plus, of course,
liquefied natural gas platforms. Indeed, LNG is becoming an
increasingly important part of the global energy market. I think that I
have dealt with the issue of Rough.</div>
					<a name="080221101000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East talked about the behaviour of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. This is a critical question. So far, globally, we have
relatively little experience of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage, although the
sheet is not blank; there is some experience. The example that I draw
comfort from&#151;it is perhaps the one that has been best
researched&#151;is the Sleipner gas field in Norwegian waters, where
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
						<span class="Sub"> </span>has been successfully injected for something
like 10 years. It is carefully monitored, scientifically studied and
the advice is that, geologically, the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> is behaving as one
would expect, which in layman&#146;s terms means that it is still
down there in a very safe
state.</div>
					<a name="080221101000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
agree with my hon. Friend that, as we enter a century in which we
expect to see the development of the safe storage of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#151;frankly, we need to see it&#151;the scientific
issues are absolutely vital. That is one reason why we have established
a joint working relationship with our Norwegian friends. I discussed
this with the Norwegian Minister only a couple of weeks ago, and we
have an expert working group looking at all aspects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>.
My hon. Friend raises a very important
point.</div>
					<a name="080221101000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">One or two of
the other issues raised may be ones we can tackle in the course of the
morning. As our debates proceed, there are a number of pegs on which we
can have some informed discussion on some of these critical questions.
That might include the Liberal spokesman&#146;s question about why is
the current regime so complex&#151;we might be able to tease out
answers to that this morning.</div>

paragraph?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000199"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:

Gentleman, but I got so excited by the geological storage of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> that I was guilty of a discourtesy. Let me give
way.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000200"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> The Minister is very kind; I am most grateful. I
recognise that the whole question of the regulator and the relationship
with licensing will be dealt with later. However, I am concerned at
this early stage about storage in the North sea and its relationship to
the pre-combustion extraction of carbon and to the ability to obtain
more from the North sea.</div>
					<a name="080221101000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that I am slightly out of order, but one reason why I raise the issue
now is that the Minister will know that tests have been set in respect
of post-combustion. One proposal involved linking pre-combustion with
the extraction of oil. Will he at least comment on that and give me
some hope that other ways might be found to help people who want to
exploit that
facility?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman said that I was very kind to
give way. If I may say so, he was far too patient. He should have been
waving his Order Paper to remind me that I had promised to give
way.</div>
					<a name="080221101000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue raised
goes slightly outside the clause, but let me say that what we are doing
this morning is, with the permission of the Committee, putting in place
a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework. That brings us back to the
Liberal Democrat question. The short answer is that we believe that, at
the moment our legislative cover, is not fit for purpose. We are
engaged in new territory relating to LNG and carbon capture and
storage&#151;later clauses deal with CCS&#151;and we need a
fit-for-purpose regulatory framework. That is the essence of the early
part of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="080221101000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I can reassure the hon. Member for Northampton, South that
although there is an interesting debate about whether we have chosen
the right technology for our demonstration project of
post-combustion&#151;my story there is about its applicability to
China, given the imperative of tackling global warming&#151;this
framework would be fit for purpose for whatever technologies arise in
the future. These clauses are not part of the post-combustion scenario;
they are about a wider scenario.</div>

that it is near perfect, although we will see whether Committee members
agree with that&#151;I will detain the Committee with a number of
relatively short speeches on clause stand part. However, it is
important to get certain points on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>the record and, of course, to enable Committee members to participate in
debates about particular clauses. This will be one of the slightly
longer speeches, because I want to set out the context that the hon.
Member for Northavon was anxious to
hear.</div>
					<a name="080221101000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have touched
on this point already. The context is that we in the UK have been
fortunate for some time in being able to rely on natural resources for
much of our energy consumption. As I have noted, however, gas
production from the UK continental shelf&#151;the UKCS&#151;and
particularly from the North sea is in decline. The story of the North
sea is in two parts, both of which are important. One is that the UKCS
remains a very important business in the United Kingdom. There is still
a great deal of energy there. Indeed, I am reliably informed that two
thirds of our energy need and demand in Britain is still met by the
UKCS, so it is still very significant, but it is in decline at probably
the rate of about 8 per cent. at the moment. The decline is therefore
significant. Both things are true: it remains important, but it is in
decline. That is part of the context for our
discussion.</div>
					<a name="080221101000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
started to import gas relatively recently because of the decline that I
have mentioned. We are perhaps importing 20 per cent. or so of our gas
requirement at the moment, but by 2020 that could be up to 80 per cent.
A more cautious estimate would be between  50 and 80 per cent.,
but the Committee will see that the change is significant and
relatively rapid. That greater reliance on imports poses some risk to
the United Kingdom from overseas disruptions to energy supplies, as
supply routes become longer and as they cross ever more countries to
enter the UK&#146;s energy system.</div>
					<a name="080221101000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">To minimise the risk of
disruption or of soaring prices at times of high demand, we need to
ensure that we have sufficient levels of gas importation and enough
storage facilities. Some will remember that only two winters ago the
spot price for gas rose on some days to a considerable height. We have
less storage capacity than our continental neighbours, but as I said
earlier that is because our store is the UKCS itself. However, it is
worth noting that things are now changing.</div>
					<a name="080221101000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses in chapter 2 seek
to address the problem by creating a regulatory framework to encourage
investment in infrastructure that will allow the storage of gas
offshore and enable liquefied natural gas imported into the UK to be
unloaded to offshore installations or pipelines in order to be piped
ashore. The Committee will know that LNG will become a significantly
important part of global gas supplies. Almost certainly, it will become
an increasingly important part of supply to the United Kingdom, not
least with the Qatari LNG about to come on
stream.</div>
					<a name="080221101000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
there is potentially some &#163;10 billion of private sector
investment to be made in such projects, but investors have told us that
they need a regulatory regime for such investment that will offer
clarity and certainty. This part of the Bill will provide for such a
regime through the establishment of gas unloading and storage licences.
The Bill provides the powers to create a bespoke regulatory regime for
the unloading of LNG and natural gas storage projects under the sea
bed. Clauses 2 to 6 cover the licensing arrangements for such unloading
and storage projects, and clauses 7 to 14 cover the enforcement of
those licences.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>
					<a name="080221101000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
2 underpins the new regime by prohibiting gas storage or unloading
without a licence, gas being defined in terms of the combustible gases
such as methane used for energy production. That prohibition also
covers the recovery of the gas stored, the conversion of natural
features such as salt domes for use as storage space and related
exploration activities, as well as the establishment and maintenance of
installations for those purposes. The prohibition applies in any place
within the limits of the territorial sea adjacent to the UK or within a
gas importation and storage zone designated under clause 1, which could
extend up to 188 miles beyond the seaward boundaries of the territorial
sea.</div>
					<a name="080221101000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a point of
clarification, I should add that clause 2 applies to operators that
carry on storage activities, but the provisions do not apply to the
shipper or owner of the gas. Those persons that provide the gas to the
operators of the storage facilities will therefore not require a gas
unloading and storage licence. Anyone undertaking such activities
without a licence will be subject to the criminal sanctions set out in
clause 7.</div>
					<a name="080221101000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Establishing
an offence for non-compliance will help to ensure that developers seek
the necessary licence before undertaking any such activity. That will
enable us to keep track of all projects and to ensure that appropriate
safeguards, such as environmental protections, are in place and adhered
to.</div>

							<a name="080221101000203"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> On that point about environmental protection, I
want to tease out from the Minister what discussions he has had with
the marine environmental lobby. For instance, my part of the world is
an area of outstanding natural beauty and a world heritage site, where
the marine environment is extremely sensitive. What consideration will
be given to
that?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000204"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Again, I thank the hon. Gentleman for notice of
that question. We are fully aware of the environmental considerations,
and I may say a little more about the subject later. However, just as
in existing regimes for the exploration of oil and gas, environmental
considerations are paramount. We are confident that through these
provisions we can satisfy the hon. Gentleman. I am bound to say that
all our constituencies are areas of outstanding natural beauty, and
that is certainly true of Croydon, North.</div>

local planning committees with regard to their environmental impact

							<a name="080221101000206"></a>Malcolm

an opportunity during the course of this debate to give a more specific
answer to my hon. Friend
.</div>
					<a name="080221101000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000207"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab): I give the Minister
advance notice of my question now so that he can answer it later. How
does this measure interact with the habitats directive? Will the
licences be issued irrespective of one&#146;s responsibilities to the
habitats directive, with those responsibilities being met later? Or
will the person applying for the licence have to fulfil the obligations
of the habitats directive before applying for the licence? As I say, I
am quite happy if the Minister answers that question
later.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000208"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> If I may, I will answer that question in full
later. The short answer is that we are fully joined up. Let us give an
example of how we intend to tackle this. Concerns exist, for example,
about the situation for whales and dolphins. Before awarding any
licence or consent, the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform will conduct an appropriate assessment of the site,
in line with the requirements of the habitats and wild birds
directives. Should a licence or consent be deemed to have a negative
impact on a protected habitat, such as the one for whales and dolphins,
the licence or consent will not be awarded. For example, we have not
issued licences for oil and gas exploration in Cardigan bay recently
because we were concerned about the situation of the dolphins there. I
hope that that reassures my hon. Friend about our good intentions and
our commitment to ensure that we have the appropriate legislation and
regulation.</div>
					<a name="080221101000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000209"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> I am very grateful to the Minister for that
reassuring answer. The one concern I have relates to his point of view
and that of his Department. He seems to be describing a process in
which officials in his Department have to be expert not just on energy
matters but on environmental matters in order to judge whether to issue
a licence. I wonder whether that is to expect too much of his
Department.</div>
					<a name="080221101000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000210"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I do not want my hon. Friend to expect too much of
my Department, but he can expect a great deal. Obviously, this is a
situation in which we have to join up with relevant agencies, and with
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in particular. I
note his concern, and I will say more about that in due
course.</div>
					<a name="080221101000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">My instincts
about local planning were correct. I am sure that during the course of
Committee procedures in the past, my instincts have been incorrect, but
I have always corrected myself later. I am being modest about this. In
terms of local planning, the answer is that this regime purely applies
offshore. I hope that that satisfies my hon.
Friend.</div>
					<a name="080221101000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that with the advent of the single electricity market across
Ireland, there are increasingly different considerations to take into
account in Northern Ireland to the proposals that might come forward in
the rest of the United Kingdom. To reflect those differences, I believe
that it will be prudent for my Department and the Department of
Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland to pursue a formal
memorandum of understanding, setting out how we would work with the
relevant authorities in Northern Ireland before granting any consents
for gas infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland territorial waters.
With those words, I move that this clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080221101000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000211"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out
with such clarity the stark picture that is facing us on these issues.
Some of us will have felt that his judgment was slightly impaired when
he referred to Croydon as an area of outstanding natural beauty. I
thought that most of us would assume that the nicest thing in Croydon
is the A22, which leads to my constituency. However, this may have to
be one of those areas of difference where we simply will not be able to
find common ground and
agree.</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>
					<a name="080221101000165"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
					<a name="080221101000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
is also right to say that we could be dependent on imports for 80 per
cent. of our gas by 2020. In the explanatory notes, it says that more
than half of our demand for gas may be met by imports by 2020. However,
the Minister is absolutely right to give a much starker assessment of
the situation. Looking at his Department&#146;s figures, our current
consumption of gas is about 105 billion cu m a year. By 2010, that
figure is expected to rise to 110 billion cu m a year and by 2020 it is
expected to rise to 130 billion cu m a year. By 2010, half of our
demand will be met by imports and by 2020, 80 per cent. of our demand
will be met by imports.</div>
					<a name="080221101000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is
a very significant challenge facing us. It is not just us who face it;
the issue of gas demand applies across the whole world. It is estimated
that in 20 years&#146; time, there will be a 300 GW energy gap in the
European Union alone. Just because people choose to build power
stations that are powered by gas, that does not mean that there will be
the gas available to power them.</div>
					<a name="080221101000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are rightly now addressing the issue of gas storage. In the
past, I do not think that they have done enough in this regard. The
Minister will remember his words when he said, just about two years
ago, that we were &#147;awash with gas&#148;, which was about 24
hours before we nearly ran out of gas; I think that was the timing of
his comment. Of Mary I, it was said that if they opened her up they
would find &#147;Calais&#148; written on her heart; when the time
comes for the Minister to be opened up, which we obviously hope is a
long way off, we will find the words &#147;awash with gas&#148;
written on his heart. It is better than having &#147;full of
wind&#148; written there, but the phrase &#147;awash with
gas&#148; did not quite capture the spirit of the problem at that
time.</div>
					<a name="080221101000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is
that, at the moment, we have about  12 days of average winter
gas usage storage in this country. That compares with 80 days in
France, Spain and Germany, where they are required by law to have far
higher amounts of gas storage than we are required to have in this
country.</div>
					<a name="080221101000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gas storage
is an area in which we need to do much more. The Minister quite rightly
points out the improvements that are happening in LNG and the pipeline
connections that we have, which certainly add to our country&#146;s
energy security. However, he is absolutely right to say that more needs
to be done to open up the potential for that &#163;10 billion worth
of investment in gas storage facilities. The industry has said to us
that it wants a much clearer regulatory regime and, judging from its
reactions to the Bill, it seems that the proposals that are being put
forward are just about right.</div>
					<a name="080221101000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need to be clear about
the security of our gas imports. People can very readily get worked up
about Russian gas imports, but I think that we must be sensible about
that issue. There is wonderful imagery of the Russians being able to
turn off a tap and just stop the gas flow coming through to countries
such as Britain. We have a duty to explain to people that that is not
the way that the system works. We must make it clear that, as a
company, Gazprom has honoured every trading contract that it has had.
Where the difficulties have arisen in Belarus and in Ukraine, those
difficulties have been caused by very different issues, where gas sold
cheaply for domestic consumption has been sold 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>on at a much higher market price. I hope that we can try to reassure
people that we do not face a threat from Russia on these issues.
However, it is still right to take these steps of improving gas
storage.</div>
					<a name="080221101000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000212"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): I recently attended a
conference on energy and climate change in Ukraine, where
representatives of the Belarusian and Ukrainian political parties were
present, in addition to Gazprom. Among the Belarusians and the
Ukrainians, the fear is a very real one that the Russians will
arbitrarily turn off their gas at a
whim.</div>
					<a name="080221101000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000213"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that, in
those countries, there is that fear. However, it is very interesting to
see how the British press and the German press have interpreted this
story. Here, we have tended to say, &#147;Look what Russia has done.
How scary! That could happen here.&#148; The German press have
focused on the comments of the President of Ukraine, who says that
Ukraine must look at its contracts and see if it has paid its bills,
because that was the reason why Ukraine was disconnected. I think that,
in this country, there is a bit of hysteria about this issue.</div>
					<a name="080221101000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, if we want to
reassure people, it is absolutely right that more gas storage will be
an integral part of any energy solution, because the more gas that is
stored on land or at sea here, the more we can increase the number of
days of provision that we have and that will make it easier for people
to feel secure in the long term.</div>
					<a name="080221101000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the Minister that
the current system of consents is too complicated and that there is
great sense in simplifying it. What would happen if there was more than
one licence sort for the same patch of sea? It is possible that there
would be two potential storage areas, one beneath the other. About a
year ago, I went with a parliamentary group to Texas and we saw what BP
is doing in the gulf of Mexico. It is looking for and is able to
identify oil and gas reserves under 10,000 ft of water and 20,000 ft of
rock, and it can pinpoint those reserves with incredible accuracy. If
one is now looking for oil and gas at those depths, it is plausible
that one will find two potential reserves: one above the other. How
does the licence relate to depths as well as to geographic area? What
will the proposals mean for combined gas and wind projects? The
Minister may be aware of Eclipse Energy&#146;s project off the
north-west coast; the intention is that when the wind is blowing, power
will be provided by wind turbines and when it is not, the project will
draw the gas from a largely depleted gas field. That seems to be a good
balance, because one uses the wind when one can but one ensures
security of supply as there is a gas back-up. In those circumstances,
is it conceivable that what was previously a gas field would be
designated as gas storage because of the way that it was being used?
What would be the implications for those sort of projects? In general,
we support the clause and, with those clarifications, we are happy to
take it forward.</div>
					<a name="080221101000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000214"></a>
							<b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): Mrs. Humble, it is a
delight to be serving under your chairmanship again and I am looking
forward to a co-operative approach from the Committee, with a lot of
free exchange of ideas between both sides. However, to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>sound a slightly partisan note to start with, my constituency really
does contain an area of outstanding natural beauty; the Cotswolds might
beat Croydon on a good day. We have already had an insight into the
psychology of Conservative Members on this subject; I had not realised
that when they were talking about withdrawing from Europe, they were
still talking about the loss of Calais. Perhaps that is an unfair
point.</div>
					<a name="080221101000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the subject of the clause, which is the licensing regime, clearly the
purpose, as the Minister said, is to provide a suitable basis on which
to have security of gas supply and to provide certainty and stability
to energy retailers. One hopes that that stability will translate into
stability of prices for consumers, which is a hot topic at the moment
because of the sharp rises in energy prices that consumers have been
suffering from. Instability and energy prices for the energy companies
can sometimes translate into very large profits, as we have seen in the
news today. Have the Government given any consideration to ways of
recovering perhaps some of the cost of this licensing regime? The
impact assessment puts the cost at a high level, but the licence price
suggested in the impact assessment is only about &#163;3,000. Will
there be any scope for trying to recover, from the very high profits
that energy companies make from time to time, any of the
taxpayers&#146; costs? Recovered costs could then be directed at
measures to tackle fuel poverty and might offset some of the impact of
variable energy prices. Perhaps the Minister can address
that.</div>
					<a name="080221101000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
assessment also suggests two particular risks associated with a new
licensing regime. Paragraph 66 on page 58
says:</div>
					<a name="080221101000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is a risk that the time taken to bring the new licensing scheme into
effect will act as a disincentive to developers in the short
term.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221101000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are there any
steps that the Government can take to minimise that disincentive and to
make it clear to developers that they should not be discouraged at this
vital time in the development of the technology? There is also concern
in the impact assessment
that:</div>
					<a name="080221101000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
licensing scheme will need to be sufficiently widely drafted so as to
capture the range of innovative new technologies which are being
developed in this
sector.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221101000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having looked
at the clauses, I cannot see anything that addresses the issue in the
legislation. Will the Minister tell us that there will be a conscious
effort to avoid closing off any particular technological avenues or
innovation, and that the licensing regime will not be implemented too
tightly?</div>
					<a name="080221101000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="080221101000215"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> This has been a useful debate on a number of quite
important issues. I suspect that from time to time, perhaps with your
support, Mrs. Humble, I have been a rather tedious member of
the Committee who sticks to the Bill. The contextual issues are very
interesting and the hon. Member for Wealden, helped us with the context
by emphasising the changing nature and growing importance of imports of
gas into the United Kingdom. Certainly those will be considerable in
the
future.</div>
					<a name="080221101000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
judgment is that, as the century unfolds, the geopolitical issues
relating to energy insecurities globally will become almost as
significant on immediate agendas as climate change. I do not feel
entirely relaxed about some of the questions in that regard, but we
must 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>pursue those issues on another occasion. It is certainly important that,
alongside the UK developing what I always refer to rather simply as
&#147;home-grown energy&#148;&#151;energy that we can produce
ourselves, here and offshore&#151;we are smart about pipelines and
regions and the importance of LNG. In terms of our national security,
that is very
important.</div>
					<a name="080221101000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had
better not say too much about the phrase &#147;awash with
gas&#148;, but on the occasion referred to, a debate was going on
about whether the lights were going to go out. I cannot remember who
was the leading proponent of that idea at the time. Others of us said,
&#147;No, the lights are going to stay on,&#148; and on the
particular day when I said to the House of Commons that we were awash
with gas, that was the advice that I had received from national grid.
That turned out to be the case, but I hope that that rather inelegant
phrase will not be written across any part of me on any occasion,
either now or in the long-term
future.</div>
					<a name="080221101000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
issues have been raised. In particular, it was asked whether more than
one licence would be sought in relation to the same patch of sea. I am
advised that the Crown Estate will consider the competition and
overlapping issues for any lease. Both the licence and the Crown Estate
lease will apply to a defined volume, so it can deal with the issue of
depth. I think that we are all right there, but no doubt when we need
to draft any regulations later, or when we are in discussion with the
Crown Estate, we will bring that issue to the attention of the relevant
authorities.</div>
					<a name="080221101000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked about potential conflicts and I agree that the project that
has a wind turbine attached to it in the sea is quite intriguing. We
may see more of that in the future. At present, all consents required
will be given by the Secretary of State, taking into account other
activities in the sea environment, including other petroleum activities
and proposed wind farms. Likewise, the Bill includes an amendment to
the Petroleum Act 1998 to allow gas storage developments as well as
wind farms to be taken into account when consenting to petroleum
activities. Such provision is already made in relation to wind farms by
an amendment made by the Energy Act 2004. Those arrangements will allow
the Secretary of State to ensure that the respective industries have
liaised with each other with regard to a mutually agreed solution for
developments, and ensure that those industries co-exist in the
interests of
all.</div>
					<a name="080221101000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet wondered whether BERR was
sufficiently environmentally expert. I reiterate that our long
experience as a Department in regulating offshore oil and gas means
that we have become expert on environmental issues. Indeed, the
Department already employs an offshore environment and decommissioning
unit, which regulates the offshore oil and gas and renewables industry,
in the context of sustainable development, with a raft of legislation
for the protection of the environment. I reiterate that we liaise
carefully with DEFRA and other appropriate
agencies.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="080221101000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard from
the hon. Member for Cheltenham&#151;another very important and
beautiful part of our country. I will not rise to the challenge about
Croydon, North, except to say that Thornton Heath looks lovely at this
time of year, if hon. Members know what I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>mean. I will not go on about Broadgreen, which is also particularly
beautiful&#151;I am in enough trouble making those remarks. I will
not be tempted by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="080221101000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The usual
answer applies, perfectly appropriately: the use of revenues must be a
matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and not me, sadly. I think
that I have more or less covered that question, but the hon. Gentleman
asked another about new technologies. We are not in the business of
trying to close those off. The Bill contains enabling powers to
facilitate the new licensing regime to cover all types of innovative
investment in gas offshore. Later on, we will come to clauses on carbon
capture and storage. Part of the raison d&#146;être of the
Bill is the introduction of a new regulatory regime for the kinds of
new challenges and technologies that we are now

							<a name="080221101000218"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> We now move on to the part of the Bill that deals
with the licensing process. Our amendment relates to the conditions
that must be satisfied before a licence is issued. Amendment No. 19
relates to gas licences. Amendment No. 20 is identically worded and
relates to carbon storage licences. It was very sensible and wise of
you, Mrs. Humble, to group them together, so that we do not
have the same conversation
twice.</div>
					<a name="080221101000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would ensure that, when the licensing arrangements for the offshore
storage of natural gas and, subsequently, CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>are made, they
take full account of the environmental risks and, in particular, that
they are integrated with future legislative arrangements for protecting
the marine environment. What we are driving at is the fact that we have
this Bill and then a marine Bill. Clause 3 talks about the regulation
of the marine environment, on which will follow further legislation
later this year. How will those interrelate? Should we be concerned
that this Bill might not deal with things that are not then picked up
in the marine Bill?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>
					<a name="080221101000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the marine Bill will not cover the sort of issues before
us today, such as gas storage. Therefore, if we do not get that right
in this Bill, it might not be done at all. That is why we tabled these
two amendments, which would simply require that, before a licence is
granted, the licence issuing authority should consult other Departments
with an environmental interest, of which DEFRA is the most obvious. It
would also be required to consult different environmental agencies,
including those with responsibilities for the marine
environment.</div>
					<a name="080221101000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the Committee will forgive me for returning ad nauseam to my main
theme, which is that energy and the environment are the
responsibilities of different Departments. With the best will in the
world, the incentives, interests and focus of those two Departments are
not identical; they could not be. The danger is that the body that
decides whether to grant a licence under the Bill will have a raft of
considerations, such as safety&#151;that consideration would be
common to both Departments&#151;and energy considerations might be
given greater weight than environmental ones where there is a potential
trade-off between the two. Obviously, if they go hand in hand, it is
not an issue. However, if, for example, a big leap forward in energy
security or supply could be achieved at some modest environmental cost,
there would be a trade-off.</div>
					<a name="080221101000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without our amendment, the
energy Department might be inclined to grant a licence where the
environment Department might give greater weight to consideration of
the environmental damage and say no. To give an imperfect analogy, we
had a meeting with the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform about the Severn barrage&#151;a clear case in which
energy issues might point one way, but consideration of the
environmental damage the other. A trade-off must be sought, and if the
energy Department has the lead and has no environmental duty under the
Bill, the worry is that environmental considerations might, at best, be
secondary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000219"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> I very much understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying, which is why I asked the Minister the same questions. However,
my understanding is that the habitats directive already imposes on the
Government the obligation to carry out consultations, so I do not
understand why the hon. Gentleman wants to include such a provision in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="080221101000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000220"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I am grateful for that and I noticed that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention was consistent with the points that I
wanted to make. Many of the environmental organisations that have been
in touch with us, such as the WWF and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, are keen to have some reassurance from the
Minister on the point that the hon. Gentleman raises. They seek
reassurance on not only present technologies, but novel technologies,
which my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham mentioned. In other
words, we want to be confident that there will be, for example, a full
strategic environmental assessment where novel forms of extraction or
storage are applied. I am not absolutely sure that such an assessment
would follow from the habitats directive&#151;I do not know enough
about it to know whether that would be the case&#151;but that is the
sort of assurance that those groups seek from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>the Minister. Where novel extraction or storage activities are licensed
under the Bill, will they be subject to a full strategic environmental
assessment?</div>
					<a name="080221101000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is whether such considerations should be dealt with as part of the
licensing process at all, or whether the proposed marine management
organisation, which is obviously germane to this issue, should have
oversight. The worry is that the Government&#146;s plan is that it
should not. If so, we would have a Bill covering the licensing of
offshore gas storage and supply, but the separate marine management
organisation that is to be introduced in legislation later this year
would have no duties at all. Most people would think it rather strange
to create a body called the marine management organisation when that
body has no remit over the extraction and storage of gas and energy in
the marine environment. I hope that the Minister can clarify the
relationship between that body and the licensing authority and why the
marine environment organisation will not be given oversight over such
issues.</div>
					<a name="080221101000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
should like some clarification of spatial planning in the marine
environment, to which these proposals relate. Currently, there is not a
robust set of protected marine areas to guide the location of new
activities at sea, but the licences that we are talking about should be
granted in accordance with a strategic overview. We have heard mention
of local planning authorities, and individual planning applications
that were made on land would fall within a strategic plan. If the
Government do not accept the amendment and if the marine management
organisation does not have responsibility for such issues, we might end
up with&#151;I was about to say a gold rush, but that is not the
right analogy&#151;people making licence applications on an ad hoc
basis that do not fit into an overall planning environment, as they
would on land.</div>
					<a name="080221101000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
preference would be for the marine management organisation to have
responsibility for environmental oversight over such issues. However,
if the interest is in regulatory simplicity and in having only one
body, not two, and if the marine management organisation is deemed not
to be the right body, we would, at the very least, want there to be
consultation of the sort envisaged in the amendments with the relevant
environmental bodies before licences were
granted.</div>
					<a name="080221101000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221101000221"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I seek your
guidance, Mrs. Humble, on whether the intention is to enter
into a clause stand part debate after we have considered the
amendments, or whether I should address all my remarks to the
amendment. The best thing is probably to proceed and see whether you
ask me to sit down.</div>
					<a name="080221101000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regardless
of whether the amendments are accepted, the clause refers to not only
the question of whether Departments should issue a licence for gas
storage, but the fact that a licence is subject to the provisions of a
Crown lease that may have been granted or may be granted subsequently.
To take up the comments by the hon. Member for Northavon, there are not
two partners in this enterprise but at least three. That is the extent
to which the licence that is granted by the Secretary of State is
subject to an entirely separate body, over and above any other
considerations pertaining to DBERR, DEFRA and other
Departments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>
					<a name="080221101000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Crown Estate is not a
reactive organisation in the way that is sometimes implied by
references to it; nor, in fact, is it particularly responsible to the
Crown. It was split into two some while ago&#151;I believe in the
1960s&#151;whereby the personal possessions of the Queen went in one
direction and the commercial activities that relate to those things
that were relevant to the Crown went in another direction. The Crown
Estate is now a separate organisation with a board of directors and
managers. It is responsible, apparently&#151;although not accountable
to anybody, as far as I can see, least of all to Parliament&#151;for
the deposits of money that it makes to the Treasury, and it is subject,
in theory, to an intervention notice by the Treasury if its activities
go seriously off the
rails.</div>
					<a name="080221101000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that no intervention notice has ever been issued by the
Treasury to the Crown Estate since it was set up, and it is not clear
whether the intervention notice would be compatible with, for example,
policy on the charge that was decided for a licence. The possibility
more than theoretically exists that, in pursuit of its wish to maximise
the money that it deposits in the Treasury&#146;s coffers, the Crown
Estate could take a view on the issuing of a licence that would be
completely incompatible with the aims of providing a licence, given the
idea that, for national strategic purposes, a licence might be granted
for gas storage. It is also more than theoretically possible that,
under those circumstances, the Crown Estate could simply refuse a
licence or put such conditions on it that totally negated the intent of
the licence that was issued by the
Department.</div>
					<a name="080221101000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
may be regarded as fairly arcane considerations. I accept that members
of the Committee are looking at me as though they were rather arcane.
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
						<span class="SmallCaps">
</span>&#147;No, no.&#148;] Nevertheless, they are important,
because, as far as I can see, the clause contains no leverage
whatsoever that the Department that issues the licence can use on the
next procedure to make the licence real. I may not have understood the
process properly, or it may be that the procedures that have been
followed over so many years give reliability to a process that,
theoretically, is not perfect. Nevertheless, that is how matters stand
as far as the Crown Estate is concerned, and I would value the thoughts
of my hon. Friend the Minister on whether the arrangements that I have
described are sufficient and reliable enough to ensure that the clause
has the effect that I am sure we all want it to
have.</div>

						</b> Before calling the next speaker, I advise
Members that I would not anticipate a separate stand part debate, given

Horwood:
						</b> Thank you, Mrs. Humble. I think that I
will be on that procedural territory.</div>
					<a name="080221101000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is always a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Southampton, Test with whom I often find
myself in agreement. He often points out problems in policy that the
rest of us have not spotted. He has outdone himself on this
one.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>
					<a name="080221101000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue that I want to raise
is one that was mentioned in passing by my hon. Friend a minute ago. It
is about the tension that is reflected in this clause as to whether
this is a natural area of responsibility for DBERR or DEFRA. Do we see
this as principally a business activity and, therefore, naturally in
the domain of DBERR or is it about the disposal of a toxic substance?
That question involves an important principle. Surely, one of the main
purposes of energy policy should be to reduce the production of
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>and not to accept it as a natural part of the energy
process. We ought to be thinking of the disposal of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>as
analogous to landfill.</div>
					<a name="080221101000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The operation of a landfill
site can be a profitable business activity, but it is not something
that we would want to encourage, or see as a long-term growth activity.
Such an operation is clearly the responsibility of DEFRA. If one was a
conspiracy theorist, one might see something slightly suspicious in the
relative timings of this Bill, the Planning Bill and the marine Bill.
The latter Bill had widespread support when it was proposed some years
ago, but it has not yet made it to the House. Now it is being
pre-empted by this Bill in an important respect that is highlighted in
my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. The marine management organisation
may well have some of its anticipated responsibilities removed from it
before it has even been set up, which must be some kind of a
record.</div>
					<a name="080221101000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister could reassure the Committee that such a conspiracy theory is
not well founded and that there has been adequate consultation on the
issue of the responsibilities of the marine management organisation and
that he has had discussions with DEFRA on this. Perhaps, also, he could
tell us what conversations his Bill team in DBERR have had with the
Bill team working on the marine Bill in
DEFRA.</div>

							<b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): This is an important discussion
on a matter of principle. How can we have development while at the same
time protecting the natural environment? How do we balance the two?
These are important amendments, particularly, as the hon. Member for
Northavon has said, with the introduction of long-anticipated
legislation on the marine
environment.</div>
					<a name="080221101000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to
the hon. Member for Cheltenham that I do not think that there is any
conspiracy here at all. He is right to say that there has been a long
gestation period for the marine Bill. It is a difficult issue. Let me
remind him that the Bill appeared in Labour&#146;s last manifesto; it
has not been forgotten. A White Paper was published last March and I
anticipate that the draft Bill will be published in April. We will have
to wait and see what is in the draft Bill. Clearly, it will bring
forward an enhanced series of marine protected areas and, for the first
time, it will introduce the notion of marine spatial strategy. As has
already been said, there is the notion of a marine management
organisation. There needs to be considerable discussion about the
powers of such an organisation and we shall have to wait to see what is
in the draft Bill. Clearly, it is not possible now to table amendments
on a Bill that is not yet in existence, but there is a point of
discussion here.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an extremely important
point with which I agree. I accept that we cannot know the content of
the marine Bill until it is published, but does he expect the marine
spatial strategies that are envisaged to encompass gas storage
agreements of the sort that we are discussing
today?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000226"></a>Paddy
Tipping:
						</b> I am not in the position to answer that question,
because I have not seen the draft Bill. However, having followed such
matters closely for a long time, I know that there have been
substantive discussions between DEFRA and DBERR. My hon. Friend the
Member for South Thanet will remind us that the Department for
Transport has been involved fundamentally in the preparation of this
Bill. It is a difficult issue, but the essential point made in
Committee today is that, whatever the powers under the Bill, they must
link clearly to the future attraction&#151;an attraction that we have
had a trailer about, but we do not yet know what is in the film. I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s response to that point because I
anticipate that the marine Bill may be highlighted in the next
Queen&#146;s Speech, and the Bill now under discussion must be in
sync with larger legislation on the marine
environment.</div>
					<a name="080221101000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish
to pursue briefly the arcane point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Southampton, Test. Those of us who have had dealings with the Crown
Estate know that it is an arcane body; it is unique. My hon. Friend
referred to having leverage on the Crown Estate, but I do not know how
we can have any leverage on it at all. I look forward to hearing what
the Minister says about the role of the Crown Estate. It chooses to
maximise profit and income from the Treasury. It is in a powerful
position. We need assurances that it is on board with the general
policy set out in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221101000227"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I thank you for your guidance on
clause 3, Mrs. Humble. I had my doubts about
certain points, and you have clarified the position for
me.</div>
					<a name="080221101000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to set my
remarks about climate change against the issue of China and India
because carbon storage impacts particularly on that debate. If we go
ahead in Europe alone, the cost throughout the next  20 or 30
years will be enormous to European industry and the only way in which
we can take a proper approach to climate change is to ensure that we
have a global agreement with both China and India. The whole matter of
gas storage impacts on that particular
area.</div>
					<a name="080221101000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides a dual lease and permit system of licensing, which adds
sizeably in the minds of the industry to the bureaucracy of licensing,
regulation and inspection. It is concerned about adding to cost, for
example, at a time when cost is in the early days and very much an
investment that is reliant on income at a later date. A licensing
exercise will be more expensive because of its dual purpose. The lease
part of the process is related to the Crown Estate and, as the hon.
Member for Sherwood said, there is much worry about control and the
ability to understand the machination in that regard.</div>
					<a name="080221101000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later in the Bill,
particularly under clause 12(3), reference is made to the regulatory
and inspection powers. It suggests that they will be lodged with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>another body. That will make the matter of licensing
and regulation particularly difficult for an industry that is in the
relative early stages of development and needs all the help it can
get.</div>
					<a name="080221101000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My real plea is
to ask the Minister whether we can reconsider the whole matter. I know
we cannot do so in this Bill, but there will be later opportunities.
Indeed, we could bring the whole of licensing, inspection and all the
regulatory matters under the control of a central body rather than
splitting it between the two bodies, as suggested by the
Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): I, too, welcome you
to the Chair, Mrs Humble. Could I follow on from the hon. Member for
Northampton, South on the question of licensing in general? Although,
it will crop up in various places in the Bill, it is important to raise
the issue now. At our third sitting I asked Mr. Paul Dymond,
the director of operations of Oil and Gas, about licensing. He
said:</div>
					<a name="080221101000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are a number of parts in the Bill asking to tighten up certain pieces.
Licensing has been going on since 1964, and there are hundreds of
licences. Within each licence, there are tens of part-licences, so the
licensing process today is exceedingly
complex</div>
					<a name="080221101000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I asked him
whether he thought it was more or less complicated, he
replied:</div>
					<a name="080221101000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Because
the process has been going on for so long, companies have commercial
and legal mechanisms to cover this for themselves. What is really
important is that some of the new powers that the Secretary of State
will have as a result of the Energy Bill do not work against, but with
those mechanisms that are there.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official

					<a name="080221101000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not concerned about costs, because I think that these companies can
afford a few bob or two. I will not worry about how much it costs them
to get the licences and how many people they employ. But if there is
one thing that has been a feature of many Bills over the time of this
Government, it is that we try to streamline bureaucracy. I ask the
Minister to take a look at this and see whether we can do that here.
Although we must ensure that security and safety are paramount in
everything we do, if we introduce more hurdles for people to get over,
sometimes the process just becomes too cumbersome. At the end of the
day, the only people who make any money are the
lawyers.</div>

						</b> This has been a useful and well informed debate
and we are all indebted to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test for
the knowledge that he has brought to some of these considerations. We
all agree that this should not simply be a matter of transferring

					<a name="080221101000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to go into the whole CCS debate with our eyes open and understand
the consequences. It is easy at the moment for it to be seen as the
panacea for all our ills that will enable us to go on burning fossil
fuels for all time to come. People have not yet fully understood how it
might work and what the consequences might be. But I should be
interested if the Minister could take this debate a little further and
look at the legal responsibilities of where liability lies in these
matters, particularly in relation to things like statutory
nuisance.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>
					<a name="080221101000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite possible that if
one of these installations was put in place, it would be deemed to be a
statutory nuisance to fishermen or to shipping lanes. Who then has
responsibility? Clearly there is the operator, who is in charge and who
owns the installation, but he has a lease from the Crown Estate. So
does the Crown Estate also have some of the legal duties for statutory
nuisance? But it is operating under licences partly from DBERR and
partly from DEFRA, so do they have any legal responsibility for
statutory nuisance in these
areas?</div>
					<a name="080221101000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need some
clarity here and not just in relation to such activities, but in
relation to a whole load of others too. Offshore turbines are in a
different part of the Bill, but the same issue will apply if they have
a licence from the Crown Estate and it is deemed that they are making a
statutory nuisance by obstructing other people&#146;s legitimate
right to go about their business. Who will be responsible for
that?</div>
					<a name="080221101000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a couple
more general questions, which I should be grateful if the Minister
could answer. Who will be responsible for assessing the geological
safety of the proposed storage area? Will it be officials from his own
Department, the inspectors who are referred to in a subsequent clause
and who will carry out subsequent assessments? We all know that the
terrain of the Earth changes gradually over time in certain areas, so
who will be responsible for making sure that, in decades to come, they
are still satisfied about the geological safety of the areas that are
being proposed for these
activities?</div>

Owen:
						</b> I want to bring a Welsh dimension to this issue. We
heard in the discussions on the amendments talk about environment
groups and agencies but, in Wales, the statutory consultee is the Welsh
Assembly Government. I know from my experience&#151;and my
constituency is surrounded by sea so the issue affects me
considerably&#151;that with some applications in the past, we had the
old Department of Trade and Industry giving licences, using the Welsh
Assembly Government as a consultee. However, they had certain
responsibilities themselves and there was often duplication and delay
because both bodies were
involved.</div>
					<a name="080221101000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now we have
the move to liquefied natural gas, and I prompt the Minister on this
point because there is a proposal in my constituency, or off my
constituency, for the unloading of LNG. I want to know whether the
Welsh Assembly Government have responsibility for that because of the
short distances involved. The planning authorities are responsible for
what happens ashore, the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform is responsible for what happens off the territorial
waters, but who is responsible for what takes place a short distance
offshore and not on land, but not outside territorial waters? Do the
Welsh Assembly Government have responsibility for this? Would he deal
with that question in his winding
up?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> This has been a useful discussion, including the
question of who is responsible for longer-term geological monitoring,
and I hope to have an answer to that before too long.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>
					<a name="080221101000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me just set the scene on
this clause by saying that clause 3 empowers the Secretary of State to
grant licences for the purposes of offshore gas storage or unloading
and related activities. The licences will contain a number of terms and
conditions, details of which will be decided following consultation.
Perhaps we can leave the details of such terms and conditions until we
move on to clause
5.</div>
					<a name="080221101000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because the
exclusive rights to exploit the sea, the sea bed or spaces under the
sea bed for these purposes will be vested in the Crown under clause 1,
an operator will in addition have to obtain lease or authorisation from
the Crown Estate. Subsection (2) therefore makes provision for the
geographical co-ordinates covered by the gas storage licence to be
linked to those covered by the lease or authorisation from the Crown
Estate. This is a sensible arrangement as both are required before any
activity can take place and it will reduce bureaucracy for both the
licensing authority, in this case the Secretary of State, and the
operator.</div>
					<a name="080221101000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hope to
convince the mover of the amendment that it is unnecessary, but that is
for him to judge. However, it is a useful and important amendment and
has led to an important discussion. The hon. Member for Northavon has
raised the important point of the interaction of environmental
regulators when granting licences for offshore gas storage and carbon
dioxide storage activities. There is also the important theme of the
advent of marine spatial planning and the marine Bill, to which I will
return, although hon. Members will understand that until we have a
marine Act, some of the specifics cannot be
decided.</div>
					<a name="080221101000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
this amendment, hon. Members are seeking to introduce a requirement
that before issuing offshore gas unloading and storage or carbon
dioxide storage licences, the Secretary of State shall consult with
relevant environmental bodies, particularly in relation to marine
plans, when granting the licences. One key aspect of the provisions in
the Bill is the protection of the environment. We have therefore
ensured the regulatory framework for offshore gas unloading and storage
and carbon dioxide storage builds on existing environmental
legislation. There already exists a tried-and-tested environmental
regime for the oil and gas industries in the North sea and this is set
out in a number of pieces of legislation. I assure hon. Members that it
is because we take these issues so seriously that we will also provide
for legislation to cover offshore gas unloading and storage and carbon
dioxide storage activities. That will ensure that proposals for
installations of that type are subject to appropriate controls to
protect the environment. Where necessary, environmental approvals
granted in respect of a project would also contain conditions to
protect the environment. We will extend the requirements of EU
environmental laws to the offshore gas unloading and storage, and
carbon dioxide storage, regimes.</div>
					<a name="080221101000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relevant
environmental protection laws provide for and, indeed, require
consultation with the relevant environmental bodies, such as
Departments and their agencies that have a particular responsibility
for the environment. The hon. Member for Northavon may find it helpful
if I explain some of the environmental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>protections that will be in place once the regime is implemented. Those
obviously cannot be specified in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="080221101000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, under
legislation implementing the environmental impact assessment directive,
certain aspects of any offshore gas unloading and storage of CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>will require an environmental impact statement. I hope that that
reassures the hon. Gentleman in that respect. The environmental impact
assessment will be undertaken by the potential developer and assessed
by the Secretary of State or, in the case of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage,
the relevant licensing authority. The assessment will determine the
extent of any potential impact of the proposal on the environment, and,
where necessary, will propose options for minimising such impacts. By
virtue of the public participation directive, the public will be able
to participate in and be consulted on any proposal.</div>
					<a name="080221101000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where necessary, an
appropriate assessment will also be undertaken under the habitats
directive. That will determine whether the proposals would have any
adverse effect on the integrity of Natura 2000 sites. I do not think
that there are any of those in my constituency, but I am sure that
Opposition Members have them in their constituencies.</div>
					<a name="080221101000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak briefly to the
specific point about marine plans. As hon. Members will know, the
concept of marine spatial planning is one that the Government are
considering in the context of the draft marine Bill that we expect to
publish later this year&#151;as it says here, more cautiously than my
hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet: I shall give him more lines to
take in  the future.</div>
					<a name="080221101000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect that once the marine
management organisation is established, the Secretary of State will
work closely with the organisation in considering the potential for
offshore gas unloading and storage and carbon dioxide storage projects
in UK waters. That will replicate the existing relationship between the
Secretary of State and the Marine Fisheries Agency in the context of
existing oil and gas licensing rounds. There is already a good deal of
experience of the need for such consultation and
collaboration.</div>
					<a name="080221101000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the commendable intention of the amendment, but I consider
that because of the existing environmental protections that I have just
outlined, it is unnecessary. In my view, the relevant matters should be
dealt with under existing environmental laws; they can and will be
amended as appropriate.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> Perhaps I should just briefly share some of the
thought processes behind the drafting of the amendment, which refers to
environmental organisations in general. Of course, the reason it had to
do so was that the maritime management organisation does not yet exist.
It was the maritime spatial aspect of the matter that particularly
concerned us.</div>
					<a name="080221101000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has given a reassuring indication of the direction of policy, but
surely the Government are the Government and they must know whether the
maritime management organisation will be a statutory part of the
process in due course. If the Bills had been presented to Parliament
the other way round, that matter would have been sorted out. Surely the
mere timing of the Bills does not mean that the Government do not know
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>answer to that question. Will the Minister give an absolute assurance
that the organisation will be part of the statutory
process?</div>

							<a name="080221101000233"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> For reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for
South Thanet outlined, one cannot be as specific as the hon. Gentleman
wishes, because the question of what the marine Act will look like at
the end of the day is subject to the will of Parliament. The hon.
Gentleman surely understands that discussions are already going on, and
will continue, about the precise and important arrangements that need
to be made.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>
					<a name="080221101000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, in relation to
offshore oil and gas, agreement has been reached with the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that that is a reserved matter,
and that therefore the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform should be the licensing authority. Perhaps I did not
say that earlier, but it shows that we are already discussing in my
Department the interaction of oil and gas with marine spatial
planning.</div>
