da, Mr Williams. For the sake of posterity, I record for <em>Hansard</em>
that it is a beautiful sunny morning and, as ever, we are all slaving
away indoors on the Bill. We have reached clause 20, on the requirement
for schools to participate in international

is a probing amendment about the Minister’s intentions on
academies. The clause will give new powers to direct community,
voluntary or foundation schools to participate in international
surveys, and we will have the opportunity to talk about that proposal
at length when we discuss the next amendment. But we seek absolute
clarity on the Government’s intentions, given that the clause
makes no reference to academies. For any survey to have the chance to
give an accurate picture of educational performance in the country, a
representative sample of academies must participate. I would be
grateful if the Minister explained why he has not included academies in
the clause, and how he will compel them to
participate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000021">&#160;</a>

                           </div>of the funding agreement between the Department for Education and
individual academies. The principle is to ensure that academies are
bound by minimal amounts of legislation, and that the contractual
funding agreements with academies are used where necessary. As it
stands, the clause supports that principle, while it allows us to
secure academy participation via the funding
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Unfortunately, they have to be academies that have
such a requirement in their funding agreement. The hon. Gentleman hints
at the fact that academies created under the previous Administration
will not have that provision in their funding agreement. If he looks at
the participation of academies in 2009, he will find a high rate of
participation: of the nine academies drawn in the sample, eight
participated. One did not, which is not good. However, although the
proportion of community, voluntary and foundation schools that
participated is slightly lower, the numbers are alarming in absolute
terms: of the 168 drawn in the sample, only 146 participated in the
scheme, which means that a large number of maintained schools did not
participate. Although the proportions between participation rates for
academies and for foundation, voluntary and community schools are
broadly similar, the fact that all new academies will have such a
requirement in the funding agreement will tackle that small problem
with academies. The main issue we have to address in the clause is with
maintained

it is small—with the Government’s approach. They want to
capture all schools, including academies, but they are not able to do
so, because they are not legislating to require all academies to
participate. They are therefore accepting that that can be achieved
only through the funding agreement, but existing academies will not
have that requirement in their funding agreement and therefore will not
have to participate. I do not want to prolong the discussion, but it
would be sensible for the Minister to try to seek a solution if he
wants all schools to participate in surveys. If it is so important, it
should be all schools and it should be funded by the state. It should
not be some schools. Even if it is a small number—a
minority—a significant part of the state sector would not be
participating.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000027">&#160;</a>

I do not know what team the hon. Gentleman supports—I do not
think that Bedford has a team in the Premier League. Times have changed
since 1997, when not one Conservative represented a constituency with a
football league club in it, but we have moved on from those halcyon
days. If the Premier League in England, Serie A in Italy and the
Bundesliga in Germany were combined, and instead of finishing in the
top 10 of the premiership in one year, the very next year we finished
lower down the table of the three championships combined, that does not
suggest that the quality of our play had declined. It simply means that
more teams are playing in the league, so it is utterly irrelevant. He
can win his gold medal in the Commonwealth Games, but if he does not
win at the Olympics, it does not mean he is any worse an

relative standards that fell. The whole point of having standings is to
be able to compare with elsewhere. When we drop down to 24th on the
PISA table—which was set up to give a picture of where we sit
internationally—we should take that seriously. I cannot believe
that the hon. Gentleman, who is committed to trying to make a
difference to our children’s education, not least in a

to illustrate why the hon. Gentleman, despite his distinguished
chairmanship of the Education Committee, is himself not giving the full
picture in his intervention. In addition, the OECD, which is
responsible for compiling the statistics, has said that comparing the
UK’s results between 2000 and 2009 is not statistically valid.
The OECD has said that—not me. With this clause, the Minister
may be trying to overcome the problems with sampling in 2000. There was
not a statistically valid sample from this country in 2000. The
Secretary of State chose not to mention that in his comments on Second
Reading, although perhaps I am being unfair to the Secretary of State,
as the Chair of the Education Committee has said. If PISA is the only
credible international evidence available to us, the Secretary of State
had nothing else to call upon in making his arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously,
being the Secretary of State, and wishing to give full picture, he
would quote all the international evidence from all credible surveys in
his comments on Second Reading. From that, we might presume that PISA
is the only international evidence that is available. Except, of
course, that is not true. As we know, from a snippet towards the end of
the Secretary of State’s speech, there is another significant
international study, which he made a quick passing reference to and
then moved on, conveniently choosing to ignore its findings.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The other
major international testing study, which was not cited, presents an
entirely different picture for England than the PISA study. The Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study, which is better known
as the TIMS study and which has been going longer than PISA, last
reported in 2007. It showed that between

State’s officials are listening, because they should read it
too—England’s primary school maths performance improved
by a greater margin than any of the other 15 nations that
had pupils taking tests in those years, including Singapore, Japan, the
Netherlands, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Norway. Our
score went from below the international average in 1995 to comfortably
above it in 2007. Our ranking improved from 12th out of 16 countries in
1995 to seventh out of 36 countries in 2007. To use the earlier
analogy, if we had combined the premiership, Serie A and the
Bundesliga, instead of finishing in the bottom 20 in the smaller
premiership, our team would have rocketed up the tables in the much
larger international table during that period. I should have thought
that the manager of that team would have wanted to brag about such a
startling
improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000042">&#160;</a>

board what the Chair of the Select Committee has said about my not
having the full list of countries in the tests. Nevertheless, in the
2007 science tests, in primary, English pupils finished ahead of
countries including the United States, Germany, Australia, and Sweden.
We do not hear much about Sweden from the Secretary of State since it
has dropped down the PISA tables after introducing free schools. In
secondary, English pupils we were ahead of those countries plus Russia,
Hong Kong and Norway. Why did the Secretary of State say, on Second
Reading, that the PISA statistics were ungainsayable? I remind the hon.

Reading, towards the end of his remarks, the Secretary of State said
that he could not find anything to celebrate in children’s
achievements in our schools. Perhaps he did not want to find anything
to celebrate; why else would he have ignored the findings of one of the
studies that he is now legislating, in the clause, to compel our
schools to participate in? In those remarks, in every other speech he
has made, including to the world education forum earlier this year, and
in the articles he has written on the subject he has chosen to
completely ignore the evidence. That one-eyed selection of
international evidence even formed the basis for the
Government’s impact assessment for the

not fit with the political picture that they are trying to paint about
their education reforms shows that the Secretary of State cannot be

understand, politically, why he wishes to do so. None the less, PISA is
the preeminent international record. Any comparison tables will have
some challenges, especially given the different nature of curricula in
different countries, and if other countries join the assessment,
statistically we are not comparing like with like. Nevertheless, PISA
is the preeminent measure, and it suggests a worrying lack of progress
by this country. Will the shadow Minister at least accept

the Government are legislating for TIMSS as well as for PISA. PISA is,
nevertheless, an important study. We know that if we put too heavy a
weight on some of the measures, we ignore some important statistical
facts—the hon. Member for North Cornwall made a point about
that. Ofqual is doing work on that issue at the moment, and it cited
the King’s college study in its recent report. Ofqual wrote to
the TES last week, saying that King’s college had made those
statements, but it did not deny what the college was
saying.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000059">&#160;</a>

here who is of the Catholic persuasion—I know that one or two
Members are—will understand the concept of cardinal sins;
unfortunately the Secretary of State does not understand the concept of
cardinal and ordinal numbers, despite his desire to talk about tables.
The point is not where we rank in the tables but what our performance
is, and, as statisticians and people involved in comparisons will tell
us, as will Ofqual when it reports, often the difference in movement in
the tables is statistically much smaller than the ranking shifts
suggest. A mature debate about that would reflect the fact that it is
ironic that we are talking about testing in maths when people do not
know the difference between an ordinal number and a cardinal
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000060">&#160;</a>

would certainly affect statistics on vocational education. Given that
he is my predecessor in respect of the management of work and skills,
perhaps he could say a word about the Lord Leitch report, which the
previous Government commissioned, and what that said about our
comparative performance on skills and what our schools do to feed those
skills?<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000065">&#160;</a>

pecker up in terms of the pecking order in Committee. Of course, the
Leitch report was an indictment of many years of failure to provide
basic skills to people, particularly in literacy and numeracy. A vast
remedial programme was put in place to try to improve that. There was
some success—although more so in literacy than numeracy. That is
a more difficult nut to crack because it is sometimes almost
unfashionable—sorry, that is the wrong phrase. It is perhaps not
acceptable socially for someone to admit that they cannot read, which
creates particular problems in dealing with adult literacy. However,
sometimes people happily say, “I’m no good at
maths” and accept that that is the way it has to be, which is
not the case. That is a serious point. My amendment would not do what
the hon. Gentleman is saying; it would simply create a bit of a health

Serie A, the Bundesliga and so on. I did some research about which
countries have been added. Which of the following countries would
appear, as he would say, in the Bundesliga or the premiership?

example, Azerbaijan was added. Is that important? The Kazakh Republic
was added. Is that a country we ought to be falling down behind? Other
countries are Serbia, Moldova, the Kyrgyz Republic, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates. There are other countries if hon. Members wish to

That makes absolutely no difference to my argument. If we delve more
deeply, we might find other examples. As I pointed out, in the TIMSS
tables we are rising above a lot of countries that the Secretary of
State sometimes quotes as being higher than us in other
tables.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000070">&#160;</a>

that the PISA tables and the TIMSS tables use their own methodologies.
As I mentioned, the TIMSS tables use more traditional methodologies,
which the Secretary of State favours elsewhere. This country does well
in respect of TIMSS. I am afraid it was the Secretary of State who did
not give the full picture. I have accepted that PISA is an important
international comparator. We will hear in a moment whether the Minister
accepts that TIMSS is. If he does not, he should say in the clause that
TIMSS is not statistically valid and therefore he will not compel our
schools to participate in it. If he thinks it is rubbish, he should not
be compelling our schools to participate in wasting their

                           </strong> This has been an interesting and entertaining
debate, but it would be more illuminating to look at the facts and
figures. First of all, the hon. Member for Cardiff West is confusing
problems relating to the PISA surveys. He is confusing the 2000 survey
with the 2003 survey, which we have not cited. In PISA 2000, England
failed to reach minimum school participation rates, but because the
pupil participation rate was met the OECD 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 613<a class="bkMark" name="Column613">&#160;</a>
                           </div>included data for England as part of the UK’s results in its PISA
2000 report. However it was in PISA 2003, which the Secretary of State
has never cited, that the OECD excluded results for the UK in its
international report, because in England neither the required school
participation rates nor the required pupil participation rates were
met. That is where the problem was, rather than with the 2000
figures.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting to note that Ministers at the time were very keen to
cite the PISA 2000 survey results. I remember Schools Ministers and the
then Secretary of State citing them and I will go on to quote the
permanent secretary at the time, who was also keen to cite
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In response
to those issues, the previous Government commissioned the Southampton
Statistical Sciences Research Institute at the university of
Southampton to investigate the school and pupil samples for England, in
order to look more closely into possible bias in both the 2000 and 2003
samples for PISA. The institute’s subsequent report concluded
that the impact of possible bias on the position of England and the UK
in any ranking of OECD countries was very slight and estimated that it
would only have shifted England’s position by about one place in
2000.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000093">&#160;</a>

eighth in maths. Only Finland and Canada are consistently ahead of the
UK – and major countries like Germany, Italy and Spain are well

dropped from third to 16th between 2001 and 2006. When the PISA survey,
the PIRLS survey and the trends in international mathematics and

there is a problem with us internationally. If we look at the 2009 PISA

Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan are all above us in the maths survey for
14-year-olds, as indeed is Hungary, which was sixth. Indeed, those
first five countries are not just above us; they are significantly
above us and there is a gap between them and Hungary in sixth place.
England is in seventh place. Taiwan scored 598, Korea scored 597 and
Singapore scored 593. We then come down to Hungary, which scored 517,
and England, which scored 513. That is the problem. In China, which is
represented by Shanghai in the PISA 2009 survey, 15-year-olds are two
years ahead of 15-year-olds in this country in maths. That is the
problem that we are trying to confront.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000098">&#160;</a>

chosen from China to illustrate the point, does he not accept that it
gives a very skewed picture of the reality of the level of attainment
in China? I do not dispute that we should not do all we can to improve
our performance overall. I am just asking the Minister to tell the

Gentleman did not cite PIRLS in his speech. Of course, one wants to
present the case as well as one can, but looking at TIMSS properly and
forensically, the same problems that the Secretary of State referred to
on Second Reading are revealed there too. On the figures for children
at age 14, between major competitor countries such as Japan, Hong Kong,
Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, and the countries below them. The hon.
Gentleman asked me to cite countries that were below England. They
include the Russian Federation, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Armenia,
Scotland, which came 17th in that survey, Serbia, Italy and Malaysia.
Clearly, there are a lot of countries below us in the TIMSS survey, but
our concern is the gap. Even the most favourable survey that he wishes
to cite reveals severe problems in the gap between this country and our
major
competitors.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000100">&#160;</a>

Finland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands and
Macau, China with 525. Here are the problems. We have not yet reached

teachers and children to do better. What children achieve at 14
reflects at least nine years of compulsory schooling, and possibly
education before that. All we are asking is that the Minister ensures

serious concern, and we have to start to look at what is in the

should take a balanced look at all the surveys. I find
things to worry about in the TIMSS survey, and I worry about the
absolute figures. The hon. Gentleman’s quote stated that the
absolute figures did not differ that much. In the TIMSS survey they do
not differ much in England, where there is a clustering around the
figure 513. However, there is an enormous gap between the first five in
that survey, and the next batch down that includes Hungary, England,
Russia, the USA, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. That goes from
Hungary’s score of 517 to between 570 and 598 for the top five
countries. That concern is reflected again in the PISA survey, where
Shanghai, China, has a mean score of 600, compared with
England’s mean score of 493. That constitutes two years of study
and achievement, and we are trying to address that concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000110">&#160;</a>

been talked about in context, although all politicians tend to be a
little selective in their arguments. The real context of our education
performance is the massive increase in expenditure in our education
system that took place over the first decade of the 21st century, and
the fact that the gap between rich and poor has widened. I know that
the whole House and all members of the Committee are committed to
creating a fairer society in which opportunity and outcome are not
determined by where a person is born. This debate is in the context of
the widening gap between rich and poor, and massive investment, but yet
there is stagnation. It is right for Ministers in the new Government to
implement reforms, and to feel a certain level of indignation at our
failure to do more until now.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000113">&#160;</a>

highlighted by the PISA survey included the wide gap between the top
and bottom in our education system, the growing tale of
underachievement and the huge gap in equality in our system. We come
55th out of 57 countries in terms of equality of system, and we have
the biggest attainment gap between the maintained sector and the
independent sector of most OECD countries. When those issues are taken
together, the international surveys reveal a problem that urgently
needs to be addressed. That is what the Secretary of State is seeking
to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000114">&#160;</a>

The UK Statistics Authority’s main function is to provide
international scrutiny of all UK statistics. It already has the power
to monitor and comment on any statistics produced by the Secretary of
State, but it is not within the remit of the authority to approve

indicators, and areas of improvement are fed back to data suppliers to
enhance the quality of future collections. Specialist statisticians

While the Minister has assured us that the use by the Secretary of

sound, has anybody sought to address the issue of who will decide the

are requested by the organisations that compile these—the OECD
in the case of PISA, for example—and until now it has not been a
compulsion for them, so they decide the sample and are responsible for
ensuring that it is statistically valid. The clause simply means
that they cannot turn down participation in a survey. In
that sense I do not necessarily share his concerns, but even though he
is a member of another party, we should have involved him in helping us
to draft our amendment; it might have been more effective had we used
the term “office for statistical responsibility”. That

                           </strong> I say “Hear, hear” as well to the
innate talent of the children in this country. What the Secretary of
State did not do was celebrate their achievements. He seemed to suggest
that with all this innate talent, none of them was achieving anything,
because he failed to quote the TIMS survey. He was trying to say that
because we are 28th in the PISA table for maths there would never be
any Microsofts, Googles or Facebooks in this country. But the USA did
worse than us in the PISA table so that does not work logically. The
Secretary of State cannot get away with it. Given the Minister’s
remarks and the desire to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw

grateful to you, Mr Williams, for the opportunity to say a little more
about the clause. If the Government had not put it in the heart of the
Bill we probably would not be debating the importance of these
international standards, whichever ones we use. Clearly there needs to
be close statistical analysis of all these things but the important
thing is that we also reflect our real success in this country with
inclusive education. We try to ensure that we bring forward all
children and develop the talents of all children, whereas in some other
countries they focus on certain pupils and push them forward. I accept
that we need to look at these measures but we should ensure that when
we evaluate all these things our successes with inclusion are
reflected.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000135">&#160;</a>

to this clause stand part debate. One of the overriding objectives of
our education policy is to close the attainment gap between those from
wealthier backgrounds and those from poorer backgrounds. That drives
everything we are doing in education, whether it is the English bac or
the pupil premium where we are increasing the funding for schools for
children from poorer families—£430 per pupil this year,
rising to £2.5 billion by 2014. This is a significant
contribution to closing that attainment gap. We are also introducing
measures in league tables that will evaluate the performance of schools
in helping children from challenging backgrounds or with special needs.
All these issues are vital and an important Government
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000142">&#160;</a>

already include, for the first time, a progress measure. That measure
is not simply the raw attainment of 35% achieving five or more GCSEs A*

of progress as well, and that is the right approach to assessing the

Amendment 107 seeks to check that the appointment of the chief
regulator will still continue to be subject to the scrutiny of the
Select Committee as it is today. It is not clear, as currently set out
in the Bill, whether that will be the case. It would therefore be
useful if the Minister could put that on the record for the avoidance
of
doubt.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000155">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I may not have been able to follow the legislative
language, but it seems to me that amendment 107 relates to the chair.
Of course, the role of chief regulator in Ofqual is moving from the
chair to the chief executive. We could debate whether both posts should
be subject to hearings of the Select Committee, but the chief regulator
would certainly seem to be the key post. If the role moves from chair
to chief executive, surely it is the chief executive who the Select
Committee should confirm.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000156">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for
clarifying that. The hon. Gentleman is, of course, correct to say that
the chief regulator’s role is moving from the chair of Ofqual to
the chief executive, and I share his view that both appointments should
be subject to pre-appointment hearings with the Select Committee. To
reiterate, it would be useful to get the Minister’s thinking
about that on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000157">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just to clarify, I am certain that the chief
regulator should be subject to hearings with the Select Committee,
possibly strengthened to confirmation. As to whether the chair should
also be subject to that, I think that the number of posts subject to
Select Committee hearings should be kept to the bare
minimum.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000158">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps this is where we slightly disagree. I
think that we will come to this issue when we discuss amendment 110,
but it would be useful to hear the Minister’s thoughts about the
reasoning behind the role of the chief regulator being moved from the
position of chair to chief executive. I am not entirely certain why
that is the case. I do not want to pre-empt the discussion that we will
have on amendment 110, but I am not entirely certain what the changes
would add to how to help to maintain standards, enhance perception that
standards have been maintained, which is an important point, and help
the governance of Ofqual. I hope, with your permission Mr Williams,
that we can discuss that later on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 108
seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State can sack the chair of
Ofqual only following consultation with the Education Committee. I
understand from reading reports of the Committee stage of the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 that there was
a great deal of debate about the governance of Ofqual, and whether its
chair could be removed if he or she was unfit for office. I was not a
member of the Committee, but the Minister of State was, so he has the
slight advantage of having rehearsed these arguments. We are concerned
that giving the Secretary of State the ability to sack the chair of
Ofqual could provide the Government with too much power, allowing it
undue influence over Ofqual. The Bill provides temptations for the
Government to distort the system to suit political ends, and this
probing amendment would help to clarify the Government’s
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The ASCL has
told us that it is crucial that Ofqual retains its strength and
independence from the Government. It stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000161">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>I
ask the Minister to set out the rationale behind the decision to allow
the Secretary of State that power. The Bill does not define clearly
enough the grounds on which the Secretary of State can sack the chair
of Ofqual. New paragraph 3A(5) of schedule 9 to the 2009 Act, contained
in schedule 6 to the Bill, states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000162">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I noted in interventions, transferring the role
of chief regulator from the chair to the chief executive is important.
It is essential for Ofqual to be clear that it reports to Parliament
through the Select Committee. That process of accountability will help
to bolster the independence of Ofqual, and will reassure the public
that the role of Ministers in determining how Ofqual behaves is
mediated by Parliament. That is an important principle.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Select
Committee has not discussed whether it wishes to have confirmation
hearings with the chair of Ofqual, which is the current situation, and
with the chief executive. However, the Secretary of State has written
to me saying that he is happy for the Select Committee to hold hearings
for both. That is welcome, and the manner in which the offer was made
was well received, but the Committee has not yet decided whether it
wishes to cover both posts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I mention in
passing that although the Select Committee can hold a hearing with the
candidate that the Secretary of State of wishes to appoint, it does
necessarily have to do so. My view—it is a personal view, and
not necessarily that of the Committee—is that we should focus
only on the key appointments. If we had to deal with too many
appointments and decided not to hold hearings for them all, the
perception among the public might be that we were failing in our duty
properly to scrutinise appointments. That, however, is for future
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Like the
shadow Minister, I am interested to probe the Minister’s
thoughts on why this transfer is taking place. Perhaps he will give us
a little more idea of how he sees the role of the chair of Ofqual,
especially in relation to the chief regulator, and of how that
relationship will work. Perhaps he will spell out the role of the chair
and the board in removing the chief regulator. Perhaps he can also tell
us the Government’s view on the ongoing issue of whether they
are prepared to allow the key departmental Select Committee to have a
right of veto over certain key posts, although, as I say, I would not
want too many to be covered. The Treasury and the Chancellor have
conceded that in the case of the Monetary Policy Committee, and I see
no reason in principle why it should not occur with other key posts.
That would further cement Parliament’s ability to scrutinise the
Government and ensure that it played a role in relation to what are
supposed to be independent bodies. I look forward to the
Minister’s response.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000167">&#160;</a>

need an individual who can lead the board of an assertive and effective
regulator. That is why appointments to the position are made entirely
on merit, with independent scrutiny of the process by the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are also strong believers in the benefits of the
pre-appointment hearing system, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness mentioned, which is another key safeguard of
Ofqual’s independence. That is why we have specifically asked
that, in future, the Select Committee scrutinise appointments not only
to the position of chair, as it does now, but to the new combined post
of chief executive and chief regulator. We will, therefore, increase
the number of Ofqual appointments, subject to scrutiny and the Select
Committee’s
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
commitment to pre-appointment scrutiny is reflected in our proposals
for the appointment of the first chief executive/chief regulator.
Glenys Stacey has already been appointed as Ofqual’s chief
executive. Members will understand that, under the existing
legislation, that is a civil service post and is, therefore, not
eligible for pre-appointment scrutiny. Even though it is our intention,
other things being equal, that Glenys Stacey will transfer and become
the new chief regulator, we have offered the Select Committee an
opportunity to scrutinise that transition, and my hon. Friend referred
to the letter from the Secretary of State. That offer has been taken
up, and by ensuring that the chair and the chief executive are subject
to pre-appointment scrutiny, we will increase the democratic
accountability of appointments to Ofqual. That will, I hope, provide
assurance that there will be ample opportunity for Select Committee
involvement in such
appointments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would, however, go further and introduce a requirement for
the Select Committee to confirm appointments to the position of chair,
effectively giving the Committee a veto over the appointment process.
That would muddy the waters over accountability. Ultimately,
responsibility for making appointments must remain with Ministers. That
ensures that Ministers are personally answerable and accountable to
Parliament and the public for the men and women they appoint. The
Cabinet Office and the Liaison Committee are currently looking at
pre-appointment scrutiny across Government, and we must pre-empt the
outcome of that review. However, we have no plans to introduce a Select
Committee veto on
appointments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000172">&#160;</a>

cross-Government scrutiny. Ultimately, Ministers are accountable for
education standards, and it is important that they have the ability to
appoint people. Of course, the Select Committee will make its views
clear. Under the previous Administration, the Children’s
Commissioner was appointed despite the Select Committee’s views,
and that decision was taken by a Minister. In some circumstances, such
decisions are, as Sir Humphrey would say, very brave, but Ministers are
ultimately accountable to Parliament, and they must take such
decisions. With regard to the MPC, we are talking about an exceptional
arrangement. It is a reflection of

believe that the amendment would make things worse by calling into
question Ministers’ accountability for the removal of the chair
in the limited circumstances in which it is appropriate to do so.
Removal of a chair is not an option that any Secretary of State would
take lightly, but as with appointments, it is important that ultimate
responsibility for removal of chairs remains with Ministers so that
they are personally answerable and accountable for their decisions. Our
provisions would ensure that without interfering with the current
appropriately high bar for removal.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000178">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister said on the issue of veto—I do
not agree with him—that it is important that Ministers have the
right to drive decisions through. None the less, hearings are held.
Amendment 108 mentions consultation with the Select Committee. In no
way would it bar the Secretary of State from carrying out his duties
under schedule 9, and the Minister overstates his case to say so. He
might not wish to concede this, but the amendment would not inhibit the
Secretary of State’s ability to take decisions and be held
accountable for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000179">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, we can always agree to differ on the matter.
The Secretary of State will want to consult. I would not rule out his
wanting to consult my hon. Friend, as he and I do on all kinds of
issue. Clause 107 discusses confirmation of veto, and my hon. Friend is
right that consultation is involved. Even so, I ask the

                           </div>Committee to resist amendment 108. The grounds for dismissal are
sufficiently specific, sensitive and restrictive—inability or
unfitness to carry out the duties of the office is not a political or
party issue—that they provide a sufficiently high bar for
leaving the decision to the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I tempt the Minister to speculate on the
circumstances in which the Secretary of State would exercise the power?
Also, before I sit down, I reiterate the point made by the Chairman of
the Select Committee. Amendment 108 was carefully worded not to provide
a power of veto but to ensure some degree of consultation between the
Secretary of State and the Select Committee if there was a question of
incompetence or unfitness for
office.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000181">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will not be tempted down that avenue. Ministers in
the previous Administration succumbed to that temptation when they
introduced schedule 9 to the ASCL Act 2009. The wording of the
provision is sufficiently clear that the chair must be absent from
Ofqual’s meetings for a continuous period of more than six
months. That is clear and specific, and we need not speculate why a
chair might be absent for so long.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not want to play tag with the Minister, but
if he does not want to speculate on the precise circumstances, will he
at least explain what unfitness means? Is this a mental health related
matter, or could a strongly ideological Secretary of State arrive and
decide that this person is so differing in view to themselves that they
are simply unfit for office? I have felt that many holders of public
office were unfit for office but it was not because they had a mental
health problem or any other problem, it was because I did not agree
with them on many
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000183">&#160;</a>

Friend and copy in other members of the Committee so that we can define
this term precisely. So far as this debate is concerned, the wording of
the paragraph is clear, especially in relation to absence from meetings
for six months. On subparagraph (5)(a), I will certainly write to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The schedule is one of the few provisions that has
both a direct and indirect effect on Northern Ireland. I certainly
resisted the temptation to table any amendments that referred to a
consultation with Assembly Ministers or Assembly Committees. Does the
Minister not accept that the amendment which provides for consultation
with the House of Commons Select Committee, which has a UK
representative responsibility in the way in which it operates, gives
assurance to devolved interests that if there are issues of concern,
they can be ventilated and duly considered at an appropriate level via
the Select Committee? In the past, we have found that communication
between Assembly Committees and House of Commons Select Committees has
ventilated issues that do not normally get dealt with through
ministerial engagement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000185">&#160;</a>

comments. If he feels that the current group of Ministers are not doing
that, I hope that he will come to see us and put that right. The issue
is about dismissal. Amendment 108 is about the removal of the Chair of
Ofqual. Given the clear wording of the schedule, which will be
clarified further by the letter that I intend to send to my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness, those issues do not require
vast consultation. It is a sensitive matter to do with the removal of
somebody from an office because of inability or unfitness to carry out
that office, or because of absence for six months. Such a matter goes
beyond policy and should not be subject to those levels of
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000186">&#160;</a>

to write to the Chairman of the Select Committee and the rest of our
Committee is very helpful. On the deliberations at Committee stage of
the ASCL Act 2009, considerable time was spent on working
out—I accept that this wording has been transferred directly
from the Act—what inability or unfitness to carry out the duties
of the office means.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000188">&#160;</a>

am now in Opposition, I share the view of the Chairman of the Select
Committee—it is amazing how one changes when the shoe is on the
other foot—that the wording seems to imply that it is about some
sort of medical complaint. Certainly absence of more than six months
would seem to indicate that as well. None the less, the
Minister’s offer to write is very helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In respect of
the broader point regarding this group of amendments, it was news to me
that the Cabinet Office are considering reviewing the whole possibility
of pre-appointment hearings. I hope that the Minister can provide some
reassurance on that. He went so far in his comments, but I hope that he
will go slightly further and say that he would resist any suggestions
or recommendations that could spring from the Cabinet Office that would
restrict heavily the idea that the Ofqual chair and the chief executive
are subject to any pre-appointment
hearings.<a class="bkMark" name="11032464000190">&#160;</a>
