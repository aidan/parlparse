</UL></FONT>

<P>
New clause 3-Procedure on decision making by local authority executives-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) This section makes provision in relation to the way in which, under executive arrangements, a local authority executive which takes the form specified in sections 11(2), 11(3) or 11(4) is to be responsible for the executive functions.

<P>
(2) The proceedings, decisions, reports and documents of the executive shall be subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985.

<P>
(3) No function may be discharged by any person or body unless an officer appointed by the Head of the Paid Service of the local authority is present to record the decision taken, the reasons for it, the identity of all persons present during the taking of the decision, the written advice of any officer, a summary of any oral advice tendered by an officer present, and the background papers relating to the decision.

<P>
(4) No decision which would result in expenditure by the local authority may be taken otherwise than in accordance with a scheme approved by resolution of the local authority for the delegation to the executive of powers to authorise expenditure.

<P>
(5) The Head of the Paid Service shall within seven days of the date of any decision of the executive provide each member of the local authority with notification of the decision and with the records pursuant to subsection (3) above and, if the conditions set out in subsection (6) are met, shall include in his notification to each member his certification that those conditions are met.

<P>
(6) The conditions referred to in subsection (5) are that such decision satisfies the requirements of subsection (4) above and that implementation of the decision would not result in the authority incurring expenditure of more than £100,000.

<P>
(7) In the absence of such certification as is referred to in subsection (5) above the decision shall not be implemented before the expiry of 14 days from the date of the notice to members pursuant to that subsection or before the date of the conclusion of any scrutiny proceedings resulting from the provisions of subsection (8), whichever is the later.

<P>
(8) If, within 14 days of notification of any decision not accompanied by such certificate as is referred to in subsection (5), the Head of the Paid Service receives a written request signed by at least three members of the local authority he shall refer the decision for scrutiny in accordance with section 15'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
New clause 15-Decisions made by individuals-access to information-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`-(1) A decision shall not be taken by a decision taker unless public notice containing the details specified in subsection (2) has been given by him at least three clear days in advance of the date on which it is proposed to take the decision by posting it at the offices of the local authority and by making it available on the Internet site of the local authority.

<P>
(4) Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent a decision being taken without giving such notice where by reason of special circumstances, which shall be specified in the written record of the decision, the decision taker is of the opinion that it should be taken as a matter of urgency.

<P>
(5) In this section-

<P>
``decision'' means a decision made in connection with the discharge of functions which are the responsibility of a local authority executive;

<P>
``decision taker'' means

<P>
(a) an individual member of a local authority executive, or

<P>
(b) an officer of the authority discharging functions of the executive delegated to him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> On a point of order, Mrs Michie. Before we start I know that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is due to open the debate as these are his amendments. Before we allow him to do so, we should acknowledge that this really is the week of the family and congratulate him, and his daughter, on the birth of his grandchild. I hope that that will inspire him to a good debate this morning, although I accept that he has probably had less sleep, worrying about the birth, than he might otherwise have had.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Further to that point of order, Mrs Michie, but from a different angle. May I add my and my colleague's compliments and congratulations and ask whether that means that we shall not be seeing the hon. Gentleman for the next fortnight?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is definitely not a matter for the Chair, but we all appreciate, and I am sure that Mr. Foster appreciates, your good wishes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for those comments. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) will not get rid of me that easily. However, I shall take the opportunity as early as possible to go back to Bath to see how things are.

<P>
I begin what the Minister rightly acknowledges will be a fairly lengthy and important debate by acknowledging that, since we first debated the Bill on second reading some weeks ago, progress has been made on this issue. We are all delighted that the second draft of the guidance makes it clear that the Minister and the Government generally have taken on board a number of the concerns that have been expressed by many organisations, and indeed by a number of Labour Back Benchers. I want publicly to place on record my gratitude for those movements forward. I support the movements that are proposed in the new version of the draft guidance. The purpose of the debate today is to press the Minister to go that little bit further on these important issues both on the detail of access to information and also on enshrining some of the moves forward that have been made in the regulations on the face of the Bill, which is important.

<P>
I am delighted to speak to the amendments that stand in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders). As I said, this issue has been of concern to a large number of organisations, including the Campaign for Freedom of Information, Friends of the Earth, the Local Government Information Unit, Charter 88, the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Society of Editors, the Newspaper Society, ITV Network Limited, the Labour Campaign for Open Local Government, the Local Government Association and many more.

<P>
The other day I received a copy of a letter from ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and ITN to the Minister dated 16 May. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are extremely concerned that, in its present form, the Bill would remove the press and public's current statutory rights to attend council decision-making meetings, to obtain agenda papers in advance and to inspect minutes and supporting documentation afterwards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We would therefore urge you to support amendments 258-268 and new clause 15.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similar letters were sent to the Minister in advance of the meeting that she had with a number of organisations yesterday and in advance of some of the changes that had taken place in the draft regulations. As a result, some of those organisations were pleased-I have already expressed my pleasure-about the moves that had been taken in the intervening period. However, lest we all believe that these amendments are no longer necessary and that all of the organisations to which I referred are now satisfied, it is important to put on record that they are not. They still wish the amendments to be made and want pressure to continue to be put on the Government.

<P>
Following that meeting, I have received faxes from the Society of Editors and some of the others who were present. In particular, I refer to and place on the record the views of ITV Network Limited.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We welcomed the Government's proposal for the publication of ``forward plans'' by councils, setting out the key decisions to be taken over the coming months. However, we remain unconvinced that the Government's proposal to allow an Executive the choice of meeting in private would safeguard the media and public's right to access information.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We still take the view that key decisions will be taken behind closed doors and the electorate will therefore not have access to a full picture of the weight of discussion and where their own councillors stand on controversial issues. Minutes of proceedings published following meetings of Executives will not provide a flavour of the debate that took place, or detail the advice given by officers during the meeting. The draft guidance does not give a timescale for publication of decisions and papers relating to decisions following meetings, stating only that it should be ``as soon as reasonably practicable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Clearly, ITV Network Limited was not persuaded following the meeting with the Minister yesterday, that sufficient progress had been made. Similarly, the Newspaper Society-I think it was- which also had written prior to the changes to which I have referred, was at yesterday's meeting and has since sent me a copy of a letter to the Minister, which she no doubt received, as I did, this morning. That letter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many thanks for giving us so much of your time today and explaining your intentions.  I am afraid, however, that we remain to be convinced that the Bill as it is currently drafted will deliver all that you aim for across the country. Sadly we fear that on the basis of some of the evidence coming from those authorities that have gone ahead with reform voluntarily, not all of them will deliver the greater openness in decision making that you promise. We welcome the steps that you are taking to ensure that the public and the media get prior warning of decisions through forward plans. Regrettably, we feel that some councils will not enter into the spirit of the legislation and may even exploit it to retreat into greater secrecy. We are also concerned about the level of detail that will be required in forward planning notices and whether it would equate to the amount of information currently contained in agendas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We suspect that some councils may not follow the good examples that are being set.

<P>
We wish that we could share your confidence but we hope you will continue to listen to the sensible amendments that are being proposed.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I do not intend to read it out, but the letter suggests that if the Minister is not persuaded to accept the amendments, it would be helpful if she would put clearly on the record what she believes would constitute good practice, so that members of the public and media would at least be able subsequently to refer to those examples of good practice when commenting on the actions of a council about which they were concerned. I draw attention to that section of the letter.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have not had the letter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise. I hoped that the Minister would have received it by now, but she has to deal with a lot of post. If her hon. Friend the Whip will pass it to her, she can look at it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> On a point of order, Mrs Michie. The hon. Gentleman has barely cleared his throat on the issue, but it is unhelpful when some members of the Committee-especially the Minister-do not have all the correspondence to refer to a meeting at which some of us were not present. We do not know whether it was completed and the Minister has not had a chance to tell us what happened or whether she has accepted any of the amendments. That does not sound like openness in government.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is for the Minister to supply papers, not the Chair. I agree that there is a problem. The Minister may be able to overcome it for the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs Michie, I hope that copies of the correspondence to which I have referred can be circulated and that the Minister will describe what happened at the meeting. I read out the contents of the letter in such detail to allow members of the Committee access to information that came into my hands only an hour before the meeting took place.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the explanation. Does the hon. Member intend to continue?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As the hon. Member for Eastbourne correctly pointed out, I had barely begun to clear my throat on the history. By referring to the meeting that took place, which I was not invited to attend, and the subsequent correspondence, I sought to make it clear that there should be no attempt by the Minister or anyone else to suggest that in the light of the meeting yesterday the various organisations are satisfied with what the Government have done. The organisations to which I referred are keen for us to continue not only to debate, but to persuade the Minister to accept the amendments.

<P>
I said also that other organisations were concerned about the Government's proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins </B>(Tamworth): Before the hon. Gentleman moves on, he has spoken at great length about the media's right to know. The logic of his argument to date is that the only way the public can know what has transpired in local authority meetings is via the media. Does the hon. Gentleman argue that the media must be forced by the Government to inform the public of every decision that a local authority has made? In other words, the choice of what to make public is passed from the local authority to the media.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for his intervention and I appreciate that I have already referred to correspondence that I have read out at some length. He will note that in that correspondence-and in the Official Report-the media organisations said consistently that their concern was about access to meetings by both the media and the public and to prior publication of paperwork. It may help the hon. Gentleman if I say that all the amendments would put in place for the proposed structures for local government the same procedures for access to information, advance publication and subsequent reporting of decisions as exist in local government legislation. I do not seek to make any changes other than the wording; that is necessary because of the changes in the arrangement of the Bill. The basic principles remain the same. I do not intend-nor would it be right-to introduce legislation that places a requirement on local media to have to report all the decisions taken by local government. The responsibility for publishing decisions rests with local councils.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that useful clarification. Will the hon. Gentleman also accept that he is trying to continue to enshrine in law the existing situation, which is based on successful Conservative legislation, that started with the private Member's Bill introduced by the then Margaret Thatcher?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am more than happy to acknowledge that. It might be helpful, before we move on, to place the chronology clearly on the record. The hon. Member for Eastbourne said that in 1960, Baroness Thatcher, as she now is, was successful in bringing the Public Bodies (Admissions Meetings) Act 1960 on to the statute book, which gave access to full council meetings. The Local Government Act 1972 extended the right of access by the public and the media to council meetings to committee meetings. That access was extended by the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985 to sub-committees; that Act added the new requirement for advance publication of information. We are seeking by these amendments to enshrine that combination of prior legislation, built up during Conservative Administrations, in the legislation for the new arrangements for local government that the Government propose.

<P>
A number of other organisations remain concerned, even in the light of the welcome changes proposed by the Government. The Council for the Protection of Rural England says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are concerned that the Government's proposals for reform  would allow new executives to reduce rather than enhance opportunities for public involvement  CPRE is dismayed that Clause 21 gives new executives the ability to exclude the press and public from meetings, without explanation or justification  The draft regulations and guidance do nothing to allay our concerns  CPRE believes that if Clause 21 is passed unamended, it would be a seriously retrograde step. We believe that these issues should be dealt with on the face of the Bill <P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I shall not labour the point, but it is clear that, prior to the changes that the Government introduced in the second draft guidance, there were considerable concerns. There is a general welcome for the move that has been made in the new draft guidance, but very many organisations remain unconvinced that the Government are going far enough forward to allay their fears about what will happen.

<P>
I shall discuss the broad principle of what the amendments would do. The Bill has been severely criticised for allowing decisions that local authorities must now take at open meetings to be taken by closed meetings of executives. The Government remain unwilling to require executives to meet in public, but have moved forward a little on some aspects.

<P>
The most important issue is that of access of the public and the press to all meetings of the executive. That is what amendment No. 258 seeks to resolve: all meetings of executives or their committees or sub-committees would be required to be held in public and councils would not have the option of enabling them to take place in private.

<P>
Discussion about this issue has been going on with the Minister for some time. I do not intend to repeat what she said on Second Reading: Committee members may find her comments at col. 210 of the Official Report for 11 April. Somewhat in advance of that debate, the Minister was more succinct about her views on the matter in a letter to Charter 88. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Committee meetings may be open to the public, but too often that is not where real decisions are made.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Minister believes that opening meetings to the public is likely to drive decision making elsewhere and that that would be a retrograde step. There is no evidence whatever to back up that claim. [
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) seems somewhat sceptical. I draw his attention to a report produced by the Policy Studies Institute in 1995 for the Department of the Environment-a detailed and comprehensive study into the impact of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985. That was the Act that ensured access to committee meetings, sub-committee meetings and full council meetings and the prior availability of information. The question was whether that Act led to the driving of decision making into other hidden arenas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins:</B> On that point, the answer would be yes, because anyone who has spent any time in local government will understand that decisions on policy and implementation are taken by the political groups. The committees are merely the public face for the decisions that have already been made, particularly the key ones.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has served in local government, as have I. I do not for one minute deny that some of the pre-decisions in councils on which I served took place in the way that he describes. However, following those group meetings, there is a requirement for people to come into the open, public meeting to justify the decisions. In addition, clear and detailed research evidence suggests that the instance of what the hon. Gentleman and I know happens from time to time has not increased-indeed, if anything, it has been reduced-since the introduction of the 1985 Act. I draw his attention to paragraph 4.8 of the report which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no real evidence that any more decision-making takes plae in political group meetings or informal settings than had previously been the case. The opposite view, that the Act had led to more business being discussed openly, was much more widely held-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is by members and officers of councils-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This was a result of both the reduction in closed sessions, and the opening of sub-committees to the public.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman may disagree with that research finding, but there is a difference. He and I can both use our own experience and the conversation we may have had with other people. The study was a detailed study of a large number of councils, involving a large number of councillors and officers, and I am prepared to accept the view of that wide-scale study rather than the hon. Gentleman's view. Therefore, the Minister's view that suddenly allowing more decisions to take place out of the public gaze will somehow open up public decision making simply does not hold water.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> This is an important point. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that part of the Government's problem is that they misunderstand the clear difference between transparency and openness. Transparency tells one who is making the decisions; openness gives the real background as to how those decisions are made-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> From a sedentary position both the Minister and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes) say that they entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I happily admit that so do I. It is vitally important that we know who is making decisions. It is also vitally important that we have access to the information on which those decisions are based, but it is also important that we-the general public at large and the media-have an opportunity to see those decisions being taken so that we can judge the way in which the information that is presented is to be used.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): A propos of seeing the decisions being taken, I wonder how the hon. Gentleman would react to witnessing decisions being taken in the bath. The Local Government Chronicle contains an interview with the Minister and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>She supports the principle of cabinets meeting in private, throwing the openness baby out with the mayoral bath water: ``I don't know how you say to a mayor `you have to take decisions in public', because a mayor may well decide in the bath, and come in the next morning and tell people `that is what I've decided'. If you are going to bring that culture in for a mayor then a cabinet should be on the same principles.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be a collective bath, by the sound of it. How would the hon. Gentleman feel about witnessing such a decision in the bath?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The right hon. Gentleman tempts me to go back to my schooldays, joining in those collective rugby showers after matches. It was not a pretty sight, therefore, it is certainly not an approach that I would adopt.

<P>
I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman and I share another concern about the Bill, which is the way in which there is a real possibility of significant decisions being handed to a single individual. That power in the hands of a single individual is something about which I am deeply concerned and I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman is, too. Nevertheless, that is not subject to the amendments that we are debating, which refer to the executive and its committees or sub-committees and not to those circumstances, which the Bill does allow, in which individual members of the executive or officers may have decisions delegated to them. We would then get into what I suspect would be a rather fatuous debate about how the public could be present, in the bath or elsewhere, where that individual was making those decisions. To avoid the embarrassment of that debate, the amendments have not sought to include those decisions.

<P>
I have referred to the way in which there is no clear evidence that opening up the decision-making process has led to decision making being driven underground.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Sawford </B>(Kettering): I worked in local government for 20 years and was leader of the local authority for six years. I am interested in hearing the hon. Gentleman's suggestions about where decisions should be made. I want openness and transparency and I support the call for freedom of information. I am sure that many members of the Committee and other hon. Members have a track record of opening meetings to members of the public and supporting their right to speak, and of taking many other initiatives over the years.

<P>
Is the hon. Member for Bath suggesting that, prior to meetings of an executive or its sub-committee, there will have been no discussion of emerging issues, or of unexpected urgent matters such as reports about named individuals-for example, employees of the council or council tenants-and that the report received in public at that meeting will be the first that the council or the public have heard? I do not believe that that will happen, even though I want more openness. The hon. Gentleman implied that there is no evidence that decisions are made elsewhere, but public presentation of the report, which will have been published and to which the press will have had access, will not be the first that members of the council have heard of it. It will have been discussed elsewhere, so decisions might already have been reached. Therefore, is not his proposal a red herring?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a rather long intervention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> None the less, Mrs Michie, it is a helpful one, because it gives the Committee the opportunity to consider in detail certain issues. The hon. Gentleman, from his long experience, rightly points out that moves towards openness in local government have been made by councils of all political persuasions. I welcome that. The hon. Gentleman may have slightly confused the issue, but he has drawn our attention to decisions that will be made about individual employees or members of the public, including council tenants. My amendments make it clear that the opportunity to consider exempt business would continue to be available. I make no attempt to change that, because it is vital that we keep it.

<P>
The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Sawford) says, rightly, that councillors who currently go to a full council meeting or a meeting of a committee, sub-committee or working party do not go as a blank sheet of paper, with no knowledge of the issues that they are likely to discuss. Individual councillors might have been intimately involved over a long period with a matter that affects their ward or about which they have been lobbied-I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has had people camping on his doorstep, or sending him hundreds of letters about a specific issue. I acknowledge that members of decision-making bodies do not go into meetings without prior knowledge. However, my point is that the media and members of the public have a right of access to the paperwork on which a decision has been based and, equally important, the right to attend the meeting and to observe the discussions. This is the basis of our amendment No. 258.

<P>
Paragraph 8.16 of ``Public access to information'' is relevant to what the hon. Gentleman says. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Meetings are valued by established groups and associations, by groups campaigning or lobbying on specific issues and by individuals pursuing their own particular `cases' or issues of personal interest. They are valued because they give all these groups the opportunity to make representations before the meeting, to make their interest known by being present at the meeting, and to observe the debate and decisions that take place. These are all valid uses of the Act-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the 1985 Act-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which do reinforce the accountability of local government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with all of that. I hope that I have made it clear why the Committee should accept amendment No. 258, which would make it a requirement that the executive, its committees and sub-committees should continue to meet in public under exactly the same conditions as currently apply to meetings of councils, their committees and sub-committees.

<P>
Other amendments deal with access to information given in advance of a meeting. The Government have accepted that it is vitally important for members of the public and the media to have access to the paperwork that will inform the meeting, and they have made it a requirement in the draft regulations that such material must be made available. However, there are two problems with the Government's proposal: first, it will be possible for councils or executives to find ways around it and, secondly, the Government do not propose to put that requirement on the face of the Bill, so it will not have statutory force. The force of law that will apply if such requirements are inserted in the Bill will be much stronger than if they appear only in regulations. If the amendments are not accepted, the current system will be watered down when the Bill is enacted.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister shakes her head; perhaps she will pick up that point when she responds. My advice is clear. The provision will be a retrograde step, which will make it more difficult for members of the public to take action against members of the executives, but if the Minister can convince me otherwise, I should be delighted.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): Under the present system, not only can the media and the public be present, but the opposition can scrutinise prior decisions and ask awkward questions. Even if the changes proposed in the amendments are made, we face the prospect of an executive of a single party receiving briefing papers and ratifying decisions extremely quickly with no scrutiny at all.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I probably hold similar views on the importance of pre-scrutiny-a process that I hope we will use to an increasing extent in our deliberations at Westminster. I agree that additional amendments could be made to the legislation to improve it in the way he describes, but I think, Mrs Michie, that you would rule us out of order if we pursued that line. Were the hon. Gentleman to table such amendments at a later stage, subject to the precise wording, he would have our support.

<P>
To pursue the point about access to paperwork and the power of legislation with the Minister, I should like to quote some notes that I have been given on the matter. She might tell me that I have been incorrectly advised, but the notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where an executive decides to meet in public, the draft regulations impose a new set of rules largely identical to those under the 1972 Act. However executives will be free to hold all their meetings in private if they wish. In this case, the public's right will be weaker. First, the existing statutory right to see papers at least three clear days beforehand will be replaced by what may be a less specific requirement, in standing orders, to publish papers when they are finalised. The guidance indicates the intention is that papers will be made public significantly earlier than at present. This is welcome. However, we are concerned that it could be circumvented-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the following reason.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The guidance states the papers will only have to be disclosed when they are ``finalised''. This suggests that drafts could be circulated without having to be disclosed. Unless there is a clear requirement to make reports public at a set time, executives could deliberately rely on draft reports to which minor changes are made from time to time, to avoid public disclosure. The result could be that there will be less than three days notice of the detailed proposals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the first point. Papers are required to be made available only when they are finalised; there is no specific requirement that that be three days in advance or more. If the papers are not finalised, executives could resort to draft paperwork.
<P>
The notes go on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The result could be that there will be less than three days notice of the detailed proposals, which will then be decided at closed meetings. This would obviously represent a substantial weakening of the existing rights-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[
Interruption.] Does the Minister want to intervene? No.

<P>
The requirement is to appear in standing orders, not in legislation. The notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 1972 Act makes it a criminal offence for anyone to intentionally obstruct a member of the public seeking to exercise a right of access under that Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the requirement relating to access is now to be in standing orders, it is my understanding-again, if the Minister wishes to, she can contradict me-that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It would not be an offence to obstruct someone seeking access to documents which should be available under the standing order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the existing deterrent is lost-although I would be the first to admit that it has not been very effective, as fines have usually been very small and the opportunity has rarely been used.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It might help the Committee if I make it clear that, later in the Bill, we are introducing a new regime that brings together the standards, conducts and ethics of local government. Therefore any breach of the standing orders, which would be statutory provisions, would be an issue for the standards board. Although such actions will be decriminalised, there will be a clear route for complaints by members of the public and press. As the hon. Gentleman knows, one of the problems at present is that there are so many different pieces of legislation involved. We have tried, with considerable support to date, to bring together ethics and standards so that there is one means of addressing those issues. I regard that, not as a weakening of the current system, but simply as a change to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am most grateful; that is helpful. Although the clarification and bringing together of various issues under one framework is always welcome, the Minister has rightly acknowledged that the proposals mean that the power of complainants will be diminished. All they will be able to do is take an issue up with the standards committee.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The issue will go before the Standards Board, which is an external body, not the standards committee, which is internal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That was a slip of the tongue and I apologise. Nevertheless, resorting to the Standards Board is not the same as having recourse to law, as is the case now. Whether that is a better approach will merit further debate wheh we come to the relevant part of the Bill.

<P>
We need to bear in mind two points. First, it is possible to undermine the current requirement for information to be made available three clear days in advance; and, secondly, in legal terms, the provision could detract from the ability and right of individual members of the public to challenge a member of an executive who seeks to deny them access to information.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> One of the Minister's difficulties is that she is establishing a system that will allow secrecy to continue and people who want to utilise it for corrupt purposes will be able to do so. The problem for the public is getting enough information to be able to ask the right questions. It is all very well to apply a stick afterwards, but the Minister has provided opportunities for abuse in the first place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The clear issue is that several requirements are needed; I have mentioned them before, but I shall repeat them. It is vital for members of the public to know who is going to take a decision. They must have advance access to the information on which decisions are based. They must have an opportunity to be present when the decision-making process in action-observing the meeting and indicating by their presence whether they support what is being debated. After decisions are taken, they must have access to full and detailed accounts of the reasons underpinning them.

<P>
The majority of the Committee wants to achieve such a system, but we disagree on whether it is appropriate to do so in the manner proposed by the Minister and whether it is possible to circumvent the system that she advocates. I and many organisations that have studied the draft guidance believe that there are ways in which to circumvent the Bill's provisions on the prior publication of information. The proposals will be less effective than the current arrangements because they are to be set out in guidance, not built into the Bill.

<P>
We have had a long introduction to what I suspect will be a long debate. The Government have made significant progress since the proposals were first debated, but they have not gone far enough. The key issue is dealt with in the lead amendment. I passionately hope that the Minister will agree that it is vital to retain the standards of openness in existing legislation and to apply them to the Bill's new proposals on local government.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I apologise for hesitating before rising, Mrs Michie. I was intending to respond to all the amendments in the group. Conservative Members have tabled amendments, but I assume that they do not want to pursue them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> In the face of the experience of a lifetime, I was attempting to help the Minister. Our debate has become somewhat out of kilter, and it would help the Committee if the Minister told us exactly where things stand in repect of her meetings with media representatives. That is why I propose to speak after the Minister. However, if it causes her difficulty, that is another matter.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It causes me no difficulty at all. I assumed that the hon. Gentleman wanted to move, or at least speak to, the Conservatives' amendments, but it appears that I shall have to respond to the hon. Gentleman's amendments before hearing any of the points that he wants to raise about them. I am trying to act in accordance with the way in which debates are usually conducted, but there we are.

<P>
I shall speak now because the hon. Member for Eastbourne wants me to do so and because I want to address the serious issues raised by the hon. Member for Bath. I am not sure whether the amendments tabled by Conservative Members should be treated with the same degree of seriousness; my view is that, as the amendments proposed by the two Opposition parties are different, I shall treat them differently. Conservative Members continue to close down choices, rather than extend choice, as they claim they are doing. Their amendments would achieve a return to the committee system.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bath has attempted to explore how best to realise the spirit of our proposals: whether to build it into the Bill or embody it in the guidance and regulations. We do not want merely the status quo; we want enhanced openness and accountability. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that I have often spoken about closed meetings at which a decision is taken and disciplinary action is subsequently applied against any member who does not back up that decision in the open forum of the committee. I am not saying that open meetings necessarily drive people back into making decisions in a closed form; however, openness does not necessarily guarantee the accountability that most of us want. One of the Government's main arguments is that the current system does not ensure sufficient accountability, because it is difficult to identify who has taken a decision, what options were considered before taking it and where accountability for it lies.

<P>
We are attempting to change the structure in order to secure levels of accountability hitherto unknown in local government. That is why we introduced the Bill. Far from wanting to close down local government in terms of public access, we want to open it up. We are working with people to arrive at an understanding of how to bring that about in reality; a showcase is not good enough. The hon. Member for Bath and I share a desire for greater openness and accountability, which is why we have discussed the issues with outside groups. I do not apologise for continuing to arrange meetings with lobby organisations and various groups that want to press a particular view: that is precisely how a Minister should behave.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): The Minister does not take any notice.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> If that were true, we would not have made any changes or tabled any amendments to the Bill. We listen carefully to people, but we want to achieve greater openness and accountability without imposing on local authorities a mass of bureaucracy that prevents them from taking decisions.

<P>
I was told by someone yesterday that we should allow a veto on the ability of an executive member to take a decision. I replied that we should think that through. It would mean that no authority could ever take a decision, because people who did not want a certain decision would do whatever they could to stop it being made. That is not likely to be in the interests of the wider group of people. If one person can veto a decision, the whole democratic process is undermined.

<P>
Is the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) saying that I should not think through the consequences of what someone proposes and that, simply because something has been proposed, I should accept it? We must ensure that we think through the consequences of propositions put to us before coming to a judgment. We always try to do that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> To save time, let me state that no Opposition Member is coming close to suggesting that the Minister should not meet lobby groups. That is a proper function of a Minister; it is one of the things that Ministers are paid to do. The reason that I thought it best for the Minister to speak first, and possibly twice, in this debate was to enable her to tell the Committee about what, if any, changes to the Bill she proposes after her meetings in recent days.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Perhaps the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham should start to take such matters seriously. If he wants to sit in on all my meetings, I have no objection, but he needs to grow up. If I were an Opposition Member, I would not expect to receive invitations to discussions with Ministers, Members of Parliament and members of the public about what should go into a Bill. The hon. Gentleman has not invited me to any of his meetings with lobby groups or with his local executive. He should grow up and allow us to have a reasonable debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I shall not give way at this stage. We want to ensure that we move forward as clearly and straightforwardly as possible and that we have a regime that the public can understand. They must feel that they know what they have to do and what they can do, and that they have the ability to get information and make representations. If members of the public are not content that they are being treated fairly and honestly, they must feel that they have a clear means of proceeding.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bath will know that, currently, recourse is to the courts. I now many members of the public who are terrified of going to court and who cannot afford to do so. The regime that we are introducing with the Stanards Board will be far more accessible to the public. It will create far less fear and will not involve people in the expense of going to court, but it will be as rigorous as the current system and as demanding on councils in terms of their behaviour. Indeed, some penalties, such as suspending councillors from being able to hold office, might be more effective than the fines used in the past-which, as the hon. Gentleman says, have rarely been used. We do not want to make it more difficult for people, or less difficult for councils. We want a regime that is coherent and accessible to members of the public, many of whom find the current regime very confusing. We share the hon. Gentleman's desire for transparency in councils and for decision making to be accountable, but I remain to be persuaded that the amendments will achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The merit of the Liberal Democrats' amendments is that they acknowledge the nature of an executive, although I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman carried that to its logical conclusion. He spoke about the executive meeting as a committee, but it will meet as a group of executive members, each of whom will have personal responsibility for an area of decision taking. The problem with the amendment is that it treats the executive as a committee, and it may be an individual such as the mayor who is responsible for a decision. For example, in Hertfordshire the member who has responsibility for children's services is the executive.

<P>
That is the problem and I have tried to be honest with members of the Committee and with those outside the House who are anxious about the matter. The proposed system gives responsibility to individuals; there must therefore be a much more robust and open system of accountability. Documents must be avialable and open to scrutiny before an individual member of the panel takes a decision. The new guidance is designed to make the system even more robust than it was before.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall not go into my views and those of my party about executives, because we have already discussed that issue. However, if an executive is not an individual but a group of people, as it will be in some cases, will the Minister explain in simple terms so that I can easily understand her how an executive that meets in secret aids the process of openness?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall come to that matter later, but I want to ask the hon. Gentleman how an executive meeting openly will aid the process. I shall listen carefully and I am not closing any doors, but I want openness and accountability to be more than simply a show at a meeting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have a related point which should be dealt with now because it is important to consider such matters together. Paragraph 10.15 on page 65 of the guidance relates to the availability of documents. The problem seems to be that an executive must decide, both that it will meet in public, and that it will meet as a committee before the provisions kick in. Is that right? That would create two hurdles-rather than just the one-to the availability of information, about which we have complained most.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will discuss that issue later, but I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is right. As I read it, if an executive chose to meet in that way and to change the role of its members from one of being collectively accountable for decisions, the current legislation would kick back in. The executive would be meeting as a committee, and committees must meet in public, so the same regulations would apply. The Bill provides for the times when the executive does not meet as a committee.

<P>
People are finding it difficult to accept the new concepts. We have carefully worked out the implications. The hon. Member for Bath intervened earlier and said that he accepted that it was difficult to say that an individual should take a decision openly, but we must deal with the times when the executive does not meet as a committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If that is the only barrier between us, I will be more than happy for the Minister to give a clear assurance now that she accepts the broad thrust of the amendments. If we need to get the words right for times when a group of people meets, I will give that commitment to finish the debate.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman again misinterprets what I said. If the executive meets as a group, it does not necessarily mean that it is meeting as a committee that will take collective decisions. For example, a member of the executive might already have consulted interested parties and the scrutiny panel might have produced a report before such a meeting. That person could then tell the committee about the proposal at the meeting and invite the committee to give its view, but he or she alone would take the decision, after hearing all the representations. A committee meeting would work differently from such an executive meeting.

<P>
Two issues underlie all the amendments. The first and more important issue concerns access to decision taking and holding the decision maker to account before the decision is taken. We must ensure proper access to the papers and the people taking dcecisions, to allow local people to have some input into decisions and to find out what is being decided, what was decided, why decisions were taken and on what evidence those decisions were based. That is the core issue behind the clause.

<P>
The second issue is whether meetings should always be open to the public, except when exempt information is being discussed. There is an amendment on that, too, but I am not sure whether the official Opposition realise that they were seeking to make public all exempt information.

<P>
I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Bath. My main concern has been to ensure that even when individuals are taking decisions, they are so packed around with openness and accountability that, whenever and wherever they take them, the public and the press have had full knowledge of the options being considered and the ability to ask for specific aspects of those options to be looked at and to apply pressure in any legitimate way. That is much more than is currently possible.

<P>
The hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) suggested that not every decision made by the executive, whatever its form, will have been scrutinised. That is inevitably so, because there will be priorities for the scrutiny panel, but any member of the panel may ask for an issue to be looked at before a decision is taken. I am not sure what more we can do. If members were content that they had been able to speak to the executive about potential decisions, who are we to say that every decision should be gone through by a scurtiny panel before it is taken? We have tried to make it clear that any member has the right to raise an issue and ensure that it is looked at.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> We are coming into a cloud cuckoo land of toing and froing, where the scrutiny committee needs to have sufficient knowledge to ask the questions to pre-scrutinise, but will ultimately receive decisions that may have been ratified quickly with the minimum of papers and will not have sufficient knowledge to be able to scrutinise and, when scrutinising, will do so predominantly post-decision-in many cases, six months later. Hammersmith and Fulham is the classic example that has been referred to many times in the Committee.
 
<P>
<B>Ms. Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that we are entering cloud cuckoo land. The reality is that it is not possible for anything that we are talking about to take place within the current committee system. We are talking about pushing councils to do things that they have not previously done. I acknowledge that it will take time and councils will need to train and learn to do it effectively. Parliament tried to do it without training, which was silly. Members of Parliament should learn how to scrutinise. We are offering training in local government. Some authorities will do it better than others: that is the case in all their activities. What framework should be put in? What constitutes effective scrutiny? How does one encourage it? It is not for Parliament to do the work of local councils; it is their job to develop skills and opportunities within the framework so to do.

<P>
Public access to decision making is fundamental. I shall argue for that very strongly. In the regulations made under the legislation we will introduce a framework that guarantees the necessary access, whether decisions are taken by an individual executive member or an elected mayor, by officers of by the executive acting corporately.

<P>
I have listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Bath and other right hon. and hon. Members have said in interventions. Our approach is one that will guarantee the public the access that they are seeking and will do so in all the different sorts of decision-making circumstances that will arise under the new structures. Above all, I stress that our approach for councils' new constitution goes much further to guarantee access than present arrangements do, including those in part V of the Local Government Act 1972, to which hon. Members have referred.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Let me demonstrate to the Committee how that is so. The executive will have a duty to produce a forward plan well in advance of the key decisions that it will be making, whether collectively or individually. That forward plan will be updated on a rolling basis. For the first time, key officer decisions will be made formally, subject to advance notice and public consultation. The forward plan will have to set out who will be taking the decision and who will be consulted. The officers will have to make papers available as soon as they receive them, not just three days in advance, when it can often be too late properly to influence a decision. That is all set out clearly in the guidance and will be legally enforced through regulations.

<P>
Where a key decision arises that has not been set out in the forward plan, there will need to be at least a three-day delay before it is taken to allow proper consideration, except in cases of extreme urgency. Once a decision has been taken, it will need to be recorded and published, together with the reasons for the decision, and other options will have to be considered as well as relevant background papers.

<P>
There has been concern about the availability of papers-it was raised on Second Reading. We have talked about papers in their final form being made available once they go to the executive. The hon. Member for Bath expressed concern that people might keep things in draft until very late to avoid having to disclose information at an early stage. We need to look at this carefully to find out whether we should stipulate in regulations that papers relating to a decision be made available at least a certain number of days before a final decision is taken in all but the most urgent cases. New clause 15, tabled by the hon. Gentleman would provide for that in relation to individual decision makers. I recognise that there is a case for that, but it is too prescriptive to put such matters on the face of the Bill. We will certainly consider whether we should make such provision through regulations.

<P>
We intend to put the framework that I have set out
in place through regulations, including mandatory standing orders, but that does not mean that it will be an unenforceable regime without teeth. Heavy sanctions will be attached. Failure to record or publish key decisions would be a criminal offence. Failure to place a decision on the forward plan when it should be there and could have been foreseen would be a breach of standing orders and hence a breach of the new code of conduct, which could ultimately lead to suspension for up to five years. They are not sanctions that I envisage a member of an executive would take lightly.

<P>
Finally, Opposition Members have said a good deal about open meetings. Openness has become an icon-I understand that. In response to the hon. Member for Bath, I have to work out whether it is more than an icon. Will meeting in public mean that the decisions are better and more open than under the regime that I have described? At my meeting yesterday with the press and media representatives I was told that yes, it is an icon, but it is important because people can see that it is an open process. I am prepared to think about that, but I am not at all convinced that we shall secure openness by requiring that all meetings must be in public. I have said before that it is important to give executive members the opportunity to think. We all take the opportunity to think in private, not in public. That is perfectly reasonable. I have considered whether we should say that meetings at which decisions are being taken should be in public. I am certainly not convinced that all meetings of an executive should be in public because it may need time to consider representations and other matters before coming to a decision.

<P>
I am trying to ensure that we edge towards a system that demonstrates fully to the public that it is open and accountable and gives them real access on many occasions that they have not had it before. An hon. Friend who has long experience in local government mentioned the ability to speak at committee meetings. I remind hon. Members that that is a discretionary power. It is not within the legislation. I do not think that it is even in the guidance or regulations. The Bill puts far more into regulations because we want to be honest with the public and we want the public to feel that they have real access, and a real ability to influence decisions, but to recognise that with a directly-elected mayor or an individual executive member, the actual decision may well be taken when that person is not in a public forum. If we insist in Parliament that it must be taken in a public form, it will be the reporting of the decision. We cannot stop people thinking in their bath or wherever, as was discussed earlier and, in essence, coming to a decision.

<P>
We are trying to discover how far within the formal system we in Parliament can insist that local authorities act in a certain way. We have gone a long way to meeting the concerns. I accept that as soon as one concession is made, people want to go for the next. That is not the way in which the hon. member for Bath is approaching this matter, but a requirement for decisions to be taken in public can never be a guarantee of real access. It may provide access and it may be one route to access, but it may also provide an image of access and little more. I want more to come out of the Bill. That is why the framework that we are seeking to establish is about more than whether the final decision-taking meeting is held in public.

<P>
It is not easy. We need to spend time thinking our way through to achieve the best levels of access and accountability and openness in local government. We are working hard to get there. I am not prepared to con the public that that can be done simply by saying that a meeting has to be open. As I said, it may be that my concern not to con people is proving a difficulty.

<P>
I am not convinced, therefore, that every executive meeting should be open. There is clearly the potential that things could be lost if we insist on that. I am always keen to listen to what members of the Committee have to say and the hon. Members for Bath and for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) will appreciate that I am moving towards their position, but in a way that means the whole framework will deliver openness and access. I am not convinved that simply opening meetings to the public will do that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have learned my lesson. I hoped to advance the debate by permitting the Minister to speak first, so that she could give us an insight into her thinking following meetings with the lobby groups. It is not a mistake. I repeat: we are no further forward and the Minister has retreated into a twilight zone of obfuscation and complication, telling us how difficult it all is. There is nothing complicated about booting people out of meetings which they have had the right to attend, neither is it clever-[
Interruption.] I am taking the matter very seriously. I am sure that the Minister is serious, but she could still be plain wrong. She must take a step back from the complications, because life is sometimes much simpler than one might think.

<P>
We are not talking here about a political version of ``The Truman Show'', whereby people are monitored on a 24-hour basis by hidden TV cameras to detect the precise moment when an electronic impulse that could constitute a decision flashes through their brain. Of course, it is not unknown in any party for people to arrive at meetings of individuals or groups-whatever you want to call such gatherings-having made up their mind in advance. That is not unheard of and the Minister herself has spoken about people making decisions in the bath. We are not remotely in the business of trying to capture the moment when people make a decision in that way. We are simply saying that, at the moment, the system, imperfect though it may be, in certain circumstances requires meetings to take place in public with full access to agendas and so on. There is an enormous burden of proof on Ministers to justify changing that.

<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan </B>(Cardiff, North): Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that, at the moment and for many years, executive-style arrangements have operated within local authorities? For example, when I was a councillor, the chairs of the committees always met together and there was no public recording or production of minutes of any of those meetings. The provisions of the Bill are a step on from that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As my right hon. Friend the member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) said the other day in the context of whipping, you will never stop elected members of any body meeting and talking, especially if they happen to share the same breakfast table-as we heard from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Of course I acknowledge that, but sometimes that sort of system is perverted and misused and it is simply not good enough for Minister to say, ``Sometimes these things happen without proper scrutiny, therefore we are going to include the practice in the Bill.'' It is obvious from what the Minister said-and this is why I shall not repeat the experiment of changing the order of batting-that she has taken not a blind bit of notice of what the lobby groups said. It would be nice if Opposition members of the Committee could have a copy of the correspondence at some time, so that we at least know what is being talked about.

<P>
We welcome the support of the Liberal Democrats for the thrust of our amendments. It is purely a procedural quirk that although our amendments pre-date theirs, theirs went first; but there is a lot of good sense in what they say. We welcome them, belatedly, to this side of the argument.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
An important point that runs through all this, and which I am pleased to see is common ground between us and the Liberal Democrats, is this business of transparency and openness. In a later clause the Government are trying to insert by amendment the word ``transparency''. They fundamentally misunderstand the difference-but I shall come to that.

<P>
I want to discuss the guidance in more detail. We welcome, as do others, the changes in the second draft, as far as they go. They simply do not go far enough; they certainly do not meet the thrust of our amendments and I suspect that the same will be true of those tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. In any event, if the changes are good ones, they should be incorporated into the Bill, because this is such an important point. Our aim is to stop the Government retreating from a series of Conservative measures that enshrined the right of the public and press to information in local government. It is worth reminding the Committee that the first of these provisions was introduced by Baroness Thatcher in a private Member's Bill some years ago.

<P>
The problem is that the opportunities presented by the Bill as it stands have been embraced with enthusiasm by some Labour-controlled authorities in advance of the legislation. Ministers seem intent on ignoring the concerns of newspaper editors, freedom of information campaigners and Opposition parties as well as many of their own local councillors and Back Benchers. Conservative legislation required councils and their committees to meet in public in all but the most exceptional cases. Now, Labour is trying to reverse that. Most cabinets, especially in Labour-controlled areas, are already made up of members of one party. Now the Government say that it is all right for the handful of local politicians who make the decisions in these one-party states to meet behind closed doors. Labour is giving the green light for corruption and smoke-filled rooms in our town halls.

<P>
What is particularly interesting, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has already said, is the Minister's in-depth interview with the Local Government Chronicle only the other day. She expresses her frustration at the slow pace of change in town halls. Could that have something to do with a lack of enthusiasm? On the question of secrecy, it gives us an interesting insight into her thinking on the matter. She points out in the interview that she refuses to provide a blueprint for an open, accountable cabinet. She says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I'm not going to do that, because people would say ``that is my choice''. We want differentiation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She goes on to say that she supports the principle of cabinets meeting in private, which, as the LGC says, is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>throwing the openness baby out with the mayoral bath water.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already had a reference to the bath from my right hon. Friend.

<P>
The Minister says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not feasible to have effective decision making when all of the thinking is done in the glare of publicity, because then people will not be thinking the unthinkable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said earlier, I do not fully understand why she is concerned about the thinking process. That will remain a private matter for those involved in any council, but surely the process by which matters are discussed openly between people on a local council, particularly on an executive or cabinet, should in the normal way be of proper public interest and concern.

<P>
We have heard about the provisions of the 1985 Act and the legislation leading to the current legal position. It is interesting that, in opposition, the present Government took a strong line on freedom of information. As the then Leader of the Opposition said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The first right of a citizen in any mature democracy should be the right to information. It is time to sweep away the cobwebs of secrecy which hang over far too much government activity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on about ending the ``obsessive and unnecessary secrecy'', but, far from extending freedom of information, the Government are trying to step backwards in terms of what is available to the public. As Mr. Andrew Ecclestone of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are now finding a Labour government removing the rights Mrs Thatcher gave us.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
One of the joys of being the Opposition on the Committee is that just about every point we make is not a Conservative or Liberal Democrat point, but one on which there is broad agreement across the whole spectrum of local government and even on the part of Government Back Benchers. The hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) tabled an early-day motion in which he referred to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>open government as enshrined in the Access to Information Act 1985.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There has been a broad measure of support for it among Government Back Benchers.

<P>
As we have heard, on Second Reading, Labour Back Benchers were positively queueing up to attack this clause of the Bill. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>How on earth will private meetings of executives-in closed session-help the participation of the public? How are the public to know about the debate and the decisions? The executives will merely present them with a fait accompli. How will the Bill result in greater participation, transparency or openness?-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 210.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer to his rhetorical question is that it will not. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill in its present form is deficient and will lead to more closed, less well-informed and less informative local government  We cannot let the Bill pass from this Chamber in its closed state.-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 222.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was supported in comments by a number of Government Back Benchers, including the hon. Members for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith). The latter said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government could legislate so that all cabinet meetings remained open to the public and to all councillors. The present system-of leaving the decisions to the executive-is unsatisfactory.-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 263.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a matter for comment that there are no Government proposals to amend clause 21, despite many Government amendments to almost every other clause of the Bill; there is only wishy-washy talk about the guidance, to which I shall come shortly. Why will the Government not listen to their Back Benchers? The hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) had a ten-minute Bill on local government access to information, backed up by a series of his hon. Friends. Why ignore the views of competent and sensible Back Benchers?

<P>
What about our old friends in the Labour campaign for open local government? No sitting of the Committee would be complete without a contribution from them. Surprisingly, they refer to the private Member's Bill of the now Baroness Thatcher in 1960 and, grudgingly, say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only time she ever did anything positive for local government<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is rather churlish. They refer to Robin Squire's Bill a few years later,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which permitted the publishing of council agendas in advance. LCOLG believes that the government in the year 2000 is going backwards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not an amazing comment from a group that represents some 500 councillors? [
Interruption.] The figure may have gone down since 4 May-I am willing to be corrected by the Minister if she thinks that the figure was wrong. Would she like to tell me the current figure? No.

<P>
Let us look at the way in which the provisions, in advance of reaching the statute book, have been embraced by some Labour councils. One rebel Labour councillor on Birmingham metropolitan council stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decisions made behind locked doorsis exactly how Hitler started and it is a very dangerous precedent for a modern city like Birmingham.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A letter in the Independent from Mr. Peter Mole stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to the present leadership of Lambeth council-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not so far from here-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>[openness] is an alien concept.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already heard the quote from the Labour leader of Darlington council, John Williams, but it bears repetition. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Holding meetings in public would merely create a theatrical experience for onlookers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would that council meetings were so exciting! The Northern Echo, choosing somewhere at random, talks of Sedgefield district council, which described secret meetings as ``an abuse of power''. The Highbury and Islington Express attacks Islington borough council and talks of:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>eight politicians wanting to decide our future in secret.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Speaking of Kingston-upon-Hull city council, the Hull Daily Mail warns that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A cloak of secrecy could descend on important council-decision making in Hull.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to the Independent, in Newcastle metropolitan council,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ten councillors sit in single-party Cabinet meetings closed to the public. Afterwards the council issues a list of recommendations to a further committee, which although held in public, has been accused of `rubber-stamping' Cabinet decisions.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have heard from the hon. Member for Bath and other hon. Members about the attitude of bodies such as the LGIU, Charter 88 and the Campaign for Freedom of Information. Its briefing document, which members of the Committee will have received a few weeks ago, is especially pointed on the matter of transparency versus openness. It rightly points out that Minsters often speak of the need for transparency. We can all sign up to the notion that it should be possible in the process to identify who is making a specific decision; but that is a world away from openness, disclosure and lack of secrecy. As it put it:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clarity of responsibility after the event is no substitute for openness prior to decisions being taken, and cannot be a substitute for an open and responsive approach to decision-making, which allows the community to discuss and influence decisions before they are taken.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That strikes me as a sensible and penetrating summary of what the debate is about. Local councils are not the private property of those who happen to be fortunate enough to control them on a turnout of 30 per cent. or, in places like Liverpool, much less. They remain the property of local voters. It is unacceptable for those who happen to run the council, let along the tiny group who are in the cabinet or executive, to try to exclude the public and those who pass on to the public the relevant information from their deliberations, except in special circumstances.

<P>
The hon. Member for Tamworth made a point about commensurate obligation on the local media, which bears further examination. There is an obligation. One of the problems with local democracy in recent years has been a general decline in the quantity of reporting of local council meetings and key local committee meetings, as a cost-saving exercise or whatever. The inability to find young cub reporters to sit in a committee meeting after a certain time of night is a shame. There may be organisational and monetary reasons, but it is a pity. We all appreciate the briefing and views that we have had from journalists, newspaper editors and the media generally on the issue and I make the plea that, if we try to help them, they will look again at the detail and amount of coverage that they give to local democracy.

<P>
Most people will not be able to go to local council committee meetings, but they look to their local press to reflect what has been going on fairly and informatively. If that right is to mean anything, the coverage must be substantial and on going.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Bath referred to a number of organisations that have expressed concern. The National Union of Journalists says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The cabinets or executives, meeting behind closed doors, which are now being imposed will deny basic access to local democracy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have heard from the CPRE and the hon. Gentleman quoted from its briefing. We have also heard from the Newspaper Society, representing 1,300 newspapers titles across the country. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government proclaims its commitment to freedom of information, but in the context of local government it is proposing to deprive the public of existing rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is surely the point: these are existing rights. The Opposition are not trying to introduce new rights of access to information in local government. As the hon. Gentleman put it, this is entirely a matter of holding the line and protecting the status quo.

<P>
The Newspaper Society goes on to refer to the fact that it was the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on which my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley served that recommended that agendas and background papers of the executive should be published in advance-one of the issues taken up by the Minister. It adds that the access to information provisions are so important that they must appear on the face of the Bill. The hon. Member for Bath also quoted from Friends of the Earth, which has a lot to say and has helpfully produced its own briefing on the matter. Those are only some example of a range of bodies and organisations that have expressed concern about the provisions, extending way beyond the ambit of local government.

<P>
Various television stations such as ITN, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 have worked together to bring to our attention their ``extreme concern'' about the provisions of the Bill. It is in order for the Minister to speak twice in the debate, and if she wants to take up that option it would be helfpul. The Government are basically saying that they will not change a word or comma of the Bill. The Minister has met those lobby groups, although she does not deserve brownie points for doing that, because it is part of the process: that is what openness and accountability at national level is all about. However, she plainly is not going to take any notice of what they had to say and will fall back on the draft guidance.

<P>
As I have already conceded, the Opposition perceive the merit in the changes made from the first draft to the second, but we stress again that these matters should be on the face of the Bill. The first point to make about the guidance goes almost without saying: The rules will apply as before to full councils. Here we have another example of the status quo applying to full council meetings. We then come on to the rather intriguing concept of ``key decisions''. The executive is to set out its programme of work and to consult widely and effectively. Who could complain about that? The relevant stakeholders are to be involved in the process. That is all good stuff. The forward plan is to be updated each month on a rolling basis.

<P>
There is a danger here, which my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley touched on in an intervention: it is that we are creating a complex, bureaucratic method of tackling some of the problems, while letting the major problems slip through entirely. That is what we may end up with. Once one has made the distinction between ``key decisions'' and others-presumably decisions that do not matter much-one must agree a definition, yet the guidance goes only some way to doing that. It states that ``key decisions'' are, among other things, decisions that have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i)  a material effect beyond the internal workings of the authority or (ii)  a significant effect on the authority<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and those that involve ``significant expenditure''. Who will define ``material'' and ``significant''? How does the Minister define them? Some people want the guidance to work, but others want to find a way round it if they can, as the hon. Member for Bath said.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> How are key decisions determined at present? What decisions are taken in committee and what are properly taken by officers? Can the hon. Gentleman say how decisions are taken at present on what constitutes a key issue that must be debated in public? What information is their about such decisions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister is introducing the concept of key decisions and she must defend it. It is no earthly good asking me; if the sub-text of her question is to ask me whether I think that everying in the local government garden is rosy, my answer is no it is not, especially in many Labout-controlled authorities. I hope that, in her second bite at the cherry, the Minister will make a serious effort to answer my questions about the draft guidance.

<P>
Paragraph 10.11 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There will clearly be occasions where the executive needs to take such a decision which is not contained in the forward plan. In such a case, the executive must notify the relevant overview and scrutiny committee(s) of the decision<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that must be done at least three days in advance. The following paragraph refers to urgent decisions which must be taken without three day's notice. Agreement must be obtained from the chair-it should be chairman in my view-of the relevant overview and scrutiny committee that the decision is urgent. What about those authorities in which the chair of the committee is a member of the controlling party, for example, the Labour party? Is that a complete safeguard? Even those who have not served on a local council know that good, responsible and admirable people will follow what is laid down in the guidance or code of conduct anyway; they are the sort of people who will make it work, whatever party they belong to. However, those who want to circumvent the guidance will find ways to do so. I mentioned paragraph 10.15 in an earlier intervention. The Minister answered my question, but she may want to say more about the matter later.

<P>
It is embarrassing that the proposals have almost no friends in the world, for two reasons: first, the proposals remove the protections that are in place now, and the Minister has not even begun to make a case for doing so. Secondly, in advance, in a perverted pilot scheme, some Labour-controlled authorites used the Bill to keep private decisions that were taken within a small group. A recent article in The Guardian by Peter Hetherington referred to Cardiff council, which was outraged by bad publicity about fat-cat councillors awarding themselves huge pay rises. That really takes the biscuit. The lord mayor-cum council leader, Councillor Goodway, was paid a package amounting to £58,500. The councilor decided to launch its own 140,000-circulation newspaper and order town hall departments to withdraw all job advertising from the local press. Cardiff is one of our major cities. The Minister with responsibility for Wales is not here-I am sure there is a good reason-but it would be nice if some Minister could respond to my argument. Is that the kind of local government that the Labour Government are seeking?

<P>
That is not the bad part. The decision was taken in secret by the cabinet. A more recent article in The Guardian by Mr. Hetherington, who has been a doughty campaigner on the issue, was headlined, ``Culture of secrecy in the town hall cabinet system''. There is nothing new about that. There is a tradition of small, self-perpetuating oligarchies in some councils, which have been controlled by the same party for years if not generations, misusing their position. Now, like manna from heaven under the new so-called modernisation proposals, there is an opportunity to make it even worse.

<P>
Mr. Hetherington gives an example from Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Newcastle has finally bowed to pressure. It will follow the example of the old committee system and will open the next cabinet meeting to the press and public after six months of secret meetings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That strikes me as eminently sensible. Councils everywhere are having little pilots of their own, without the blessing or encouragement of the Government. Newcastle-a major city-has decided that it got things wrong and is opening its meetings to the press and public. If it has come that view after experimentation, why cannot Ministers adopt the same policy?

<P>
The sting, of course, is in the tail of the same article by Mr. Hetherington, who writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Labour's national executive has little sympathy with critics in the council chamber and in the local press. In a recent circular to all Labour council groups, it claims current campaigns against a cabinet system are ``naïve, misinformed or mischievous''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That about says it all. The Minister, in her typical way, has managed to assemble against the provisions a rainbow alliance of the Conservative party, Charter 88, the Liberal Democrats, the newspaper editors and television channels, the LCOLG, the CPRE, the NUJ and others. The list is endless. All think that the Government are wrong. They think that it is nice of the Government to have tinkered with the evidence, but that it does not go far enough and that in any case these important matters should be in the Bill. We agree. We are delighted that the Liberal Democrats agree with us. We want to pursue our amendments and we support theirs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Sometimes, an element of surrealism intrudes on these discussions. We have used phrases today as though they were interchangeable. Hon. Members have spoken of ``access'', ``open'' and ``accountability'' as though all were different terms for the same thing. They are different things and we should be careful about the way in which we use them.

<P>
There is not the sharp dividing line between public and private discussions that is sometimes suggested. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales perhaps sits over his cornflakes with his wife and discusses the council agenda. By and large, I prefer breakfast in silence. If I have to converse, I tend not to talk about what will happen in the Select Committee because my wife would not be especially fascinated by it. It is not true that we can find legislative means by which people will not discuss things in private. Many forms may be discovered: one picks up the phone, or people drop into the office of the director of education or the chief executive as they go past. None of these are regulatable. It is a matter of choice whether we define them as part of the legislation-making process. We must be careful not to be prescriptive in the Bill so that people wanting intelligent discussion about the options will not be seen as contravening freedom-of-information principles.

<P>
I will illustrate that. We have often talked as though there are councillors on one side and the outside world on the other. I pay tribute to the Liberal Democrats, if they have managed to put together such tight-knit, politically disciplined meetings. I wish my party were a bit more disciplined in local government. Sometimes, the main complaints to me about the decision-taking process come from younger members of a party, who do not feel that the older members are consulting them. They often want more party discipline.

<P>
The problem with local government is that there is not enough politics in it. I should like to see considerably more politics in it; people would know better where where political parties stood. Then, fewer people would be inclined to sulk off and become either Liberals or Independents as soon as a decision went against them, which happens so often nowadays-all, of course, in pursuit of the highest moral principles. Mercifully, the highest moral principles tend not to last more than one electoral campaign.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We must not assume that public debate and open debate are the same thing; they are not. An argument can be presented in public, which makes it a public decision, but much of the input that led to that conclusion will have taken place behind closed doors-so it is not open, but public. We must take care in the terms that we use. Accountability is not synonymous with openness; it means holding someone to account for decisions that are taken.

<P>
The Cabinet, for example, has virtually ceased to exist. As many political commentators inform us, many of the Government's decisions are stitched together in Downing street in late-night shouting matches between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. The Cabinet as a decision-making structure does not perform the functions that it used to. The Cabinet Office structure, rather like the White House staff in America, has become much more important constitutionally. At the end of the day, it may all be accountable, but it cannot be described as an ``open'' system as we mean when we use the term in Committee.

<P>
Access is the most important concept. People require access to material that enables them to make an informed judgment on the policies pursued-in other words, the essential raw material that defines the options from which decisons are taken. We should not assume that the public and the press are necessarily interested in the same thing. I speak as a journalist.

<P>
By and large, the public are not interested in the process by which a decision is taken, but in what the decison is. In my constituency, for example, people might want to know about planning permission-or how to stop it-parking charges, school catchment areas and the allocation of school places. The appeals procedures governing allocation must necessarily take place in private because the individual performance of a child might be discussed. Road safety issues-particularly blind corners, kids crossing the street, lorries turning out of the auction mart into blind corners and so forth-are also likely to appear on the back pages of the Craven Herald & Pioneer and the Harrogate Advertiser. In comparison, the major political decisions rarely attract particular concerns.

<P>
In my experience, people are more concerned with outcomes and the press is more interested in process. Sadly, too, the press is much more interested in conflict. The argument is what makes the story. Irrespective of the rules impressed on a council, there will always be councillors who find it easy to talk to the local press. A story that such and such a councillor ``accuses'' or ``charges'' another is likely to result. As has been said, pay rises will always be a sexy issue. In Wales, as in Scotland, the issues will be whether they are going to build their new building. How many pay rises Members of the Scottish Parliament award themselves in the first Session will be another popular theme. That may not be a commentary on our maturity in understanding issues, but it is a fact of life that that is the sort of story that the press seeks.

<P>
When I was in office, I sometimes felt that the press moved beyond reporting the news towards creating the incidents on which the news was based. If I was not subjected to a riot at a fishing port, the press regarded that as an omission by the fishermen, who should have exposed me to the bombardment that is a Fisheries Minister's due. Equally, no matter how much a party says that a press conference during an election is about some issue, it is really about creating headlines from the first question onwards. Therefore, we must be careful about how we consider those terms and we must think about what people expect from a system that guarantees access.

<P>
I remember the periodic debate about the Council of Ministers, when a lot of absolute drivel was said about the Council meeting in public. I never came across a greater load of rubbish in my life. It met in public occasionally. The television came in, and each Minister made a nice formal statement for television consumption back home. There was no translation, so most people had not the faintest idea what others were saying. No doubt citizens back home were reassured that their Ministers were resolutely fighting for their national interest, defined rather extravagantly. However, we then had to make compromises to reach an acceptable outcome. That negotiation process is not easy to carry out in public.

<P>
Politicians often have fewer options than they would like. One often chooses from a relatively restrained menu, and although one would like to think that one has a blank sheet, one's actions are frequently defined narrowly. The citizen has the right to know that. A citizen wants to make an informed judgement based on knowledge not only of how nefarious politicians are, but of how restricted the options available are. Access to the essential information for the decision-making process is important.

<P>
Not all citizens will be interested. Queues rarely form for the meetings of Craven, North Yorkshire or Harrogate councils. Some people complain that their voice is not being heard when they make representations, often about planning issues, but by and large no all-consuming interest in proceedings is present. However, that does not make a lack of access legitimate. It is not important whether people want access; it is important only to ensure that access is not inhibited, and that the raw material that goes into the decision-making process is available.

<P>
The Minister asks us to trust her on the guidance. Governments increasingly rely on guidance. Given the arithmetic of the Committee, we have no choice but to trust her, so I hope that she will strike a sensible balance and ensure that people can reasonably argue an issue and find out what is practical, in a sensible environment. When decisions must be taken, the public must know why option A was chosen rather than option B and must be given access to information about how a proposal will work in principle.

<P>
I do not want to abuse your generosity, Mrs Michie, so I will mention only briefly the report on a Government decision relating to organophosphates published by the Select Committee on Agriculture today. None of us in the Committee disagreed with the decision; it was the decision-making process that was important in ensuring that people knew what the position was and why it had been adopted.

<P>
I support the case argued by the hon. Member for Bath and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. We need the assurance that the Government believe in the same things as us and in the logic of our proposals. When it comes to the crunch, it is a matter of how the Government supervise a sensible operation of the system to ensure that they can step in to stop any clear abuse, but equally on occasion to protect local authorities when difficult decisions have to be made. The ability to take a sensible decision might be compromised if there were occasions when they could not carefully consider those options and their implications.

<P>
We have no option at the end of the day but to trust the Minister, but she could enhance our trust considerably by accepting that we tabled the amendments in good faith and in a desire to nail matters down so that we all know where we stand.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I rise briefly to support the tail end of the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. The Minister fails to understand that the amendments are meant to be helpful in placing a situation before her, rather than aggressive. They are not meant as an attack on the system. As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, we have reached the point where there is a system that the Government would like to institute. We do not like it and we see it as flawed, but if it is to happen, we need some openness and an opportunity for the public and the media, through their councillors and directly, to help the scrutiny system, and in particular to have clear sight of the proposals and the details of how they were arrived at before a decision is made. They should be able to have a direct influence. The system being proposed by the Minister allows majority groups to block that opportunity for the public.

<P>
There may be flaws in the amendments, and they will be pointed out to us if they have not already been, but the essence of what we are trying to say is reflected in the scurry that the Minister has had, meeting Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all from the media, pressure groups and so on. She has issued draft guidances followed by more draft guidances. I hear from the local authorities that they have been flooded and are becoming more confused. However, I suspect that that indicates that the difference between us may not be as great as it would appear.

<P>
The Opposition believe that the present system is a seamless and open system. I accept that the Minister does not share that belief. We shall have to agree to disagree, and she has the power of the vote to ram through her system. There will always be secret meetings, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and others have said. They are not meant to be secret. They may be the bath meetings in the rugby football club. I am glad I am not a member of the Liberal Democrat party just in case that ever became a generalised proposal. Whatever the party in power, there will always be such meetings, and the Opposition party or parties, equally, will have the same sorts of meetings. The present system then goes through a series of stages where there is scrutiny-I know that the Minister argues about the value of it-and an opportunity for the public and the media to put pressure on members on both sides, if the council is divided, or on all members, if it is not. People can put their case and question officials.

<P>
In the proposed system there is an opportunity, in spite of the wads of guidance and the wads of regulations to come, for some authorities, or some majority groups on the authorities, to follow the pattern that I set out in an intervention on the hon. Member for Bath. It is possible for them to ratify a decision with minimal papers, minimal presentation and minimal discussion, and to pass it on down through to the scrutiny committee, which will probably be whipped or at least heavily influenced by patronage. The media and the public may not have their questions answered and may not see the details. They may not feel that their concerns have been taken into account or that the method of decision making and the thinking of the councillors and officers have been clarified.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that exactly what he has described is possible under the current system? He may not accept that we are trying to unpack that, but what he has described is absolutely possible.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I accept that it is possible, but there are ways in which the public can come back on it, and the media and the public are able to do that under the present system, with deputations and so forth to the committee, and to put pressure on individuals. They can be present at the meeting when a decision is made to find out whether the councillors are responding to pressure upon them. That would not apply if it were a secret decision at a secret meeting.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman explored that matter in a little more detail. I believe-and I think that he believes-that the ability of the public to attend the meeting and to see the decision-making process will put such pressure on the decision makers to ensure that they do not rush it through. Lest people believe that Ripon council as described by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is usual, is he aware that research reveals that about 40 per cent. of councils report an average attendance of 10 or more members of the public and in London nearly 90 per cent. of councils now report that they have 10 or more members of the public attending their meetings. The public do attend for the big decisions.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am horrified to find such a rapid measure of agreement. I agree with the hon. Member for Bath and I am surprised, as his numbers are quite low. I can remember introducing some of my more controversial measures and having 3,000 attendees outside, waving banners. The fact that most of them did not live in the local area and were bused in with signs saying, ``Socialist Workers party'' and so on was always revealing. If I may digress for a moment, I should thank the Evening Standard photographer who regularly photographed the crowd outside and made sure that every Evening Standard reader knew exactly who was there. They were nothing to do with the local area and the local meeting. However, when the election came along and the majority for the Conservatives went from one to 35 or 36, it was clear that the decision that was made openly was accepted locally as the right decision, possibly aided and abetted by the photographer from the Evening Standard.

<P>
There is little difference between us on the aims and intentions, but I do not think that the Minister understands the deep-down concerns-not just here but outside in the real world, among the officers and the members-and the fact that all the regulations and so on will not at the end of the day give us the openness that we have now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I did not intend to speak on clause 21, especially after the tour de force of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. However, the Minister's comments and her refusal to let myself and other members of the Committee intervene made me want to contribute.

<P>
One has the impression from the Minister that if anybody, certainly from the Opposition Benches, wants to raise a point in scrutiny of the Bill-let us remember that this Committee is a scrutiny committee-it is instantly dismissed. It is not seen as valid. It is not relevant to the discussion that the Minister wants us to have. That does not bode well for the future functions of those scrutiny committees that the Bill is promoting.

<P>
When the Minister said earlier that she had been having meetings in the past few days with various lobby groups, we in no way wanted to criticise that. Many of those meetings were held-perfectly legitimately-in secret. That was not the point that I was seeking to challenge. However, when the Minister claims that so much has been changed and when so much appears in the press about whether the Government will back down or not, one would expect at the very least that the Minister would make a statement to clarify exactly where we are. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne wanted the Minister to speak first.

<P>
I have been involved in many Standing Committees on much more detailed Bills, in particular the Finance Bill and the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which set up the Financial Services Authority, and I give credit to the Ministers for having the courtesy to update Committee members about what was going on with some fast-moving events. If the Minister has had meetings and an open-door policy and if she has been prepared to listen to the lobby groups with legitimate concerns across the whole political spectrum-councillors, politicians, people from the media and environmental lobby groups-why have the Government not tabled a single amendment to clause 21 at this stage? Why have all the amendments resulting from the concerns that have been raised been tabled by Opposition Members, in contrast to the scores of Government amendments that litter virtually every other clause? That is why we raised the matters that we did. If those on the Government Front Bench want to be taken seriously as performing within a scrutiny Committee, the Minister should perhaps be prepared to listen to our arguments rather more seriously than she has done this morning.

<P>
The whole point of the amendments to clause 21 comes down to a debate that took place in 1960. A quote from the Franks committee report is as relevant today as it was then. It was quoted by Mrs Thatcher, as she then was, in her maiden speech, when she was introducing her Bill: She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Publicity is the greatest victory and most effective check against any arbitrary action.-[Official Report, 5 February 1960; Vol. 616, c. 1351.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that most members of the Committee would agree with that. Lady Thatcher went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>publicity stimulates the interest of local persons in local government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that Committee members would be united in agreeing with that statement. Judging from the Minister's comments, we are all in favour of increasing the publicity given to the work of local government. We want people to be able to see what goes on in local government, because the aim of this legislation, as we all agree, is to make people more interested in local government and to make them feel that it is responsible for their area and is responsive and relevant to them. We all acknowledge the problem that has caused such low and reducing turn-outs in local elections. Our aims are largely the same, therefore, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said; it is the way that we achieve the solution that is different.

<P>
The crux of the issue is in subsection (2), which would leave it to local authority executives to decide what is open to the public and what is not. Will less scrupulous councillors, of which there have been too many examples, use that option to get round the system rather than make it more transparent? The amendments would provide only that the openness of meetings to the public and the press should not be forced in every single instance. The norm should be that such meetings should be open and, as at the moment, the executive should be able to use the exemptions as specified in earlier Acts for sensitive issues, where access to the public and the press would not be beneficial.

<P>
Those provisions were outlined in Margaret Thatcher's Bill in 1960 and they remain relevant today. She also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>when the Press is excluded it must be because of some particular reason arising from the proceedings of the local authority at the time, and there must be a very good reason for the exclusion. The real reason for excluding the Press is that publicity of the matter to be discussed would be prejudicial to the public interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She gave as examples cases where discussions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may relate to personal circumstances of individual electors  to a confidential communication from a Government Department  to staff matters  to legal proceedings, to contracts, the discussion of which tenders to accept and other such matters.-[Official Report, 5 February 1960; Vol.616, c.1354.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No one disputes that. Those exemptions still apply today and we are fully in favour of them. That is not the issue. We are not saying that absolutely everything that might compromise the ability of the council to go about its business must be subject to public and press scrutiny at sensitive stages, particularly when there are legal implications.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne said, there is criticism of the Government's intentions across all parties, pressure groups, lobby groups and the media. It started in the report of the joint Select Committee, at paragraphs 176 and 177, where the thrust was to recommend openness along the current lines of access to the press and public.

<P>
My right hon. and hon. Friends have spoken about the amount of coverage that the clause has gained. The CPRE has been mentioned, but not the Local Government Information Unit, which claimed that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Bill will be strengthened by stronger requirements on access to information and decision making.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is our aim. We are not trying to undermine the Bill, although the Minister is too ready to accuse us of that when we suggest constructive and positive amendments. We want to strengthen the Bill and, more importantly, the perception of the public that the changes will be for good.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon mentioned instances where the queue outside Craven district council for council meetings is thin. That is the reverse of my experience when local issues such as the siting of a waste incinerator, the closure of a school playground or changes to the refuse collection system are on the agenda. All of a sudden, when key, high-profile matters that affect many people in their everyday lives are being discussed, the public take a strong interest, manifesting this by turning up to meetings to see what happens. If they are excluded from the early stages of such discussions, their scepticism about being able to influence them must be heightened.

<P>
The problem with the turn-out at councils these days is largely due to the fact that many members of the public do not understand what local councils actually do. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon mentioned several of the functions of the local council. In fact, he also mentioned county councils and district councils in the same breath. As I am sure that all hon. Members find that many electors do not know which council is responsible for the schooling of their children and which for picking up their refuse. Many people believe that such things as local hospitals, the national health service and where they get their social security benefits are also the responsibility of the councils. There is much confusion.

<P>
We need to ensure that people are in tune with where decisions on different matters are made. If we try to exclude them from the early stages of the decision-making process, they will feel even more annoyed and let down by local government. If we are not careful, as a result of the Government's proposed measures, people will see local government as even more remote and they will take less interest in finding out for which of the activities affecting their everyday lives it is responsible.

<P>
Across the whole gamut there have been objections to the proposals in clause 21. Hon. Members have mentioned many examples already, but there are others. The Newcastle Evening Chronicle, to which I spoke, and which has also been reported in The Guardian, has been running ``open-them-up campaigns''. It has seen the opaqueness with which executives threaten to operate.
<P>
