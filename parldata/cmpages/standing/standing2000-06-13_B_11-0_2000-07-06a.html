<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 33, line 40, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Save in Part IV and section 62 of this Act and in section 51 of the 1998 Act, in the Police Acts ``efficiency and effectiveness'' includes impartiality and having regard to international human rights standards on policing.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have all argued that the policing service in Northern Ireland should be efficient and effective, but we would like to ensure that it is also impartial. It is especially important to emphasise impartiality in the Bill in the context of our divided society and its divisions on policing. The inclusion of such criteria will enable those who are served by the police-the public-to make a proper judgment and assessment. Indeed, it would be useful for the police to assess their own performance through a power to judge efficiency, effectiveness, impartiality and regard to international human rights standards. The amendment would add the word ``impartiality'' in most places where efficiency and effectiveness are mentioned. Clause 2(2) is a good example of a provision into which the term ``impartiality'' should be inserted, as it deals with the general function of the Policing Board in relation to the police, support staff and traffic wardens.

<P>
I accept that the term ``impartiality'' is not applicable or does not make sense in some circumstances. Having considered the matter, we accept that it would not be appropriate to make changes such as those that are proposed in part IV, which deals with efficiency and effectiveness provisions in relation to the Policing Board, or in section 62 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, which makes the Secretary of State responsible for ensuring ``efficiency and effectiveness''. In addition, such an amendment would not be appropriate in section 51 of the 1998 Act, which relates to the police ombudsman.

<P>
I emphasise the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>having regard to international human rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because it is most important that such standards should be incorporated into Northern Ireland domestic law. They have not been, but they certainly should be incorporated into police law.

<P>
Many people have expressed concern that the introduction of those matters would give rise to court proceedings and so on, but we doubt that it will. The relevant words of the amendment are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>having regard to international human rights standards on policing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The best counsel that I have received indicates that it would not lead to an enormous amount of litigation, but it would enable the police service to take measures to apply appropriate international standards.

<P>
There may be some surprise at this, but I refer the Committee to the implementation plan and to recommendation 4, under which the Chief Constable instructs his officers about the implications of the Human Rights Act 1998 and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the wider context of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The UN declaration is not part of domestic law, but the Chief Constable will be instructing his officers, in the wider context, about its implications. It is a minor but important step to apply that principle generally, so that all the policing agencies have regard to international human rights standards on policing. That would place human rights at the centre of the police service. It is a reasonable, proper and important amendment.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth) </B>As my hon. Friend the Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) made clear, amendment No. 291 would require that any reference to police efficiency and effectiveness, with one or two exceptions, shall be taken to include impartiality and<P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>having regard to international human rights standards on policing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have said on numerous occasions that they wholeheartedly agree that human rights should be at the core of policing. I doubt whether any other police force in the world could be so human rights-based as the Bill's proposals will make the new police service.

<P>
I said during the Committee's fourth sitting that the Government would look at ways of reflecting the principle of impartiality in the Bill. I hope that we shall be able to do so on Report, but my hon. Friend will appreciate that the timetable is now very tight. We are not clear what is meant by international human rights. However, all domestic legislation must conform with the international human rights instruments to which the Government are a signatory. Those referred to by my hon. Friend are included.

<P>
My hon. Friend referred also to the implementation plan. The section dealing with human rights and the recommendations that relate to it apply just as much to domestic legislation. That is why they are included. They are there partly because of Patten, but the monitoring of the implementation of the proposals will inevitably be based on normal international human rights standards, which we take to be an obligation in the application of all domestic legislation.

<P>
We have also noted that Patten talks in paragraph 4.8 specifically about instilling the European convention on human rights in policing arrangements. My hon. Friend is aware that we attach great importance to that aim in the Bill, as he does, and that there has been training within the RUC.

<P>
My hon. Friend is also aware that the new oath will require officers to uphold fundamental human rights. We will consider ways of applying that measure to serving officers. Clause 2 requires the board to monitor the performance of the police force in complying with the Human Rights Act 1998. Clause 53 requires that reports issued by the Board include an assessment of the performance of the police in complying with the 1998 Act. There is also the code of ethics under clause 48, which we have said that we will strengthen. It is clear that officers will have to adhere to the principle of impartiality and that they will have to conduct their duties in compliance with the 1998 Act. I repeat: we are prepared to make the formal point even more explicit. On that basis, having given that undertaking in good faith, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Minister has divided the amendment in two. One part deals with the requirement for impartiality to be firmly and visibly expressed and he said that that requirement would be subject to an amendment on Report. On the question of human rights, I was somewhat surprised that it was permissible for the Chief Constable to instruct his officers on the European convention on human rights but that it was not possible for the Bill to note that that was good and desirable. There seems to be a contradiction. The subject's absence from the Bill and its rejection by the Government might suggest that the Chief Constable was acting at variance. However, having heard the Minister's undertaking regarding impartiality and his comments on human rights, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 33, leave out lines 41 to 43.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Amendments Nos. 59, 60 and, to an extent, 61 are predicated on new clause 1 and are amendments of omission to facilitate the implementation of that new clause. Indeed, amendments Nos. 289 and 290 to schedule 6 are also consequential on new clause 1 being acceptable to the Committee, as I hope it will.

<P>
New clause 1 concerns the naming of the new police service in Northern Ireland. It may have been inevitable, but it has certainly been unfortunate, that the publicity and media attention about recent change in Northern Ireland have concentrated almost entirely on the name of the police service. I do not want to deny or diminish the importance of that issue, but it has clouded the reality that the great majority of Patten's recommendations on structural change were what most of the population wanted. The failure fully to recognise or embrace that fact has enabled those who want to rewrite or remake Patten to escape from the criticisms and requests for justification of their attitudes by concentrating their anti-Patten propaganda on what is, properly, an emotive issue-the RUC name.

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The structural changes are, in our mind, not a threat but an opportunity for a new beginning of a new service for all-not an old service for some. I still fear, because of the attitude that has been taken to many parts of the Patten report, which have been omitted or amended beyond recognition, that there will be difficulty over it. In concentrating on the issue of the name, an attempt has been made to remake Patten in many ways. It will be a terrible pity if this opportunity to set up a comprehensive new police service is missed. It could mean missed opportunities for police and citizens.

<P>
I must speak cautiously: the issue of the police service raises the deepest emotions and has been used opportunistically by some. Furthermore, many of those who most value the RUC and many of those who feel connected with it through family, by suffering and grievous loss, feel that to change the name is to deny or diminish all the accumulated pain suffered over the 30 years. My intention in commending the new clause is not to do that.

<P>
What informs my party's approach, and the purpose of the new clause, is the desire to learn from the pain that has been suffered. Aeschylus, the Greek philosopher, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In our sleep, pain, that cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own time, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
After the pain of the past 30 years, I hope that wisdom has come from the lessons learnt. We who live in the north of Ireland can see a lot of it all around us-not all the time, and perhaps not so much in the headlines of the past week, but generally, we perceive a thrust forward in learning from past mistakes and sufferings. We have learnt the wisdom of negotiation, the wisdom of entering Government, the wisdom to end violence and, I hope and pray, the wisdom to change the policing service. I think that that has been accepted, if not agreed. People, when asked, may say that they do not agree with change, but accept it, because of the importance of what it will give. A growing number of people in the communities and in the police know that change, both symbolic and structural, is needed and that the police should be known by a name other than the RUC.

<P>
The international commission's report outlines the arguments for the change and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many people from the Irish Nationalist and republican traditions regard the name  of the RUC as associating the police with the British constitution and state. This contributes to a perception that the police are not their police. On the other hand, many people in Northern Ireland from the Unionist tradition consider it perfectly natural that a service provided and funded by the state should signal its provenance. The problem is that the name of the RUC  has become politicised  In Northern Ireland, where the constitutional aspirations of the inhabitants conflict, the use of words  to associate the police with one side of the constitutional argument must inevitably go some way to inhibiting the whole hearted participation in policing of those who espouse the other side of that argument.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The report was specific. It said that the new beginning for policing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>cannot be achieved unless the reality that part of the community feels unable to identify with the present name<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is addressed. It explained:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our proposals seek to achieve a situation in which people can  all regard the police service as their own,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and went on to say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>While we have not accepted the argument that the Royal Ulster Constabulary should be disbanded, it should henceforth be named the Northern Ireland Police Service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the argument advanced by Patten. It is unambiguous and unqualified. That is the reasonable Patten-compelling, clear and certain. The Government should be equally clear, certain and unambiguous. We accept the Government's preferred name-the Police Service of Northern Ireland-but we can accept no less than that.

<P>
I have outlined the principles that informed our decisions and the Patten report, but what are the politics of the issue? What does the name Police Service of Northern Ireland say to my community and the wider community of Northern Ireland? It says that the police service, for all its individual diversity, needs to be corporately neutral, especially in a divided society in which the division has developed to the point of conflict and beyond. It says to me that the police service needs to be symbolically and substantially impartial and independent, with a requirement to uphold the law and human rights. It is an invitation to my community to give its allegiance and offer its membership. It is a declaration of intent that the practice of the police force of the past, some of which heavily and happily identified with the constitutional position of the Union and with the political practice of Unionism, is not how a police service of the future should conduct its affairs. It says that this police service is in the ownership of all and not just the majority.

<P>
I want to take the politics of the issue further. I know that many people who defend the name Royal Ulster Constabulary do so genuinely-I have said that before-but it is wrong and irresponsible aggressively to position the issue of the name in such a way as to fail to address the wider concerns of the nationalists or to recognise our strong argument and the need for principled change. By concentrating on that one issue, it is possible to avoid tackling the need for a broader and deeper change in policing and related issues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): Is not the hon. Gentleman rehearsing a tired and hackneyed argument that we have already covered? Does he not agree that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland was determined by both traditions in the Belfast agreement? Is he suggesting that a police service-whether or not it is called the RUC-can function without giving allegiance to the constitution on which we have all agreed?

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman-I think-for his intervention. I do not mind using tired and hackneyed arguments; I shall continue to use them, as long as I believe them to be right.

<P>
I throw back the tired and hackneyed ball to the hon. Gentleman, who constantly confuses the constitutional issue with the naming of the police service. The Good Friday agreement recognised the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, which would remain as long as the majority so wished it. As I have said time amd again, that is correct, that is what we endorsed, that is what we agreed to, and that is what we believe. It is nothing whatever to do with the naming of the police service.

<P>
T.E. Lawrence-Lawrence of Arabia-spoke about remaking the new world in the image of the old. The hon. Gentleman wants the new police service to be the image of the old one. We are trying to keep to the spirit of Patten. We understand that the Government have a difficult political equation to work out, but they have not behaved very responsibly in the matter.

<P>
Most people in Northern Ireland accept the need for the change of name, although they may not agree with it. If people are asked if they agree, they will say no; but if it is there, they will accept it.

<P>
The Government do not appreciate how profound the issue is in my community and what the consequences could be if they get it wrong. They do not seem to hear what we are saying. The ability of my party to participate in the new policing structure will depend on what comes out of the Bill and on how the new service is constituted. Some people want to make changes that are neither the image nor the making of Patten, and I hope that they will not win the day in Committee.

<P>
The amendment is word for word from the original clause 1 in the first draft of the Bill, before it was erased and purged, and evaporated into clear air. We borrowed the Government's words to show Patten's intentions before other factors influenced them. If the Bill reflected what Patten intended, some might not have felt so strongly and been so aggressive in our debates today.

<P>
The Bill does not reflect what Patten intended; it is not Patten as we understood it and as it needed to be to resolve the problems in policing.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): The Committees may know that I colour-code the amendments and will have seen that this is my party's last blast in Committee. Not even our worst enemy would accuse us of having overly detained the Committee, but we have reached a matter that is extraordinarily important to my party.

<P>
I accept that I speak as an Englishman and a Conservative; I hope, however, that that will not discount the strength of our views, because it is central to our belief that Northern Ireland is part of the country of which we are also citizens-the United Kingdom.

<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 156 and new clause 9 are in the same group. My remarks relate mainly to new clause 9 and incidentally to amendment No. 156, so I shall detain the Committee but once on the two measures.

<P>
Patten's proposals to rid the Royal Ulster Constabulary of its proud name and cap badge are the most controversial of the entire report. They are wholly without justification and have caused significant hurt and anger. As the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No-one should underestimate the great hurt that altering the title of the RUC will cause to my members, to past members, to injured members, to their families and to bereaved families. I understand the feelings of my members because I share those feelings.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We profoundly disagree with the assertion that the police service should be entirely free of any association with the symbols of the state, especially when acceptance of the Belfast agreement means acceptance of the legitimacy of Northern Ireland's constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom.

<P>
As the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee put it in its report on the ``Composition, Recruitment and Training of the RUC'' in 1998:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Until there is a change in the status of Northern Ireland, inevitably many of the symbols of Government will be British.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is one of which those who have served in the force are justly proud. It is a name granted by royal charter. The Patten report offers no convincing evidence to support scrapping the royal title, because no such evidence exists. As one of the police authority's most recent surveys concluded, it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will cause major offence in the Protestant community but will not lead to significant improvements in support for the Police among Catholics.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That fear was echoed recently by the Chief Constable:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If we are to endure this great hurt proposed then I hope the gains envisaged are demonstrable and achievable. I don't see the concrete evidence that that will be so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the proposal is all pain with very little gain.

<P>
Why abolish the name, when all the evidence suggests that it is not the overwhelming problem that critics of the force claim? As an opinion poll in the Belfast Telegraph in April showed, 61 per cent. of Catholics in Northern Ireland had no difficulty with the name of the RUC. When the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee examined the issue two years ago, it recommended that the name be kept. As it convincingly argued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no clear reason to make a special case for the RUC<P>
</UL></FONT>
by changing its name, without changing the names of other organisations which are also either ``Royal'' or ``British''. The official symbols associated with the force are not central to the status of the RUC in the eyes of the community. They attract the loyalty of many in Northern Ireland. There is no good reason to change them.
<P>
The inescapable conclusion is that the decision to drop the royal title is intended to appeal to a minority of a minority who have never supported the police and who, in all honesty, are unlikely ever to support any police force other than one that they themselves control.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lembit Öpik </B>(Montgomeryshire): What is the hon. Gentleman's rationale for believing that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> We are now in a philosophical realm. I am not sure whether, generically, beliefs and rationalisations necessarily live alongside each other. It is my opinion.

<P>
As the chairman of the Police Federation, Mr. Les Rodgers, put it recently:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The loss of our proud name is a concession to the leaders of the bitterly competing nationalist political parties. It is a vindictive demand by the nationalist politicians seeking to outdo each other in inflicting hurt and destroying our collective self-esteem.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was his opinion. This proposal in Patten does not have widespread support throughout the community and should be looked at again. In January, the same Mr. Les Rodgers delivered a petition to the Prime Minister containing 400,000 names of people opposed to changing the name, cap badge and symbols of the force.

<P>
The Bill currently defers a decision on the new name of the police service and leaves the final decision to the Secretary of State, who said in the House in January that he rejected the Patten proposal to rename the force the Northern Ireland Police Service and preferred Police Service of Northern Ireland. For some time, we have advocated a title that incorporates the RUC alongside a new name for the force. We have been supported by many distinguished figures including Monsignor Denis Faul. We have the support of the Northern Ireland Police Federation.

<P>
In its formal response to Patten, the current Police Authority said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend therefore that the current arrangement whereby the police have a dual title should prevail with the term Northern Ireland Police Service being given greater prominence by the police than at present.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 156 achieves that. It builds on the current arrangement as set out in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, which established the Northern Ireland Police Service and merely replaces that with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It makes it clear that for all operational and working purposes, the force could be known as the RUC or the police service.

<P>
The Secretary of State has stated in the House on a number of occasions recently that it should be possible to incorporate the name of the RUC into what he calls the title deeds of the newly renamed force to emphasise that the RUC is not being disbanded and to recognise the links between the RUC and the new police service. Our amendment provides the opportunity to do just that. It enables the proud name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to stand alongside the working title Police Service of Northern Ireland. We look forward to the Government's support, but if they do not support us we will have to return to this on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) for his comments. Although I tabled new clause 8, I support new clause 9, which he tabled. I shall in a moment compare the two and explain the reasoning behind mine. I find it not a little depressing that the hon. Member for South Down-I do not pick on him personally, but address my remarks to his party-cannot live up to the spirit and letter of the Belfast agreement. I was rather surprised that he concurred so easily with my description of his philosophy as tired and hackneyed. That is what it is-not in any commendable sense, but in the worst sense. His speech would have done justice to one by Eddie McAteer before the demise of the old Nationalist party in Northern Ireland. It smacked of late 19th-century narrow nationalism. It almost smacked of sectarianism. That is exceedingly worrying at this time in our history.

<P>
If I have read aright the contributions from SDLP members over the past weeks, and particularly today, I must conclude that they reject policing in an effective sense. They reject flags that are part of any nation's expression. They reject emblems. They reject freedom for people to do what people normally do. I am thinking particularly of the right of people to walk and to demonstrate their affinity with organisations or causes along the Queen's highway.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I certainly will shortly, but let me first develop my reason for making these assertions. They are serious assertions and I feel that the hon. Gentleman should consider them before he is prompted to react. I can cast my mind back to 1969, when the civil rights movement, in which he was active, wanted people to be able to express their identity, their culture, their aspirations in a tangible way by walking and demonstrating to show what they believed in and what they felt. That was a mere 30 years ago, so we can see how the hon. Gentleman's memory has failed with the ageing process.

<P>
Today, other cultural or traditional organisations are deprived of the right to walk the Queen's highway. We find ourselves in the dreadful situation that we found ourselves in 30 years ago, when thugs took over in the wake of the confrontation and opposition over civil and religious liberty. The hon. Gentleman's party can concentrate only on what it does to deny the police their identity, their pride, their history and their ability to deal with what any police force is intended to deal with-the maintenance of law and order and the protection of our society. I want to quote the hon. Gentleman accurately. He said that if there were ``an ability by my party to participate'', things must be done his way. He implied that there was no alternative.

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
There are two traditions in Northern Ireland. Irrespective of whether there are two or 22 traditions, 90 per cent. of our society do not give tuppence for the hon. Gentleman's argument or mine. They want the Committee to produce, through the Bill, a police service that has confidence in itself and is not demeaned, held up to ridicule or denied its traditions or identity. What a surprise that he and his party-who place so much emphasis on their tradition, culture, identity, civil and human rights-would so constrain the people in the front line against criminality as to deny them the same. If that is not a manifestation of old, narrow, tired and hackneyed nationalism, tell me what is.

<P>
One of our great regrets is that, when we heard several years ago that the Chief Constable was carrying out a fundamental review, we did not demand to see the detail of it. That review was flawed. Perhaps 90 per cent. of its recommendations about a new police service-which might emerge if parties such as the SDLP permit it-were not flawed. However, it appeared-as it was leaked-to be apologetic when no apology was required. That was the weakness of the Chief Constable's approach. Let us not forget that Patten and other members of his commission played on and developed that. That was the thin end of the wedge.

<P>
I regret the fact that people whom the Chief Constable consulted and who were privy to what he said-as members of this Committee were not-were not more alert to the way in which their generosity, foresight and perhaps weakness would be exploited.

<P>
The Police Federation has been cited, and I do not disagree with the hon. Member for Solihull's selective quotations. The federation and the Police Superintendents Association took part in the fundamental review. It appears that they lacked any appreciation of the narrow political selfishness that would be used to interpret their proposals. However, we cannot rewrite history. Consider the contrast of the past few days when we have turned on our televisions and heard the name of the Ulster Freedom Fighters-a bunch of terrorist thugs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Flying Union Jacks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be ashamed of his national flag because someone abuses it, but I am not. I simply deplore the fact that some people abuse the flag. The hon. Gentleman's sedentary comments are not helpful.

<P>
The UFF has been liberally quoted on television. That is no different from liberally quoting the Irish Republican Army, the Loyalist Volunteer Force or any other bunch of thugs who have held our society to ransom for 30 years. RUC officers stood between those thugs and the greater number of people in the law-abiding community, yet they are to be demeaned, humiliated and almost wiped away, as though their service counted for naught. The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) may shake his head, but his earlier remark betrayed his sympathies, which is unfortunate.

<P>
Although I tabled new clause 8, I would prefer new clause 9 to be part of the Bill. New clause 9 secures no more than the entitlement of those people who, for 30 years, sacrificed life, limb and peace of mind to protect society. However, I know the reality. The Chief Constable is acquiescent. Other people are publicly less acquiescent, but not significantly so. I know that Patten is to be the order of the day, by and large. God help us all when we try to deal with our mafia sub-culture in the way that he proposed.

<P>
There is no generosity on the part of those with whom my colleagues and I will have to work to try to make Northern Ireland a better place to live. We must face up to the reality that the RUC will continue to police, however damaged, undermined and demeaned it may be. The RUC will continue, and I hope that its success, its training, its ethos and its attitude will be maintained, although I gravely fear for the latter.

<P>
In commending new clause 8, I want to ensure that the body of constables known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary shall continue as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no perfect way of doing it and one cannot rewrite history, but I am trying, with new clause 8, to find a way to tell those who are left that we in this place and many of those whom they serve will acknowledge who they are. They should not, as the SDLP wants, operate in limbo as a neutral group.

<P>
It is a wonderful thing that we do not have the power to make people transparent. If we could, the SDLP would want the police service to be transparent. Sadly, there is little transparency in what the SDLP represents today. It lacks the courage that I had come to expect during the more difficult years. When people were being killed by terrorists, I saw evidence of courage among the SDLP. Now, when we come to the philosophy of moving Northern Ireland forward, that generosity has disappeared.

<P>
I commend new clause 8 to the Committee. We have discussed the matter with the Government, and I believe that they have a responsibility to table a parallel amendment on Report to deal with the RUC reserve. I believe that other amendments are contingent upon the lead amendment being accepted. Not only new clause 8 but many of the other amendments in this group deal with the matter. If that body of constables is to have any confidence in the support that they receive from the Government, from their command structure and from society, we need to start here and tell them that we are not about to demean them by something other than disbandment. We are talking about the members of the RUC. Whatever we call them, they will be the same people tomorrow, with the same degree of professionalism and impartiality, despite the political campaigns that have been waged against them.

<P>
As I said to a journalist the other day, those who want to judge the RUC against any other constabulary, on these islands or further afield-to judge how it deals with people, whether terrorists or ordinary members of society-should do a head count of deaths in custody in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years. A comparison of that remarkably low figure with that for any other constabulary gives one an idea about the professionals of whom we have been speaking.

<P>

<B>Mr. McWalter: The Royal Ulster Constabulary is not demeaned, contrary to what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone </B>(Mr. Maginnis) said, by the suggestion that its name be changed. Were it not for the extraordinary courage and determination of that body over many years, we should not now be able to contemplate the extraordinary change in policing that the Bill proposes and which is absolutely necessary.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone asks us to judge the Royal Ulster Constabulary against any other constabulary. It would emerge very well from such a comparison. However, it has much greater need to change radically than any other constabulary. That is not particularly because of recent events. The Committee has already noted that the Hunt report of 1969 described the ethos of the Royal Ulster Constabularly as militaristic. No one claims that that was its fault. An exceptional organisation was developed for an extraordinary problem. The men and women who served in the RUC did so with great distinction and courage while they tackled the dreadful problems that are still in existence today.

<P>
We can change the RUC in a radical way. The Bill contains dozens of ways of achieving that. However, none of that would matter a jot or a fig if we did not change the name. The people we want to join the RUC, to end the perception of it as a force representing one interest rather than another, will not know of our hundred amendments and our detailed deliberations. They will want to know whether a discontinuity of significance has taken place; that the force that the Hunt report described as militaristic is now a normalised police force or service-or at least that it is undergoing that change towards normality. That is the nettle that the Bill grasps.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but part of the problem is that the Patten commission envisaged the changes coming about when the nature of policing was changing because of the knock-on consequences of establishing the executive. As we saw on the streets of Belfast last night and at Drumcree, the type of policing in Northern Ireland is, through no fault of the police, what the hon. Gentleman wants to avoid. The police cannot implement the changes that he wants. Is there not a danger that we are concentrating too much on the issue of the name?

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is genuinely trying to achieve a meeting of minds, but the difference between Government and Opposition Members is that we believe that the move towards a normalised police force can help to bring about the changes in society that are desperately needed. It has causal efficacy and is not merely a reflection of an agreed and settled state.

<P>
I sat on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that first decided to inquire into the RUC. Its deliberations were referred to by the hon. Member for Solihull. Select Committees seek consensus. Membership of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee ranged from members of the Democratic Unionist party to people who might be regarded as the loony left of the Labour party. The Committee agreed unanimously to inquire into the RUC. That took courage, particularly from those people of a Unionist persuasion who often thought that the police service was in order.

<P>
Simply to conduct a Select Committee inquiry precipitates change in the objects that are under investigation. For instance, the Committee's debate on gas services in Northern Ireland dramatically changed the way in which those services were supplied. That principle was particularly true of the RUC. Committee members understood the need for radical change. We saw the development of new inclusive training programmes. Those of us who believed that the name of the RUC would have to change asked the Chief Constable whether he thought it necessary. He was strongly of the view that it was not and that his members would not hear of it. In the interests of consensus and as part of our desire to have a unanimous report, we decided not to recommend a change in the name. We needed some agreement before that was possible, but that is not to say that we recommended that the name stay the same. No Labour Member would have done that. Although we thought that a change in name was desirable, we decided to give in and not press it. However, at the last minute, the Committee divided when the Ulster Unionists or people on the Orange Order side sprang a couple of late Divisions on us. That made some Committee members feel rather cheated, as we had given way on the main business only to find that there would be Divisions on the issue of flying flags.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I interrupt the hon. Gentleman only to ask how the Orange Order has suddenly come into his remarks, in relation to my party. He will know that some members of my party are members of the Orange Order, whereas others are not. How on earth did the Orange Order come into what had been a logical point? Did the hon. Gentleman introduce it into his argument with the intention of raising emotions?

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I did not raise the temperature and I was not aware that membership of the Orange Order was something of which people were ashamed. The amendment was moved by an hon. Member who specifically told us that he was a member of the Orange Order and I have no reason to believe that anything that goes on in relation to that name is disreputable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to finish this point? The fact is that the general orientation and the view of the RUC that I described was and is held by members of the Orange Order. Perfectly legitimately, an amendment came from that quarter, but it divided a Select Committee that had unanimously agreed to the inquiry and to almost every recommendation, but that which was then taken apart in the Division Lobbies at the last minute on the issue of flags and insignia.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is now becoming mischievous. He is attributing to me things that he has no right to attribute to me. I am not ashamed of the Orange Order. I am not a member of it, but that is slightly different. I merely asked the hon. Gentleman why he introduced the Orange Order into his remarks, when it had nothing to do with his argument. If the hon. Gentleman and all Labour Members came to a conclusion in order the achieve consensus in a Select Committee, should not he have the courage and integrity to stick to his guns now, when we are debating a matter that reaches far beyond the Select Committee and out into the society that I represent? Why does he not seek consensus rather than confrontation?

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I think that there has been a misunderstanding, as I did not intend to impugn anybody. I am deeply disappointed that the Select Committee divided on the issues that I have mentioned, and some of its members felt somewhat betrayed. The hon. Gentleman has strong convictions on the matter, but the fact is that we were determined to ensure change and restructuring in the police service. Indeed, it did change and evolve during and after the inquiry. It developed towards what I hope that the Bill encapsulates: a non-militarised police service, or a change from a police force to a police service. I maintain my strong conviction that that is what is right for all communities, if it is at all achievable. The Select Committee report cannot be taken out of that context. We were trying to change the way in which policing was done and were contributing to that process. At that time, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 was already in force, but it is different from the Bill, which builds on progress that has been made in the police service by the Government and, crucially, through the Belfast agreement, which makes possible a new order of policing that was previously impossible. To work with conviction and determination towards an accommodation with which all sides can be satisfied is not welching on one's principles, but pursuing the principle that all sides need to be taken into account.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will reject those who say that the change of title is unimportant or that we should somehow emphasise strongly the continuity between the new policing service and the old one. We should emphasise the discontinuity, not to demean the RUC but as a tribute to the work that it has done to make a normalised police force possible and as a tribute to the fact that a peaceful society in Northern Ireland is possible.

<P>
Crucially, only a change in the name will make those of a nationalist persuasion be of the view that we no longer have a police service in Northern Ireland that serves just one part of the community but we have a police service that definitely is oriented to serving the whole community.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): My name is third on the list of the hon. Members who tabled new clause 9 but first on the list of the hon. Members who tabled new clause 12. That is significant of my priorities. I certainly support my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull with regard to new clause 9 and amendment No. 156, but I regard them as my fallback position. I also support amendment (a) to new clause 8. I believe that I will agree with the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) will advance in support of that amendment.

<P>
I wish to speak to new clause 12. Both the purpose and the effect of the new clause are self-evident. It would ensure continuation of the name and entity of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the RUC reserve and would ensure that the working and operational title of the police force in Northern Ireland remains, as it should, the Royal Ulster Constabulary. In anticipating that my arguments will fail to convince the Minister, I express my wish, if procedures allow, to press the new clause to a Division.

<P>
We come to what many of us regard as the heart of the matter-the real business. Many of the Patten proposals are unobjectionable to Opposition Members. After all, many were foreshadowed in the Chief Constable's report a few years earlier. Notwithstanding the comments of the hon. Member for South Down, I suggest that the title ``Police (Northern Ireland) Bill'' is, in a key respect, a misnomer. It is a not especially effective titular smokescreen, concealing little and fooling few. It might have been more honest and more straightforward to have called it what it is and what it was always intended to be: the ``Royal Ulster Constabulary (Abolition) Bill''. That is what the Bill does as one of its primary purposes. That is what the Government and Government Members want, and what the Bill facilitates.

<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when a woman changes her name after marriage, she does not disappear in a puff of smoke?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I do not accept that there is the remotest bit of an analogy.

<P>
New clause 12 protests against the move that I have outlined and that I would have otherwise. The hon. Member for South Down put a selective gloss on his party's policy. We should be clear in our minds that the SDLP's objection to the RUC is first and foremost political, and one that they share with republican terrorists. As the 1995 SDLP policy document put it, the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>problem of policing in Northern Ireland<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is ``incapable of resolution'' outside an agreement that is acceptable to nationalists. The truth is that the abolition of the RUC lies at the heart of the demands of Irish nationalism. No amount of reform can make the RUC acceptable to Irish nationalists-they insist that the RUC must go.

<P>
The unqualified claim that we hear so often from the SDLP and its terrorist fellow travellers is that the RUC is unacceptable to Catholics.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> In a moment.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> When I have finished this point, I shall give way first to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik), and then to the hon. Member for South Down.

<P>
The claim that the RUC is unacceptable to Catholics is primarily a concocted lever for constitutional change. Patten himself acknowledged that the RUC has the highest rating in western Europe for public satisfaction with police performance against crime. Common attitude surveys in Northern Ireland confirm that 66 per cent. of Catholics believe that the RUC deals effectively with ordinary crime; 65 per cent. believe that the RUC deals fairly with everyone when combating terrorist and sectarian crime; and 74 per cent. say that fear of intimidation or attack deters Catholics from joining the RUC. The remarkable truth is that 30 years of propaganda and intimidation have failed to alienate the majority of Catholics from the RUC.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I do not wish to discuss the detail of the hon. Gentleman's points, but notwithstanding his appointment to this Committee by Her Majesty's Opposition, will he confirm that he is, in the main, expressing his personal opinions, rather than those of the official Opposition?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Of course I am expressing my own opinions. I said that I support the amendment and the new clause that were tabled by my hon. Friends, and I made my priorities clear from the outset.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Twice in his remarks, the hon. Gentleman suggested that my party and I are in some way associated with, or fellow travellers in, extreme violence. I should point out to him that my party has consistently opposed violence when to do so was dangerous. Members of our party were killed and maimed by the republican movement; our houses were burned and our cars destroyed. Will he continue to assert that I, or other members of my party, participated in republican violence? Where is the evidence for that, either in deed or word?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> With respect, I said no such thing. I said that the SDLP's objection to the RUC is first and foremost a political objective, and one that they share with republican terrorists. The provisional IRA and other republican terrorist organisations do share that objective. That is not to say-as the hon. Gentleman is assuming and claiming that I am saying-that there is some form of partnership. They have that objective in common, but they arrive at it from their respective sources.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> No. I referred to the SDLP and its terrorist fellow travellers, and they do share an objective.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Only one debate should be taking place in the Room.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I have clarified my point sufficiently. I respect what the hon. Member for South Down said, but he misinterpreted my remarks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Would not the hon. Gentleman find it terribly offensive if I were to say of the Conservative party that its views on the euro were fairly similar to those of the National Front, and described its members as fellow-travellers with the National Front? I have been impressed by the way in which members of the Committee have, on the whole, managed to discuss sensitive issues in a sensitive way. Would not it be better if we were to keep the temperature down today, as we have previously?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but in one respect I disgree with him. One of the tragedies of political debate in Northern Ireland, starting with the Brooke/Mayhew initiative in 1992, has been the failure of constitutional nationalists to develop a political agenda that is distinct from the agenda of people who believe in violence. Political debate in Northern Ireland has suffered as a result. It is a matter of great regret that, in the context in which I am talking, their objectives are the same.

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, it would be helpful if I advanced. We have explored this point. If he wants to intervene on a subsequent matter, I shall certainly give way.

<P>
My point represents one argument as to why the police force of Northern Ireland should continue to be called the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and is one reason why we tabled new clause 12.

<P>
The underlying reason for the abolition of the RUC is that it is a core demand of Republican terrorists. It is fundamental to achieving their immediate political objective-the decommissioning of the British state in Ireland, as one IRA commander frequently puts it. The objective is to remove all the symbols, all the institutions, and everything else that represents or expresses the Britishness of Ulster. There should be no illusions about that.

<P>
The Bill and the report that spawned it are a vile and contemptible insult to the memory of 302 officers who have been murdered, and well over 9,000 who have been injured, in the defence of liberty and the rule of law during 30 years of terrorist onslaught. Let us have no more rubbish about comparisons with the disbanding and amalgamation of Army regiments. No British Army regiment has been disbanded or amalgamated at the demand of those who oppose the British state.

<P>
The report has become a mouthpiece for Republican and nationalist demonisation of the RUC, and the Bill has become a vehicle for expressing that. New clause 12 would begin to redress the situation. The tactic of demonisation has been pursued relentlessly over the years, sustaining nationalist and sectarian hatred of the Unionist community. The motive behind the demonisation of the RUC and the demand for its abolition is to secure the removal of whatever stands in the way of a united Ireland. First, it was the B specials, then the Ulster Defence Regiment, and now it is the turn of the RUC, which has so magnificently held the front line against terrorism for so long.

<P>
On several occasions during the course of our proceedings, the Minister has urged the Committee to reject what he calls the old past and to embrace a new vision for Northern Ireland. I do not for one moment doubt his sincerity, but I believe that his analysis is fundamentally mistaken. The contrast that he makes is devoid of moral value-it is a valueless judgment. Too much of the so-called peace process has at first ignored moral values and too often reversed or denied them. The abolition of the RUC, which new clause 12 would resist, should be seen in the context of the appeasement of terrorism. In the Province, that process of appeasement has corrupted the workings of democracy and civil society, and the abolition of the RUC would be another manifestation of that process.

<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Those who believe that a just and stable society can be built on the so-called values of the agreement are deluding themselves. Democracy, decency and justice have been sacrificed in Northern Ireland in the name of an agreement that has not remotely-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> In a moment.

<P>
That agreement has not remotely excised violence from society-nor will it. To sacrifice the role of the constabulary to appease terrorists-that is what is happening-is vile and contemptible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He is trying to hit as many targets as possible with language that is as offensive as he can make it from the depths of his prejudice. I want to ask a question about his attack on the hon. Member for South Down and his party, the SDLP. If the majority of the people of Northern Ireland voted through the ballot box for a united Ireland, would the hon. Member for Basingstoke respect that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am surprised that the Minister asks me that. I have consistently maintained my acceptance of the fundamental principles of the Downing street declaration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept, therefore, that that may be the SDLP's objective, although I cannot speak on behalf of that party? Its proposal would be conducted through the ballot box and would therefore involve the democratic process. His offensive remarks about the SDLP do not stand muster when that position is considered, because he and the SDLP share the same objectives.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am sorry that the Minister returned to that matter, which I thought I had clarified. My remarks were to the effect that there was a common objective that the SDLP shares with the Provisionals and other republican terrorists, and that it is a matter of regret that that is the case. It was not my intention particularly to rouse Committee members. I believe that mine is a valid position to maintain. It is a matter of great regret that the SDLP has failed to answer that charge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> For the last time. This debate is being prolonged for longer than I had intended.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that some of the views that he expressed, and some of the rhetoric that he used, could be regarded as being similar to the views that were being expressed by certain members of certain Protestant terrorist organisations. However, I should never accuse him of being a fellow traveller with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I appreciate that, although I do not really follow the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I tried to put forward my views as coherently and clearly as I could, and I do not withdraw one word of what I said. My essential point is that the concessions that a democratic Government are making in the Bill to the key demands of terrorists are unacceptable. Democrats should have nothing to do with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Gentleman. I shall not take him on over the detail of his speech, although he knows before he starts speaking-let alone after he finishes-that I am likely to disagree profoundly with virtually every word that he says. That was as true when I was a member of his party as it is now that I am a member of the Labour party.

<P>
I shall say one nice thing and one questioning thing to the hon. Gentleman. The nice thing is that I respect new clause 12, which is a thoroughbred. It puts one side of the argument-the extreme side-but it says what it means. It should be contrasted with new clause 9, which is no more and no less than a back-door way to ensure that the RUC will continue to be called the RUC. It would require the tortuous splitting of the police force from the police service and it involves some jolly old typists and a few irritating traffic wardens, but somehow, at the end of the day, the title ``Royal Ulster Constabulary'' is retained. I do not think that that is worth considering again on Report. It is especially sad that the official Opposition, having commendably given support to amendments tabled by the Ulster Unionist party, and to its views, should suddenly diverge from it. No doubt we shall discuss that matter again. New clause 12, however, is a thoroughbred amendment.

<P>
I would say to the hon. Member for Basingstoke that when I started in the Conservative party-I am a little older than him, but he might remember this-the party conferences in the late 1950s and early 1960s did not have such massive security around them. Often, in the middle of lovely speeches by the likes of Harold Macmillan, strange people would get up and start shouting into microphones or waving banners. They were called the League of Empire Loyalists and they used a very similar form of language in talking about any part of the world that we wanted to give up at the time. The hon. Gentleman's speech reminded me of them. However, the great difference here is that we are not giving up on Northern Ireland. I used that analogy to illustrate a relevance to the hon. Gentleman's speech, not to what is happening in Northern Ireland.

<P>
I want to concentrate on the speech made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, because it has been somewhat neglected. I shall discuss what he said about new clause 8 in a moment, but I want first to say where I am coming from on that matter. The hon. Gentleman made a wise and generous speech. I am not renowned for agreeing with him, so I hope that he will accept my compliment. He clearly said that he would prefer new clause 9. I dare say that he would prefer new clause 12, if it were in any way realistic. However, he then said that he had tabled new clause 8 for the benefit of the whole, which is exactly the spirit that I and my hon. Friends have been urging on the Committee. He was, therefore, shifting his position.

<P>
My position, over the years and now, has always inclined much more to the nationalist case-the SDLP case, perhaps-and the democratic case for nationalism in Northern Ireland because I have always felt that they were the underdogs who represented the change that had to take place. The problem with new clause 12, tabled by the hon. Member for Basingstoke, is that at a time of change it resists all change. As I said on Second Reading, maintaining the status quo is certainly not an option. I approach the argument from that side. I would love to be alongside the hon. Member for South Down and new clause 1, and alongside Patten. Paragraph 17.6 of the Patten report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In our judgment that new beginning cannot be achieved unless the reality that part of the community feels unable to identify with the present name and symbols associated with the police is addressed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to recommend that the force
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be named the Northern Ireland Police Service.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Turning to the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I would say that new clause 8 represents the kind of compromise with which we can all do business, although I shall wait to hear what my right hon. Friend the Minister says, and what the Government's view is when the matter is finally decided. The new clause is important because it accepts change. I hope that I am not overdoing it if I say that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is making a significant gesture in tabling this new clause at this time. The RUC is having a particularly difficult time at the moment on the hill at Drumcree, night after night and day after day.

<P>
I want the hon. Gentleman to know that I appreciate new clause 8-I do not think that I am alone in that-because I think that it provides the answer. It accepts the fundamental name change, but gets away from the fear of disbandment. Patten did not recommend that, but the fear has always existed and the language in new clause 8 is spot on in stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The body of constables known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary shall continue in being as the Police Service of Northern Ireland<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and shall be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>styled for operational purposes the ``Police Service of Northern Ireland.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister hears what I am saying-I cannot influence him unduly, but such an amendment appeals to me. If we can reach an accommodation, the RUC can get on with its job and look to the future instead of being in fear and doubt the whole time. The philosophy expressed in the new clause gets us away from disbandment. During a meeting of the Labour Back-Bench Northern Ireland committee and the RUC, it said that it feared being sacrificed. It was clear that RUC's dignity had been affronted and that it thought that what it had done in the past and is doing now deserved better recognition.

<P>
If we can get the language right in the spirit expressed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, we shall have come a long way down the road. I was told at the meeting with the RUC that 95 per cent. of Patten caused it no problem, but that the proposal to change its title affected its dignity and it feared disbandment and being sacrificed. That fear needs to be assuaged, and new clause 8 does that. If we could settle on that or a similar provision, the RUC could look to the future and continue valiantly to perform its difficult duties in these tortuous times with increased morale.

<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I wish to speak to new clause 12 and to support the hon. Member for Basingstoke.

<P>
I am not against change in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and if hon. Members look at the record, they will see that we have tabled many fewer amendments than the Social Democratic and Labour party. Not only have we tabled the least number of amendments from a Northern Ireland party, but I suspect that we have received the least number of concessions. We have supported many of the suggestions in the Bill, but I am opposed to changing the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. I can see no reason for changing it, especially as it has been demonstrated over the years that the majority of people in Northern Ireland have no problem with it.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Down said that many nationalists in Northern Ireland have a problem with the name; it is a pity that he did not discover that sooner. Only recently has he discovered that a large number of Roman Catholics or nationalists are against the name. In the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee he agreed that there was nothing wrong with the name. The Select Committee stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no good reason to change<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the name or the symbols, so if he was as convinced then as he is now that the majority of his supporters opposed the name and the symbols of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, it is strange that he supported the continuation of the name at that time.

<P>
The reason that there will be a change is that Sinn Fein will not accept the new police without it. There is no point in the Minister's trying to suggest that that is not the case. The Bill is designed to placate Sinn Fein; if it does not, that party will not support the new police service. As the SDLP cannot afford to go against the views of Sinn Fein, its leaders have now discovered, to the surprise of many, that nationalists have, over the years, been opposed to the name and symbols of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I shall assume, for the sake of argument, that the hon. Gentleman's premise is correct. Is he suggesting that too few republicans and nationalists feel that way to justify the change, or that the views of such people should be disregarded?

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I am saying that there are too few nationalists disgruntled about the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its symbols to justify ignoring the views of the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland in order to appease Sinn Fein-IRA. That is what the Bill is about. New clause 12 would retain the good and honourable name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. To change the name would be an insult to all the proud members of the RUC and a particular insult to the memory of those who have given their lives while serving in the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

<P>
I turn to the amendment to new clause 8. I tabled the amendment, because, at the time, I thought that I knew what the Government's mind was on new clause 8. Now, I am not sure where the Government's mind is. If new clause 8 is to disappear, I would recommend that the amendment be made to clause 69, after subsection (5).

<P>
There is a great danger that we will change the name and symbols of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, thus creating a wonderful new service called the Police Service of Northern Ireland, only for Sinn Fein to say that it does not accept the changes and will not recommend to republicans that they join. In such circumstances, the likelihood is that the SDLP will not be happy either and will not recommend to nationalists that they join. Thus, we will have changed the Royal Ulster Constabulary and thrown away its name to no good purpose, and Sinn Fein-IRA will have been given another propaganda victory. Republicans will tell themselves that they have got rid of the B Specials, the UDR and, now, the hated RUC. No Government in their senses should allow that to happen.

<P>
The amendment proposes that the name and symbols should not be changed until
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the majority of parties making up the executive of Northern Ireland have declared to the Secretary of State their active support for the new police service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, a majority of the parties that make up the present Executive must positively say that they now accept the Bill and, in so doing, that they will actively support the new service. To substantiate that, all the political members of the board from various political parties will have to be appointed and take their seats.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Would not paragraph (b) allow a party that did not want the name to be changed not to take up its seats? I do not suggest that of any of the parties represented here would do so, but one that is not represented here might, if it were selected for a position on the Police Board, refuse to take its seat to ensure that the name is not changed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I have thought long and hard about how the amendment might be written to provide as positive a safeguard as possible, but it is not easy. If only a majority of the members of the Executive take up their seats on the board, we could be confident at least that the new service that the Government are keen to see come into being could take place. We should then have some positive hope of consensus in Northern Ireland and, as a result, young nationalists might be encouraged to join the police and make it their career. That is why I tabled amendment (a).

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I do not think anyone could disagree with what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said about the courage, bravery and self-sacrifice of those who have chosen to make their career in the RUC. People in the rest of the United Kingdom do not understand the degree of sacrifice involved. If one extrapolates the death toll of members of the RUC to the United Kingdom, it would be the equivalent of more than 10,000 officers dying over three decades, and more than one third of a million officers injured. Only if one thinks about it like that can one begin to realise how deep is the wound that the RUC has to endure.

<P>
We have discussed the change of name many times before, but in such circumstances it is hardly surprising that the name has such great symbolic importance for so many people. We must first recognise the genuine problem that may be caused by a change of name, and admit that it is quite respectable for individuals to object to a change. The issue is personified by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for South Down. I am not surprised, in that context, that the Government seem to be attempting to sidestep that fairly intractable issue.

<P>
Subsections (3) to (5) would defer the making of a decision on the name. I do not condemn the Government for that. However, given the intensity of the debate, they will sooner or later have to take a position. The first choice would be to listen to those who have argued for no change, but the nationalists and republicans will not accept the present name. Patten's investigation was sufficiently deep for us to be confident that his judgment was impartial on whether a minority-albeit unquestionably a significant proportion of people-do not currently have faith in the police service.

<P>
The second option might be to make a wholesale change now. I have concerns about that because, as the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone pointed out, there would be a sense of hurt and let down if the name were simply to disappear from the face of Northern Ireland policing. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said in an intervention that perhaps the police force had not evolved far enough to accommodate the change. That ignores the fact that the change of name is an important part of the process of evolution. It will have an impact on the impression that the police service creates, and, in all likelihood, on its opportunity to become a truly bipartisan force able to attract significant numbers from Catholic and other communities. I conclude that we need to make a change.

<P>
It gives me little pleasure to participate in the debate, because almost everything that is said will stir up the dissatisfactions of one group or another. The crucial point was made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone in response to my intervention, when he emphasised his judgment that the proportion of nationalists and republicans who require the change is insufficient to justify it. We should take note of that: it is the heart of the debate. It is less a matter of the principle of the change, than of a judgment about whether the hurt and discomfort it would cause to those who do not want it is outweighed by the proportion of people who currently feel disfranchised with respect to the police force in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman drew the conclusion that there are too few such people to justify the change. I draw a different conclusion. I think that there are enough to justify it, and Patten agrees.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I support the hon. Gentleman. An independent survey in December 1997 found that 59 per cent. of Catholics considered a change in name essential, and a further 18 per cent. thought it desirable. That implies that 77 per cent. of the Catholic population want a name change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Those figures back up my perception, though I have done no objective analysis of the question on my many visits to Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recall that the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee said that the Roman Catholic community is split about evenly on the question whether there should be a change of title, whereas 85 per cent. of those responding from the Protestant communities thought that there should be no change?

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those figures, which help to define the terms of the debate. By his figures, not only do 50 per cent. of the Catholic community desire a change, but, by implication-he can correct me if I am wrong-15 per cent. of the Unionist or Protestant community have also seen the benefit of a change. Even if that does not amount to a majority of the Northern Ireland population, it is my judgment that the feeling of disfranchisement of such a significant minority more than justifies dealing with the name of the RUC.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Although 15 per cent. responded in that way, there are always ``don't knows''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> That is fair enough. I do not want to draw too many conclusions from the statistics, but it is clear from both sets that we have been given that a significant group of people would like a name change. That is made even more important by the fact that the proportion of such people will almost certainly be much higher in certain geographical areas, where the RUC has not enjoyed the faith and confidence of the community. I am sure that, in those areas, very high percentages of people would call for a change. The implication, if the hon. Member for West Tyrone is correct, is that in those areas there will not be much faith in the police force unless the name and the symbolism that goes with it are changed. That is a compelling argument as to why the change is necessary and is exactly the point that Patten was driving at. He did not seek a majority in favour of a name change, but said that change was necessary because such a significant proportion of people regarded the name as an insuperable barrier to constructive participation in the police force, either directly as a member or by helping it as a member of the public to carry out its duties.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I concur with the views of the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) on how the matter should be addressed. Having considered the many options before us and having listened to the remarks that have been made, I believe that new clause 8 offers a balance, for reasons that the hon. Gentleman set out and which I do not need to repeat. I will be interested to hear the Minister's remarks on the new clause. I hope that the Government will accept it, or will at least consider it further.

<P>
I should explain the other reason, in addition to those given by the hon. Member for Leominster, why the new clause has my support. It represents a movement by somebody who has been intimately involved in the history and fortunes of the RUC and who accepts the principal tenet of the Patten report, which is that a change is necessary. It is a gentle approach to an important issue, but it requires those who want change to occur to move a little bit also. I am sure that some hon. Members want the immediate and complete abolition of the phrase ``Royal Ulster Constabulary'' in any connection with the police service in Northern Ireland. I encourage anybody who reads our debates to think seriously about whether they are able or willing to agree to such a change. If they are, perhaps they could communicate that to the Ministers who will have to make the call. 

<P>
I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments. I am glad to have heard the arguments that were advanced so lucidly by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for South Down. I hope that the proposal that has been made will enable us to make progress on what is, understandably, an extremely emotive discussion on both sides.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): The comments that I wish to make will reflect my interest in young people and the work that I have done with Childline. The clause and amendments go to the root of the whole debate, which is the question whether there will be a new beginning, or merely a new chapter in a rather tragic story. We should ask ourselves not only why we want to make the changes, but for whom we are making them. I want to put on record some of the results of a survey that has just been produced through Keele university. It covered 1,000 Catholic and Protestant young people aged between 14 and 18 taken from 12 Belfast schools, four youth groups, training organisations and three schools outside Belfast. They were interviewed at length and were subsequently involved in extensive listening exercises. It is not only interesting for Committee members to consider what those young people said, but incumbent upon them.

<P>
When we talk about making changes and about the creation of a new police service, we should bear in mind that we are doing it for the young people more than anybody else. We are doing it for the people who will, we hope, take jobs in the service tomorrow. Those young people need confidence in the police service, not least because it is necessary to enable them to join it. The survey reveals the tensions that the Committee has been discussing. For example, it shows that fewer than 1 per cent. of the young people and fewer than 1 per cent. of the Catholic young people believe that things can stay as they are. On the other hand, although 71.9 per cent. of those young people wanted to change, including change to the name, that was true of only 12 per cent of the Protestant young people.

<P>
That tension runs through the entire Bill and hangs over the question of the change in name. If we were prepared, just for a moment and regardless of which side of the argument we sat on or whether we sat on no side at all, to take note of the comments from some of those young people, we might understand why the change had to come. Aged 14 to 18, they do not speak as committed members of a political party, but as young people with a hope for tomorrow and a hope that we can deliver something that will succeed.

<P>
One young Catholic girl, aged 16, whom we should heed, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For Catholics it (policing) is a very sensitive issue and there should be compromise to try and please everybody as much as possible. I know it is hard to please everybody, but the RUC definitely aren't doing that  People in West Belfast they don't want the RUC-they say ``RUC out''-they are scared and feel intimidated by them, just because-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in their eyes-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the RUC has a bad reputation for being a sectarian, Protestant force. It would be much easier if the RUC were reformed  If you were a particularly strong nationalist you certainly wouldn't want to serve in something called the RUC.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If we are to be successful, we must understand how that girl feels. We can choose not to listen, but we can also choose to listen to the acceptance in that quotation that the RUC was trying to do a difficult job. That acceptance was echoed in the other comments, whether the young people were Catholic or Protestant. Both sides recognised the role that the RUC has played; they regarded it as honourable and as having been crucial to the provision of a police service. They wanted a successful new beginning.

<P>
It is interesting to hear from another young person, this time a young 14-year-old Catholic, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Well the way the RUC is at the minute would intimidate some Catholics-it's Royal and therefore it's British-whereas if it had a different name they would probably think that this is just the police  If the name was changed people wouldn't see a Protestant organisation or a Catholic organisation they would just see a police force.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
An 18-year-old boy said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What is the point of trying to reform it, to get more Catholics or nationalists into it, if you are going to keep the name that brings back so many memories  The name is important because whether cosmetically or not, if it goes it brings in the idea that there is a new police focus here  One that will be fair, one that will be different.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That final point is crucial. I will give the final word from the survey, which tells us a lot, to an 18-year-old Protestant girl. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I didn't really see the need for all the changes and I would have been quite happy for it to have stayed the way it was. But at the end of the day a mixed police force will make things better and help the peace process along. It definitely will. This is what everything's about, trying to integrate Catholics and Protestants together. Like the police force is just one way of starting it. It is a good way  I didn't really care much for all the changes, but I feel that they had to happen.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) for that illuminating contribution on the important views expressed by young people. Everything that we seek to do in Northern Ireland is as much about the future as it is about tackling the problems of the present, while being mindful of the difficulties of the past. I am glad that I did not include those quotations in my speaking notes, because the thrust of a big part of my argument would have been taken away.

<P>
The debate has captured better than I ever could the strong views held on both sides of the community about the name of the police in Northern Ireland. Some hon. Members referred to it as I would want to and others argued for the retention of the name ``Royal Ulster Constabulary'' and acknowledged no case for change. I was going to respond to the hon. Member for Basingstoke, but so many of his comments were offensive that I have decided to ignore him. We have often debated the fundamentals of the issue, but he reached a new low today when he tried to attribute base motives on the part of the right hon. and hon. Members.

<P>
I share the view of the hon. Members for Solihull, for West Tyrone and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who spoke of the RUC's good name. They mentioned the pride that they and others take in the RUC as a force that has stood resolutely in the face of a terrorist onslaught and done its duty in the most difficult circumstances to protect all the people of Northern Ireland. My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster and Opposition Members referred to the terrible scenes that we witnessed on television recently: nothing could more graphically highlight the difficulty of the RUC's job.

<P>
While we stand back and consider what is happening on the ground, blast bombs have been used against RUC officers. Constable Frankie O'Reilly was the last RUC policeman to be killed, the victim of a blast bomb at Drumcree in 1998. Acid is being thrown at the police, their families are being intimidated and, as in previous years, some will be driven from their homes by people who call themselves loyalists but who are loyal only to their own evil intent, not to the United Kingdom. It is a disgrace and outrage that they should touch the Union flag which represents such a proud tradition.

<P>
I understand the sentiments that have been expressed. The Government stand behind such views, but we do not agree that a change in the name would denigrate and dishonour the sacrifices and service of the men and women of the RUC. That is not part of the Government's agenda. We have consistently made it clear that we admire and support the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The awarding of the George Cross is a fitting and unique tribute to its efforts and sacrifices in the past decades.

<P>
There is another side to the debate. Some people do not want to recognise the continuity between the RUC and the new police service. The Patten report was clear on some aspects of the debate. It did not accept the argument that the RUC should be disbanded-that is set out clearly in paragraph 17.6-and the Government strongly agree. The RUC should not and will not be disbanded. Patten recommended only that the police service should be renamed. The commission also made it clear in paragraph 17.7 that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>important that the link between the RUC and the new Northern Ireland Police Service be recognized.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Government agree on the importance of recognising such continuity and inclusiveness. It is against that background that the strongly held opposing views on the issue of the name have had to be tackled and understood.

<P>
We have thought long and hard about the problem. Many people think that it is an easy process to adopt and go for one name, but that is not the way in which we can deal with issues in Northern Ireland. A difficult balance has to be struck constantly. Sometimes, a judgment will come down on one side, sometimes on the other, and sometimes we are able to achieve agreement between competing views because people are prepared to accept a compromise. The name falls into that fundamental category of strongly held views, and it has been a difficult issue for the Government to tackle.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government's original intention was to deal with the matter by including an enabling power in the Bill in clause 69, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said. The power was for the Secretary of State to provide for a name by order at a later stage, which would have enabled the Government to consult the new Policing Board and have the advantage of having its views on the issues. We have taken on board all the representations and requests made about the name in recent weeks, and are persuaded that there is a good case for bringing closure and clarity on the issue in the Bill. People on all sides of the debate want clarity and a final decision from the Government.

<P>
Let me deal with the question of why we believe it necessary to change the name at all. As we have consistently said, changing the name is not intended to dishonour the RUC. The Government concluded that
a name change was an essential condition for encouraging Catholics to come forward for recruitment to the police service. It is therefore an integral part of the objective of achieving a more representative and effective police service. Indeed, the police service will be more effective because it will be more representative.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already suggested that the Government's preference is that the name should provide a legal description or formal title that incorporates the RUC while introducing a new name, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to be used for everyday operational and working purposes. We believe that that is entirely consistent with the Patten report, paragraph 17.7 of which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the link between the RUC and the new Northern Ireland Police Service<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be recognised.

<P>
New clause 1 was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. In the Government's view, it fails to make the necessary and important link between the RUC and the new Police Service of Northern Ireland, but would merely change the name and contains little hint of continuity. For that reason, we cannot accept it. He asked whether the Government clearly understand what his party said on the issue. We do; we recognise how important changing the name is to achieving the objective of creating a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland, changing the police service's composition, and creating a police service that can command the support of all sections of the community.

<P>
I assure my hon. Friend that the Government understand all those issues, and that they are central to our thinking. That is why I believe that our policy is clear: the name will change. We have said that before, and I repeat it. I want to make it abundantly clear that the new title-the only title that can and will be used in the future-is the Police Service of Northern Ireland. If we return to the debate on Report, either my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State or myself will make that clear again. I hope that our objectives are clear to my hon. Friend and his party.

<P>
New clause 9 was tabled by the hon. Member for Solihull, and new clause 12 was tabled by hon. Members from the Conservative party and the Ulster Unionist party. Both would result in the retention of the name ``Royal Ulster Constabulary'' in the working title, but we do not see that as an option. The Government believe that there must be a change in the operational title if we are to engender ownership of the police service throughout the community in Northern Ireland. I quote from paragraph 17.5 of the Patten report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the use of words or symbols perceived to associate the police with one side of the constitutional argument must inevitably go some way to inhibiting the wholehearted participation in policing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That important position must be taken into consideration.

<P>
The formulation set out in new clause 8, tabled by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, satisfies the criteria set by the Government. It makes the necessary connection, and provides for continuity, between the RUC and the new police service through the formal title
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At the same time, it makes it clear that a working title-Police Service of Northern Ireland-will be used for all ``operational purposes''. That offers a clear and widely acceptable solution on an undoubtedly difficult and sensitive issue.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred to what I would call technical deficiencies in his new clause; it deals with only one part of the overall policing structure. We must deal with the RUC reserves in the same way as his amendment deals with the RUC regulars. The Government would also want to think further about the definition of the term ``operational purposes'' to ensure that it meets the terms and requirements of our policy.

<P>
On the understanding that the Government are sympathetic towards new clause 8 and intend to deal with the technical deficiency and the definition of ``operational purposes'', I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment. We have not tabled new measures in response at this stage, so we will have to return to the issue on Report. If our amendment is then selected, we will be able to debate the matter at that stage, and the hon. Gentleman may decide whether he accepts or rejects our understanding of it. The Government will table a new clause that uses the wording precisely as set out in his new clause, while expanding it to deal with the RUC reserves.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> If the Minister considers that ``operational'' needs further definition, I suggest that he look in the dictionary. He may cause himself unnecessary difficulties by seeking to define that word further.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know whether to deduce from that intervention that the hon. Gentleman is now supporting the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Oh, the hon. Gentleman is not. That was a step too far. He was simply giving free advice again. As we have said time and time again, we will always take the advice offered by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield because it has proved helpful in the past. Although I suspect that it may not prove wholly helpful on this occasion, I will look in the dictionary. I do not know whether he has a dictionary to hand that will give me the definition, but he suggested that he had a definition that would make our approach redundant.

<P>
We disagree, we must define that phrase for the sake of clarity and to satisfy the roundness of the debate that I have set out and the competing points of view that have been expressed. People see the word ``clarity'' in everything that the Government have produced on this matter, and we have used that word extensively in every aspect of every discussion about the development of the Good Friday agreement. Clarity is what people want, and that is what we seek to achieve in the matter that we are discussing.

<P>
The amendment to new clause 8 would provide that the name change could go ahead only if a majority of parties in a Northern Ireland Executive declared
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>their active support for the new police service; and

<P>
(b) all political members of the Board<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
take up their seat. I question how we would judge what is ``active support''. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has a definition for it, but, no matter how he defines it, others in his party and elsewhere will have a different interpretation.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> What I mean is that the party would come out and say that it accepts the new police force and recommends that our supporters join it. That seems to me to cover ``active support''. If the Minister can suggest a better wording, I would be happy to consider it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have been over the definition of ``operational''. It would probably be even more difficult to define ``active support''. The hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment, not I, and he should have thought about exactly what it means-it would have been helpful if he had provided such a definition. He has done so only in response to my question, which leads me to conclude that he did not even consider the possibility of different interpretations. If he did, why is that not reflected in the amendment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I would certainly be happy to table another amendment on Report, defining exactly what I mean by ``active support''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have no doubt that we will have more amendments on the issue, but I am not prepared to consider one at this stage-or at all.

<P>
The reference in the amendment to ``the executive of Northern Ireland'' constitutes another fundamental technical flaw. I do not know whether it refers to the executive committee established under section 20 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 or to some other executive, such as the Housing Executive. The hon. Gentleman has a responsibility, in drafting an amendment on such an important issue, to get it right so that we are clear about it. Apart from the issue of the underlying principle, what he seeks to do in those two areas alone leads me to conclude that we should not support his approach.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I am not a draftsman; if the Government accepted the amendment in principle, I am sure that the legislative draftsmen could draft it better than I could. It is rather petty of the Minister to dismiss it outright in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have tried to deal with the technical flaws in the amendment, but I also said, in my earlier arguments, that it does not achieve the hon. Gentleman's objectives. I cannot ask for support on his approach. He has made it clear that his addition to new clause 8 seeks to tie nationalist parties into supporting the police before the name changes. Patten says in the preamble to his report, at paragraph 1.19, that if changes are to be effective they must have widespread support and he calls on national leaders from all sides of the community to support what we seek to do.

<P>
The majority of Patten's recommendations are to do with good policing. The Government have implemented Patten and we hope that all parties support the changes that he has brought about. It would be a matter of great regret, having examined the Bill, if parties simply said-this is the point made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone-that if one does not get everything, nothing should happen. That is a flawed approach. However, the Government cannot force parties to support our approach. I therefore invite the hon. Members for South Down, for Solihull, for Basingstoke, for West Tyrone and for Beaconsfield-bearing in mind the relationship between Basingstoke and West Tyrone-not to press new clauses 1, 9 and 12 and related amendments Nos. 59, 60, 61 and 156.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 289 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down would remove paragraph 1 of schedule 6 that provides for references to the police service and the police service reserve to be construed as references to the RUC and the RUC reserve respectively until clause 72 comes into force. The clause was drafted to take account of the Government's decision that the name should change in autumn 2001, whereas other provisions of the Bill will come into effect immediately. I genuinely appreciate the intention behind the amendment and the fact that it reflects the strongly held view of those who support it.

<P>
However, the Secretary of State set out the Government's policy on 19 January 2000, when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That change is needed to signal the new beginning, which will be symbolised in particular by the arrival in the new training environment of the first recruits entering through the new independent procedures and selected on the new balanced basis. That point will come in the autumn next year.-[Official Report, 19 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 848.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is my assessment that amendment No. 289 would-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was hoping that we would reach a natural break.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am just coming to the last 42 paragraphs of my speaking notes! Amendment No. 289 would run counter to the Government's policy and I shall not ask the Committee to support it.

<P>
Amendment No. 290 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down would remove paragraph 2 of schedule 6, which continues in being the RUC as a police service. Patten said that there should be a new name and that the RUC should not be disbanded. We have repeated that time and time again and it is worth repeating yet again. That is the Government's policy and it was recommended strongly by Patten. I am sorry that amendment No. 290 was tabled. It seeks to revive the argument about the disbandment of the RUC and, for that reason, I oppose it. I have tried to make it clear where the Government stand and, if the sitting is about to be suspended, I hope we shall have more time to reflect on the matter.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is a natural break, which we have all earned. It might be as well if I gave some technical advice to the Committee on how to vote on the various amendments, but I shall do so after the break, which will last for half an hour. I shall resume the Chair at 
<P>
<H5>5.32 pm.</H5>
</P>
<P>
5.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended.

<P>
<H5>5.32 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> When I was speaking earlier, my grey matter was working on how to explain what could be construed as inconsistencies in my attempt to encapsulate our discussions. For clarity, I should make clear what the Government intend, which might help those who have given further thought to the debate.

<P>
Technically, amendment No. 60 has to be made to allow us to move on to the new clauses. Although I said that I was supportive of new clause 8, it occurs to me that, unless we have a vote on that amendment, we shall not be able to vote on the new clause or any other amendments. Therefore, if my hon. Friend the Member for South Down is not prepared to move amendment No. 60, I give notice that I intend to do so. It will then be for those who support the new clauses to decide what they want to do. I want to make it clear also that if the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone moves new clause 8, I shall ask the Committee to support it. I hope that I have cleared up the situation. If further explanation is required, I shall happily respond.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I want to say a word about amendment (a) to new clause 8. The Minister spoke a lot about the wording, but he failed to deal with the principle. After all that we have gone through in discussing the Bill, he seemed to imagine that the SDLP and Sinn Fein would go along with it. However, that is in no way certain. He should at least address the principle of the amendment, which is that we should not lose the name of the RUC or the reserve if those two parties are not prepared to support actively-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman consider the views expressed by his hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and reconsider the wording that is proposed in the new clause? I think that it meets his overall objective in relation to the name of the RUC. If that was not the case, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone would not have spoken to the new clause as he did. I tried to explain that the amendment itself is technically flawed and undeliverable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank the Minister for his comments and I understand the consequence of new clause 8. The Bill ensures that the operational name of the police will be the Police Service of Northern Ireland. After the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is changed, Sinn Fein and the SDLP might not then support the new police service. It would be foolish to change everything and annoy a lot of people but have no gain at the end of it. That is what amendment (a) seeks to avoid, and the Minister should address that specific problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> There are one or two matters with which I want to deal before we move on. The Committee has not heard a great deal from the hon. Member for Witney. Today, however, he quoted some statistics and relayed some information from research. I am as aware of that research as he is. I know that he may not be overly familiar with Northern Ireland, but I must remind him that it is very easy to mislead oneself with selective quotations from young people. I shall not go into detail, but I can tell him about the people from both traditions who are currently visiting me.

<P>
Two people from the Roman Catholic tradition have visited my constituency surgery in the past fortnight, to complain about the police. They said that the police were not recruiting and appeared to have no intention of doing so until September next year. They were frustrated that they could not enter the RUC. One young man with a university degree came to my surgery with his mother to talk about the matter. He was of the Roman Catholic tradition. The hon. Gentleman can check with the Chief Constable, to whom I wrote to ask whether there was any way in which he could begin to accommodate the young people of both traditions who are eager to join the RUC now. I am not trying to nit-pick with the hon. Gentleman. I am familiar with his source and believe it to be rather prejudiced and slightly dubious. There is the corollary and that is my experience.

<P>
On new clause 8, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Leominster-I used to mispronounce the constituency's name-for his support. I am also grateful to others who have suggested that we may have found a way forward. The Minister has been helpful. I am grateful that the Minister has been positive, but it was not easy for my party and me to draft and to present the new clause. I drew the Minister's attention to the parallel amendment that must be made and he acknowledged the situation. Consequential amendments on top of that will need to be made.

<P>
I do not want to appear ungracious on the matter, but I issue a word of caution, which endorses exactly what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said. Having got where we are, we do not need to complicate life by trying to define ``operational purposes''. We all know what the phrase means. One cannot say that we will put a title on the title deeds and also ask how we can find a way of making it totally meaningless. We know what ``operational purposes'' means-a policeman going to knock on someone's door, stopping someone in the road, apprehending somebody or assisting a person. We know what policemen will be required to do. ``Operational purposes'' is wholly understood.

<P>
I see one or two heads nodding in assent. I beg the Committee and the Minister not to try and reinvent the wheel. We have come to a conclusion that, like so many things, will not satisfy everyone. However, there is a little in it for everyone. On that note of caution, I will conclude.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The debate on the amendments that I tabled has been long and tense and, sometimes, personally offensive. My intention is not to respond in kind because diatribe is often an excuse for lack of argument.

<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull made many comments about polls, statistics and other factors, arguing that there was no real support for a changed name in the community from which I come, in which I live and which I try to represent in its totality. He seems to have forgotten that the Patten commission and most of its members spent a considerable time in the north of Ireland. They held lengthy hearings in halls and other public venues to assess people's attitude on the factors of policing. It was a national body with a local composition which was spread geographically, politically and religiously.

<P>
The commission took on board the references, comments and representations made to it. Those public and sometimes private consultations produced the simple and basic comment that the RUC's name should be changed to the Northern Ireland Police Service. As I said, we see no great difference between the Northern Ireland Police Service and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Government included that in the original draft of clause 1. They were obviously responding to Patten.

<P>
I must say to the hon. Member for Solihull that the views do not represent a minority of a minority. Instead, they represent the majority of a minority, and perhaps many more besides. I do not think that the proposition was an appeasement to my party. It is a necessary adjustment of the delivery of police service and essential for how it is perceived by the entire community of Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman invoked the views of a priestly person on the name, symbols and political ethos, yet he seems to have ignored the collective view of the Northern Irish bishops. The Catholic bishops-representing Catholics, presumably-said that such depoliticisation of the culture and ethos of policing is essential if policing arrangements in Northern Ireland are to win the full support of the Catholic community and if the targets for Catholic recruitment set out in the report are to have a realistic chance of being met. That is not the party political stance that is alleged to have been taken, but the view of the committee of the Northern Irish Catholic bishops.

<P>
The diatribe of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone once again did not address the arguments of Patten and the needs of a renewed police service. He rightly referred to the Good Friday agreement which had regard to the principles of equality, parity of esteem and respect for traditions, and how we would achieve those against the backdrop of what went on before. The new police force will need those attributes, but that did not matter to him. He said that I personally and my party are still in 1969 and that we have not emerged from the Eddie McAteer era of nationalism. Where has he been? The SDLP promoted the concepts of anti-violence. It took violence out of the equation and encouraged consent, equality, esteem and respect for traditions.

<P>
The SDLP's new policies over the years were the force for change, which drove the Good Friday agreement, which created an environment in which violence could be stopped. The republican movement accepted the Good Friday agreement and dramatically agreed that consent, not force, was the essential factor in bringing about constitutional change in Northern Ireland. If these were not new, dramatic and effective policies that delivered peace, I do not know where the hon. Gentleman has been.

<P>
Our proposals to change the name of the RUC are supposed to be demeaning and humiliating to the members of the force. As I have said time and again, we pay respect to the service, the suffering and the pain, yet we are continually pushed on to the emotional track whereby changing the name is held to detract from all the RUC members have sacrificed, served and suffered. That idea would not be accepted anywhere else. Did changes to the name of British Army regiments demean and detract from the sacrifices of the soldiers who fought in various wars throughout the previous century? I do not think so. Why should it? Why is a name change interpreted in the Northern Ireland context as being humiliating and demeaning for RUC members and their families?

<P>
Several times the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone rehearsed the argument that the SDLP was tired, hackneyed and old nationalist. I have already dealt with that by talking about the new dynamic of Northern Ireland politics, which was the brainchild, the product of the policies and the thought processes of my party, that led to the Good Friday agreement. Even republican Sinn Fein accepted the new dynamic. These dramatic measures were intended to take the gun out of Irish politics with particular regard to the aspirations of the nationalist community.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone argued for the inclusion of new clause 8, which seems a mishmash. We can have but one name for all purposes; we cannot have a name-whatever it is-in the title deeds and a different name or style of name for operational purposes. How ludicrous can we get in discussing such matters? To achieve its objectives, the name of the new service must reflect the collective opinion, the research and the dialogue entered into by the Patten Commission. The name accepted by the Government was the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The various proposed convolutions relating to style, operation, title deeds and so forth are simply a means of frustrating the whole exercise.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead made a powerful argument for change and dealt with various aspects of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee's report on policing and recruitment. He clearly illustrated that no particular comment was made by the SDLP on the issue, though some Members wanted to personalise it. The day on which the Committee voted on these controversial matters was 1 July 1998. I was not present, having the relatively good excuse that that was the date of the inaugural meeting of the new Northern Ireland Assembly. The Committee continued to following week, on 8 July, the date on which the first meeting to discuss business arrangements was held with the Presiding Officer of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, when I was responsible for my 24 Members of that Assembly. I therefore did not subscribe. Perhaps I was at fault in not pursuing the matter and submitting a minority report of one. However, at the time, I did not believe that that was appropriate; indeed, I probably did not even think of it, because of the events that surrounded me and my party in Northern Ireland.

<P>
I have already referred to the comments of the hon. Member for Basingstoke in an intervention. He allied me personally and my party to the extremes of violence in Northern Ireland. Although he decried it in a subsequent answer to another hon. Member, the import of his comments was that the SDLP's agenda is dictated by, a consequence of and the result of collaboration with extreme physical violence. I cannot say strongly enough how that hurts me personally and the members of my party who have suffered. The Catholic community in Northern Ireland suffered more as a result of republican violence than any other community in terms of deaths, maimings and damage to property. Our towns were equally destroyed. We all suffered. I resent any inference that I am a fellow traveller with that violence.

<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke also said that the SDLP had failed to develop a political agenda that was distinct from violence. I have just articulated how we did exactly that, through a new perspective of Irish nationalism that eschewed the old violence, guns, force and any bar to the course of persuasion by lawful and democratic means, and were greatly hurt in doing so.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone referred to the merit in his case. I was referring to his wing of the Ulster Unionist party, rather than the official wing. The amendments tabled by the UUP are unnecessary. They reflect the ethos of his and his party's thinking, which is not only anti-Patten but anti-agreement. I therefore cannot give him a plaudit for not having tabled more amendments. He said that our propositions insulted the RUC and all that it stands for. That is simply not so, as I have repeated time and again.

<P>
The hon. Member for Witney made some interesting and incisive comments about both Catholic and Protestant young people in Northern Ireland, with whom I empathise, having spoken to them in my constituency. Young people want change. They want a demarcation between the old and the new, to be clear and unambiguous and to say that, as far as the policing service is concerned, ``We are going to participate in a new dimension in a new society.'' After all that we have endured, we have a duty to give them that opportunity, not frustrate it. As I tried to say in my opening remarks, although the changes that we propose are not necessarily agreed preferences, they offer an acceptable way forward. I think that that is the thrust of what the hon. Member for Witney was saying.
<P>
 
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The question of support for new clause 8 is puzzling. As I have partly articulated, it does not reflect the Patten report, equality of esteem, impartiality, new from old, or a new beginning of the old history. Underlying the exchanges between the Minister and the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is the notion that the matter can be described in three or more variations-in terms of new clause 8, styling or clarification, which I think that the Minister said that he wanted to introduce. On the question of what title should be given to the body or persons engaged in operational matters, I find it hard to respond. Is it conceivable that a body can have one name when it is concerned with operational matters and a different one when it is concerned with administrative matters? I have come across phrases such as ``known as'', but I have never come across the word ``style'' in any legislation. I do not understand its meaning.

<P>
The Minister referred to the formal title of the new police service as the Police Service of Northern Ireland incorporating the RUC. If that is the formal title, that is the title; full stop, end of story. The people of Northern Ireland will not interpret that as a fudge but as a continuation of the name, with all its associations. As a result, everything that we have been trying to change will have been put into reverse. If, as they were wont to do, the Government had taken the view of the Patten commission-which was not biased one way or the other-and created a new image centred on the new name, we would have a much better chance of creating the new dimension that we hope will be achieved through the establishment of a new police service.

<P>
As we progress through the Bill and notice how it fails to reflect some of the major requirements and suggestions in the Patten report, it is less and less clear that the commission, and those who accepted its report, will have confidence in what has been done. It is sad that a one-off opportunity may be squandered and lost. If that happens, I do not know how we will pick up the pieces. We have seen the violence on the streets of Northern Ireland, to which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred. If I may digress to earlier exchanges, it was the Orange Order that called for the protests on the streets. It also said that it would not take any responsibility for the consequences of its action-I think that I heard that on the radio this morning.

<P>
The Ulster Unionist party cannot divorce itself entirely from its influence on the Orange Order. The Orange Order is constitutionally represented on the governing body of the Ulster Unionist party. I should like to hear that party tell the Orange Order, ``Stop these demonstrations. Give us peace. You are laying down an opportunity for those men of violence of the extreme loyalist paramilitaries to create mayhem''. If events escalate over the next few weeks, there is a great danger that the paramilitaries will demonstrate their power by attacking various communities. I pray that that is not where we are headed, but I fear that the opportunity that we have here has been squandered. To try to prevent that, I ask the Committee to accept the amendments that stand in my name.

<B>The Chairman:</B> This is the moment of truth. It may be for the benefit of the Committee if I give some procedural advice at this point. I refer first to the amendments in this group: should the proposers wish to move them, there may be separate votes on amendments Nos. 59, 156, 60, 61, and 290. Sharp-eyed members of the Committee might ask about amendment No. 286. It is dependent on the fate of amendment No. 261: if amendment No. 261 falls, so does amendment No. 286.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friends and I would like a separate opportunity to vote on amendment
No. 156.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That intervention was not strictly necessary, but I thank the hon. Gentleman for the information.

<P>
Votes on new clauses 1, 8, 9 and 12, which relate to the name of the police service, may be held only if amendment No. 60 is agreed to. It is important that hon. Members understand that when they vote. Votes on the new clauses do not come until after the completion of the votes on the clauses on the face of the Bill. If amendment No. 60 is agreed to, a vote on new clause 1, the first of the new clauses on the name, may be held after any debate on clause 73 stand part. It will or will not be agreed to.

<P>
Then comes the debate on new clauses 2, 5, 13 and 14, which all refer to the police oversight commissioner. When debate on that group of new clauses is completed, we may move to the vote on the second of the new clauses on the name, new clause 8, which has been most in focus. The amendment to new clause 8 would be taken with that. Subsequently we would deal with new clauses 9 and 12. However, if any of the new clauses on the name is agreed to, all the others fall. Is that clear? With that knowledge graven on hon. Members' hearts we move to the votes on this group of clauses.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I ask the Committee to reflect for a moment, so that it can acknowledge how the international input into the resolution of the conflict has enabled it to be better managed, moderated and resolved. Senator George Mitchell, Harri Holkeri and General de Chastelain in the negotiations, Marti Artisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa through confidence-building measures, and the late Ron Brown, the Treasury Secretary on US investment-all gave international input into resolving and attempting to resolve the constitutional and socio-economic problems that affect and afflict our community.

<P>
The rationale governing acceptable international input is clear. With such input, we hope to gain an application of independence of mind, credibility, authority and technical skills. Allied to that is the good will of the international community and, we hope, an ability to see realities beyond emotions. Those principles have served the purposes of the political process well, hence our proposal for the Police Oversight Commissioner. The SDLP proposed the appointment of a commissioner to oversee and implement policing changes in our original submission to the Patten commission. We therefore welcome chapter 19 of the Patten report, which stated that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>vital that the recommendations in this report should be implemented comprehensively and faithfully  We believe that a mechanism is needed to oversee the changes required  and to assure the community that all aspects of our report are being implemented and being seen to be implemented.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report added, in heavy type:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend that an eminent person, from a country other than the United Kingdom or Ireland, should be appointed as soon as posible as an oversight commissioner with responsibility for supervising the implementation of our recommendations  We recommend that the government, the police service, and the Policing Board (and DPPBs) should provide the oversight commissioner with objectives (with timetables) covering their own responsibilities, and that they should report on the progress achieved at the periodic review meetings, and account for any failures to achieve objectives  We recommend that the commissioner should in turn report publicly after each review meeting on the progress achieved, together with his or her observations on the extent to which any failures or delays are the responsibility of the policing institutions themselves or due to matters beyond their control  We recommend that the oversight commissioner should be appointed for a term of five years.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We welcome the appointment of Tom Constantine, after some delay, as the oversight commissioner. If the office of the commissioner is to be credible and earn confidence, it should have its terms of reference, powers and responsibilities as outlined in the Patten report laid down in statute. That is what our amendment would do, and we hope that it will commend itself to the Committee.

<P>
New clause 2 takes the constituent parts of the Patten report and translates them into law. It establishes in statute the office of the oversight commissioner with the purpose of overseeing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the reform of policing in Northern Ireland<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and states that the office shall be in existence for at least five years. Arguably, the Patten report went further in stating that the commissioner should supervise the implementation of the report. None the less, the wording of our amendment should achieve the desired purpose, with the self-evident requirement that the Committee and the Government support it.

<P>
New clauses 13 and 14 go together. Patten said that the oversight commissioner should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provide more than a stocktaking function<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>review process would provide an important impetus to the process of transformation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report recommended that the Government, the police service, the Policing Board and district partnerships should provide the oversight commissioner with the objectives and timetables, accounts of progress or failure of progress to which I have referred. They would provide observation as to the extent of those failures or delays and whether the responsibility lies with the institutions or themselves, or whether they are the result of matters beyond their control.

<P>
The Government have produced their implementation plan of the Patten report without much consultation and without even a reference to the political parties or others. That is a high-handed view of the involvement that we have had in consultations on aspects of the new police service. We will have to live with that and work through the consequences of that plan, which we hope will be helpful in due course.

<P>
There are difficulties with some of the objectives, targets and timetables in the implementation plan, however. The report said that holding centres in Armagh and Derry should be closed forthwith, and the Belfast centre has indeed closed. In the plan, a study has been launched to plan for new ``custody suites''-a lovely term-rather than interrogation or holding centres. The study will report by December 2000 on the building work likely to be necessary. So much for ``forthwith''. Things will actually start to happen in the second quarter of the new millennium. Therefore, we are sceptical of the deadlines and timetables.

<P>
The Patten report says that Special Branch and Crime Branch should be brought together under the command of a single assistant chief constable. The implementation plan says that, subject to constraints of the security situation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Chief Constable will review the scope-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not introduce the measure, but review the scope-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for bringing Special Branch and Crime Branch together under the command of a single Assistant Chief Constable-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then, in an unusual choice of words-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for implementing the other recommendations, by summer 2001.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
One reading of that suggests that the merger of the Special and the Crime Branches is not necessarily accepted and that it is, in any case, subject to the security situation. Whatever happens, it will take place after 2001, at the earliest.

<P>
We are concerned about the phasing-out of the full-time Reserve and about the recruitment of the part-time Reserve, including recruitment on a geographical basis. We debated that in previous sittings. The implementation plan confirms that the phasing-out of the full-time Reserve may not be addressed until late 2001 at the earliest and that the context for the renewal of contracts would then be three years. That was subject to the security situation. Whatever the justification for that, no timetables are offered for the required recruitment of the part-time Reserve on the geographical basis. When that will start? What numbers will be recruited? What targets will be established? I refer to those matters, because there is a need for timetables, targets and objectives. I am raising existing concerns about procrastination. That is why the Oversight Commission needs full powers in statute.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking about the Oversight Commissioner. Paragraph (1)(8) of new schedule 1 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may call on the Ombudsman to retire  if satisfied that the Oversight Commissioner has-

<P>
(i) been convicted of a criminal offence; or

<P>
(ii) become bankrupt.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Do I take it that that is a misprint? The Ombudsman would be called on to resign, if the Oversight Commissioner committed a criminal offence.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman repeat the question?

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> On page 1429 of the amendment paper, paragraph (1)(8) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may call on the Ombudsman to retire  if satisfied that the Oversight Commissioner has-

<P>
(i) been convicted of a criminal offence; or

<P>
(ii) become bankrupt.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Do I presume that that is a misprint and that it is intended to be the Oversight Commissioner who retires?

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has pointed out a flaw, and I thank him. It shows that no matter how often one reads an amendment, one can still miss something.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> It seemed a little unjust.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Wherever the Bill ends up, targets, deadlines and objectives for the implementation of policing reform must be set. Failure to do so would simply ensure that the old order prevailed. That is inconceivable. The Oversight Commissioner needs the powers of his office in statute to ensure the transformation to which Patten referred. New clauses 13 and 14 would achieve that.

<P>
I will take a step back and deal with new clause 5, which is a further development and refinement of my earlier arguments. Its contents are a proper and reasonable interpretation of Patten. It would enable the Oversight Commissioner to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>inquire into any matter related to the reform of policing in Northern Ireland.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That power arises from new clause 2, which says that the Oversight Commissioner
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall oversee the reform of policing in Northern Ireland.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Commissioner could fulfil that function better if he had the ability to conduct inquiries. Clearly, he would have to use the power judiciously, cautiously and only in appropriate circumstances. It would enable the Commissioner to pursue a matter, if the reform of policing had not been achieved in the required manner, and in such time-frame as he would need to make the decision to have a further inquiry.

<P>
That may arise beyond the control of any one party or directly from the responsibilities and failures of one party. The power of inquiry would give credibility and build confidence into the new office of Oversight Commissioner. It would facilitate the transformation in policing that we seek and give impetus to the new image.

<P>
New schedule 1 is consequential on the Oversight Commissioner being given the powers contained in the new clauses. The new schedule provides for such matters as the appointment procedure, including appointment for five years in the first instance, and the terms regarding remuneration and staffing. I am sure that the Committee will be glad to hear that I shall not read out all the technical matters specified in the schedule, as they are fairly self-evident.

<P>
I commend new clauses 2, 5, 13 and 14 and new schedule 1 to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, as I do not believe in supererogation. I shall simply make an observation that may interest the Committee. When I was a very young lad at school, I learned that the population of Northern Ireland was 1.5 million. About 20 years later-almost 40 years ago-when I was a young married man, the population suddenly increased to 1.6 million. I am not suggesting that I had a great deal to do with that increase. In the past month, I learned that the population of Northern Ireland had risen to 1.7 million. I have no doubt that that increase is due to the number of people now appointed to look after the police.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I did not know that there were so few. Perhaps we should increase the population by appointing more; that might also help the economic base, because most of the people who take such roles are paid handsomely for their efforts on behalf of the Government and the community.

<P>
New clauses 2, 5, 13 and 14 and new schedule 1 provide a statutory basis for the appointment of the Oversight Commissioner, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Down said. The Government want to place the commissioner's role on a statutory basis and we want to do that while remaining consistent with Patten.

<P>
In chapter 19 of the report, Patten clearly said that a commissioner should be appointed for five years to oversee changes and assure the community about progress on implementation. Patten suggested that the commissioner should review progress three or four times every year and that the Government, the Chief Constable, the Policing Board and the district policing partnerships should provide objectives with timetables, and report on progress. The commissioner could then report publicly and outline progress achieved, at the same time as identifying any obstacles to progress and seeking explanations about delays.

<P>
The terms of reference for the commissioner, who has already been appointed before any provisions have been enacted, are available to the Committee. It is important to recognise that we appointed the commissioner after an extensive trawl for someone of the standing required for what may prove to be a difficult role. I ask those who say that the Government are hanging back in implementing Patten to take into account our appointment of the commissioner. Apart from specifying a renewable appointment for three years, rather than Patten's suggestion of five, the terms of reference meet Patten's recommendation.

<P>
There have been several arguments about the time scale, but we hope that rapid progress will be made on the implementation of Patten's recommendations so that, in one sense, there will be no need for an extended existence of the postholder. The appointment is for a renewable three-year period. We intend to place the postholder on a proper statutory footing, in part to show our commitment to the role, but also because of the added status that it will give the commissioner.

<P>
To that extent, I would have been happy to accept the new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, but when compared with Patten's recommendations, they would clearly and significantly extend the commissioner's remit. I think therefore that my hon. Friend is going beyond the Patten report. For example, new clause 5 would enable the Oversight Commissioner to conduct inquiries. It would also give the commissioner an extensive range of inquiry powers, equal to those of the Secretary of State and the board. That was not envisaged by Patten, who made it clear that such power should rest with the Policing Board.

<P>
We should be mindful of Patten's warning about avoiding a situation where the police service is subject to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a confused proliferation of scrutiny<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as was made clear in paragraph 6.23 of the report. Too many people undertaking too many inquiries stop the police doing what they were established to do. If it were thought that inquiries were the way in which policing should be conducted, that would show an over-obsession with criticising policing. It should be carried out in the streets and in the communities, although there are powerful provisions for inquiries and scrutiny under the Bill.

<P>
Furthermore, I do not accept the need to make the Secretary of State and the ombudsman answerable to the Oversight Commissioner. New clause 13 would require them to produce objectives, targets and timetables in such form and relating to such matters as the oversight commissioner may direct. Patten said that the Government, the police and the Policing Board should provide the Oversight Commissioner with objectives and timetables and that they should report on the progress achieved at periodic review meetings. The terms of reference provide for all of that, and we believe such an approach to be appropriate. It is coupled with the ability of the commissioner to publish reports giving details of progress. That does not mean that he will accept what he has been told, but he will have the capability to report on progress.

<P>
The Secretary of State is, after all, answerable to the House, not the commissioner. That is the nature of our parliamentary democracy, because it would then be asked, ``To whom is the commissioner accountable in terms of his judgment?'' He will not stand up in a Committee or at the Dispatch Box and explain what he has done and be subject to such robust scrutiny-I have been through that myself during the past few weeks in this Committee. The Chief Constable is also operationally independent. The board is an independent body, too. In one sense, the Chief Constable had such powers anyway, but we are giving the board that status, too. We are currently working on the necessary Government amendments that will meet the underlying principle of my hon. Friend's proposal, but in a more proportionate way. We shall put the commissioner on a statutory footing and, hopefully, the amendments will be dealt with on Report.

<P>
My hon. Friend referred to several detailed matters, such as a holding centre, the merging of the criminal investigation branch and the special branch and a timetable for the wind-up of the full-time reserve. On the latter point, we debated how that could be handled and we gave the assurnce that it would not stop the engagement of the part-time reserve if there was a delay in that process. Those issues are contingent on the security profile of Northern Ireland.

<P>
People say, ``Abandon this,'' or ``Abandon that,'' but they never explain how the new environment would tackle terrorism or paramilitarism. They operate on the wish and hope that their approach will create a new climate. We are not in the new society yet in Northern Ireland-to appreciate that, we simply need to look at our television screens. Dissident republicans pose a daily threat, and we need powerful laws to tackle the problem. The Terrorism Bill, which is passing through the House, will deal with the matter on a UK-wide basis. When people argue for the removal of something within a firm timetable, they should consider what guarantees there are that their approach will achieve the stated objective.

<P>
I have explained our view of the new clauses and why we believe that our approach is wholly consistent with Patten. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down will withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Minister explained his view of the new clause, and said that the matter might be taken further on Report. At the rate that we are going, that could take a couple of months, although we will be allowed only a couple of hours. He emphasised the fact that these matters must be subject to the security situation. No one denies that. My party has no intention of putting the community in jeopardy because the new clauses would have effects X, Y or Z.

<P>
The new clauses and schedule involve a fair interpretation of Patten. I stress the importance of the appointment of the Oversight Commissioner, his terms of reference and ability to instigate inquiries. I assume that the fact that the Government will select and appoint the person who will be the Oversight Commissioner means that they are confident in his ability and integrity and have conducted the appropriate assessments. There is therefore no reason to fear that the powers in the new clauses will be abused. On that basis, I am not confident that the Government will appropriately reflect on Report the matters that we want to raise at that stage. I shall press the new clause to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I want to express my appreciation, Mr. O'Hara, to you and your colleagues, Mr. Malins and Mr. Benton, for your guidance and assistance. It has been, at times, a difficult Bill-a visit to Byzantium, indeed-but we have worked our way through it. Great patience has been required since our first meeting on 13 June.

<P>
There have been 10 sittings in which we have dealt with the 73 clauses and 7 schedules of the Bill. I thank all my colleagues on the Government Benches and, for the most part, Opposition Members for their contributions. Some said that we could not do it within such a time scale: well, we have. We have had a detailed, comprehensive and illuminating examination of the Bill. I thank members of the Committee, who have been constructive, if sometimes critical, in their contributions.

<P>
The Bill will ensure that the principles for policing laid down in the Good Friday agreement are met. It paves the way for a challenging and forward-looking set of changes to policing practice and culture in Northern Ireland. That said, the Government recognised that the Bill would need some adjustment during our considerations. I made it clear at the outset that we were prepared to consider constructive changes: we have lived up to that commitment.

<P>
We have accepted some changes, including some quite big ones, and undertaken to consider others. We dealt with the name issue today-indeed, we have just voted on it-and have already accepted several changes relating to safeguards and the board's powers of inquiry. We are considering other changes and will deal with them on Report. We have provided for aggregation of the 50:50 recruitment process and for any review of those special powers to include an assessment of their effectiveness in achieving a representative service. We removed the 10-year lifespan for those provisions. We altered some of the ombudsman provisions to clarify their meaning and the Government's intentions. Changes are being made to the arrangements on DPPs, based on submissions made to the Committee.

<P>
We accepted the argument of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone that the board's reports should be required to address more specifically the operation of DPPs. We dealt with the Oversight Commissioner, whose duties will be put on a statutory footing. On planning, the Secretary of State's objectives will now be ``long term'', and that report will be laid before Parliament. We accepted important changes on the oath and the code of ethics.

<P>
I have undertaken to consider how best to remove the word ``force'' from the Bill in respect of its description of the police in Northern Ireland. That will take effect at a later stage of the Bill's passage.

<P>
That shows that we have listened to all parties, and that we were prepared to take on board issues that improved or clarified the Bill. I thank all hon. Members for their contributions in that respect.

<P>
The Bill, as amended-it will undergo further fine-tuning on Report-points the way to the new beginning that was envisaged in the Good Friday agreement, with a police service that will be effective and efficient, acceptable, representative, subject to human rights norms, capable of maintaining law and order-an especially relevant point, given the trouble in Northern Ireland in recent days and nights-and working for and with the community.

<P>
The next stage of the Bill's passage beckons, and I am looking forward to its consideration on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> This has been one of the most interesting and difficult Bills that I have considered in Committee during my time in the House. The fact that we have reached this point-6.52 on this Thursday evening-is a tribute to you and your two fellow Chairmen, Mr. O'Hara. Throughout our proceedings, you have given us your wisdom and tolerance. You have steered us well and kept the mood of the Committee in good shape, bearing in mind that we have been dealing with a subject on which things might have got a bit awkward from time to time.

<P>
As well as endorsing what the Minister just said, I thank all the support staff who helped the Committee to do its work-Hansard, the police, and everyone else whom I have not mentioned.

<P>
I was one of those who got it wrong about the timing of the Committee-I thought that we were in for a real grind. During the first sitting, I wrote my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield a note, the contents of which I can now reveal to the Committee. It read: ``The Minister wants out by 6 July. Seamus Mallon wants to amend the Bill out of sight. Ken Maginnis obliquely anticipated a guillotine. I am beginning to think a guillotine is inevitable. To get a guillotine, the convention is that the Government must ensure that the Committee has got a substantial number of sitting hours under its belt. Bring a razor and a toothbrush.'' I am happy to say that it did not work out quite like that. I am still reasonably clean-shaven.

<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke and, in particular, my extremely talented friend, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, whose fees I will never be able to afford.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I wish to add my voice to the remarks that have been made, especially about you, Mr. O'Hara, and Mr. Malins and Mr. Benton. I thank the Table Office for the help that we have received. It was invaluable, and I hope that it will be sustained over the next week or so.

<P>
I thank everyone who has listened patiently and has made a difficult task simpler by the attention that has been given. I am now in my 18th year in the House, and once thought that I would never participate in a Bill's passage, because, for far too long, Northern Ireland was dealt with by Order in Council. At least in my latter days here, I have experienced something worth while, in which democracy has played a proper part. I hope that the Bill can be improved further as it reaches its final stages. I am grateful to everyone who participated, particularly you, Mr. O'Hara, and your colleagues. Without your careful handling, we would not have achieved as much as we have.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The whole process shows what can be achieved when the Government listen to me [Laughter.]-and others. This has been an exercise in flexibility, and I hope that it has resulted in good legislation, but the true test will be in the Province rather than this place. We have some way to go on Report, but our proceedings have been enjoyable and I cannot wait to do it all again.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I should like to endorse the thanks to you, Mr. O'Hara, and your co-Chairmen. I am aware of the suffering that you have endured in the past couple of weeks. I am grateful for your advice, both in public and private, on how to proceed. Through you, I thank your officials who sit beside you, and those who are not present today.

<P>
It would be tempting to conclude with a winding-up speech, but that is forbidden by the rules. Next Tuesday will be a Martian day rather than an Earth day, because the Minister will have to make so many references back to our proceedings that matters will take a long time to conclude. I am not optimistic about the direction in which the Bill is heading, and if I continue in this vein my remarks might take on the characteristics of panegyric, but that is not my intention. I still live in the hope that rescue can be made on the Floor of the House next Tuesday. The night of 11 July is an auspicious date in Northern Ireland, on which we celebrate all sorts of things. I like to think that we will celebrate the real creation of a new police service, but I severely doubt whether we can achieve that. Nevertheless, I once again thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and-with one or two rare exceptions-Committee members for their courtesy to me.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The final word is, as always, with the Chairman, and I have my thanks to make. In particular, I thank my Clerk for his sharp mind, forbearance and occasional sharp elbow, which made its contribution to keeping the Committee in order. I thank the Hansard staff and the Attendant, who has ensured satisfactory communication between Committee members and me. I thank the police for keeping order, although that did not prove particularly necessary, and those on my right who are traditionally seen but not heard. In this Committee, they were occasionally heard, but I resigned myself to the thought that no one can conduct Northern Ireland and Irish business of any sort in complete order and silence.

<P>
Finally, I thank the Committee members. I said at the outset that I was concerned that, although I might keep order, certain matters that were nevertheless in order might have wider implications. We have all been conscious that Bills such as this really matter outside in the streets, and I am grateful to everyone for taking to heart that important point. All members of the Committee have deep and sometimes incompatible convictions on the matter and I am grateful for the good humour and mutual respect in which our business was conducted.

<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull mentioned time and the hon. Member for South Down referred to Greek philosophers and opportunity. The Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), knows that I take the words of the Greek philosophers to heart and I have some for the Committee: chronos estin en hoi keros, keros d'en hoi chronos ou polis-time is well endowed with opportunity, but opportunity is not well endowed with time. The final word of that quotation is pronounced ``police''.

<P>
