<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 26, line 37, leave out from `investigation' to end of line 40 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a specific operation;
<P>
(b) in such a manner as is likely to result in the obtaining of private information about a person (whether or not one specifically identified for the purposes of the investigation or operation); and
<P>
(c) otherwise than by way of an immediate response to events or circumstances the nature of which is such that it would not be reasonably practicable for an authorisation under this Part to be sought for the carrying out of the surveillance.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 163 to 166.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> With this group of amendments, we are attempting to clarify the definition of ``directed surveillance''. In order to deal with a number of concerns, including those raised on Second Reading by the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce), we want to make the circumstances in which it would be beneficial to obtain an authorisation more easily understood.
<P>
The definition of ``directed surveillance'' has given us considerable problems. We all know what sorts of cases are meant—those investigations or operations, planned beforehand by the police and others, in which surveillance teams follow targets covertly to obtain information about what they are doing, where they are going and who they are meeting. We also know that directed surveillance is not limited to those cases in which it is likely that information about targets will be obtained.
<P>
If an operation is likely to pick up private information, it should be capable of being authorised, regardless of whose information it is. However, it has not been easy to put that in legislative terms. Our first attempt, seen in this draft of the Bill, has confused those operational practitioners whom we consulted—as the hon. Member for South Dorset pointed out on Second Reading. It was not clear to them where the distinction lies between general observation, which forms part of their normal duties, and covert, directed forms of surveillance that may infringe someone's private and family life. That distinction needs to be put on a statutory basis to satisfy the requirements of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
The amendments are intended to give a much clearer and more precise definition of ``directed surveillance''. That will make it easier for the police and other agencies to know when and in what circumstances they should seek authorisation for their activities. It will ensure that the provisions cover criminal investigations of the sort undertaken by the police and Customs and Excise, and intelligence-gathering operations of the sort carried out by security and intelligence agencies. It also makes it clear that obtaining information about a person's private and family life is the key factor in deciding whether an authorisation should be obtained. An authorisation can be applied for if surveillance is likely to gather such information about a person, whether or not he is the target.
<P>
Finally, the amendments ensure that unplanned surveillance, which could not be foreseen and authorised in advance, is not unlawful. Occasions will inevitably arise when, for instance, a police officer sees a person acting suspiciously and will follow that person to see whether he is acting criminally. Such everyday police work is essential to the prevention of crime and the detection of offenders. We must not introduce legislation that could hinder it, but such activities do not lend themselves to being authorised in advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. A. J. Beith </B>(Berwick-upon-Tweed): I welcome the Government's amendments. We are concerned about the definitions in this part of the Bill. We have on tabled amendments that are directed to related problems, particularly on the reasonable expectation of privacy.
<P>
It is a difficult line to draw, and legitimate law enforcement activity can reach the boundary that the Minister described. We all know, from talking to police officers, how tiresome their lives can be if their job is surrounded by bureaucratic procedure. However, an important civil liberty must be protected—the right of privacy. If we do not get it right in the Bill, the Bill will not be proof against the European convention on human rights, the Home Secretary's certificate will lose its value and problems will be taken to the courts as people seek proper protection of their civil rights. I welcome the Government's attempt to achieve a better definition that is beneficial to the citizen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's comments and commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 26, line 42, leave out from `that' to end of line 3 on page 27 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`interferes with any person's privacy in circumstances where that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 168, in page 27, line 11, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> As my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said, we are concerned about the definitions contained in part II as we take surveillance seriously as a potential means for the invasion of individual privacy. The amendments would secure a better definition of ``intrusive surveillance''. The Minister said that there were concerns about the definition of ``directed surveillance'' and tabled an amendment inserting an alternative form into the Bill. We feel that the current definition of ``intrusive surveillance'' also requires reconsideration.
<P>
The definition contained in the clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the presence of an individual, or of any surveillance device, on any residential premises or in any private vehicle.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That describes a set of circumstances but does not relate to the original mischief that has caused the Bill to be introduced—compliance with ECHR article 8. We have considered judgments on breach of ECHR article 8 and have tried to take a definition from them. Our definition is based on circumstances in which a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has a reasonable expectation of privacy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It can cover a wider range of circumstances, but it is more appropriate in the Bill than reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any residential premises or . . . any private vehicle.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
People can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in many settings. For example, the definition of ``intrusive surveillance'' should cover offices, workplaces and other premises that are similarly used but which are not defined as residential premises. Legitimate placement by the authorities of a device or individual in such premises for surveillance purposes is just as intrusive as it would be in residential premises. Our definition is one of principle and is therefore better than the current one, which tends to limit intrusiveness to specific circumstances. Amendment No. 167 would change clause 5(3)(a) accordingly and we hope that the Minister will tell us whether he believes that there is a better way of defining where intrusion has occurred.
<P>
Amendment No. 168 would remove subsection (5) from the clause. Its objective is also to expand the definition of ``intrusive surveillance'' by changing the definition of ``directed surveillance''. It deals with the other side of the matter, as subsection (5) specifies circumstances in which surveillance
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is not intrusive unless the device is such that it consistently provides information of the same quality and detail as might be expected to be obtained from a device actually present on the premises or in the vehicle.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We understand that subsection to mean that lower-quality devices would not be defined as intrusive.
<P>
The amendments seek not to prevent surveillance but to broaden the definition of ``intrusive surveillance'' and to ensure that the Bill is as compliant as possible with ECHR article 8. They would require the application of a higher test for permission to conduct intrusive surveillance, which may be operated internally, instead of the lower-level test that we suspect will currently be applied in relation to authorisations for directed surveillance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I understand the amendments' purpose and what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to do. I note also that the proposals follow on from points made on Second Reading by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, who expressed particular concerns about offices. The Government believe that there is a choice between lessening criteria for the authorisation of intrusive surveillance to cover all crime and restricting them to cover serious crime in the interests of national security, economic well-being and so on, which is the course that we have adopted. I want to explain why we have chosen that and to convince the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) of why the amendment is impractical in character.
<P>
I appreciate hon. Members' concerns to protect individuals' privacy, but the practicalities are serious. The amendment would increase the stringent requirements attached to the authorisation of intrusive surveillance to a much wider range of activities, currently covered under the provisions for directed surveillance. Although there would be no problem in identifying in advance operations involving residential premises—that was one of the points that the hon. Gentleman made—or private vehicles, the same could not be said of mobile surveillance, which makes up the majority of operations.
<P>
The amendment would mean, for example, that the police would have to know before each covert surveillance operation began where their target was likely to go and whether he might find himself in circumstances in which he or another could have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Generally, the police and other operatives would not have the information and therefore could not make the judgment. They would not know at the start of the day whether their target would spend the day dealing in drugs or meeting criminal associates to plan an armed robbery, or whether he was meeting a friend, going for a drink and a meal and then visiting the home of another friend. They would not have such information at the start of the process. It is not possible to expect the police and others conducting surveillance to decide beforehand on the expectation of privacy of the target and associates. That is why, fundamentally, there are serious and practical questions about the amendment.
<P>
The level of intrusion is proportionate to the seriousness of the offence or other activity being investigated. That is why we have restricted the use of intrusive surveillance so that it can be conducted only on the grounds of serious crime, national security or the economic well-being of the UK. However, the definition provided in the amendments would incorporate a significant number of other activities undertaken by other public bodies. That was the intention of the amendments, reasonably and explicitly. The activities would range from investigating tax evasion and benefit fraud to health inspections of restaurants.
<P>
No central records are kept of the number of covert surveillance operations conducted each year. However, police estimates suggest that they alone undertake more than 60,000 operations across the range of activities. In addition, operations are conducted by Customs and Excise, the security and intelligence agencies, many departments and local authorities. The activities are deliberately covered by the Bill but not classed as intrusive surveillance. To expect many of those cases to require prior approval would bring the statutory functions to a standstill, significantly restricting the activities of the police and others.
<P>
Instead, we need clear guidelines that operatives can easily follow, setting out the specific circumstances and locations in which people have a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy. People generally have the greatest expectation of privacy in their homes and private vehicles when going about their everyday lives. We have responded to the special protection given by article 8 to a person's home. Those are the instances in which we have restricted action to serious matters and in which cases have been given the highest protection.
<P>
A person's rights under article 8 must be carefully weighed against the purpose for which surveillance is required in other situations. They are dealt with as directed surveillance. The most intrusive categories must be fenced off and made subject to the most stringent safeguards.
<P>
I hope that I have explained to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam why we have taken those decisions. I also hope that he will be prepared, on consideration, to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, although I entirely understand that his motivation was positive in seeking to clarify the situation as I have tried to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We might want to refer to the subject later: the concern remains. For example, we talked about office premises when considering the case of United Kingdom v. Halford, which specifically applied to interception but which had a general judgment concerning article 8 of the ECHR. Office premises remain anomalous—there might also be a reasonable expectation of privacy in offices. One could imagine workplaces in which that would be the case. The dividing line between residential and work premises is not always as clear as it would have to be here.
<P>
Given the Minister's response, it is worth our coming up with an alternative to secure our wish to control intrusive surveillance as far as is possible. That would allow individuals the maximum confidence that such surveillance would be used only when they could reasonably expect its use, and in a way that they could understand was proportionate to the mischief that the Government sought to deal with. We are comfortable with the principle of such surveillance relating only to serious crime and are pleased to see that provision. Given what the Minister has said, it is best that we go away and consider how that test relates to the breadth of premises we are trying to cover with amendments such as this.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment at this time.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 163, in page, 28, line 3, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In this section ``private information'', in relation to a person, includes any information relating to his private or family life.'—[Mr. Charles Clarke.]<P>

<P>
Question proposed, that clause 25, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. In the Official Report for Tuesday 28 March, part II, column 270, it states that clause 23 was ordered to stand part of the Bill. However, as is clear from the cover of that part, clause 24 was also agreed to. Is that in order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> There is an error, which will be corrected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> On clause 25 stand part, there is one aspect that I should like to refer to the Minister. When we were dealing with clause 3(2), which deals with interception without a warrant where one party consents and there is an authorised surveillance—what is known as participant monitoring—we discussed the regime that would apply. Clause 25(4)(b) directs that surveillance of that kind would fall into the category of directed, not intrusive, surveillance.
<P>
Representations have been made to us that participant monitoring, which is particularly relevant in cases where undercover police or informers are used to obtain evidence from suspects, is often intrusive. However, in the Bill it is considered as non-intrusive. It is difficult to see how that fits with article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Given that participant monitoring is intrusive, how can the Minister argue that the same level of safeguards should not be applied as in other forms of intrusive surveillance? The Minister will be aware of the comment by Justice, among others, with reference to the 1999 case of Lambert v. France in the European Court of Human Rights. It was argued that where a person's telephone calls have been intercepted on a friend's telephone line, article 8 is relevant and protects people, not telephone lines. In the case of Duarté in Canada, the Supreme Court held that participant monitoring exceptions directly contradict the principle that it is the person whose privacy is being infringed who should be afforded safeguards.
<P>
The problem is made worse by the very general provisions of clause 44, which allow the Home Secretary, if he choose, to order that matters that the Bill considers to be directed surveillance be treated as intrusive, and vice versa. That makes a mockery of this part of the Bill. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on why this form of participant monitoring is being dealt with as directed rather than intrusive surveillance, given its nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am sorry to add to everybody's thoughts, but the perspective of history may be useful. The primary distinction between directed and intrusive surveillance in the law at present relates to whether access was obtained to the property in order to place a device in it. That definition is extended by the ``quality of image'' point included in the clause, which is a welcome extension because, from the citizen's point of view, the primary issue is not whether someone entered that citizen's property to intrude on his or her privacy, but whether someone succeeded in intruding on his or her privacy. It is worth remembering that the original basis on which intrusion on property came to be the test for invasion of privacy was almost an accident of history, because there was no legal protection in that area, except the possibility that the police might sue for trespass or criminal damage. The Police Act 1997 sought to deal with that problem by establishing protections for the citizen against that sort of intrusive surveillance, but it was never a logical way to define invasion of privacy.
<P>
Invasion of privacy involves public authorities or anyone else obtaining information about a person's private or family life or invading one's personal or private space—not necessarily physically, but perhaps through some advanced technological device that enables people to hear or see what another person is doing on his or her premises. It is helpful that the clause has extended that definition, but we must never imagine that the distinction between intrusive and directed surveillance, in so far as it is based on physical intervention on property, has a logical or coherent basis. It arose simply because it was the sort of activity that might have exposed the police to potential legal action and, therefore, had to be subject to some control. The law in that area is put together in the strangest ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I should like to clarify a few issues. As my right hon. Friend said, some distinctions have arisen by historical accident. We need to make it clear to the public what sort of surveillance may take place and into which categories it will fall.
<P>
On the distinction between directed and intrusive surveillance, in the context of the quality of the image, I am mindful of my recent visit to the National Assembly for Wales, where Members all have personal computers on their desks so that they can type their e-„mails. I went to the broadcasting suite, where the cameras are of such a good quality that one can home down and see what e-mails all Assembly Members are typing as they type them. Assembly Members are subject to intrusive surveillance, whereas the cameras in our Chamber, which cannot permit that—at least, I hope that they cannot—carry out directed surveillance. I use a very small laptop computer, which I hope that they cannot read.
<P>
That sort of example will cause all the definitions to be challenged. That situation relates to the individual—to the suspect sitting at his or her computer, typing e-mails that say, ``Send the drugs in on Thursday by speedboat'' or whatever. The Bill provides for various methods by which that information could be trapped. If messages are trapped after they have left the British Telecom white box in someone's house, that comes under the category of interception of communications, which we dealt with earlier. However, the communications of an individual sitting in his or her house could be intercepted in several ways. I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on how those methods will be categorised.
<P>
A person could sit outside with a long-lens camera and read the material on screen as it is typed—an effective method because it solves all the problems of decryption. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be measured. Ministry of Defence establishments have large shields around their buildings to prevent people from pointing devices at them to read characters off the screen—they know what people are typing by picking up radiation from the screen. Such devices would probably fall into the category of intrusive surveillance because they pick up detailed information.
<P>
There are other devices that the Government might wish to use, although the Minister does not like to go too far in discussing the technology. One of the tools for picking up information will be the software bug—the equivalent of placing a closed circuit television camera or audio bug in a building—which would fall under the category of intrusive surveillance. The security services will be able to ask an internet service provider to send down the wires something that will sit on the individual's computer. Once the plaintext has been decrypted and the individual is reading the e-mail, that text can be sent back up the wires to an appropriate person—or transmitted in another way, such as by wireless to a person sitting outside in a van.
<P>
A range of such technologies will be used, and I assume that they will fall into the intrusive surveillance category, but it is useful that people should know about it. However, I understand that interfering with someone's computer is a form of criminal damage under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. That is certainly how it is perceived. Planting devices is intrusive surveillance, which is not currently deemed to be an offence, but it is important to know whether planting software devices will be covered by that exemption.
<P>
Clause 25(4) seems to be concerned with intrusive surveillance. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of this Part surveillance is not intrusive to the extent that . . . it is surveillance consisting in any such interception of a communication as falls within section 45(4).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 45(4) states that the individual should have given consent for his communications to be intercepted. If the individual types on his computer, ``Send the drugs on Thursday,'' and if the individual to whom that note is sent is a supergrass or someone prepared to give information to the authorities and has consented to that message being collected and passed on, that is surely directed surveillance.
<P>
I simply want the Minister to clarify the levels of surveillance that may take place. If an individual uses a computer to send e-mail and if the authorities have the permission of the person at the other end, it is directed surveillance. If software bugs are planted in the computer, it would be intrusive surveillance. If information is picked up once it has left the British Telecom white box, we are into the interception of communications. All of those activities have a slightly different regime of authorisation, and slightly different criteria apply to the way in which they are carried out and supervised.
<P>
It is important that we get these things right as we go through the Bill. As has been mentioned, there are some inconsistencies between the way in which authorisations can be given. In some ways I regret that we have to go on about technology, because it is rather anoraky, but if we do not talk about it, people will not have a clear idea of what types of activity can be carried out under each category.
<P>
Technology is moving on all the time, and its capabilities are constantly improving. The Minister said that the law enforcement agencies feel threatened by new technology because it is a challenge to them. However, if one looks in the shop windows in Tottenham Court road, one can see that surveillance equipment is easily available. Without going into detail and giving away trade secrets, we need to ensure that such devices—for instance, equipment that can pick up electromagnetic radiation, or that will allow long-lens reading of computer screens—are covered by the Bill. We must ensure that the Government are mindful of that ever-changing technology when considering clause 25 and the Bill generally.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This has been a useful set of exchanges. First, the hon. Gentleman was wrong to say that we should be worried about being anoraky about technology. We should not be worried; I see no anoraks. He should not be apologetic for raising the point because the whole Bill, especially those parts of it that wrestle with such technology, has to deal with a changing technology that will continue to change.
<P>
The clause seeks to define ``covert'' and the conduct that comes within the provisions of part II—that is, directed surveillance, intrusive surveillance and the conduct and use of covert human intelligence sources. The Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Police Act 1997 provide a statutory basis only for interference with property. The Bill's provisions go wider, thereby satisfying the requirement of the European convention on human rights by providing a legal basis for other forms of covert activity that interfere with article 8 rights.
<P>
The provisions do not extend the current activities of the police or other agencies. They regulate those activities already in use and safeguard the public from unwarranted invasions of privacy. Despite the difficulties raised about ensuring that the definitions are correct, it is important to place on the record that that extension of the rights of the individual is the result of the coming into effect of the Human Rights Act 1998. Those rights did not exist under previous legislation. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, it is intended to ensure compliance with the convention and protection from legal challenge.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The distinction that we have drawn is not based on property as such, but we have given particular protection to a person's home, because the word ``home'' appears in article 8 of the European convention on human rights—although I understand the point made by the right hon. Gentleman about offices.
<P>
As to participant monitoring, the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and for Hallam are right. Interception with consent will be treated as directed surveillance. Clause 45(4) sets out how it will be dealt with. The reason for our approach is that although one-party consent is intrusive, as is implied, it is not as intrusive as no consent. We consider that to be proportionality—a concept that runs right through the Bill—at work. Surveillance is defined at different levels according to conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> May I just deal with the point on Lambert v. France before giving way? We entirely accept the principles in that case and believe that our approach is consistent with the judgment. We are giving article 8 protection to a caller whose line is monitored with the participation of the other caller. To comply with the judgment, we are allowing access to the tribunal to all persons with complaints about interception. The way in which that will be done is dealt with later in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister will recognise that some of the most difficult and sensitive evidence dealt with by courts relates to conversations between a suspect and an undercover officer who has represented himself as someone else. Questions about agents provocateurs, for example, often arise. It is a sensitive area. Is it enough, when considering the invasion of the suspect's privacy in those cases, to argue that the police officer consented to the monitoring of the call? Suspects have sometimes been acquitted because of unsatisfactorily conducted operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is a fair point and I hope and believe that it will be dealt with by the authorisation processes in the Bill, so that unsatisfactory procedures could not be used. The framework of law allows that. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point that the other participant in the conversation could be a police officer acting as he describes, but we believe that the procedures that we are establishing will cover that. However, I shall think about the hon. Gentleman's technical point, to see whether a more effective approach is possible.
<P>
The question to be asked about software bugs, which the hon. Member for Hallam mentioned, concerns the software used. Different types of bug would work in different ways. Off the cuff, one might expect most of the relevant ones to be more likely to come into the intrusive surveillance than the directed surveillance category. However, that might not be the case for certain forms of software. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would clarify what type of software he has in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The query follows on from our earlier discussions about intercepted communications, in which we established that the BT white box in the home was the end point of the public telecommunications network, for which an interception-of-communications-type warrant would be relevant. My understanding of the technology that could be used includes, for example, an internet service provider's software on a user's computer, which makes the connection and sends packets back and forth. That could be altered in a way equivalent to a software virus to read the plaintext. E-mail sent by the user is decrypted and presented on screen as legible characters, but instead of going through the entire decryption process, an effective way to obtain the contents of the e-mail would be for the software to pick it up at the appropriate stage and send it back to the internet service provider in those packets. Without being technically expert the user would not be able to tell what was going back and forth. Such surveillance will be increasingly useful to the security services because it avoids all the decryption nonsense.
<P>
That form of surveillance is in principle broadly equivalent to a telephone bug, except that the bug would not be physical. By extension, such software devices could read the contents of an entire hard disk and send them back bit by bit over a period. If desired, a physical device could be used to permit wireless technology to broadcast the information to a person sitting in a van outside. There is a huge range of useful possibilities, and I wanted to clarify how what I described would fit into existing categories. My present understanding is that it would be intrusive surveillance broadly comparable to the other types.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> This is a very interesting debate. My officials and I have been thinking about the hon. Gentleman's point while he has been speaking, and our view is that he has been describing interference with property or an offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. It would need top-level authorisation under the Police Act 1997 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants. I shall consider the matter, because I accept that it is difficult to foresee all technological developments. If what I have said turns out to have been misleading, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman, but I think that it is right.
<P>
I want to add to what I told the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire earlier. Circumstances in which an undercover officer was recording what went on would be treated as authorisation of covert source, not directed surveillance. The issue there would be breach of trust, not the location of the breach. All that would happen then would be recording of what took place.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>

<H4><center>Authorisation of directed surveillance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 29, line 4, leave out from `department' to end of line 7.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it is convenient to take amendment No. 170, in clause 28, page 29, line 39, leave out from `department' to end of line 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Clause 27(3)(g) is another of those odd little bits of the Bill that leave the Secretary of State powers to make additions. In this instance, he is given the power to add grounds for authorisation. We find that odd, not to say objectionable. It is odd because the list of other grounds in the subsection is comprehensive and clearly modelled on the European convention on human rights. The Secretary of State appears to be giving himself the power to add grounds that might not accord with it.
<P>
It is difficult to imagine what relevant grounds the Government could envisage besides national security, crime prevention, the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, public safety and health, and the collection of taxes, duties and levies. If they found something that they considered sufficient ground for authorisation, the idea that it should be dealt with by an order under the negative procedure is also objectionable. The Bill already provides a wide enough range of grounds for authorisations, which conform to the ECHR. We do not see why they should be added to, but any additions that are made should not be made in the proposed manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I should like to add a minor point. The clause for the first time connects the purpose of protecting public health with surveillance. The list of public authorities that can make authorisations appears in clause 29(4). Those authorities are police forces, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the National Crime Squad, any of the intelligence services, the Ministry of Defence, any of Her Majesty's forces, the commissioners of Customs and Excise and other such public authorities.
<P>
None of the authorities listed in clause 29(4)(a) to (g) directly relates to public health. Security threats from foreign Governments or from international terrorists, who might operate under the protection of a foreign Government, could relate to public health, which such activities might put at risk by using toxins and so on. The security services would be deeply involved in such matters. Generally, none of the bodies that may direct surveillance has any interest in protecting public health in the way that we usually understand that phrase. The police have an interest in safety—

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening carefully to the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, but I cannot see how they refer specifically to the amendments. His comments might be more relevant in a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I understand your point, Mr. O'Hara, but I shall explain how my remarks are relevant to the amendment, which seeks to delete clause 27(3)(g). That provision states that the Secretary of State may make an order
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for any purpose (not falling within paragraphs (a) to (f)).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that the Secretary of State may use his powers under paragraph (g) to exemplify the purpose of protecting public health and to grant authorisations to parties such as environmental health officers, trading standards officers and councils, the medical profession or public health laboratories. I am not making my point clear and I understand that the Minister may be mystified; it is these early hours of the morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is as clear as daylight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is a very murky day outside.
<P>
I am concerned that the clause specifies the purpose of protecting public health and grants the Secretary of State a more general order-making power that applies to any other purposes. For example, environmental health officers, who cannot make authorisations, could ask the Secretary of State to grant powers under subsection (3)(g) to allow them to do their duty to protect public health. Could the Bill be used to grant them such powers? Is there any danger that the Government could use paragraph (g) to extend the range of powers and people who may make authorisations under other provisions in the Bill, in order to fulfil the obligation imposed by paragraph (e), which refers to protecting public health?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> On the point made by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed about ECHR article 8, am I right in thinking that the Minister will not be able to specify any purpose under paragraph (g) other than one that is covered by article 8? I think that the Minister is nodding. If I am correct, why does paragraph (g) grant such a power? The only item that I can think of which is not currently covered is the protection of morals, which would be a rather odd addition for the Minister to make—unless he would like to tell us something. If that is the only category left, and the Minister is not thinking of protecting morals by authorising directed surveillance or covert human intelligence operations, is paragraph (g) needed?
<P>
Perhaps the Minister could have the strength of his convictions and say, ``We have worked out what our purposes are and we do not need a catch-all clause for once''. The parliamentary draftsman always gives the Minister a catch-all clause. That has been the case in almost every part of the Bill, but are such catch-all clauses necessary? Perhaps, if they are not, we could do without them.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Let me first deal with the points made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) in what was a clear exposition for this time of the morning. I always hesitate in the Committee to use the term ``rapier-like'', but I thought that it tended toward the rapier-like. I can reassure him on this. The Department of Health does undertake directed surveillance and will be designated by order under the Bill. If we are talking specifically about the situation as regards health, the Department of Health is involved in the situation.
<P>
I shall now respond to the point raised by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. First, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire is right. The grounds would have to be those covered by article 8 of the European convention, as the Human Rights Act 1998 makes clear. It also makes it unlawful to make an order that is incompatible with the convention. That is the case in all circumstances. We have carried this through in the Bill, so its existing form clearly sets out the grounds on which we believe that the article 8 coverage could be used in relation to these forms of surveillance.
<P>
I understand the general concern about catch-all clauses; that is a legitimate point to make. When we discussed the subject when we debated clause 6, I undertook to consider, and we still are actively considering, whether the particular paragraph—I believe that it was 6(2)(k)—in that context could be used to meet the point being made by the Committee. I hope to be able to inform the Committee on that matter soon.
<P>
The two article 8(2) definitions of the European convention on human rights' grounds that we have not included on the face of the Bill are, first, the one that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire raised concerning the protection of morals; and secondly, the definition concerning the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Those are the two categories that are not included on the face of the Bill. The reason for this is the same as that referred to by the hon. Gentleman—that at present we can think of no reason why public authorities would wish to use those exemptions as grounds for using intrusive investigative techniques. Therefore, we thought it inappropriate to put the definitions on the face of the Bill
<P>
However, we are not fully aware of all the ways in which the Human Rights Act 1998 may impact on the activities of public authorities. As has been widely reported, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has said that our knowledge on that will evolve over time. No doubt there will be political discussion on those points as the Act moves forward in a variety of ways. As these issues become more apparent, we shall be in a better position to judge. The Government of the day might find that there were legitimate grounds for using intrusive techniques in relation to the other article 8(2) exemptions on public morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Therefore, we thought it wise to include this provision in the Bill.
<P>
To summarise, the European convention on human rights article 8(2) requirements not included in the Bill at present—on the protection of morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others—are not there because at present there is no need for them. However, we do know that the law on the subject will evolve in the coming years as the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into effect. The Government of the day may decide that it does need powers in that area. That is why we have the clause. I hope that, on the basis of that explanation, the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Are there any circumstances in which it would be right to authorise directed surveillance or covert human intelligence work to protect public morals although that was not related to the prevention or detection of crime, which is already covered? If it was a criminal offence such as paedophilia, everybody would agree and it would already be covered. If it was not, and was just a matter of public morals, would the provision not be a bit strong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I acknowledge the force of the hon. Gentleman's point but I can only repeat what I said about why the provision has not been included. I am not making a party political point, but I am acutely aware that not everybody agreed with our decision to include the European convention on human rights in British law or with the Human Rights Act 1998. Many individuals, for good reasons, did not think that that was the right thing to do; the issue was widely debated. Whatever one's view on that fundamental point, the law in this area will evolve over the coming years. It is important that the Government retain the power to consider the question carefully as the law evolves, especially in the key area of intrusive surveillance. That is why we have retained the clause. I hope that the Committee will resist the amendment, or preferably that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed will accept my points and withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Before the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed withdraws the amendment, will the Minister say more about the intriguing admission that the Department of Health will be one of those designated by order? The Department might have a legitimate role under another part, but surely not in the part dealing with authorisation of directed surveillance and, I hope, not in that dealing with intrusive surveillance. The Public Health Laboratory Service Board has a role in the surveillance of public health, but that just means getting reports from doctors all the time about rates of measles, chicken pox, rabies and so on. There might be a suggestion that the Department has its own special police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I, too, am interested in the Minister's point about the Department of Health. Does his reference cover my experience of the investigation of prescription fraud? I worked for a health authority that sat someone outside a pharmacist to check whether the people going in and out were defrauding the prescription system by ticking the box to claim that they were unemployed or over 65 when they were not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If the Minister meant a special internal police branch in the Department of Health dealing with such a crime, drug fraud in hospitals or simple theft—half a billion pounds worth of goods is stolen from hospitals, ranging from heart and lung machines to sheets and towels—that would be legitimate and I would be reasonably happy.
<P>
The Department has a customary role in trying to extend its powers to cover all aspects of our lives. I had experience of it in the early 1990s, trying to regulate the temperatures of sandwiches and cheese. I was worried that it might wish to use the clause to empower environmental health officers to increase their powers to investigate our lives. Many of them are fine individually, but collectively they represent one of the worst examples of a police state to be found.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I hope that I can offer satisfaction—I am always keen to offer that to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. As I said, we are considering only direct surveillance in relation to the Department of Health. Of the three specific examples that I want to give him, one relates to sandwiches, but the first concerns the Medical Devices Agency. It is part of the Department and it uses surveillance to observe the premises of businesses suspected of supplying counterfeit devices or of continuing to provide devices that have been banned by the Secretary of State for safety reasons. I do not know whether that is thought to be unacceptable, but it is important.
<P>
The second example, which deals with the sandwiches point, concerns the Food Standards Agency. It is responsible for the enforcement of meat hygiene and related controls in licensed slaughterhouses. Surveillance is used to target individuals or premises, purchases at market or activities at premises, such as deliveries to farms where illegal activities are suspected. The point is not trivial. Following our experience of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, having a state system through the FSA that can secure and give confidence to the population regarding the safety of our means of handling food, especially meat, is extremely important. The use of surveillance to ensure that nobody is trying to evade the established rigorous regime is perfectly reasonable. If people evaded the regime and confidence is lost, that would cause the same sort of crisis as the one that we experienced in relation to BSE.
<P>
The third example is the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which has the power to enforce various sections of the Medicines Act 1968 and uses covert surveillance to ensure that there is no breach of that Act by pharmacists of businesses registered with it. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman thinks that that is unreasonable, but I do not because I believe that the Medicines Act l 968 should be properly supervised. Those are the examples of the types of directed surveillance in which the Department of Health might be engaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I shall be brief, although we might like to return to the matter at a future date. The Minister's suggestion is reasonable. I was a member of the Committee that considered the Food Standards Act 1999, and I accept that the agency should have some investigatory powers. I appreciate that the Bill is a general Bill, which regulates investigatory powers in many Government Departments, but I would like the specific powers for the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency to be introduced in separate legislation.
<P>
We assumed that the Bill would deal with powers for the Security Service, Customs and Excise, and important state departments that deal with criminal matters, national security and intelligence. However, parts of the Bill will enable the Department of Health to carry out surveillance. I do not like the smell of that. The greater the number of Government Departments that get in on the back of a Bill that is aimed at the security service, the more worrying it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am sorry to prolong the debate, but the key point is that that activity is taking place. The Bill's purpose is to bring that activity within a regulatory regime that allows the European convention on human rights to be honoured. I am not saying that the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting any diversion from that, but one main element of the Bill is to establish protections relating to surveillance that is already being carried out by a wide range of state agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> In that case, will the Minister table amendments on Report to mention the Department of Health and any other relevant Government Departments in the Bill, instead of granting them powers on the back of the Bill or by order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> It had not occurred to me before, but does my right hon. Friend think that the Home Office might possibly already have a provisional list of authorities for which it is thinking of introducing powers by order? Clearly, the Minister has already discussed with his officials how the issue relates to the Department of Health. Does he not think that it would be helpful, while we are dealing with the issue of purposes, to know which authorities the Government contemplate including in the provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is right; it would be helpful. It makes us suspicious when we see the clause and hear the Department of Health mentioned. If the Minister has a list of authorities, let us hear it. Better still, will he include the list of authorities in the Bill so that their powers are nailed down? I do not want the Department of Health to be able to boast in future that it is mentioned in a Bill along with the security services, MI5 and MI6, and that it has a status that it does not deserve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> There is no secret. We have a provisional list, which I would be happy to publish. A large part of the preparations for the Bill entailed discussing with various Government Departments what they do, so that they can be brought within the regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> With his customary decency, the Minister offers to make a move that will help the Committee. I hope that he understands that if a phrase is included in the Bill to the effect that something must be done to protect public health, some of us imagine that it must involve the Department of Health. It is a pity that the matter had to be winkled out this morning. If things must be done to protect public health, let the Government name the Department of Health. If the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is on the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that if it would look clumsy to list all the authorities in the Bill, they could be included in a schedule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have no doubt that officials and draftsmen will consider that, and we might have to return to it on Report. Let us have a list of the bits and bobs of Departments, quangos and executive agencies that will want to exercise powers, which should be clearly listed in clauses 25, 26 and 27. If there is doubt about the organisations and the powers that they want legitimised, computer buffs and others will be suspicious that Departments and agencies are taking the first step to obtaining powers that are given only to MI5 and MI6.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> In dealing with the amendments, my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam and I have concentrated on the catch-all provisions. He will want to deal with other aspects in the clause stand part debate. The discussion was interesting. The catch-all provisions relate to bodies and purposes, which are covered in amendment No. 170.
<P>
The Minister made it clear that the Bill, and this provision in particular, provide a regulatory framework for activities that already take place, which is all to the good. But such a vague provision is inappropriate. He has said that he will provide us with a provisional list of bodies, but those should be stipulated in the Bill. All bodies that carry out such activities should be brought into the system of regulation.
<P>
I am prepared to discuss whether there is a way in which we can provide for a body that we might later discover was involved in such activities or which has to be added to the list of bodies for a legitimate purpose. The idea that we mention a few bodies but omit many others because we are working on a provisional list will not do. We will return to that matter on Report, by which time we should have an amendment or new schedule that specifies the bodies and activities. We are regulating activities that we know take place, and it should be possible to detail and enumerate them.
<P>
The catch-all provision for purposes is more difficult to tackle. The Minister was uncharacteristically unconvincing. I am not persuaded—and I doubt whether anyone on the silent side of the Committee is persuaded—by his argument that the Government would have to add to the purposes for which directed surveillance can be authorised if they discovered that such surveillance had been in operation for matters that are not covered earlier in the clause. It conjures up the alarming civil liberties picture of the Government using directed surveillance to enforce public morals. The Home Secretary is obsessed with what time our children should go to bed and how we keep squeegee merchants off the streets. The use of directed surveillance for activities that are not criminal is a red rag to the civil liberties bull and fundamentally illiberal.
<P>
The situation is worse than that. The Minister is saying that activities are or may be taking place, but that the Government will not include them until they are tracked down, which the Government have so far failed to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Let me make it clear. We are not saying that. The law will evolve, which is why the catch-all phrase is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> If the law is to evolve to enforce public morals by directed surveillance, that is a matter for primary legislation, whatever one's view of it. Indeed, the implication is that it should be. How does the European convention on human rights work? If an activity is taking place that we did not realise was contrary to the convention, we deal with it in primary legislation. That is how the system is supposed to work. Parliament is confronted with the fact that something is in contravention of the convention, and is obliged to respond. That is how the old Strasbourg system worked and how the new system should work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If we knew all the Departments and bodies on the list, we would have a better idea of the other functions and authorisations. For example, if we discovered that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Royal Parks are on the list, we would know that they would want to survey farmers who cheat on their sheep numbers and people who sell hamburgers illegally. Knowing which organisations want the powers would give us an idea of the legislation that the Government may make by order.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Beith:</B> We might have a better idea, but we would not have solved the problem. A body that is on the list could still be given a purpose that the Government have not yet determined. The addition of purposes that are clearly not permitted under the European convention on human rights should be ruled out. Although such purposes would be illegal under the convention, we would have to go through its full procedures to enforce that illegality.
<P>
It is objectionable that the use of directed surveillance for such activities is omitted. If the Government think that it is, has been or may be necessary to include activities, they should do so. We should be arguing whether those activities are legitimate. If the Government believe that an activity may conceivably have to be included in future, they should recognise how the European convention on human rights operates. If the law needs to be amended, we amend it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend. Does he agree that if the Government decide to get the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to introduce a theatrical activities (lewd behaviour) Bill so that they can send in inspectors for the surveillance of public morals, that new power for directed surveillance should be included in that Bill? The Government should not rely on this Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> That is an intriguing example, but buying a ticket, sitting in a theatre and deciding whether a production is improper would not count as directed surveillance. The trade might call that open source, which would not be covered by the provisions. However, the Hon. Gentleman's comment illustrates the need to be imaginative to make sense of the Government's proposal. The Government are inviting the suggestion that they may enforce morals through spying. It is not the Minister's intention to be in that ludicrous position, but he is open to that charge.
<P>
Both aspects of the amendments need to be addressed on Report. I hope that the Government will give further thought to amendment No. 169 and discuss with the relevant Departments the need to retain the catchall power. As for amendment No. 170, I hope that there will be discussions about the range of bodies—the Government know what they are—that should be included. Those bodies need to use the Bill's powers and be part of the regulatory system. As it is obvious that that will be discussed on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I want to raise two issues. The Telecommunications UK Fraud Forum contacted me about how the provisions will affect the practices of telecommunications companies. Telecommunications companies handle and run human intelligence and surveillance when they investigate telecommunications fraud and crime in accordance with the Data Protection Act l998 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Members of the industry are worried that the proposed regulation will make such activity illegal and restrict the ability of telecommunications companies to conduct investigations into offences. If this type of criminal activity, which I am told is increasing, is not pursued by the companies using their own resources, it is unlikely that law enforcement agencies will take up what they consider to be lower priority crime. At a lower level, one of the reasons that telephone kiosks are not vandalised as often as they used to be is that companies are able to use a combination of surveillance and intelligence. What the companies would like to know is whether this part of the Bill, clauses 27 and 28 in particular, will prevent them from carrying out such activities.
<P>
Secondly, I want to ask the Minister about a matter concerning Scotland. The Law Society of Scotland has pointed out to me that the Bill provides for procedures to be adopted in relation to obtaining warrants and authorisations of various kinds with the purpose of preventing and detecting serious crime, but also impinges on wider aspects of criminal law than those which have been reserved to the Westminster Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998. Under the Scotland Act 1998, national security and the interception of communications are reserved, but other areas are not, although the House of Commons can deal with those matters because of its paramount position as the United Kingdom Parliament.
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whilst the UK Parliament can legislate on matters which are devolved, the Society believes that the views of the Scottish Parliament and Ministers should be sought<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
before action is taken in this area. It continues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not apparent whether there has been any degree of consultation in relation to these provisions of the Bill at a ministerial level. Clarification of this would be welcomed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is on the assumption that this applies to Scotland; it does seem to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Scottish point is important because areas such as public safety, public health and the collection of some taxes, duties and levies are among those areas for which the Scottish Parliament has responsibility, and the authorities in those fields are not nationwide authorities.
<P>
I wish to raise two particular points. The first concerns codes of practice. Earlier, we had a useful debate on the interception of communications, from which it appeared that codes of practice would be published. That would be useful in making those concerned aware of the circumstances under which those activities will take place. Following on from that, it would help if the Minister could give some assurances as to the nature of the information that would have to be made public in respect of those codes of practice before the various bodies can carry out directed surveillance.
<P>
For example, if the public hear that the Department of Health carries out directed surveillance, they will ask the questions that we have asked: why, how and under what circumstances. The same would apply to other bodies. There is no harm in making the citizens of this country aware of the circumstances under which these powers will be used. Obviously, we shall not tell them when they are used, especially when they are being used against them. However, they have a right to know in general the circumstances under which the powers will be used. Codes of practice would help to provide that information. That is the first issue—the extent to which we make known information about the circumstances under which a person may be the subject of directed surveillance, about who would carry that out, why they would carry it out and the way in which it is likely to be carried out.
<P>
Secondly, I want to examine clause 27(3)(b), which states that one of the purposes for which an authorisation is necessary is the purpose of ``preventing disorder''. That raises some of the issues touched on earlier, such as the right to peaceful protest. Some protests are not so peaceful. Judgments will have to be made about how one deals with individuals ranging from the Tibet protesters who demonstrated at the arrival of the President of China to those engaged in rather more dodgy demonstrations such as the ``Stop the City'' demonstrations.
<P>
When they read in the Bill that directed surveillance can be used to prevent disorder, people will have concerns about the level at which and the degree to which such surveillance will be authorised. For example, to what extent will someone standing on The Mall with a Tibetan while the Chinese President is visiting be deemed to be potentially causing disorder? The word ``disorder'' can be given a wide definition. I can accept that the prevention of disorder is one of the grounds contained in the ECHR. However, people do expect a clearer definition of what ``disorder'' means in this context, so that they may have some idea of when they can be subjected to directed surveillance.
<P>
I can understand why directed surveillance may be an appropriate tool in relation to an antisocial behaviour order. Such orders are on the statute book, and whatever one feels about them, most people would accept that disorder such as rampaging around the neighbourhood, setting fire to cars and throwing stones through people's windows justifies directed surveillance.
<P>
The word ``disorder'' covers a wide spectrum, and it is still evolving in law with the introduction of measures such as the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Home Secretary seems keen to deal with disorder, but the term does not have a long tradition of being definable as a specific set of offences or type of offence. Crime has a fairly obvious definition, but disorder does not. Will the Minister flesh out his view of disorder before we move on from the clause?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire mentioned a telecommunications example. Nothing in part II would affect the activities about which he spoke. Clause 70 sets out clearly that nothing dealt with in the Bill is illegal other than that which is specified as such; we shall, of course, discuss that clause later. I do not think that the concerns expressed to the hon. Gentleman have any foundation, but I know that hon. Members seek reassurance and I hope that I can offer it.
<P>
Scotland is a constant entertainment and preoccupation for me, and we shall discuss it in more detail during consideration of clause 73. The Scottish are considering their position, as was shown by the letter from the Law Society of Scotland. We shall undertake public consultation soon. With the Committee's permission, I shall return to the matter when we discuss clause 73. The points were well made. As a result of the Scotland Act 1998, the Bill raises genuine issues for the Scottish Executive, which will need to be addressed when we consider the relevant clause.
<P>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Hallam that the codes of practice will be publicly available. Indeed, it is right that they should be; openness in respect of such matters is an aspect of the Human Rights Act 1998. When the hon. Gentleman spoke about the prevention of disorder, I remembered a striking example from my recent experience. I attended a presentation before the most recent Norwich-Ipswich football game, which the Committee will probably recognise as the most important event in the sporting calendar in any year. Incidentally, hon. Members may also realise that when we went to Ipswich a couple of weeks ago, we won 2-„nil, which was an important and historic development.
<P>
During my visit, I was interested to see the way in which the police dealt with avoiding public disorder in a football ground, especially in light of all the terrible disasters that have occurred when order has not been properly maintained. Their activities involve directed surveillance of individuals and are based on a communications system that can be seen in the control room. Such systems use the cameras that are now located in premier league and division one stadiums to allow particular individuals to be monitored, and the stewards and police communicate and deal with situations as they progress. That is the sort of example that is in my mind when the hon. Gentleman speaks of preventing disorder.
<P>
It is easy to imagine how surveillance could be used in a similar way in prisons and other places where such disorder might arise. I am not concerned about any of the more flamboyant ideas of what might constitute disorder in the Home Secretary's mind or anywhere else. Disorder concerns fairly specific circumstances in which it is important to acknowledge that directed surveillance is helpful and may be an important aspect of preventing genuine disasters.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand the Minister's points and agree that he described appropriate circumstances. However, I hope that he understands the concern that exists among individuals who want to exercise normal democratic rights of protest. When those people see a word such as ``disorder'' in the Bill, they suspect that it allows authorities to say, ``There may be some sort of disorder if this protest goes ahead, so the Bill gives us authority to use directed surveillance''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I give the assurance that I have given before: nothing in the Bill is designed to inhibit the rights of democratic protest that are traditional in this country. The prevention of disorder is an important responsibility of government, which is why it is specified in the Bill.
<P>
Now that I have made those assurances, I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Authorisation of covert human intelligence sources</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 29, line 28, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and such other requirements as may be imposed by order made by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 89.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to enable the Secretary of State to add to the requirements listed in clause 28(5) regarding the arrangements that the authorising officer must be satisfied are in place in those public authorities specified by order as authorities using covert human intelligence sources; and to clarify that the requirements in relation to a covert source can be attributed to more than one authority if the source is acting for public authorities jointly.
<P>
Amendment No. 80 provides that the Secretary of State may prohibit by order certain conduct or uses of covert sources altogether; it enables him, in other specific cases, to impose additional requirements which must be satisfied before an authorisation may be granted.
<P>
Clause 28 sets out the requirements that must be met before an authorisation for the conduct and use of covert human intelligence sources can be granted. In that context, covert sources can be informants, agents and undercover officers. In addition to the necessary and proportionate tests provided for directed surveillance, the authorising officer must be satisfied also that arrangements exist for the management of the source and the recording of the information obtained from that source. Those arrangements, set out in subsection (5), are that someone should be responsible for the day-to-day management and security and welfare of the source, and that a second person should have general oversight of the use of the source. The Bill also proposes that the particulars to be contained in records relating to the covert source will be set out in regulations.
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that the conduct and use of covert sources is properly controlled and regulated, with detailed records being maintained of the use made of those sources. However, we believe that the Bill does not go far enough, which is why we tabled the amendments. Amendment No. 79 gives the Secretary of State an additional power to add to the requirements contained in subsection (5) regarding the arrangements that need to be in place. Amendment No. 80 provides for the Secretary of State, by order, to prohibit altogether certain uses of covert sources, and to add to the requirements in subsection (2).
<P>
There may be many reasons why we might wish to restrict or put additional safeguards on the use of particular types of sources or their use in particular circumstances. For instance, we are concerned about the use of juvenile sources and we want to introduce additional safeguards on their use—and to stop the most vulnerable from being tasked to obtain information. For example, we intend to prohibit the use of any juvenile source, under the age of 16, from giving information about his parents who live in the same house. I feel strongly that no youngster should be pressured to act as an informant against his parents and I want to ensure that that does not happen, whatever the temptation. That will not stop youngsters from being able to give the police information—for example, if a parent is involved in the sexual or physical abuse of siblings—but it will prevent the police or other agencies from tasking young people to covertly try to obtain further information for police purposes. We will also want to add conditions on the use of other juvenile sources.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 clarifies the arrangements specified in subsection (5) in relation to a source acting for more than one public authority. Such a source may be used in joint operations involving more than one authority. In such cases it would, for example, be possible for the first authority to retain day-to-day responsibility for the security, welfare and general oversight of the source, while a second authority that is benefiting from the use of the source, could be responsible for keeping a record of such use.
<P>
Amendment No. 89 is a technical amendment. It ensures that an authorisation will be cancelled if the authorising officer is satisfied that the arrangements for the source's case no longer satisfy the requirements of clause 28(5), including, if appropriate, requirements specified by order of the Secretary of State.
<P>
I apologise for introducing the amendments at such length, but it is important to place on the record the reasons why they are necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that the Government have tabled the amendments. Opposition Members spend a lot of time complaining about Secretaries of State making orders, but those orders are usually designed to enhance a Secretary of State's powers or to add to his functions. It is good that the Secretary of State may wish to make orders to restrict the activities of the various bodies that may be carrying out surveillance or, as in this case, using covert information sources.
<P>
I was particularly pleased to hear what the Minister said about preventing the use of children to inform against their parents. That sort of thing is for those who have a ``Brave New World'' paranoia—which must include most Liberal Democrat Members, because we clearly come from that political tradition. It is pleasing to hear that the Government who sometimes seem to want to be more authoritarian than we would like—on occasion, only slightly more—are trying to create limits and put boundaries on the infringement of people's civil liberties.
<P>
Will the Minister flesh out some of the issues raised by the amendments? Clearly, he must have in mind some issues that were not considered when the Bill was drafted. The Minister must have in mind circumstances requiring draft orders that he wishes to impose on the bodies that might conduct covert intelligence operations. How does he intend to release the information, which will be in the draft orders, on what will be outlawed eventually? It would be helpful to know that. In no sense are we trying to prevent the change—-it would be a significant improvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The only example specifically in mind is the one that I gave of juveniles. I was concerned to ensure that we could deal with the issue in that way. Obviously, one effect of the amendment will be that, if other examples arise, we will be allowed to bring into public debate reasonably and positively other restrictions that might be appropriate in other circumstances. The direct answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that the principal example in mind is of juveniles, which is why I raised it when moving the amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 92 to 94.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The amendments will provide for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, acting jointly, to be able to make an order specifying which authorities with devolved functions in Northern Ireland may lawfully authorise directed surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources. The amendments will take effect only once powers are again devolved.
<P>
Clause 29 provides that the Secretary of State may provide by order the persons in a public authority who may authorise the use of directed surveillance or of covert human intelligence sources. The authorities already identified as public authorities for the purpose of the provisions are police forces, NCIS, the National Crime Squad, the security and intelligence agencies, Customs and Excise, the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces. In addition, as we have discussed, many Departments will also wish to be designated by order.
<P>
Some of the authorities identified have functions that were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. As you will know, Mr. O'Hara, the Assembly is suspended, as are the powers devolved to it. However, we look to a future in which, we hope, the powers will once more be devolved. The amendments provide for such a time and will enable the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, acting jointly, to be able to make an order specifying the public authorities with devolved functions in Northern Ireland that can lawfully authorise directed surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources. Such an order will also be able to make different provision for different cases and contain incidental supplemental, consequential or transitional provision, as the Ministers think fit.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 31, line 18, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a draft of which has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are back to a more usual amendment to deal with making orders. We are again trying to ensure that orders under the clause will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Ministers have several times suggested that they would at least consider adopting that procedure. The orders would be significant enough to warrant that.
<P>
The reason for the importance of the issue was hinted at in the earlier debate that dealt with the bodies that would be carrying out the relevant activity. Proper parliamentary scrutiny of any orders under the clause is necessary.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Probably you were right, Mr. O'Hara, in calling me to order earlier. When I asked the Minister whether bodies such as the Department of Health might be relevant and he said yes, the point that I was making was perhaps more relevant to what we are now discussing.
<P>
The amendment does not go far enough. No amendments have been tabled that can deal with the enormity of what has been revealed this morning. When I studied the clause in advance, I did not think that the Government had any other public authority in mind. The big ones—the security services, the Ministry of Defence, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the National Crime Squad and the police were included. That is the lot. I assumed that the provision was just the usual catch-all, in case, for example, the National Crime Squad and NCIS were to amalgamate in a couple of years and call themselves something new. I had no idea that there would be a list of every other Government Department, quango and non-departmental public body, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and the sandwich police. No doubt the trading standards of officers will be included too, because they need powers to look out for dodgy videotapes at Penrith market on a Saturday.
<P>
Of course some of those organisations must determine who is making fake Levi jeans, but as the hon. Member for Hallam and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed suggested, they should be specified in the Bill. It would inevitably turn out in time that there had been omissions or that a new organisation would need to have its covert or directed surveillance added, but a formula could be found by which that could be done. However, I hope that on Report the Minister—or, if not the Minister, perhaps my hon. Friends—will draft an amendment to enable the relevant organisations to be specified in the Bill.
<P>
Subsection (4) gives the impression that it deals with the big, powerful investigatory organs of state—the big guys who are acting in the big, hard world and dealing with important international crime. However, it turns out that the Secretary of State can make an order to add environmental health and trading standards officers, food inspectors and goodness knows how many other people whose jobs are very important—protecting public health, checking that our sandwiches are cold enough and our cheese under 5 deg C. The last is a fetish of the Department of Health, as I know from bitter experience. No doubt that is important, but it sits a little oddly in a clause dealing with the powers of MI5, MI6 and NCIS. The amendment is worth while and valid, but because of what we now know about subsection (4)(h), we shall need something more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I endorse the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. I had not realised that there was a possibility that the Department of Health and other Departments could be added under paragraph (h). I thought, as did my right hon. Friend, that the paragraph might just cover amalgamations and other such changes. I know that the Minister promised to give us the list but it would be helpful if, in replying to the debate, he gave the Committee some idea of the sort of authorities he has in mind. For example, will the Department for Culture, Media and Sport be included? What about other Government Departments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Royal Parks Constabulary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Royal Parks Constabulary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Hamburgers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Well, hamburgers are an important issue.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister would widen the scope of his remarks; otherwise, the debate on this subject could go on for rather longer than we anticipated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am prepared to be very helpful on this matter, as I invariably am. However, I must take issue with the tone of the discussion, although that is not meant in an aggressive way.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border mentioned the enormity of the issue, but I emphasise that all the activities that we are discussing have been taking place for a considerable time under successive Governments, including the one of which he was a distinguished member. They are not new activities or intrusions which we, the ``Big Brother Government'', want to introduce. Any new intrusions should obviously be a matter for debate in the conventional way. We are saying that, where those activities have been taking place—under the 18 years of Conservative government, as well as under the past few years of this Government—we need a proper regulatory process to determine what is happening, so that we can deal with it in a proper way. That cannot be described as enormity or intrusion. We are just saying that, where surveillance is taking place but is not properly regulated, it needs to be regulated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was not suggesting that the activity itself is a new enormity or something awful being done by the Big Brother Labour Government. It is just that all Committee members looked at the list of organisations and thought that the Bill was about big crime departments and the Security Service, and thought that the short catch-all paragraph at the end would contain very little. The enormity is that that little paragraph, which we thought would be empty, could cover dozens of departments, even if they have been carrying out those activities for 20, 30 or 50 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I think ``enormity'' is a slightly strong word to use in that context. We have made it clear from the outset, on Second Reading in Parliament and outside, that a key purpose of the Bill is to bring into a regulated framework the surveillance that is already being carried out by a wide range of organisations. That is the importance of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Surely the Government know from the various departments who is carrying out directed surveillance and covert human intelligence operations—they must do because they are the Government. [Laughter.] Well, I agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Wait until Alastair Campbell is on the list. That is why they do not want it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Yes. If the Government know, as they should know, who is carrying out such activities, why are those authorities listed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am coming to that, but I want to make an interesting point about knowledge. We know a lot more than the Conservative Government knew about what is happening in various areas, as a result of introducing the Human Rights Act 1998 and this legislation. We have gone about the process of seeking to know in a way that has never been done before. The Government of which the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was a member did not have that knowledge because a whole range of activities were not known of centrally before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am pleased to see the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border nodding.
<P>
Part of the process of introducing the legislation has been to consult with a range of Government departments about any of their activities that might be thought to come within the remit of the Bill and might be thought not to comply with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
I pay tribute to the officials in my Department. They have worked hard to discover, in their discussions with a wide range of Government Departments and organisations, what activities have been taking place and thus to acquire the information to which the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire rightly refers. This is new information because although the Government have known in a general way, the information has not been gathered together in one place. I have said that I am happy to go along with the Committee's request. It is only proper that that information should be made available to Committee members. I will ensure that it is available later today, and that it deals with the concerns that have been expressed.
<P>
Committee members will then see that neither the DCMS nor the Royal Parks Constabulary is included, as far as I am aware. I would not like to violate any activity that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border mentioned. To help the Committee, I shall give some examples of the organisations that are included. They do include the Department of Health in the way that I mentioned earlier. They do include the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the vehicle inspectorate and the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency uses surveillance to combat the illegal smuggling of special, toxic and dangerous wastes across international borders, which most people would consider a reasonable thing to do.
<P>
The list includes the Department of Trade and Industry, the Health and Safety Executive, and the Inland Revenue—for obvious reasons. It includes the Home Office immigration service, as surveillance is an important part of its work. The list includes the Department of Social Security, which the right hon. Gentleman wishes to upgrade, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<P>
There is an example which will interest the right hon. Gentleman and his Eurosceptic friends in the Conservative party; the sea fisheries inspectorate uses surveillance to determine whether vessels are keeping within their quotas and using the correct nets. The Intervention Board appears on the list, as is the Financial Services Authority, for whose work surveillance is an important capability. The Ministry of Defence appears on the list. Those are the principal agencies that I shall name for the Committee, to show the scope of what we are discussing.
<P>
We have worked hard to ensure that we have the correct information on present activity, and we believe that we have. My use of the word ``provisional'' may have implied more than the sense that we have just about ensured that we have all the information. There has been an evolving process of establishing what is happening. However, it is something for which the Government deserve credit rather than discredit, because we brought these activities, about which we had all been aware in some sense, under scrutiny.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam inquired as to the correct parliamentary procedure for dealing with this issue. Earlier, I conceded a point to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and agreed to the affirmative resolution procedure on interception. I am not inclined to give the same agreement at this point because we are now discussing a lower level of surveillance. However, I acknowledge the concern that has been voiced, for genuine reasons, across the Committee this morning on the need to ensure that we are in possession of all the necessary information.
<P>
I commit myself, as I did earlier today, to publish the list. I also commit myself to consider how we might deal with this in a manner that ensures that people know what we are doing across the whole range. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, and for revealing what I presume is the majority of the organisations that would be included under paragraph (h). However, will the Minister consider listing them all together, either in this part of the Bill or, preferably, as a schedule? They appear to be perfect schedule material.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The answer is yes. I will consider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I conclude by saying that, in the nicest possible way, I feel slightly conned by the clause. I came here in all naïveté, looked at paragraphs (a) to (g) and thought—as I said earlier—that they concerned the big boys in Government—the police, the intelligence service and Customs and Excise. I assumed that paragraph (h) was nothing but a catch-all in case some of the big boys changed their names. The Minister would then be able to designate ``the international crime squad'' or whatever it might be called.
<P>
The Minister has revealed that many organisations are legitimately carrying out surveillance now, and should be included. I feel slightly conned because the important ones have been listed in the Bill [Interruption]. They all may be important, but the ones that we expected are specified in the Bill, while a host of others, on the Minister's list, will be included. Setting them out in a schedule would have set our minds at ease. The Minister has committed himself to considering that possibility and using an order-making power to adjust the schedule for whatever odd and sod might crop up.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The approach that I have described would be more straightforward and would maintain the Minister's reputation as a decent, honest, upfront, ``what you see is what you get'' bloke. That last term would not fit the clause at present, but I have every confidence that the Minister will deserve it and will table amendments on Report revealing a host of relevant organisations. He will be the sort of Minister who will resist approaches by the Royal Parks Constabulary after legislation banning hamburger sellers in the park has been passed, requesting intrusive surveillance techniques to determine whether Paddy has an unlicensed hamburger trolley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I think that it would be a public service if someone inspected the temperature of some of the hamburgers sold in the royal parks. They can be decidedly dodgy, but that is a side issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> They keep the body regular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The important issue is that many concerns have been raised in the debate and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, while walking in St. James's park, eating a hamburger and looking for some public conveniences, will be able to ponder his success in eliciting from the Government an important list of relevant bodies. One need not be a conspiracy theorist to want the Government to set out their stall clearly on the issue of who may carry out surveillance of any kind. The surveillance in question may be directed surveillance, but it is still surveillance—someone following a person around the streets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want to ask the Minister whether a similar list exists for clause 24(1)? It was not focused on at the time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question might well have been relevant at the time, but we have moved on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Wherever in the Bill we see the term ``public authority'' we shall be aware of flashing warning signs directing us to question what authorities are meant. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was right to say that a list such as the one in clause 29(4) leads one to make certain assumptions. The list concerns bodies dealing with serious criminal activities.
<P>
The logic of the Minister's comments was encouraging. I know that he has always taken such issues seriously and I am sure that he wanted to enter Government to bring about relevant changes. He has said that one of his tasks was to ferret out the bodies with the powers in question. Having ferreted them out, it would be a shame not to specify them in the Bill. All that he said suggested that he would be inclined to do that if possible.
<P>
I am pleased that he is considering putting the details in a schedule. That is the logical conclusion of what he said about the Government's intention to let the citizen know who may be carrying out directed surveillance, and for what purposes. If the details are not explicit in the Bill, the citizen will feel as cheated as Committee members did when presented with a short list of bodies that deal with serious activities, but not the long list of other bodies whose activities, though important, are less so, with respect to surveillance, proportionate to the other group.
<P>
Now that the issues have been teased out in debate, the amendment should be passed. We do want not orders, but a schedule. In the hope and expectation that the Minister will follow his own logic and introduce a schedule on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 32, line 23, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) No authorisation shall take effect until such time (if any) as—
<P>
(a) the grant of the authorisation has been approved by an ordinary Surveillance Commissioner; and
<P>
(b) written notice of the Commissioner's decision to approve the grant of the authorisation has been given to the person who granted the authorisation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment looks at the relationship between the intrusive surveillance powers in the clause and the authorisation process in part III of the Police Act 1997. I emphasise that it relates specifically to intrusive surveillance, which is a more serious form of surveillance than directed surveillance. My reason for tabling the amendment was partly to clarify these issues. My understanding is that not all intrusive surveillance would be subject to a surveillance commissioner's oversight, although that process exists for Police Act surveillance. Initially, I seek confirmation from the Minister about his understanding of the relationship between the clause, the Police Act 1997 and the surveillance commissioners.
<P>
I should also be interested to know what the Government's experience has been since they introduced the 1997 powers. One objection to the procedure may be that urgent applications could not go before a surveillance commissioner, and I can understand that objection. I should be interested to know how often that has happened under the Police Act powers. How frequently are applications made that cannot be subject to approval by a surveillance commissioner? As a matter of principle, it is always preferable that approval should be given. There have been some unpleasant incidents in which surveillance has led to conflict. I can think of one in which a police officer ended up being stabbed. Intrusive surveillance carries with it certain risks, which are best mitigated by a commissioner's oversight. The operatives need to know that the authorisation has been carried out to the best possible standard. That means having a separate commissioner who can carry out authorisations with the proper expertise and gives the individual operative additional authority over and above that from his immediate commanding officer.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can explain the relationship with the surveillance commissioners and then say how, if he believes that the majority of surveillance operations will have the appropriate oversight, that oversight would occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Clause 34 states that an authorisation for intrusive surveillance for police and customs operations will not take effect until the grant of authorisation has been approved by a surveillance commissioner and written notice of the commissioner's decision has been given. In addition to duplicating the provision in relation to the police and customs, the amendment would appear to require Secretary of State authorisations also to have the prior approval of a surveillance commissioner.
<P>
With regard to police and customs activities, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary, simply duplicating what is already provided for in clause 34. However, it would impose a similar requirement on Secretary of State authorisations, which is not appropriate. The surveillance commissioners have no locus in the activities of the security and intelligence agencies.
<P>
I made clear the Government's position on judicial involvement in the use of warrants by the Secretary of State during debates on part I. I acknowledge that this is a topic on which there is disagreement between the Liberal Democrats and ourselves. Authorisation for intrusive surveillance by the security and intelligence agencies or by the Ministry of Defence would occur in extremely sensitive cases. It is also a key part of the line of accountability from the agencies and Departments to the Secretary of State. Involvement by the Executive has historically reflected the highest levels of scrutiny. Any alternative means of authorising such operations would have to show that it would improve on a system that has proved very effective over the years. The place for judicial influence in this process is in the oversight role provided by the intelligence services and Security Service Act commissioners.
<P>
To ensure that the urgency procedures will not be abused—the point made by the hon. Member for Hallam—the chief surveillance commissioner has created a system of approving authorisations under part III of the Police Act 1997, which means that a commissioner is on duty at all times. The procedure is supported by secure communications, so a response can be obtained from a commissioner in a few hours.
<P>
Since the office of the surveillance commissioner started operation in February 1999, only 12 cases have been dealt with under the urgency procedure—-that is, an authorisation normally requiring the commissioner's prior approval has taken place immediately without awaiting that approval because of the urgency involved. There have been 311 prior approval cases. The same system will be used to deal with intrusive authorisations for police and customs activities under the Bill. That provides the evidence that the system will not be abused. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Hallam and that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister has reassured me, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I want to ask just one question. The long list of senior authorising officers in subsection (6) includes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) any customs officer designated for the purposes . . . by the Commissioners.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Everyone else listed is a senior person—chief constable, commissioner, provost marshal and so on—yet paragraph (1) simply refers to ``any customs officer''. It is odd that all those terribly eminent people must act as authorising officer for the other bodies, but anyone in customs can do so. Will the Minister explain why a more senior person is not referred to in that paragraph?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understand the question. As with the police, customs action will be authorised only at chief constable level, or equivalent, with prior approval given by surveillance commissioners in non-urgent cases. I think that the reason why the designation appears more general is simply that the ranking structure in customs and excise is not sufficiently clear to be able to state it in the Bill. I shall check that and write to the hon. Gentleman to explain the reasons why that wording is used, but I confirm that the intention is that only senior people will give such authorisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to raise another important issue about wording. Earlier debates suggest that intrusive surveillance and the interception of communications are almost identical matters. In some cases, intrusive surveillance will be preferable to the traditional interception of communications, especially if data need to be collected before information enters the public telecommunications network. I understand that such data will be covered by intrusive surveillance. I suspect that new technology will mean that the interception of communications might become less intrusive than intrusive surveillance, by which more information can be gathered.
<P>
The grounds for intrusive surveillance in subsection (3) mirror those for the interception of communications in most respects. Such decisions are taken at a high level. However, the condition in subsection (3)(c)—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
differs from that in clause 5(3)(c), which relates to the interception of communications. The conditions in subsection (3)(a) and (b)—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of national security<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are identical to those in clause 5(3), but the third condition differs.
<P>
We established earlier that the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of the economic well being of the United Kingdom<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
constitutes a lower threshold than that in clause 5(3)(c), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purposes of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given what I have said about intrusiveness and that the Minister is keen to retain proportionality, will he explain why the test in clause 30 is lower and say whether he is prepared to consider the higher test? It would be more consistent if the thresholds for the interception of communications and intrusive surveillance were the same throughout, instead of there being two thresholds the same with the third type—the one for economic well-being—being set at the lower level that is deemed appropriate for directive surveillance in other areas, but not for the interception of communications.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Thanks to the efficient advice of my Bill team, I can now give a more precise answer to the question that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire asked about customs officers. The authorising officer will be either the chief investigating officer or the deputy chief investigating officer. I am happy to place that on the record here. Those individuals are not legal entities, which is why they are not mentioned in the Bill. That will be made explicit in the code of practice. I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Hallam, we have two different tests on economic well-being, for exactly the reasons that he outlined. We discussed that when we debated clause 5. He may be interested to know that the precise question about the difference between the two tests was considered by the interception of communications commissioner and the Intelligence Services Act commissioner as recently as last year. With your permission, Mr. O'Hara, I should like to quote from the report published by Lord Nolan, the interception of communications commissioner, published in June last year. Addressing precisely that point, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In referring to the safeguarding of the United Kingdom's economic well being the Act presupposes the existence of some threat or possible threat to that well being. In this it differs from the language of sections 1(2) and 3(2) of the Intelligence Services Act 1994, which provides simply for the functions of the secret intelligence services and Government Communications Headquarters to be exercisable ``in the interests of the economic well being of the United Kingdom''. It follows that in exercising their functions generally both of these agencies are authorised to act positively in promoting the country's economic well being, as distinct from merely protecting it; but when applying for an interception warrant they must remain within the narrow limits of the 1985 Act as regards the purpose of the warrant. At the request of the Intelligence Services Commissioner, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and myself, the lawyers in the two agencies and in the Home and Foreign Offices prepared a consultation paper on this matter, in the light of which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and I have agreed upon the advice which should be given to the Secretary of State in cases of difficulty over the distinction between the two Acts. I am satisfied that distinction has been faithfully observed in the nature of warrants.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that will reassure the Committee that there is a distinction between those two formulations, which has proved workable, and which has been considered by both the interception commissioner and the Intelligence Services Act commissioner.
<P>
On the more general point that the hon. Member for Hallam raised about the hierarchy of the different forms of surveillance that are taking place, I can only say that throughout the Bill we have tried to reflect the tiering in the various different authorisation procedures. I acknowledge that over time a different hierarchy might more appropriately reflect the level of intrusiveness of particular techniques. That is certainly possible as technology develops. But we feel that what we have now accurately reflects the current levels of intrusion. Nevertheless, if public opinion moved in its assessment of the different impacts of these measures, we would look at it. At present, the Bill reflects those different tierings and hierarchies. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Rules tor grant of authorisation</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Clause 31(5) deals with the extremely complex regime that has now been put in place for intrusive surveillance. This provision needs to be looked at again. It says that a single authorisation can cover an application both under this Bill and under part III of the Police Act 1997, but the different provisions of each will still apply. Does the Minister agree that it would be better to have a comprehensive regime for all forms of intrusive surveillance, and that she might need to consider whether part III of the 1997 Act should therefore be changed?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> Good morning, Mr. O'Hara. It has been an interesting morning's sitting As the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire lightly said, the clause combines the authorisations that he outlined. It is difficult to answer his valid question now because the measure imports provisions of the Police Act 1997 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994, but I shall reply to him in writing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That is very helpful.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Notification of authorisations for intrusive surveillance</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I have two questions for the Minister. First, what happens if the surveillance commissioner wants to place restrictions or limitations on an authorisation? Can that be done? Secondly, what about legally privileged material, which is not dealt with in the clause?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Again, I am unable to give the hon. Gentleman an immediate answer to his questions, but I shall do so in writing. I apologise for not being able to give him the detailed answers that he seeks now. It might help if I defined the sort of information that the notification will contain.
<P>
A requirement to provide similar information to that required by the statutory instrument on notifications of authorisations under the Police Act 1997 will be laid down. For example, it will include information on the grounds for believing that the case meets the criteria for authorisation, the identities—when known—of those being targeted, the action involved and the likelihood of collateral or incidental intrusion on the privacy of others.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why intrusive surveillance does not include legally privileged material, and what the definition means; it may help him to know that it is unlikely that such material could be obtained by means of an authorisation under these provisions without some interference with property. A dwelling or a private vehicle are areas where a person has the highest expectation of privacy, and we are introducing stringent controls on intrusion in those categories.
<P>
Although directed surveillance will be authorised internally, the Secretary of State can designate the levels at which such authority should be provided. There is scope to require higher levels of authorisation when sensitive material is involved. The commissioners will have oversight of directed surveillance, and may wish to give special attention to activities by which such material is obtained.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> After all our hard work today this clause states that the Secretary of State may by order decide whether any provisions in part II apply. It is a classic Henry VIII power. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may by order do any one or more of the following—
<P>
(a) apply this Part, with such modifications as he thinks fit, to any such surveillance that is neither directed nor intrusive as may be described in the order;
<P>
(b) provide for any description of directed surveillance to be treated for the purposes of this Part as intrusive surveillance;
<P>
(c) provide for any description of intrusive surveillance to be treated for the purposes of this Part as directed surveillance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Well! The problem with that, apart from being fundamentally—
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): Ambitious?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Ambitious is certainly a good way of putting it. The problem is that article 8 of the European convention on human rights states that any interference prescribed by law must be clear and accessible. That can hardly be so if the Secretary of State is able legally to allocate surveillance into whichever category he chooses. The Minister might like to explain whether she is seriously arguing that such a provision is right and appropriate. It is ridiculous.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In support of the hon. Gentleman's comments, I can understand, in light of earlier discussions about technology, why one might want to future-proof legislation and make it flexible, but doing so does not seem relevant in this context. We tried to establish the principles that must be breached for surveillance to be defined as intrusive or directed. that is important in this context, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the only good thing about the clause is that it is subject to order by affirmative resolution procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am waiting for the Government to make an amendment to change that, so that they may then reintroduce the provision as a major concession.
<P>
There do not seem to be any criteria for such power; that is what is so disturbing. If equivalent tests were to apply to both cases, the provision might make sense, but, as we have established, there is a lower threshold at which directed surveillance may be authorised and lesser tests of proportionality apply in relation to intrusion into someone's privacy than in relation to intrusive surveillance. Therefore, there are supposed to be important differences of principle that separate the two. For the Secretary of State simply to have the discretion to say that black is white and white is black, albeit following the affirmative resolution procedure, makes nonsense of this part of the Bill.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give specific examples of when the Secretary of State would wish to exercise such a power. If she will not, I hope that, now that the Government have the benefit of debates that have clarified many of the issues surrounding intrusive and directed surveillance, they will reconsider removing the power. Commitments to add more bits might make the power unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I am afraid that, at the end of such a useful and positive debate, I shall have to disappoint the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire and for Hallam. I know that I shall not satisfy their concerns and I acknowledge that the power is fairly broad, but, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office said, it is needed because, at this stage, we cannot be certain how the Human Rights Act 1998 will impact on the covert activities of the police and other agencies. That will develop as case law builds up. We must be in a position to respond swiftly to court judgments relating to the use of covert surveillance or covert sources in order to maintain effective law enforcement and safeguard those vital activities from challenges.
<P>
I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed, but I invite all members of the Committee to support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> Does the hon. Lady seriously imagine that, with those few sentences of argument, she will satisfy either the House on Report or, even more significantly, their Lordships?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> A more positive point about the clause that the Committee might like to consider is the fact that it adds to the activities that count as directed surveillance. It includes those that at present need not be authorised. That is a positive reason for using such powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> The clause has ladders as well as snakes; provisions go up and down.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> That is a good point.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, the Secretary of State can only allocate surveillance by amending the Bill with parliamentary approval. The law will remain clear and foreseeable. Clause 44 will not raise any matters concerning article 8. The power enables us to regulate low-level surveillance that is not currently covered by the Bill.
<P>
It is important to have such a power. I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed, but I hope that Committee members will support clause 44 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary needs to discuss the matter with her officials. She should admit that the Government were caught out on the matter and need to do better on Report.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> One of the joys of spending time in Committee is that one has time to consider matters as our deliberations proceed.
<P>
I have been thinking about residential premises, which clause 45 attempts to define. I mentioned software bugs when we discussed intrusive surveillance. I do not want to seem obsessive, but I think that they will be developed as an important tool. We established that they fall under the category of intrusive surveillance rather than interceptions of communications, and I suspect that they will become the principal technology for getting the type of information that the authorities want.
<P>
Because of the definition of residential premises, intrusive surveillance will apply only in domestic premises. However, the Government may wish to use such methods to pick up significant activity in office premises. If the Bill's definition of residential premises is retained, will the Government have the authority to do so? If the authorities place a software bug in an office, will that be covered by intrusive surveillance legislation? Will they be exempt from the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and other measures specifying that such action potentially damages the individual?
<P>
The Bill's definition of residential premises is restricted, so we must consider whether the Government will be able to undertake such action in office settings. Can individuals use places—in addition to the accommodation in which they live and sleep—not specified in that tight definition? I do not necessarily expect an answer now but, at some stage, I would like a considered response from the Government on whether software bugging will be permissible in a broader range of premises than those specified in clause 45?

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The clause is fairly specific, and the additional examples that it gives include hotel or prison accommodation.
<P>
I refer the hon. Member for Hallam to the comments on bugs made my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, who said that they sound like interference with property, which would be covered by the Police Act 1997 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994.
<P>
The clause is clear. The hon. Member for Hallam asked a good question, and I hope to provide an answer on all the issues that he raised at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I accept that bugs are covered by other measures. However, I am anxious that they will not be covered in the full range of premises in which the police and security services wish to carry out such surveillance. There may be a loophole, so that the police and security services do not have the cover that they require. I should be grateful for feedback from the Government on that at a later date.
