<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock, with the exception of Thursday 26 February at half-past Ten o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Jones. I hope that you will find the Bill interesting. It is an important piece of legislation, which is designed to provide a sound framework for the future policing of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Before I turn to a detailed consideration of the Bill, I should like to comment on the specifics of the sittings motion and to set out the way in which the Committee can assist the Government in finding the best way forward for our discussions.
<P>
It is not intended that the Committee will sit at 10.30 am on Thursday 26 February. That is because a Meeting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, on which many members of this Committee serve, is scheduled for that time and date.
<P>
Although it is not set out in the sittings motion, I should like to advise hon. Members that by leave of the Committee, and with your agreement, Mr. Jones, that there will be no sittings of the Committee next week. The straightforward reason for that is that I shall be in Japan and Taiwan on a trade and inward investment mission, trying to bring business and jobs to Northern Ireland. We are likely to have many differences of opinion over the Bill as it progresses through Committee, but I know that all hon. Members will wish me well in that task in Japan and Taiwan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I say ``origato'' to my hon. Friend and hope that I am allowed to speak Japanese in Committee.
<P>
Our procedures are matters for you, Mr. Jones, and the Committee, but I shall ask my hon. Friend the Whip to ask the Committee to agree to that rearrangement of our sittings at an appropriate stage during our deliberations on Thursday.
<P>
The Bill is a long one; it has 77 clauses and six schedules. You will know from your extensive experience, Mr. Jones, that, given the complexities of such legislation, it is important that it should have detailed and proper examination, preferably in a structured way. That is why I have offered each of the parties represented in Committee the opportunity to identify what they believe to be the key areas of the Bill and to which they wish to devote the major portion of their time.
<P>
I have not yet had an opportunity to speak to the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), but I will speak to him after the sitting about the points that I have already set out to hon. Members representing other parties.
<P>
After those consultations, by leave of the Committee and with your agreement, Mr. Jones, we will be able to structure our debates so as to have them at a sensible hour. The consideration of the Bill could be a long, drawn-out process, or, with the co-operation of the Committee, under your direction, Mr. Jones, we could adopt a more structured and purposeful approach to this important subject of the future policing of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Bill has two main aims. The first is to extend to Northern Ireland the benefits of the improved system of police governance introduced to England, Wales and Scotland by the Police and Magistrates Courts Act 1994. The police planning and objective--setting mechanisms set out in the Bill are modelled closely on those that the Act introduced.
<P>
The new management provisions for police finance and for staff working in support of the police will put the Chief Constable and the RUC in the same position of being able to manage all the resources that he requires to police Northern Ireland as his colleagues in the rest of Great Britain. All those measures have proved their worth over the past three years, and the Government feel that it is right that they should now be extended to Northern Ireland. If we agree the sittings motion, we shall be able to structure our debates to ensure that we deal with these key elements.
<P>
The Bill's second main aim is to introduce a new, radical police complaints system to Northern Ireland, including provision for the wholly independent investigation of complaints, resulting in the abolition of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, whose members and staff deserve recognition for their work. They have provided a valuable service to the public and to the police over the 10 years of the commission's existence.
<P>
I think that we have faithfully reflected the fact and the spirit of Dr. Hayes' recommendations of a little over a year ago. We have, for example, proposed the establishment of an independent ombudsman, who will have control of the complaints process. He, or she, will decide what constitutes a complaint, which is vital, and, equally important, will decide how it is to be investigated and by whom. In addition, the ombudsman will have to investigate the most serious cases, which are defined in clause 50.
<P>
The ombudsman will have his or her own investigative staff to do that and we will ensure that they are ready for their task.
<P>
In addition the Government have recognised the need for the ombudsman to be able to look at non-complaint matters: in effect, the ombudsman will have a call-in power.
<P>
We could not accept the ombudsman being able to take on one serious case because there was a complaint, yet being unable to touch another that was exactly the same, save that a complaint was not made.
<P>
The new independent system, which I have no doubt is a model for elsewhere and will be unique if it is agreed, will ensure police accountability, while also ensuring fair treatment of officers.
<P>
Other clauses are also unique to Northern Ireland. I should like to mention briefly what they do, because they cover key issues. The Bill sets up the new Northern Ireland police service. This new term includes all those who will work under the direction and control of the Chief Constable to supply a police service to the people of Northern Ireland. It does not abolish the Royal Ulster Constabulary--that proud title is retained--the body of sworn constables who form Northern Ireland's police force. However, the Bill does propose to change the declaration of office made by RUC officers so that it is the same as that used in Scotland.
<P>
It would also enable the Secretary of State to issue a statement of policing principles.
<P>
This would provide an opportunity for the Secretary of State to issue a paper setting out her vision, shared with the Chief Constable and the Police Authority of how Northern Ireland should be policed.
<P>
It is intended that the principles should reflect values that I am sure all of us would endorse: fairness, impartiality and respect for individual rights. I will make draft principles available to members of the Committee in good time for our consideration of this issue.
<P>
The changes to police governance that we are introducing are intended to strengthen the tripartite structure of policing, which is a proven model to which the Government are strongly committed. There can be no going back to the old Stormont model of direct political interference in police activity. The new measures set out in this Bill include a commitment to a strong Police Authority capable of representing the community and of holding the Chief Constable to account on its behalf. I pay tribute to the authority for performing these roles effectively through very difficult times, and to the sacrifices made by authority members and staff, including the ultimate sacrifice of life itself.
<P>
The Bill proposes to strengthen those roles further. I emphasise the Government's support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and pay tribute to the work of the police over many years in upholding the rule of law and the values of civilised society in the face of ruthless and determined terrorism. 301 officers have died through terrorist attack and nearly 8,500 have been injured. The Government and the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, who respect the decent values of a democratic society, will not forget their ready and courageous sacrifices, and the sacrifices of their families and loved ones.
<P>
Those who work closely, or have contact with the RUC from day to day, know that it would like nothing better than to be able to provide a normal police service in a peaceful society, free from the threat of terrorist attack and sectarian violence.
<P>
Members of the RUC have worked tirelessly, and with endless commitment, to that end. We all hope that they will soon have the opportunity to police a different and better society.
<P>
Whatever the future holds, the Bill will provide an improved system of police governance, which will enable the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be more efficient and more effective in countering crime and other threats to the whole community in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Comments have been made elsewhere, including on Second Reading, about the extra powers that the Bill will give my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Clearly, that will feature prominently in our consideration of the Bill, and it is relevant to the sittings motion. Without pre-empting that consideration, let me partly deal with the subject.
<P>
The model of policing that the Bill introduces gives the Secretary of State the same role in policing Northern Ireland as that of the Home Secretary in policing England and Wales.
<P>
The Bill presents great opportunities to the Police Authority and the Chief Constable for changing and modernising their respective roles. The Chief Constable will have control of all the resources he requires to provide the most efficient and effective police service to all the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Police Authority has for the first time, the powers it needs to ensure and to require that the views of the community form the framework within which policing in Northern Ireland is conducted. Through the policing plan, it also has clear, published criteria against which to hold the Chief Constable to account. Those matters will form major subjects for debate in Committee.
<P>
The Bill also opens the way for the Chief Constable to delegate more responsibility to his local commanders; and that presents the authority with an opportunity to ensure that local communities develop an effective voice in shaping the policing of their own areas and holding their local police commanders to account.
<P>
One fundamental issue occurs early in the Bill, and I should like to mention it now. It is worthy of early consideration, and is again, relevant to the sittings motion. I hope that it will assist the Committee in considering the Bill. It is the question of how best to guarantee the impartiality of the police service. Amendments on the matter have been tabled for consideration by the Committee. I have considered those amendments. I have also received representations from the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, and the Secretary of State has discussed the matter at a meeting with the full authority. I hope that I have found a way forward which represents a sensible and workable solution and achieves the aim of the various amendments that have been tabled on that issue.
<P>
As members of the Committee will know, the Bill addresses some aspects of the issue in the guiding principles of policing, which are to be issued by the Secretary of State under clause 37. I now wish to take the matter further by applying to the Police Authority and the RUC section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, which makes it unlawful for any body to which the Act applies to discriminate in the discharge of functions relating to Northern Ireland against any person or class of persons on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Robinson: </B>(Belfast, East): How is it possible for the Minister to uphold that principle, which is enshrined in the Constitution Act, while at the same time he discriminates against my party by ensuring that it has no representation on the Police Authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We shall discuss those issues in our debate on amendments that I shall table later, and when we discuss the consultative document on the make-up of the Police Authority. There is no discrimination against the hon. Gentleman's party on the Police Authority. He can use strong words if he wishes, but the facts do not lead to his conclusion. Members of the Police Authority are chosen on merit; they have to go through the due process of selection. The hon. Gentleman has made his accusation on many occasions. Effectively, he is saying that his party should automatically have a seat on the authority. He will have an opportunity in the new consultative process to discuss the shape and form of the Police Authority and I hope that he and his party will make their representations.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As there is no predetermination about how the Police Authority should be formed, we must ensure that it is not done simply on the basis of people being appointed by political parties, although that could be done if it is decided that it is the best way forward. There are many ways in which people can be appointed to the authority. Political representation is one of them; but a range of other issues, which are referred to in the document, should also be taken into account. Examples are geographical interests and the interests of various councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Does my hon. Friend accept that the current Police Authority was founded not on the basis of being representative but of being independent and of trying to take merit into account in overseeing these matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Ideally, of course, the Police Authority should be representative. Unfortunately, circumstances in Northern Ireland mean that that is difficult to achieve because some parties do not wish to be so involved. As the Secretary of State announced yesterday, we are trying to find a new way forward on the basis of the consultative document and our plans for restructuring and reforming the Police Authority.
<P>
Merit must come into the equation. We must ensure that those who serve on the Police Authority have the commitment and the quality to assist that body in its determinations, and that they come from the sectors, groupings and political parties which may want to make appointments to the body. No predetermined position has been adopted, which is why the matter is subject to consultation. That issue, like others, will be debated in Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East intervened to comment on what I said about the impartiality of the RUC being extended to the Police Authority. I shall table amendments which will give those that are already on the amendment paper a proper structure and format. I hope that the Committee will agree with what I propose. The amendments will be tabled in due course.
<P>
I referred to the consultative document, and the intervention by the hon. Member for Belfast, East was useful because it brings me to my next point. I explained briefly what the document is about. The discussion paper, ``Your Voice, Your Choice'' was published yesterday and I repeat that the Government have no predetermined views as to which, if any, of the options in the paper should be implemented. However, the paper may be valuable in aiding the debate on clause 7, which sets out arrangements for obtaining the public's views on policing by the Police Authority. Schedule 1 sets out the constitution, terms of office and method of appointment of Police Authority members.
<P>
Some members of the Committee are, of course, closely involved in the continuing talks process, to which the Bill and the Committee's consideration of it relates. There has been some criticism of the timing of the Bill, proceeding as it does in parallel with the talks process. Such criticism is unfounded. It stems from the view that the Government are changing the system of policing in Northern Ireland in a way that will conflict with the agreement on policing that could emerge from the talks process. I do not think that that will be the case. Making clear the duties of the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State in the existing system of policing should aid the parties to the talks in their consideration of future arrangements.
<P>
As well as being worth while in its own right, the Bill makes the police service in Northern Ireland more efficient and effective and, through that clarification, will provide a clear platform on which the parties currently involved in the talks process can build agreement on policing. The Government welcome further debate on the future of policing in Northern Ireland. We are committed to implementing whatever agreements emerge from the current negotiations.
<P>
Clearly, anything that flows from the talks process may have an impact on our deliberations in Committee, on Report, or when the Bill is considered in the other place, if timing so permits. If timing does not permit and it reaches the statute book before any agreement, the Government have given a commitment to implement any agreement that comes out of the talks process on policing. However, it has to be an agreed position between the parties and must also have the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The experience in the rest of the United Kingdom is that reforms of police governance that the Bill proposes have allowed the police to work more closely and to be more responsive and accountable to the communities that they serve. I am sure that the same will apply in Northern Ireland. The new complaints procedures that we are introducing have already received widespread support.
<P>
I genuinely believe that the police complaints system will do much to increase the confidence of the public in their dealings with the RUC and the police themselves as it is designed to give confidence in the overall delivery of the service that the RUC provide for the wider community. The Bill will ensure that the police and the people of Northern Ireland will have an opportunity to work even more closely together to make life better for everyone.
<P>
I have tried to set out the key elements of the Bill. I hope that highlighting the issues which I consider will be of importance to the Committee has helped our consideration of the sittings motion. Hon. Members may wish to order their thoughts to ensure that the debates are structured and take place at a reasonable time, not in the dead hours of the night. If the Committee wants long debates into the late evening, so be it, but I make a plea for a useful, structured debate. The Bill is an important measure for all the people of Northern Ireland. With the assistance of Members of the Committee and under your direction, Mr. Jones, we can rapidly consider the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Jones. We look forward to many weeks of your wise and reasonable stewardship of the Committee which, as the Minister has said, is dealing with an extremely important piece of legislation. We are grateful to the Minister for outlining his thoughts on the sittings motion. We are also grateful for advance notice that the Committee will not sit on 26 February and that it will not sit next week. On a point of clarification, Mr. Jones, you did not say that we were not sitting next week when you read out the sittings motion. I am no clearer now than I was when we started about whether we are to sit next week. The Government Whip indicates that we are not. We are grateful for that.
<P>
We wish the Minister a happy and successful trip to Japan. Obviously, the fact that the winter Olympics are on in Japan now is pure coincidence, but if he is seen going through Heathrow with his skis we will know where he is going.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I went through Heathrow with skis, it would be the first time ever. I used to do mountaineering but that is not a winter Olympics sport. Nothing in my programme would tie me in with the winter Olumpics. However, I shall have a closer look at the matter because the hon. Gentleman has drawn my attention to something that I was not too aware of.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am delighted that the Minister is taking guidance from me. Perhaps I can give him a second piece of advice: if he takes his wife on the trip he should ensure that everything is above board.
<P>
We recognise the Bill's importance and have noted the Minister's remark about structured debates. We suspect that there is an ulterior motive, which is to speed the Bill through the Committee. Our stance on the Bill does not prompt us to slow down the Committee process. There are 70 clauses of important legislative proposals, as the Minister said, and it is important that they receive adequate and proper scrutiny. We will not use delaying tactics; we will give some thought to the Minister's ideas about structuring and will talk to other colleagues to see whether we can find a sensible way forward.
<P>
The Bill is the culmination of a great deal of research and consultation, not only in Northern Ireland but in Great Britain where, as the Minister said, a considerable amount of legislation has been enacted. It follows on from the Police and Magistrates Courts Act 1994 and the Police Act 1996. Many ideas and clauses have been lifted from those Acts for England and Wales and incorporated in it.
<P>
There has been a great deal of activity in Northern Ireland--the Police Authority's report on community consultation, entitled ``Everyone's Police, A Partnership for Change''; the Labour party's own paper, ``Policing in Northern Ireland'', which was published in April 1996; and the Conservative White Paper, ``Foundations for Policing'', also published in 1996. Dr. Maurice Hayes, in his report on the police complaints procedure, put forward ideas for a police ombudsman, which the Minister mentioned. That report was commissioned by the previous Government, as was the report by Dr. Peter North, albeit not necessarily focusing on policing as such--although in the report on parades and marches, which led to the Police Processions (NI) Bill, whose Third Reading took place last week, Dr. North in many ways considered how best to police public disorder in such a way as not to involve police being at the interface between two warring factions. Finally the RUC undertook its own fundamental review last year.
<P>
There has been unprecedented activity, some of it instigated by legislation in Great Britain but much of it stemming from a desire, perhaps as part of the overall political process, to find, if possible, an accommodation between both sides of the Committee for a revised structure for policing in Northern Ireland, which we hope will be acceptable to all parties.
<P>
The previous Government's White Paper, ``Foundations for Policing'', set out our proposals to build on the strengths of the tripartite relationship. It was designed to clarify the lines of accountability between the tripartite partners--the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable; to define more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the parties in that structure; and to create new structures to facilitate greater community involvement and, more importantly still, identification with policing. Many of the threads that make up the Bill derive in part from the previous Government's White Paper and last year's Labour party paper on policing.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The press release announcing the previous Government's White Paper stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It has been repeatedly emphasised by many of those consulted that any changes should safeguard the impartiality of the police.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``impartiality'' occurs not only in the White Paper but throughout many other documents and reports relating to policing in Northern Ireland. It is interesting that the Minister dealt with the issue of impartiality in his opening remarks. Obviously he has understood that if possible the Bill should include a clear definition of the role of the police service. We look forward to more detailed debate on the subject later and to hearing the Minister's ideas about how best to tackle the matter.
<P>
The press release that I mentioned also quoted ministerial opinion that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is widespread agreement that reform of the existing arrangements is needed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a consensus encompassing the previous and current Governments and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. We accept the need for change to policing in Northern Ireland. Something needs to be done; the question is what, how much, when and in what form?
<P>
The Minister pre-empted a matter that I wanted to raise, concerning the worry that has been expressed in several quarters about the timing of the Bill. The Police Authority for Northern Ireland has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Authority would be the first to acknowledge that reform of the tripartite system is long overdue, however there is a very real danger that the reasons for introducing legislative change at this time will be misunderstood and indeed misrepresented''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The comments continue with the remark that presenting a Bill now
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may have given rise to what may be unrealistic and even unrealisable expectations in some quarters''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to be a reference to the nationalist side of the equation. From the Unionist quarter concern has been expressed that the move is too much, too far and wrong at the present time.
<P>
The Police Authority also expressed a view that it is essential that the Minister who is setting out the reasons for the Bill should establish that nothing is to be done to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``exaggerate the importance of the package of reforms as a political expedient''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister reflected those views when he spoke about the talks process and the Government's desire to respond as quickly as they could to anything constructive that came out of it. It was always the previous Government's view that much of the detail relating to changes in policing should come from the talks process rather than from the Government of the day. I think that the present Government take a slightly different view. We believed that it was best if the parties could reach some agreement. The present proposal of course gives the Labour Government a different framework to consider and discuss.
<P>
There are two views about policing in Northern Ireland, and bringing them together will be extremely difficult. The issue is one that divides the two sections of the community. The Minister should proceed with caution. His opening remarks show that he realises that and wants to proceed cautiously to ensure that we get the legislation right. He knows how important it is and we intend to help him find a constructive way forward. The Bill must be workable and acceptable to the majority. It must address the thorny issue of policing and bring about a positive outcome for the Province.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Jones, for what I expect to be a long and arduous journey as we steer the Bill through its Committee stage. I am grateful to the Minister for spelling out the timetable so far in advance. That is helpful to Northern Ireland Members, especially those who have to participate in the talks process--even though some of us are no longer permitted to do so.
<P>
It is interesting to hear the Minister talk about a structured and purposeful way forward. We all hope that that will happen but whether it does will rest mainly with the Minister. We shall certainly do nothing in Committee to hinder a way forward. However, as we view the Bill as fundamentally flawed we anticipate a climate for changing it as we move along. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify where we can expect to see the changes.
<P>
For Northern Ireland Members who are forced to commute regularly it is particularly helpful to have papers delivered back in Northern Ireland as well as here in Committee. We do not want to spend our time having to search for papers that may be brought forward by the Government as part of their business on a particular day. I would be grateful if the Minister would respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As I said during the proceedings of the Committee considering the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill, it is not the role of Ministers to spoonfeed hon. Gentlemen. What I can do this morning is set out the parameters for achieving a constructive debate on the issues before us. I spoke to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) on Sunday to provide him with some of my ideas about that.
<P>
As to the distribution of papers, it rests with individual members of the Committee to obtain them and they will know when they are being published. If there are any supplementary explanatory documents I shall take account of the hon. Gentleman's remarks and try to ensure that they are made available as efficiently as possible. The hon. Gentleman is not the only one who has to commute back and forth: Ministers have the same problems and may experience them even more extensively than the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, at least as far as it goes. I do not want to be spoonfed and I am suspicious about what might be on the spoon.
<P>
I want to pursue the Minister's plea for a structured and purposeful debate. He drops in very easily, when it suits him, the idea that we shall have exactly the same as the rest of the United Kingdom. As an Ulster Unionist, I welcome that idea, but when it suits him, the Minister suggests that Northern Ireland is a region with specific problems that are different from those in the rest of the United Kingdom. I assure him that we do not want to be tied by what is or is not acceptable in the rest of the United Kingdom; we shall study each issue on its merits.
<P>
On Second Reading, I alluded to my concern about the Bill. My major concern is that more authority is being clawed directly from the Police Authority to the Secretary of State. It might help the Minister if he studied the debate that took place at Stormont on 18 February 1970 when the Police Authority was debated and the purposes for which the authority was established were considered.
<P>
There had been considerable clamour--perhaps, in some cases, that clamour was justified--to the effect that policing in Northern Ireland was too closely identified with political interests. At that time, the police were particularly keen to have a police authority and to accept the proposals in the Hunt report, but under the Bill more of the power and direct authority for the police is to be vested in the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will be obliged to consult the Police Authority, but that is not good enough and substantial change must be made as the Bill progresses through Committee.
<P>
I welcome the document, ``Your Voice, Your Choice'', which deals with the way in which the Police Authority might be structured. It is one of the more useful documents that the Northern Ireland Office has issued recently; it is not perfect, but it makes substantial and useful proposals. There are other matters that, frankly, would be unworkable, and some proposals could not be considered if the Bill progresses as drafted. The opportunities for the Police Authority to perform its function meaningfully and effectively would be severely curtailed by the Bill.
<P>
Does the Northern Ireland Office have any substantial and accurate figures on what savings may be achieved if certain functions are directly transferred from the Police Authority to the Chief Constable? It is incumbent upon the Minister, perhaps even now, to tell us whether either the Chief Constable or the Police Authority have given him figures defining the savings to be made when these responsibilities are transferred.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is my understanding, and I look to the Minister for confirmation or otherwise, that the Northern Ireland office has been fishing in the dark over the transfer of functions. It has not received any substantive information from either the Chief Constable or the Police Authority, nor is it possible for either of them to provide such figures at present.
<P>
We will find ourselves in a situation where the 3,500 people currently employed by the Police Authority, 2,800 of whom are civil servants, will have to be redeployed. I am not sure to what extent they will be redeployed. There has been no indication in any papers I have seen of how that might be done. I am not even sure, although I must assume that the Police Authority will be left with some staff, how many people it will directly employ.
<P>
The most dangerous element here is that those who will be employed by the Police Authority, with the probable exception of the chief executive, if I read the Bill correctly, will have to be negotiated between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. We will have the ridiculous situation in which the Chief Constable is supposed to be accountable to the Police Authority but the Police Authority has to go to the Chief Constable to negotiate what staff it will have--the very staff who will be looking at and examining how the Chief Constable carries out his policing functions. I hope that before we go any further the Minister will be able to enlighten me on that apparent contradiction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I should be delighted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It may help the Committee if I respond to the hon. Gentleman. It would not be appropriate to go into the detail of the measures that we shall discuss later as that would pre-empt our detailed consideration of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman seems to believe that the legislation is being driven by a desire to make savings. That is not the motivation. If that is what he is asking the Government to do, I take it as a positive step forward that we should seek to deliver our public service in the most efficient and effective way possible.
<P>
The Bill's overall import is that it is not being driven by savings but by the desire to achieve the best governance of the policing of Northern Ireland--a principle with which I hope the hon. Gentleman agrees. The question of staffing and any savings or other cost implications that may accrue are detailed matters that should not colour his judgment of the merits or demerits of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I apologise to you, Mr. Jones, and to others if I have expressed myself so badly that the Minister thought that my points were based on the need to make savings. Of course, if savings can be made, that is fine. What I was talking about, however, was control, responsibility, accountability and the means by which they could be achieved. I was not talking about financial savings. I was going to make the point that the Bill does not contain any reference to a code of practice for financial management, but I will return to that issue later.
<P>
With reference to the point that I was making before the Minister's intervention, my concern, and that of my party, is that the Police Authority appears to have its powers eroded at every stage; it is not even able to employ its own staff. The Bill does not set out how the authority will be financed. I know that there will be a separate budget, but there is no indication as to what that will be. Obviously, that is because we do not know the number of people who will be directly employed by the authority. Part I of the Bill is an attack on the safeguard that was put in place 28 years ago by the Northern Ireland Government in response to the Hunt report.
<P>
As the Minister has raised the matter of costs, I should like to point out that for three or four years I have had no success in obtaining the figures for the savings that might be achieved, until quite recently an official of the police division threw out a &#163;10 million carrot. That is unrealistic. I have yet to discover how we achieved such a nice, round, comfortable figure of &#163;10 million in savings.
<P>
It would be wise if the Minister did not sell his soul to the Treasury by tossing out figures of that sort. The nature of the Treasury is such that it might take him at his word, and then a year or two ahead, when we wonder why we do not have adequate funding for policing duties, he would say that it was nothing to do with the Northern Ireland Office or the advice from the police division, but all to do with the Treasury.
<P>
In that respect the Bill is complex and in some areas it is inadequate. It is easy for the Minister to toss out words such as merit, saying that the Police Authority will be appointed on merit. That is grand if ``merit'' is not defined, and that has never been done, as far as I am aware. If merit has been defined, I can prove substantially to the Minister that it has been overlooked in some of the appointments that have been made.
<P>
Perhaps it is my naturally suspicious mind, but I believe that merit is overlooked when convenient. There are some excellent people on the Police Authority, but it would be possible to have even more people with genuine community interests and a great ability to ensure that Northern Ireland secures the type of policing that the Minister says he wants.
<P>
I should like the Minister to consider the matter of community and police liaison committees, and in that context consider also tabling an amendment to the Bill. Until now, these committees have, I believe, been appointed only by regulation, with their role and function not defined in primary legislation. The Minister's desire to consult widely can, from my experience, lead to all sorts of difficulties.
<P>
It is important to define carefully ``consulting widely''. It is interesting that the first ever police Bill relating to appointing a police authority attempted to define the areas from which members of the authority would be chosen. There are always difficulties with that, but it is important that we tackle them here because, if this remains a vague issue after the Bill has gone through the House of Commons, the Minister and his officials will forever be plagued by sections of the community who will claim that they should be represented but are not. We could make considerable progress with this issue, because if such committees were properly structured, there would, at grassroots level, so to speak, be an input that could filter through to the Police Authority. There would also be a seedbed for members of the authority to cut their teeth on local issues, deal with local problems, and reflect them through the process to the Police Authority. It seems ridiculous that we reach out into the ether, pluck people from here and there and make them members of a police authority without their ever demonstrating that they are interested in policing at their own local level.

<P>

<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes much sense but it does not seem necessary to include a provision in the Bill now. The Government are trying to ensure that local authorities have greater empowerment to be responsive to their communities. As the power evolves, the next stage may well be that local police committees will be more effective throughout the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman's idea is a good one, but I am not sure that we need push it at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I mentioned it at this stage because I wished to ensure that we did not confine the relationship between the Police Authority and local areas to district councils. The Bill suggests that the authority will consult local councils about those who should be spoken to outside the domain of the local council. However, the local council should not be set apart in that way. Currently community policing liaison committees and local councils appear to be synonomous but we have an opportunity to broaden membership of CPLCs to include representatives from local authorities.
<P>
We may not need to include such a provision in the Bill now, but the Minister has the responsibility to reflect Government thinking about the most effective way of filtering from local levels to the Police Authority--without offending particular groups--the needs of society throughout Northern Ireland.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
At this stage, I shall desist from further comment except to say that my party supports the recommendations of Dr. Maurice Hayes on policing arrangements: they are patently sensible and, more importantly, workable. They will benefit Northern Ireland society. As we debate the Bill we must not lose sight either of the interests of members of the police force or of what will be to the betterment of the greater number of people who want a peaceful and lawful society in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon: </B>(Newry and Armagh): I also welcome you, Mr. Jones, as Chairman of the Committee. I hope that you enjoy your stay with us and that you use your good offices to ensure that our debate in Committee is structured, brief and succinct. I shall certainly try to achieve those three objectives.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's request for a structured debate. Debate on and amendment to the Bill divides itself naturally into three topics--one about the Police Authority, the second about police complaints and the third a schedule almost exclusively relating to the complaints section of the Bill. I accept that the Committee will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays but I regret that those are the chosen days.
<P>
Some of us are centrally involved in serious talks and negotiations. We are required to take part in them: it is not of our own choosing; it was imposed on us by this Parliament. The job has to be done. It would be possible, however, not to have a sitting so that the Grand Committee could sit. There could be a conflict of interest when crucial negotiations are taking place. However, I recognise the realities and I will abide by them.
<P>
It is important to express opinions honestly, briefly and in the most structured way possible in Committee. I expressed my views on Second Reading and there is no reason to change them. The Bill is inadequate and fails even to approach the heart of the problem. My opinion was reinforced yesterday by the publication of a glossy brochure, which would be hard to beat for superficiality in terms of the crucial need to solve the policing problem.
<P>
When we consider what the Bill and the glossy brochure do not address, the deficiency in both becomes apparent. We will convince ourselves that both documents cover crucial matters and that budgetary aspects are immensely important. The Police Authority's position will be presented with great loquaciousness; that of the Police Federation will be expressed with even greater loquaciousness.
<P>
We cannot escape some key factors. The Bill does not go to the heart of our problem in Northern Ireland: how do we police a society, which is divided not only politically, but in terms of its identity, allegiance and ideology? How can we create a system of policing that commands the support of the entire community? ``Support'' must mean more than words: it must mean joining the police service and protecting it. The police service must be part of the community in which it operates.
<P>
I listened with interest to the observations of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) about the glossy brochure, the appointments to the Police Authority, and the use of police liaison committees and community liaison committees. I shall give an example which emphasises the fundamental problem that we are not tackling. Not one policeman lives in south Armagh, on the west bank in Derry or in west Belfast. Liaison committees are set up and ways of appointing people to the Police Authority are sought, but we do not even make an effort to reach the heart of the problem.
<P>
Our deliberations exaggerate the importance of parts of the Bill. Parts of the Bill are crucial, but let us not create a myth that the Bill is more important than the problem that it attempts to tackle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman alluded to a comment that I made. I take note of his point about policemen not residing on the west bank of the Foyle or in south Armagh. But he and I know why: it is not because members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary lack the desire to live in the areas where they work, but because of their personal security and that of their families when they are off duty. That is what has led to this unfortunate situation.
<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me that the alternative to getting the people in those areas in touch with policing, however it is done, is the sort of incident that happened last night, when the Provisional IRA imposed its own form of justice on a drugs dealer. Neither the hon. Gentleman nor I want the extremists from our respective traditions to usurp the power of the RUC in the areas where it finds it most difficult to operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman, who once again gives part of the answer. He says that I know why policemen do not live in those areas, but he gives only part of the answer. There is a much more fundamental, underlying reason which has existed since the state and the policing system was formed in 1921, and the figures show it. There was a 21 per cent. nationalist involvement in 1921. That figure had fallen to 16 per cent. by 1970; it is now 9 per cent. That is not only because of threats from the IRA or from any other paramilitary organisation; it is a manifestation of the fact that there is a deep ideological division of identity. Until we start to cure that and deal with it, we can throw as many glossy brochures as we like at the problem, but we will not get to the heart of it.
<P>
I make that point because I believe that it is right to do so. Sometimes, in this type of context, we give ourselves and what we are discussing an importance that is not always justified. What is staring us in the face is that although there will be much debate about the Police Authority, and many amendments, the one thing that it is not is an authority. That is the reality. It is a body, but it is not an authority; it does not even have the authority of a budget of its own to spend. It is not a police authority, whatever else it is.
<P>
I have always believed that there is a need for a buffer between the community and the authority for policing. But we must recognise that the authority for policing in the Bill is not the Police Authority, but the Secretary of State. A buffer is needed between the community and the Secretary of State--between the community and the person who exercises the authority--and that buffer is the Chief Constable. Therefore there are two forms of authority in the Bill; one is the Secretary of State's, the other the Chief Constable's. The one thing that the body does not have is authority.
<P>
As our debate progresses, we should remember that, effectively, a large part of the Bill is based on a misnomer. This is not a police authority. I regret that because, like the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I welcome the Hunt report and the creation of a body to act as a buffer and undertake a certain role in society.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us consider the history of that body--we shall not doubt hear about those who have been members--and remind ourselves of the number of people from the nationalist community who attempted to serve on it but found that they could no longer in conscience remain members. I remind the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone of Jack Hassard from Dungannon, of Mr. Murphy, from the legal profession, and of numerous others who found that they could not remain members because they had no authority, nor could they live with some of what was done in their names. Lest we be tempted to become platitudinous, let us remember those things if we are serious about wanting to get the matter right.
<P>
I make that crucial political point now because a consequence of it was touched upon earlier. I refer to the unseemly haste in producing the Bill at a time when serious negotiations are taking place. They may or may not succeed; if they do, however that is defined, things will change fundamentally. One fundamental question that will be asked, and each person will have to answer, is: can an administration or political structure of that type sustain itself if, effectively, responsibility for policing does not rest with it? Is it possible to have an administration, legislative and executive, if the most fundamental issue in Northern Ireland society is not dealt with by it?
<P>
That is a question that rattles the bones in each community in Northern Ireland, where, both within and between parties, the strongest imaginable views are held. It must be answered, because it will keep cropping up as we go through the Bill. The question has been touched upon, and it will come to the fore, but when we are going flat out to try to resolve a problem, is it right that that should be swept under the carpet?
<P>
My views on that are fairly well known. Power without authority is the weakest imaginable position for any administration. I am part of the dregs of a previous administration from 1973, which fell under a mixture of lack of courage here from the Government of the time, and that administration's lack of power to sustain itself because it did not have control of the policing. That was left to others.
<P>
The time will come in these negotiations when all of us on all sides will have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to leave the policing to others. That will be an interesting question when it is put and answered. I note already that one of the parties, Sinn Fein, would much prefer to have British people administering the police. It said yesterday that it would rather have someone from England, Scotland or Wales doing that, which is a strange form of republicanism. That question goes to the heart of our problem.
<P>
I greatly welcome the section on police complaints in the Bill. The apparatus must be wholly independent. It might be possible to get away with misnomers such as a ``police authority'' that is not one, and with saying that authority is vested in the Secretary of State, which it is, but nothing should tamper with the independence of the ombudsman. We must insist that he be completely independent. He must not be dependent in any shape or form on the whim of either a Secretary of State or a Chief Constable. He must be absolutely independent of both of them, and he must be able to control each and every case from beginning to end. The final adjudication should be made in the name of the independent ombudsman.
<P>
It is suggested in the Hayes report that a reduction in the budget from &#163;5 million to &#163;2 million could result from the appointment of an ombudsman. That could happen only if the ombudsman were not doing his job or were not being allowed to do his job, and most of the complaints were shovelled over to the police to investigate themselves. I agree with the Minister that the system could be an example for other countries, but only if it is budgeted in such a way that the ombudsman's independence is not eroded by financial requirements from day one.
<P>
I look forward to the debate on that part of the Bill. I will table a number of amendments, and I hope that they will be accepted. It is important that all members of the Committee, whatever other prejudices they may have, insist that what is created will be absolutely independent.
<P>
My final point relates to the police and community liaison committees that feature highly in the glossy brochure. They have been spoken about for years; they have been nodded at. They do not exist, of course. They do not exist where the problems are. Imagine the chairman of the Police Authority coming to the police and community liaison committee meeting in Crossmaglen, or even Cullishanna, Forkhill or the Malone road, when a problem needs to be resolved. The whole thing is irrelevant. Yes, he could improve the quality of policing at the edges. Perhaps the policeman would come along 10 minutes sooner and some of the graffiti that offend the people of the Malone road as they drive up it might be dealt with.
<P>
However, the police and community liaison committees will serve no purpose in Andersontown, in Markethill, where I live, or in other places throughout the north of Ireland where policing is the problem. That--I do not want to sound cynical, although I am afraid that I sometimes do--is why I take a disparaging view of the glossy brochure. I shall not give it a name, but I wonder where it was printed. I wonder whether it was printed in the north of Ireland--[Interruption.] It was. I am delighted to hear that; it makes a change.
<P>
We are not being presented with a serious attempt to solve the problem that we face. I look forward with some trepidation to the Committee's proceedings and to hearing the views of the Police Authority and the Police Federation. I am also looking forward to putting a view that is not often enough heard--that policing goes to the heart of our problem in the north of Ireland, and that if we do not solve that, we solve nothing. I shall put forward that view at every stage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> I am delighted to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Jones--but I did not welcome as much the Minister's big-stick approach in threatening late nights if we do not toe the line in the structured set-up in which he has invited us to take part. I hope that his approach to the Bill and the Committee will be one of responsiveness to reasoned and reasonable amendments, of which there are many on today's amendment paper.
<P>
I do not think that any Committee Member would object to the suggestion that the Committee should not meet next week while the Minister of State is out doing business for Northern Ireland in Japan. We should all wish him well in that. At the present rate of exchange he could probably make some purchases for us while he is there. I should have done everything in my power to prevent trips to Dublin for some other purposes. But if the Minister wants to go to the far east I am happy to support him in that.
<P>
We are told that the Bill is to provide for impartial, efficient and effective policing. I dare anyone to say that he would not want that for Northern Ireland, or indeed for any part of the United Kingdom. I listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) who might be surprised or even worried if I were to say that I agreed with some of his comments. However, he should take account of a basic premise. His disparaging references to ``glossy brochures'' and to the lack of likely impact in Cullyhanna, Markethill or Crossmaglen, and his argument that the state's role in policing is a major problem while not everyone accepts the status quo affecting state relationships with the United Kingdom or the Irish Republic, amounts to saying that there should not be change until that major problem is resolved by a constitutional settlement--that no change will satisfy people until that has happened and they feel comfortable with the constitutional set-up.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The reality is that no matter what changes are made to the RUC or to policing in Northern Ireland, the support of terrorists--of any persuasion--will not be obtained for the police force. A similar thing could be said of the people with similar goals and ideals to those of the terrorist organisations--a significant number of people.
<P>
There is little in the Bill that will contribute to achieving the goal of impartial, efficient and effective policing. The only significant aspect relates to police complaints and disciplinary issues. Other than that, I can find nothing to contribute to police impartiality, efficiency or effectiveness. I supported the idea of improvements with respect to police complaints and disciplinary procedures when Dr. Maurice Hayes's report was published. The proposal is valid and it should be made law.
<P>
Given that so little of the Bill appears to relate to the stated goal, I wonder about the purpose of the remainder. Clearly, some of it has a political purpose. It is included so that it can be waived in front of people to keep them on board, to provide concessions, to show that the Government are listening to them and moving towards them. The attempt to move away in stages from the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and to place it under the umbrella of the Northern Ireland police service, and the inclusion of matter concerning the oath, are all items with a political purpose that do nothing to achieve the stated goals of impartiality, efficiency and effectiveness. The Committee should be apprehensive about any change that is not geared towards improvements of that kind.
<P>
I know that some people are concerned about any change at all in policing. Especially when a police force is under fire, that attitude is understandable. However, it does not follow that improvements cannot or should not be made in policing in Northern Ireland. However, those should not be political changes, and I suspect that political changes have been included in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh referred to the fact that the proposals have coincided with consideration elsewhere--by some, at least--of a constitutional settlement. He seemed to think that it was premature for the Government to present a Bill when those engaged in the talks had not fully considered or reached agreement on the matter. It is consistent with my views to think that the talks process has a predetermined outcome; the Government know the eventual result and it all fits into their overall scheme. I do not take the charitable view held by some people that the talks process is capable of producing any outcome other than that which has been predetermined by the Government--or should I say the Governments.
<P>
I want to make considerable comment on the proposals for the Police Authority. An essential feature of any police force is its accountability: to whom will it be accountable? The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh made it clear that authority, in its broad sense, lies with the Secretary of State. I agree. The Police Authority is window dressing and has a limited role in Northern Ireland. Ultimately, an elected representative or representatives must have some authority for policing. The Police Authority must be accountable to the community, and only elected representatives have the necessary authority.
<P>
The Government's consultative document suggests several ways of forming a police authority, but it does not suggest that it should have more power or control, which is a vital issue. Indeed, the Bill and the consultative document suggest that the Secretary of State will end up with more power. I find it hard to swallow the Minister's comments about moving away from the old Northern Ireland Government control of the police, while at the same time pushing through legislation that would ensure that this Government would have more control of the police.
<P>
The Secretary of State has several means of controlling the police. If she can call in the Chief Constable to report to her, obviously he is accountable to her and he carries out his operational role fully cognisant of the fact that she has certain views and wants to achieve certain things. She makes appointments to the Police Authority, and does so according to her political view. This is where merit comes in, because someone who is a back-slapper, a lickspittle, a toady or a head nodder will be appointed to the Police Authority by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Hesford </B>(Wirral, West): If that is the case, may I ask, on behalf of lickspittles everywhere, why I have not been appointed? If the hon. Gentleman believes that members of the Police Authority will be all those things, why does he waste time by commenting on what he perceives as discrimination in its membership? Why does he discuss that separate issue, if he genuinely thinks that the Police Authority is a waste of time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The answer to that question is so apparent that I am surprised that the question was asked. If one objects to a body that is full of head nodders, the obvious answer is to get people selected who are not--that is how such a body is changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a wider point--that the Police Authority, as constituted, is a waste of time. If that is his genuine position, why does he want people on it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The role of any democrat is to change an organisation to make it worthwhile. I do not believe that the Police Authority is a worthwhile body; it has very little power and authority and needs to be changed. Perhaps I cannot discuss what is going on in a Select Committee at the moment, but evidence given to that Committee shows that the Policy Authority lacks the ability to address vital issues. One cannot escape that fact, although one might want to address those issues in very different ways. The Secretary of State's responsibility is laid down in law. What she does is not a matter of choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been in political life in Northern Ireland for a long time; so have I. Is he aware of any occasion when an active member of a political party has been appointed to the Northern Ireland Police Authority? Does he have any observations on such matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall have to be careful in responding to that question. I know of a number of people who have been appointed to the Police Authority. It is possible to look at one's political party and guess--usually accurately--which members will be appointed. If someone is appointed who does not toe the line, as was the case in the previous Police Authority, that person is quickly removed. That certainly occurred in the case of Mr. Corrigan, a member of the Democratic Unionist party.
<P>
The Secretary of State's legal responsibility in such matters is set out on page 5 of the document that was referred to as a glossy brochure; it actually has a matt cover. It describes the Secretary of State's responsibility under section 19(1) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, which prohibits the Secretary of State from discriminating
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``against any person or class of persons on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 requires that the membership of the Police Authority should be representative of the community, despite what the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh thought. If anyone is in any doubt about what that means, it is spelt out in the document. It suggests several ways in which a police authority could be set up and, in each case, how many members from each of the political parties would be included. Under that system, there would be at least two members of my party. According to the Government's own document, therefore, a representative police authority should have two members of the Democratic Unionist party. The present Authority has none--to the embarrassment of the chairman of the Police Authority, who had to admit to the chairman of a Select Committee not only that the present Police Authority discriminates against my party, but that there was gender discrimination, against a woman. He also had to admit--I am sorry that he is not here--that it discriminated geographically against people from Fermanagh. That large county is unrepresented in the Police Authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the authority was proportional--in some kind of Liberal Democrat sense--60 per cent. of it would be broadly Unionist and 40 per cent. would be broadly Nationalist? The same divisions that characterise the whole of Northern Ireland society would also characterise the authority. The alienation that was described by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh would continue and might prevent the authority from achieving some of the changes and progess that we all want to see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman tells us that he knows better than the people of Northern Ireland. He would make a good dictator. The views of the people of Northern Ireland do not matter; what he wants to happen should happen. A police authority should be representative of the divisions within society. Why should it not be? How can people support the RUC unless all sections of our society are represented? Governments have traditionally made contact with people who are not represented in the Police Authority at present. Even though such people have not accepted that contact, Governments have tried to include them, to make a more representative Police Authority. It is strange that while efforts are made to include parties that do not want to be part of the Police Authority, no efforts are made to include parties that do.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that representativeness is important but we must find ways of transcending some of the historic divisions in Northern Ireland. I understand the hon. Gentleman's sense of grievance that nobody from the Democratic Unionist Party is represented on the authority. I am on his side about that and something should be done about it. However, in addition to representatives, we must have people who transcend the historic divisions and who try to move the process forward so that policing is seen to work for the whole community. At present there are still many people in Northern Ireland who do not feel that it is.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to the extent that there can be such people but there does not have to be. The report allows some positions to be appointed from groups such as churches, community organisations, trade unions and so forth, as well as from political parties on a representative basis. It suggests that representatives from political parties should be involved in proportion to their strength in the last local government elections.
<P>
Legislation requires the Secretary of State not to discriminate on the basis of political belief and to have a representative Police Authority. The Secretary of State recognised in her own document that that requires DUP representation, yet she has done nothing about it. That shows clearly that the Secretary of State is acting illegally. She is in breach of the legal requirements of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 and indeed of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have listened to the hon. Gentleman carping on about how the Secretary of State is in breach of the law. He used the word ``illegal''. Have he and his party ever thought of challenging the alleged illegality? The answer is no. Why is he using the Committee as a platform to air views and make wild allegations when a legal remedy is open to him? He and his party have never gone down that avenue because they know that they have no sustainable case in law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Had I known the point that the Minister intended to make I would not have bothered giving way to him because his question would have been answered in the new few paragraphs. When we went to see the Secretary of State and laid the charge before her in January, she accepted that three further places were available on the Police Authority and that they would give her the opportunity to remedy the error, which she admitted it was. Nothing happened in January. The positions have not been put out to public advertisement as required under the new terms.
<P>
Now the consultative document is before us and I want to find out from the Minister whether it means that further appointments to the Police Authority will be put on ice even longer. If that is the case and those three places, which could remedy the situation, are not to be fulfilled, I can tell the Minister that he will be in court over the issue. Perhaps the Minister will tell me that the available places will be filled in such a way as to resolve the issue. I should be happy to give way to him if he can tell me whether the consultative document means that those positions will be filled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> It is difficult to understand the hon. Gentleman's anger about exclusion from the Police Authority which, by definition, has no authority. I can understand why his party may be aggrieved or piqued about it. The essence of the problem is that the Bill seeks accountability by association from the communities and political parties, while it provides for authority to reside politically with the Secretary of State, and operationally with the Chief Constable. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that circumstances could evolve politically in which, rather than nonsense about police liaison committees, district council elections--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I got the gist of the hon. Gentleman's question. He misses the reality of Northern Ireland. He knows that authority does not reside with district councils, various Northern Ireland boards or Northern Ireland Members of Parliament. We can do little to change events in Northern Ireland. The only trust that is reposed in members of political parties is to speak on behalf of those whom they represent. I can do that on a district council or here, on a board or in the Police Authority. Those institutions allow me to speak for those whom I represent.
<P>
Of course, it would be better to have real power, and a system of government that allowed accountability to the people of Northern Ireland. However, until that exists, we must accept our responsibility, as elected representatives, to speak on behalf of those who put us in our current positions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The argument about the Police Authority is flawed when we realise that, currently, it has some power. It is responsible for approximately 14 per cent. of a &#163;600 million plus budget--[Interruption.] The Minister wants me to provide exact figures, but I cannot carry them in my head. That responsibility, and the fact that the Chief Constable is technically and legally answerable to the Police Authority, means that it has some power. If we consider the Bill from that point of view and in the light of potential erosion of power, we will progress more easily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No one suggests that the authority has no role or power. It plays the significant role of appointing the Chief Constable. District councils have some power, but they play no meaningful role in local government in England, Scotland or Wales. The authority is comparatively powerless.
<P>
Our words in Committee are spoken against the backdrop of the significant role that the Royal Ulster Constabulary has played in the conflict in Northern Ireland. Its officers have displayed great gallantry, and it is a fine force with a proud tradition. It has suffered greatly for many years in the Province. It has lost many members in murderous terrorist attacks and been placed in most difficult circumstances in a divided community. People who point the finger at the RUC should pay more attention to the difficult circumstances in which it has to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I shall be brief, as clearly hon. Members would like to get some lunch at some stage [Hon. Members: ``No.''] Perhaps not.
<P>
The problem for Government Members, which became very clear on Second Reading, is that we are between the rock of Unionism and the hard place of nationalism. The Government are trying to narrow the huge gulf between those two rocks so that people can occasionally transport themselves from one to the other, or perhaps share their common heritage together.
<P>
A strong feeling was expressed on Second Reading, especially by the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), that there was not much wrong with the current arrangements--that a minor piece on the ombudsman in accordance with the Hayes report might be welcome, but that beyond that nothing much else was needed. That conservative option of doing very little contrasted with the view expressed by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh that the Bill is not nearly radical enough because it does not address the policing concerns that characterise a divided society. I was interested in trying to get the right hon. Member for Upper Bann to admit that there was a problem, while others in the Chamber were saying that the problem was so huge that anyone could see the difficulties.
<P>
In the Bill the Government have come some considerable way towards addressing the needs of policing in Northern Ireland. They admit that there is a problem. One of the problems is the current structure of the Police Authority, which has at best a nebulous brief, about which hon. Members have many reservations. Some Labour Members--I know that these remarks will be unpopular, particularly with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone--felt that there were progressive elements in the Police Authority, such as Mr. Cook and Mr. Rider, who were trying to get it to address some of the issues that so concern the hon. Member for Newry and South Armagh. Unfortunately, their view was not well regarded by other members of the authority and the rug was pulled from under them by the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I shall happily give way. I did not think that I would get away with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I really cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with that. He neglects to say that there are decent, hard-working and honourable people on the authority who are members of both traditions in Northern Ireland. It was they who found the dictatorial and self-seeking attitude of Mr. David Cook totally unbearable. His decision-making on his own behalf and without reference to his committee was not acceptable. The question of professional journalists being members of the police authority answers itself and illustrates the folly of the Northern Ireland Office police division.

<P>

<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I interviewed the said gentlemen, and I found that they had much to say of value that the Government may wish to take into account when considering a more progressive and inclusive mode of policing than, unfortunately, it has been possible to establish in Northern Ireland so far. If sometimes they have to do it in a way that upsets people--some people have claimed that there is a problem while many others have said that there is not--they may find themselves unpopular.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government are trying to find ways of building confidence in the nationalist community--my hon. Friends were right about that--but that alienates us from our Unionist friends. We steer slightly towards the rock only to find ourselves accused of being crypto-republicans or whatever.
<P>
We must find a better mode of policing. We must at least get the complaints procedure and the authority for policing right. No one could deny that it is ultimately the Secretary of State's responsibility; the Bill perhaps establishes that more clearly but that is where the chain of command goes. The real worry for the police in their operations, if things are going wrong, as happens in all forces, relates to the ombudsman, not the Secretary of State. That, as the hon. Member for Belfast, East said, establishes clear accountability two ways. It is of course vital that the post of ombudsman be filled by someone who is impartial rather than representative. If that means someone from outside Northern Ireland who is not intimately associated with either of the principal allegiances--
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Who is impartial?
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that impartiality, when one is between a rock and hard place, can be difficult to find. There have been some outstandingly bad examples of so-called impartial people. It is important that we seek to fill the role appropriately.
<P>
What will discomfit those on the Unionist side of the debate is that the Secretary of State, in addition to being a member of the United Kingdom Government, is minded to try to include some ideas from south of the border. [Interruption.] Obviously that does not sit well with people such as the hon. Member for Belfast, East, but it is our agenda. Over time, matters peculiar to Northern Ireland will be addressed.
<P>
The Chief Constable visited the Select Committee and talked about some of the problems of Northern Ireland. As he put it, if there is a major problem in Kent people can be drafted in from Sussex. There is a neighbouring police force which allows a force to add to its usual establishment to address difficulties. The Chief Constable told us that the much greater expenditure per capita for policing in Northern Ireland is not only because of a divided society and the problems of terrorism but because there was no neighbouring police force to call on.
<P>
The Government are trying to foster closer relationships between the RUC and the police forces on the British mainland and a better understanding between the RUC and the Gardai in the south of Ireland. They are evolving relationships, but the moment that some people hear any suggestion of such things, they shrink violently from the idea that there might be proper operational co-operation between different police forces. Some people take the view that we should disengage immediately.
<P>
We are trying to steer a course through stormy waters. I hope that hon. Members will accept that change is needed and that the pace of change being proposed will allow evolutionary, rather than revolutionary change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Salter </B>(Reading, West): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Jones. I hope that it will not be a long and arduous responsibility.
<P>
I support the sittings motion and the principles of the Bill. I shall try to be structured and succinct. I have not had the advantage of reading a glossy or a matt brochure from the Northern Ireland Office. Such things are obviously hidden from Government Back Benchers, for obvious reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Excluded again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> But do we whinge?
<P>
In a small and steady way, the Bill seeks to enhance community support for the RUC and to improve its efficiency and accountability. We have had a tour round the prepared positions this morning, but no one really objects to the Bill's core principles. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, predictably, that the Bill is fundamentally flawed and my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh said that it does not go far enough--[Interruption.] I was being kinder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I wonder why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> The Minister, rightly does not claim that the Bill is the holy grail which will solve the problems involved in policing a divided society. It is one small step. Surely to goodness we can agree, within a modest timetable, to implement this modest proposal without the theatricals that mar consideration of Northern Ireland legislation.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's comment that the abuses of the earlier Stormont regime are completely rejected. None of us wants a return to politicised policing. The former abuses undermined the professionalism and impartiality of the RUC and helped to contribute to the minority community's resulting lack of confidence in the constabulary. The Bill attempts to restore confidence and to regain ground previously lost.
<P>
At the hon. Member for Belfast, East said, it is to our advantage that some members of this Committee are also members of the Select Committee. We may ask why the Bill is going through Parliament now, while we still await the Select Committee's report, but as the Minister said, the Bill is a modest measure and the Government have already made a firm commitment to take on board any proposals that are agreed in the talks process. That is welcome.
<P>
Following publication of the Select Committee report, I hope that the Minister will agree that if measures are in place further to contribute to achieving the principles behind the Bill, they too will be taken into account. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead and the hon. Member for Belfast, East will draw on the useful evidence relating to the Select Committee inquiry into the recruitment, composition and training of the RUC.
<P>
I advise all members of the Committee to sit in, if they have the opportunity, at community awareness training programmes at the RUC training centre at Garnerville. They are impressive. Many police services across the country could benefit from the professionalism--and, dare I say, radicalism--that the RUC has adopted in that programme. Of course it will take many years to bring about results, but we can learn from it and it should give comfort to political representatives from both communities in Northern Ireland about the way to build community confidence.
<P>
Given the broad agreement in Committee on certain aspects of the Bill--particularly the recommendations of Dr. Maurice Hayes who is well respected on both sides of the divide--I hope that we can proceed without too much filibustering. We may not have to use all the sittings that have been pencilled in for us.
<P>
The Bill clarifies the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. It will establish a long overdue independence in complaints procedures, to which nobody objects. It introduces the concept of a Northern Ireland Police Service while retaining the RUC. It establishes effective annual policing plans that are seen elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It will make other changes that will improve the governance and administration of policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I refer especially to clause 27, which will allow RUC officers to be seconded to UK policing organisations. That may seem a minor change but it was recommended by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, as evidenced by the latest recommendations of Mr. Colin Smith, which were published last week. The principles behind the Bill are in line with current thinking in many respects. They encapsulate and will enhance the recommendations of respected authorities.
<P>
The Bill contains proposals on which we can all agree. Why can we not get on with it, accepting the Minister's assurances that further changes can be incorporated? We should all accept the broad principle of improving community consent and community confidence and we should recognise that the efficiency and accountability of a well respected police force will best be served on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have had a good and extensive debate on the sittings motion. I did not anticipate that in my earlier remarks. I should like to deal with some, though not all, of the issues that have been raised. Many detailed points will become the subject of detailed consideration as the Bill proceeds in Committee.
<P>
I shall start by encapsulating what was said by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) in welcoming parts of the Bill. He drew attention to what the previous Government had done on policing structure. However, I do not accept that nothing should be done where nothing was done by others. His views seemed to reflect those expressed by the hon. Members for Belfast, East and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I must explain why that is not the most appropriate way forward.
<P>
We cannot stand still at the present time. The governance of Northern Ireland must continue and some aspects will need to change. If change is to be fundamental, it will depend on the input of local parties--with the consent of Northern Ireland--to the shape and structure of the new body. I hope that a better society will emerge from the process. The Bill is no more than a framework for better policing. It is the beginning, not the end of a process.
<P>
The comments of the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, for Belfast, East and for Newry and Armagh--though not necessarily those of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire--suggest that the Bill is damned because of what it attempts to achieve. That is no way to ensure good governance of part of the United Kingdom, or any country.
<P>
The Bill should be considered in the light of my earlier comments, backed by careful reading of the Bill. It would assist our deliberations if we simply examined the measure, and stripped away the prejudices that hon. Members might bring to the debate.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made a fundamentally flawed objection. He claims to be British and to be part of the British ethos, culture and tradition.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman corrects me. He says that he is rather than claims to be British. The measure includes provisions that already apply to British people, yet the hon. Gentleman claims that the British people are wrong in their choice of structures and frameworks for policing, the legislation for which was passed in 1994.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the Minister and the Northern Ireland Office apply the criterion that he described across the board? If he answers yes, I shall know that he does not begrudge my Britishness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not begrudge the hon. Gentleman's Britishness. The hon. Gentleman made a fundamental objection to a measure that is deemed appropriate for the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> What about the Parliament for Scotland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Belfast, East asks about Scotland. Similar measures to the 1994 legislation were implemented in different ways in Scotland because of the different legal system that exists there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In a moment. Aspects of the Bill take account of the uniqueness of Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I note the Minister's observations. Does he subscribe to the Thatcherite view that Northern Ireland is as British as Finchley?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not an expert on Finchley. I do not know whether it contains all the ingredients of Britishness. We cannot define ``Britishness'' exactly. I simply used the same phraseology as the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. However, I am pleased that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone welcomed the consultative document, ``Your Voice, Your Choice''. Although we may debate how the proposal will work, all hon. Members welcomed the establishment of an independent ombudsman. That provision is based on the Hayes recommendations.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh said that the Bill did not reach the heart of the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) was right to say that that is not the Bill's intention. The Bill does not attempt to solve the ills of Northern Ireland. It tackles the better governance of the Northern Ireland police service. It is a response to a range of ideas and suggestions on the issue.
<P>
One of the fundamental documents on which the Bill is based was published by the Labour party before the general election. That document tried to identify some of the ways forward. The Government are trying to reflect what we said in Opposition, and what we learned from our talks with people in Northern Ireland from a wide range of interests. That is not about getting to the heart of the problem. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh, to his colleagues and to the other parties in the talks process that they must get to the heart of every problem in Northern Ireland. Their hearts and their heads will solve those problems. The United Kingdom Government cannot impose a solution. We may assist in the identification of the heart of the problem and in finding the best way forward, but in the end the solution rests with the hon. Gentleman, his hon. Friends and members of other parties in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Bill considers the role and effectiveness of the RUC in the existing society and the interface between the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. It also takes account of wider aspects of public opinion through a variety of consultation processes. The Bill is an attempt to improve that tripartite structure and to find new relationships that will ensure better policing in Northern Ireland. The key elements regarding the Police Authority are to be found in part II; those regarding the Chief Constable are in part III and those regarding the Secretary of State in part V. They interrelate with other elements of the Bill. I do not recognise the criticisms that have been made. They do not stand up to a careful reading of the Bill, especially of those parts that I mentioned.
<P>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East welcomed my earlier comments and hoped that I would be responsive to reasonable debate. I am aware that his party was not represented on the Committee that considered the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill. That was not to do with the Government. He should talk to other opposition parties to find out why his party was excluded. If his party had been represented on that Committee, he would have been aware that the Government--and I, as the Minister--were prepared to engage in reasonable debate about the structuring and the re-structuring of the legislation. That commitment is there. I have said that if the political parties in the talks process--admittedly that does not include his party--come up with a better solution, better ways forward and an agreed position, then that will automatically be considered in relation to the Bill. I can give no clearer commitment than that.
<P>
I suggest to the hon. Member for Belfast, East that he should be part of the talks process, rather than constantly criticising and being negative about everything that the Government and others have done to find a better way forward for Northern Ireland. That would be the best way to represent his constituents' interests. He will not do that by being negative, but by being positive and constructive in finding a better framework. I appreciate that he welcomed the ombudsman approach.
<P>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East said that the Bill would transfer power to the Secretary of State, who would then direct and control the actions of the Chief Constable. By no stretch of the imagination could anyone who read the Bill come to that conclusion. The operational independence of the Chief Constable is not under threat. The Bill does not challenge that in any way. I remind hon. Members of some of the requests that they make of me as a Minister with responsibility for security matters. They ask me to find out what the Chief Constable is doing and to try to persuade him to do certain things. I always reply that such matters relate to the Chief Constable's operational independence. He must direct his resources as best he can to tackle the threats that arise in the community. When they ask for political interference and direction the operational independence of the Chief Constable is constantly pointed out to them. The Bill does not in any way undermine that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) used the analogy of being between a rock and a hard place, and that reminded me of tectonic plates. I may not have got this absolutely right but I believe that when tectonic plates hit each other, new structures emerge. That is a good analogy for the talks processes. When tectonic plates rub against each other major fissures occur and there are earthquakes. As the plates pull apart they cause other problems. The rock and the hard place may come together to create better and beautiful features. I am hopeful that the talks process can reflect that.
<P>
Intervening in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone repeated an accusation about Northern Ireland officials and officials within the police division. I hope that we do not descend into constant criticism of civil servants in our proceedings. If the hon. Gentleman wants to criticise the policies of the Northern Ireland Office he should direct his criticisms to the politicians who ultimately carry out the advice that they receive from officials and from hon. Members. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Remarks are being made from a sedentary position. The Minister should be heard in silence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Jones.
<P>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East says that there is political control. A political decision gave rise to the Bill. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has ever had to make a political decision and to come to conclusions. [Interruption.] I know that I should not respond to a sedentary intervention, Mr. Jones, but clearly, the hon. Gentleman understands that there is a political dimension to framing legislation. Politicians receive advice but it is they who enact legislation. They do not have to take the advice. They can distil it or take it in its entirety, but in the final analysis it is politicians, and in this case Ministers, who take forward legislation. I ask the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to desist from his constant attacks on officials. If they continue throughout our consideration of the Bill, I will constantly ask him not to proceed in that way.
<P>
I turn now to the final point by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West, who spoke about the Select Committee report. A judgment will have to be made on what comes out of that report. If it suggests ways forward they could be absorbed into the Bill as it evolves. He also paid a high compliment to the RUC community awareness programme. It is a justified compliment and will be relayed back to the RUC, which puts a great deal of effort into that aspect of its activities.
<P>
I look forward to further sittings of the Committee. I have made an offer to the Opposition about the best way to deal with the Bill. With their co-operation we can have a useful and constructive debate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
