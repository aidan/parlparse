pushed for time, so I will not invite you to introduce yourselves and
tell us all about where you have been for the last 20 years. However, I
do want us to get as much out of the session as we can, so if you want
to make some comments about your own situations, I suggest that you do
that in response to the first question that you are asked.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000021">&#160;</a>

to you all for giving up your time to give evidence, which will enable
the Committee to function far better than it could have expected to
without your assistance. I am sure that you will give the advice that

                           </em> Thank you, Emily. Yes, I think there
are risks, but I want to start by saying that in terms of third sector
organisations—charities and social enterprises—we are
strongly behind the concept of “any willing provider”,
because we believe that third sector organisations are an untapped
resource that can provide a more cost-effective service and certainly a
more citizen and patient-focused service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000024">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I see this as
an opportunity for us to step up to the mark and expand what we do. The
risk is that if that does not happen because Monitor fails to do its
job effectively, or GPs do not step up to the mark and involve third
sector organisations, “any willing provider” will not
mean an increase in third sector provision and will mean an increase
only in private sector
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000025">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Price, absolutely. One of the problems
with commissioning and procurement is that it is stuffed full of people
who, in that famous dictum, know the price of everything and the value
of nothing. They do not understand the concept of social costs and
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000027">&#160;</a>

problems that I suspect we shall have is this. Monitor is used to
regulating foundation hospitals, but will it be able properly to
regulate community mental health services? Will it be able to take
account of the wider social benefits that you get from third sector
provision, which joins up services across boundaries, as wider benefits
of its activities in the

Slipman:</strong>
                           </em> We do not see any risks in the foundation
trust bit of this policy, in the sense that it is the completion of the
journey of foundation trusts that was started seven years ago; they
remain fully part of the NHS, but will enjoy greater freedoms in order
to serve NHS patients. We think the risks are in the transition. There
are many risks in the transition period and they are largely about
provider sustainability during that time. We think that those ought to
be separated out and addressed separately from the longer-term
structure that is being set
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000030">&#160;</a>

certainly have some worries about quality in the new system—how
we maintain quality and ensure that that is driven down the
commissioner line in such a way that GP consortia take responsibility

would have some real issues about price competition if that were to
become part of this

Bennett:</strong>
                           </em> I identify two risks from a Monitor
perspective. First, as Sue says, there are inevitably risks in
significant change of the sort that we are looking at, although frankly
there would be significant risks if we did nothing. Therefore it is
very important that those risks are identified and managed, but in a
sense that is always the case for such a large and complex system as
the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second risk that we would be somewhat concerned about is that in the
course of the passage of the legislation, the reforms themselves lose
coherence. It is important that what we have here is a set of different
changes that collectively make sense, so there is a risk that
individual changes might lose the coherence of the
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000033">&#160;</a>

James’s terms, it is a loose baggy monster. That is one of our
problems. People do not realise that the sector as a whole employs 1.5
million people and has an annual turnover of some £143 billion,

that we will set some guidelines, but then the application of the
guidelines will be done at local level—there are requirements
for consultation and so on—driven by commissioners. Essentially,
as long as those guidelines are appropriately followed and there is
appropriate consultation, we will then just confirm the decisions that

                           </em> Yes. At the moment, for example, it is not
entirely clear to what degree foundation trusts are subject either to
the Competition Act or the Enterprise Act. One thing the Bill will do
is make it clear that they are. The consequences of doing
that—first, in terms of the Competition Act and giving Monitor
concurrent powers with the OFT—mean that if there are complaints
about anti-competitive behaviour, abuse of market power or forming
anti-competitive agreements, Monitor as well as the OFT has the power
to examine those complaints and seek remedy, if
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000052">&#160;</a>

addition, we will have the power to investigate the market, if we think
there are features of the market  that prevent effective
competition, where it is appropriate. If we identify problems, we can
pass them on to  the Competition Commission and ask it do a
further investigation and, if appropriate, make remedies. The
responsibility for looking at mergers and acquisitions in the sector
will move to the Competition Commission and the OFT as a
result.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is price
competition that could drive down quality, certainly in the first years
of a market such as this. Price competition would be very dangerous.
All the evidence shows that there is a race to the
bottom where there is price competition, and that is not desirable.
Whether it is desirable in the longer term is an open question, but it
certainly will not be until this system is stabilised and we know that
quality is a prime objective for the outcomes being
commissioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000071">&#160;</a>

about the role of Monitor. The first is about the Mid Staffordshire
trust into which the Francis inquiry is looking at the moment. It seems
to me as the local Member of Parliament that Monitor
approved the foundation trust status without going into
sufficient detail as to the status of that trust, particularly the
quality of care at the time. What assurances can you give us that
Monitor’s approval of foundation trusts will be more rigorous in
the future than it was in the case of Mid
Staffordshire?<a class="bkMark" name="11021085000010">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Yes. I was not around at the time, but
looking at the evidence, the trust was approved at a time when it was
not delivering appropriate care to its patients, and that was wrong.
Monitor has done three core things in the light of that, all based on
an external review of what happened and why, and therefore what lessons
can be learned. First, it has set a clear quality bar. That did not
exist before—there was no clear definition of what was an
adequate level of safe care for any trust to be providing to be
authorised. In conjunction with the CQC and the Department of Health,
there is now a clear definition of what the quality bar should
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11021085000011">&#160;</a>

Bennett:</strong>
                           </em> That is the first thing. The second thing is
that we have developed what we call a quality governance framework. We
have basically said, “What should the board of a trust be doing
to assure itself that the trust is providing an appropriate standard of
care to its patients?” Again, one has to say that in Mid
Staffordshire, that was not working. Having established what that
should be, we now have a whole series of tests that we apply to an
applicant trust to make sure that it is doing things at board level to
assure itself that the care is safe and to an appropriate
standard.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000076">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The third
thing is working much more closely with the care regulator. Of course,
the care regulator itself has changed. At the time of the Mid
Staffordshire authorisation, it was the HCC; now it is the CQC. We work
extremely closely now with the CQC, and it has changed significantly
how it considers that sort of issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
one of the things that did not work as well as it should have done at
the time of the Mid Staffordshire authorisation was the use of what

                        <p class="tabbed">The CQC has
developed approaches that allow it to make systematic use—and,
one hopes, effective use—of that sort of soft intelligence, and
we work much more closely with it to make sure we explicitly understand
its position in terms of quality of care. There are lots of other, more
detailed changes to be made, but I think those are the three main
things we have done to make sure that it does not happen

                           </em> In due course, I think one of the things
that the economic regulator will need to look at is the issue of the

say that when the appropriate time comes for the economic regulator to

that the NHS tends to treat much more complex cases. At the moment, the

assessment sets out the categories of the potential distortions that
exist. For example, there is an issue around the cost of capital. At
the moment, the public sector has access to the cost of capital of the
Government, whereas private sector organisations have to go to market
in order to raise capital for their investments. So in those
circumstances, the Department was able to quantify the potential cost
of that distortion.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000112">&#160;</a>

and to be able to understand the full impact of that. It is unfortunate

in rural communities, are one of the areas that we need to look at very
carefully. It is my expectation that the majority of rural emergency
care, as you have described, would be protected by designation and by

that is that if the provider felt that the national tariff was not
fully covering the cost of providing that emergency care, it could make
an application to Monitor so that additional funds could be released in
order to ensure the sustainability of that care. So we do think that
there are already some good checks and balances around this

I will bring it back if that is in order. I refer to an article that
David Bennett published in the <em>Financial Times</em> on 6 January,

be<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p>My
interpretation was that you were raising concerns about what you
referred to
as<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>Presumably,
that is the £24 billion, aside from the £80
billion that has gone into GP commissioning, that you are raising
concerns about and that would be retained by the Department of Health
and would oversee loans to hospitals at commercial rates. Sue Slipman
said that if the responsibility is left to the Department of Health, it
could be used as a policy transmission belt that would affect
independence.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000123">&#160;</a>

correct that Monitor would lose direct oversight over this budget and

purpose?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000124">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There are lots of issues there. That is
misquoting an interview, not an article I published. However, it is
right to say that there is an amount of capital that funds the
foundation trusts. That is the £24 billion, which is
quite different from the £80 billion, which pays for the
services they provide. On behalf of the Treasury, we seek to make sure
that the foundation trusts do not destroy that capital. That is public
money. The proposal in the Bill is that, because there is a potential

                        <p class="tabbed">The concern I
was expressing, which is somewhat reflected in that article, is that if

arm’s length from the Secretary of State. The proposal in the
Bill—because it has listened to our arguments—is that it
should be done through a vehicle that is placed at
arm’s length from the Secretary of State. It talks about
operational independence. I need to see the details, but, in principle,

                           </em> I have just two concerns. One was about
designated services and the protection of services. What exactly will
be designated? If you designate at a minimal level, or do it around
HRGs within the tariff, what you could potentially end up with is a
bundle of services that would not be broad enough to sustain the
quality and safety of the service overall.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore we
have a concern about how that designation works. Of course we expect
that to be probed by economic regulators, so we are not arguing for
inefficient service bundles. What we will have a concern about is that
the service bundles that are designated protect both quality and safety
for patients. There will be a fine line on some of those things, and we
expect to be involved in detailed discussions with the regulator about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second issue is about what happens with the financing facility and its
relationship with the Department. Ideally, we have one too few
arm’s-length bodies to resolve this in a way that satisfies
everybody. This is something that we have raised with the Secretary of
State. We will be looking for words of comfort that operational
independence means just that during the passage of this Bill. It has
worked with the competition panel, which has been part of the
Department, but we want to be pretty secure that it will work. It is
not that we suspect in any way that the Secretary of State or
Government will want to intervene, but clearly years are a long time in
politics.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000129">&#160;</a>

obviously clear agreement among the panel that the evidence shows that
price competition in health care drives down quality, or tends to. Sue,
you said earlier that therefore you thought there ought to be some sort
of stabilisation period. What does that mean? Does it mean that you do
not think that the maximum tariff that effectively drives the price
competition should come in at the onset of the new

safe to open up to price competition—because we have thought
about them and they have been tested in theory. I do not think anyone
would be against any form of price competition in the long term, but in
the short term, because of the dangers of transition in particular, we
need stability around price expectation, so that when competition is
forced it is forced on quality and not on
price.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000155">&#160;</a>

Stephen in on the discussion. Most of us have hospices in our
constituencies and end-of-life care is dominated by the hospice
movement. From my observations, the service has been provided on a very
price-competitive basis and is of high quality. Do you have any
comments about the role of the third sector in competing on both price
and
quality?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000158">&#160;</a>

Stephen Bubb:</strong>
                           </em> That is a good question. The hospice
movement is a brilliant example of an innovative way in which the
sector delivers end-of-life and palliative care, begun just across the
river in St Thomas’ hospital. This is a very good illustration
of some of the arguments we are having because many people end up in a
hospital bed at the end of their life, when they would prefer to be
either at home with community care or in a hospice. It is more
expensive for them to be in a hospital bed and it is usually not what
people want. It is an example of where 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 96<a class="bkMark" name="Column96">&#160;</a>
                           </div>you can deliver a more cost-effective service, and a service that meets
people’s needs. There is great potential for the hospice
movement to expand the work done in the community and in palliative
care. I would like to see commissioning processes that look at how you
involve those third-sector organisations more in the process. There are
plenty of examples where, if you use the concept of quality and look at
what we do in community care and adult social care, we provide a more
holistic
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give you a couple of examples of where we need to commission
effectively. The first example is what happened—this is a point
I particularly want to make to Monitor—with meals on wheels. One
county council procured its meals on wheels through a tender process
and WRVS, which was providing the service, was sacked in favour of a
private sector manufacturing company, which did a week’s worth
of microwaveable food that it delivered in and out the house in five
minutes. That was a cheaper service, but of course it was disastrous
for old people because the contact provided by WRVS and the volunteers
was more important than the meal in many cases, and many people lost
that contact. That was a very stupid decision and it was based entirely
on price. That is why the wider benefits that we bring have to be taken
into account. I suppose that illustrates what could go wrong if the
process is just based on
price.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me give you another example in relation to the potential. If you have
diabetes, you have an annual retinal eye test. Mostly, that is
conducted in a hospital or a doctor’s surgery, but that is not
an efficient or cost-effective way of doing it as it costs something
like £400 a go, whereas you could actually go and buy the test
in Specsavers for about £20. It would be interesting if you
explored the potential, which Diabetes UK and Specsavers have done, of
a service whereby you go to a high street optician for the retinal eye
test and the results go back to your GP and to Diabetes UK. If there is
a medical issue that needs addressing, the GP does that; but in
diabetes what is more important is diet, control, exercise, support and
advice, which you do not get from the GP, but you could get from
Diabetes UK. You could really intervene effectively because diabetes is
a huge and growing cost to the health service. It is not often dealt
with medically; it is best dealt with by organisations that can work on
exercise and diet. Sorry to give such a long
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000161">&#160;</a>

Sir Stephen, under the new provisions, competition on price will be a
key factor, and where big private companies believe that one of your
members has been picked on the basis of organisational structure and
not on the basis of price, they will be able to call for the regulator
to look into that decision. Do you not

Bills currently going through Parliament, sponsored by Chris White MP

the need to take account of social clauses when you are making

was a point I made earlier. That should be extremely important and
helpful to our case. Of course, one of our disadvantages against the
private sector is the lack of access to capital; that is a serious
disadvantage for us and obviously one of the issues that Monitor will
need to take account

little earlier about competition on price. I want to be clear in my own
mind about this cost-based argument. It strikes me, as was mentioned
earlier, that it is a real barrier that, in general, NHS providers are
14% cheaper than private sector providers, given the
Government’s intention to introduce competition and private
sector providers into the system. What remedies could be applied? Could
you give an example? Could it be a tax break given to a private sector
company as an incentive to enter the market, in order to overcome that
market
distortion?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000179">&#160;</a>

aimed at bringing in any particular sector. It is about trying to make
sure that patients’ interests are put first and, as we have
discussed, that will be largely about quality. What Monitor will need
to look carefully at, after doing a thorough analysis, is the extent to
which the current pricing mechanism, which is a bit one size fits all,
is appropriate in the future. We may see the need to have, for example,
differential pricing in the event that there are true market
distortions that need to be remedied, but we are far from reaching the
conclusion that that is the case at the

which one might easily conclude is the better way, is this. You might
say everyone gets the same price, but an element of the payment to some
providers is used to fund those things that are causing the distortion.
For example, if the distortion is that the public sector is having to
pay for training that the private sector is not paying for, you can
take an element of what you would have paid to the private sector and
use that to fund the training. In that way, you establish a level
playing field.

can tell me where I have gone wrong—when I asked my first
question, about competition, you seemed to be saying that there were
designated services and outside that, it was just crude financial
competition of one kind. You are clearly not saying that, though. You
are clearly saying it is not like competitive tendering in local
authorities; it is more like best value, although we are not quite
clear about how it is going to go. What we are not clear about yet is
what you will do to prevent yourself from ending up like another
Postcomm. You are aware that competition in the Royal Mail system, in
the mail delivery system, has led to one major supplier—the
state supplier, in that case—bearing the costs of the last mile
for all its competitors. In pure competition terms, that does not
happen normally. Tesco and Sainsbury compete, but Sainsbury does not
ask Tesco to deliver its stuff. Given that clinical processes are
fairly complex and often involve long-term treatment of a variety of
kinds, how will you avoid ending up like another
Postcomm?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000188">&#160;</a>

not get off the ground. If the governors support
the proposal, there will be a check and balance in terms of the
Competition Commission or the OFT checking that there is no potential
harm to patients in those circumstances from a deterioration in quality
as a consequence of the two organisations coming together. If the OFT

legislation or with the public bodies element? On the public bodies
element—sorry, I am losing my voice—and the wider

usual and lose capability at a time of change. Those are the risks that
we in the Department are focused totally on

an enormous organisational change—lots of people are affected,
and some people, particularly general practitioners and those who work
with them, are getting fundamental new responsibilities. There is
inevitably risk associated with that, but the opportunity, particularly
the opportunity of placing GPs, with their understanding of
patients’ needs and their ability to create a dialogue with
their colleagues in secondary care, in a new position is enormous and,
in my view, outweighs any of the organisational risks associated with
the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000205">&#160;</a>

change. The main costs are the ones that we have recognised are the
likely costs of redundancy, but we would have had those costs anyway,
to reduce administration costs to the system. We have to look at a
third reduction in our administration costs across the whole system
over the next four years. What the Bill and the programme of work that
we are embarked on does is try to find the best way of delivering those
administration costs savings, so that they are factored into our
spending plans for the next four years, as are the benefits that we
will get from

big differences we have got this time from where we have been with
other changes is that we are taking tiers out of the system entirely,
so things are going from the system—it is not just a reshuffle.
The other is that we have set a very, very clear limit on the cost of
administration in the system. What has happened before when we have
made changes and made cost reductions, and what happened the last time
we reduced the number of PCTs and strategic health authorities, was
that we made significant savings in the first couple of years, but the
cost then drifted back up again, so within about two years we were back
to where we started. The big difference this time is that we have set
very clear administration cost limits on the system that we, as a
Department, actually cannot breach, so part of the spending controls
that the Treasury now impose on us will require us not just to deliver
those savings, but to keep to them and not allow us to drift
back.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000211">&#160;</a>

longer make a judgment on the cost of new drugs and whether the NHS can
afford them. Instead, the Government want to move to a value-based
pricing system where they take a central role in deciding on price and,
GP commissioning aside, if the local NHS can afford it. Given your
organisation’s involvement in new drugs particularly over the
past few years, will you retain responsibility to advise Government?
What change will it have on the provision of drugs to patients? Do you
think it will result in major
changes?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000212">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The ambitions set out in the
consultation document, and we are still in a consultation phase, are
entirely laudable: to fix a price of a drug that reflects accurately
the additional benefits it brings over current standard practice; and
the plan calls for more transparency and more clarity in what the NHS
regards as value for new treatments, so that there is greater
predictability in the process for everybody. The consultation document
indicates that NICE will continue to undertake an evaluation of the
clinical and cost-effectiveness of the treatment and will set that out
in a context that allows anybody to see the optimal use of the
treatment in clinical practice, so we are still going to make our
contribution to the process. It will still be possible for prescribers
and the public to see just where a new treatment really scores in terms
of additional benefit compared with what is available at the moment. We
need to wait and see what the outcome of the consultation is to see the
final arrangements and then to make an assessment of their ultimate
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000213">&#160;</a>

you may not have direct responsibility for it at the moment. For many

£9 billion a year. Do you think that changing the way the NHS

on a range of neutral to positive. It can be positive if it achieves
the aim of the Government’s proposals—achieves our
ambition of providing a clearer signal to the pharmaceutical industry
about the sorts of products and the sorts of disease areas that we
really want the industry to concentrate on. We have to recognise that
the UK is a small component of any global pharmaceutical
company’s market, but we are not unimportant. We are significant
in lots of different ways, not least because of the status of the NHS
and British medicine internationally, and to some extent the work of
NICE, so we should not underestimate the impact. There is a real
potential for having a positive impact on what the industry innovates
in. If we are clearer with the industry about what we want, and we
carry on paying a fair price for the products that it
brings to market, it is a
win-win.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000215">&#160;</a>

that they display the evidence and recommendations based on the
evidence for different forms of practice and lay out the options.
Although that is actually what happens in most cases—there is
rarely a single solution that fits every patient—they do that
not just in a way that GPs and other health professionals understand,
because it is how they go about their work, but in a way that we all
understand, as we experience the evolution of the diseases and
conditions that we are going to live with through our lives. It is a
great way of doing the

of the new architecture that is being put in place; our work on
indicators for the quality and outcomes framework and for the new
commissioning outcomes framework; and our contribution to the
commissioning guides—will all be laid out along those disease
and condition care pathways. General practitioners, both as health
professionals and in their commissioning role, can get very easy access
to and can reach straightaway for the things that they need to inform
the decisions that they
take.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000218">&#160;</a>

good. We have worked very closely with it to make sure that there is a
clear understanding about the distinction between its registration
standards and the more stretching NICE quality standards that are
coming out. We can work with the CQC in circumstances where there is a
particular need to look at the performance of individual institutions
or of the NHS generally, in relation to individual aspects of the
service that is being provided, by giving it the opportunity to reach
for the standard, the evidence or the guidance that it needs to
reference its judgments on. There is a good relationship

for Sir Andrew. Given the complexity of introducing value-based
pricing, and the extent to which it is very much understood to be a
very difficult issue, are you confident that you will be able to get
that resolved and agreed with the industry in time for your divesting
your responsibility to provide cost-effectiveness advice to the
NHS?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000227">&#160;</a>

lead-in time. The existing pharmaceutical price regulation scheme does
not run out until the end of 2013, and unless everybody thought that
there was a great solution that could be put in place straightaway,
which would obviously have to include the pharmaceutical industry,
there is an opportunity to work this through, test it out and put it in
place easily in enough time to convert or amend the current PPRS to
take into account value-based pricing from the beginning of
2014.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000228">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a very big change in your role, potentially
giving you much more influence over pricing at the outset—at the
beginning of the food chain, if you like—but giving you much
less influence over prescribing practices. In some respects, NICE was
set up to deal with irrationality in GP prescribing practices, but GPs
will now be holding the ring and holding the money. Are you worried
that you will see less rational prescribing when you have less
influence over their
activities?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000229">&#160;</a>

diminish the potential we have to inform the decisions of GPs and,
indeed, other prescribers. I am pretty confident that the value-based
pricing arrangements will contain the opportunity for NICE to express
the optimal use of a treatment in clinical practice. Clearly, there
will be an associated mechanism in which someone else makes a judgment
about whether the offer price is reasonable and whether it stacks up
against the additional benefits that a new treatment brings, but the
key thing for patients is that there is a national point of reference
to go to—we will continue to do this—where you can
quickly understand what the new treatment offers and where it fits in
with the other options that are available for the treatment and the
sequencing of care that patients
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000230">&#160;</a>

NICE question. David Nicholson made it clear in his evidence to the
Public Accounts Committee that, in terms of finances, in the new world

Monitor is an economic regulator and is not looking after the finances
of FTs, it is up to the board, full stop, and there is no one else who
can check? That is what I am worried about. I do not understand who
will check that stuff is okay in terms of the budgets of the
FTs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000236">&#160;</a>

long-term problem is how we get the best health and other value out of
the NHS budget. You did the guidelines and PCTs often implemented them,
but sometimes did not because, they said, they did not have enough
money. What will be the difference now with GPs being responsible? They
still have to decide whether to implement your guidelines, so in that
way it is no different—it is just up to GPs now. Is that
right?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000238">&#160;</a>

Sir Andrew, you mentioned having an effective dialogue between primary

is currently? Could it be better, and how would the Bill help to
improve it, in your
view?<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000244">&#160;</a>

Andrew Dillon:</strong>
                           </em> The easy but terribly unhelpful answer
to the first question is that it is hugely variable, but of course it
is. There are outstanding examples, sometimes across whole PCTs,
sometimes in individual clinical areas, where the dialogue is really
very good. Actually, what I think the GP consortia need to concentrate
on is creating a dialogue at individual service level. Institutional
mechanisms need to be put in place to allow GPs to do their business
with their providers, but I think that a consortium would do well to
concentrate on looking at how the clinical networks that have been put
in place for different diseases and conditions in some parts of the
country, and other networks such as the cancer networks that operate at
national level, have worked. That is where you really can create a good
dialogue, and it becomes much easier to introduce new technologies and
new methods of working. It becomes easier to do things that are
sometimes very difficult such as changing service
configuration.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000245">&#160;</a>

We know that not all treatments and medicines have NICE guidance

resources groups, for example. How do you think that that will change
with the

                           </em> I do not think that the Bill itself
will have a direct or immediate impact on the coverage of NICE guidance
across the range of diseases and conditions that for which we will be
responsible. The Bill talks about a catalogue or library of 150 quality
standards; that will certainly cover a broad swathe of both health and
social care—NICE will extend its responsibilities into social
care under the legislation. Assuming that NICE continues, and it looks
as though it will, we will continue to produce original pieces of work,
and over time there will be very little in the way of routine clinical
practice—concentrating on the NHS—that will not at some
point be covered by some form of NICE guidance. Not everything needs to
be, and we need to concentrate on those questions where there is real
uncertainty—where either the evidence is equivocal, or there is
variation in how the evidence is being interpreted. That, I think, is
where we have been most helpful, but I agree that there are areas that
we have not looked at yet. Learning disabilities would be an example,
which given our responsibilities in social care might be a useful area
for us to look at. We have not touched on that area, and it would be
very useful for us to extend our working  to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021068000247">&#160;</a>

they cover, will need to be populated by evidence-based advice of one

but critically, for anything—whether it is generated out of NICE
or any other part of the system—to have traction in the system
and have its effect it needs  to engage and enthuse both the
NHS professionals who are delivering care and individual patients and
the organisations that speak on their behalf, which are important
advocates for designing services locally.  The colleges are an
enormously important input into anyone’s

will be set for GP commissioners, based on a figure per head of
