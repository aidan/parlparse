<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I want to correct the record in respect of a point of order that I raised earlier today during our morning proceedings. You will recall, Mr. Atkinson, as you were in the Chair, that it concerned exchanges that may or may not have taken place in relation to the handling of the Bill. As a former Whip, it is not my usual practice to comment on the exchanges that take place between the usual channels, but it has been pointed out to me that I may inadvertently have suggested to the Committee that a particular document, which was tabled in the name of my absent hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), had been offered to Labour Members of the Committee two weeks ago. I have checked the record and found that that is not correct--it was in fact offered on Thursday 22 January. Quite a lot of water has passed under the bridge since that time, which might explain the momentary slip of my memory. It is right that I should offer this explanation in what I believe lawyers refer to as the utmost good faith. I hope that the Committee will continue to conduct its proceedings in that way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Boswell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief, Mr. Atkinson. It would be a brave English Member who sought to intervene in the affairs of Northern Ireland, or who sought to interpret its laws and special arrangements with any great degree of confidence. I shall do so with diffidence. An amendment relating to the clause, which also related to earlier clauses, has been debated and disposed of. I promise that I will not return to that matter.
<P>
The clause operates in accordance with the fairly familiar constitutional procedures in Northern Ireland, by inserting a new provision into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. In general terms, I can see no distinction in principle and--apart from minor points of detail--no distinction of form between that and the equivalent Great Britain legislation. I would, however, like to draw the Committee's attention to two points that worry me.
<P>
The first point--which was touched on in a wider context when we discussed areas and regions--is that Conservative Members believe that the operation of the national minimum wage will be especially difficult in Northern Ireland because of the Province's relative economic weakness. We know from studies that the average wage in Northern Ireland is 60 per cent. of that in London, and that those who are lower-paid make up a higher proportion of the total, although no doubt the Minister will immediately remind me that that is not a higher absolute number because the Province has a relatively small population.
<P>
Another special factor is the fact that the Irish Republic is next door. Clearly, a common labour market exists to a marked degree between the Province and the Republic. Complete freedom of movement exists between them, and some of the controls that normally apply between nation states are absent. Therefore, it is relatively easy for people to go and work elsewhere, but also--this is important in relation to investment--to take their business elsewhere. It is well known that, despite the undoubted success of the Northern Ireland Development Office in a number of respects, the Irish Republic has recently succeeded in attracting a high level of investment and, indeed--
<P>
<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but we are talking about unfair dismissal in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, Mr. Atkinson. My concern was simply that the delicate balance of comparative advantage and attractiveness for investment between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could be accidentally--not intentionally--disturbed by these provisions. I hope that the Ministers will consider that carefully.
<P>
I am much more concerned about another matter, which I shall touch on now. It may be an appropriate matter for consideration by the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. It relates to the community situation in Northern Ireland. I think that the Government understand, particularly at this time, that there is a need to tread sensitively and softly in such delicate matters. Those who have inserted clause 24 in the Bill--not that it is exceptional in formal terms, although it is in its effects and the signals that it sends--have shown a lack of the necessary sensitivity. Even if one is prepared to look at Great Britain as a whole, there are certain factors in Northern Ireland, particularly the community factors, which make the position there especially delicate.
<P>
Claims of discrimination in employment--there is of course legislation on other matters in connection with inter-communal distinctions in Northern Ireland--and, with the new weapon afforded by the Bill, claims of unfair dismissal in relation to the national minimum wage, are, on the track record of previous such legislation, among the most controversial and bitterly felt issues in that troubled part of our country. In recent months we have again seen how employment rights can be the flashpoint for the perception by one community or the other that it is being unfairly disadvantaged. If there is any area in the United Kingdom where cases alleging employment discrimination and unfair treatment may be advanced mischievously, for reasons which are perhaps not in good faith and have no objective connection with actual employment practice, it is likely to be in the Province.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's remarks with interest. Does he agree that this clause, which applies to Northern Ireland, is possibly even more important than the previous clauses that applied to England, given the relatively low-wage conditions in Northern Ireland and the concentration of lower-paying industries?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Like textiles?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Yes, like textiles. The impact of the minimum wage legislation overall is likely to be greater in Northern Ireland and the possibility of consequential redundancies commensurately greater, and thus the provisions of the clause are likely to have a far more serious effect for employers in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Daventry answers that pont, I remind hon. Members that interventions should be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Although the intervention was rather long, it developed in greater depth a point that I had touched on.
<P>
We understand the intention of the clause. We understand the Government's wish to produce a universal minimum wage across the United Kingdom. The Bill does not apply--those who have acute memories or have made an even more acute reading of the Bill than I may disabuse me of this--to the channel islands, for example, or offshore islands, but I shall leave that matter aside. It certainly applies in Northern Ireland, or is proposed to apply. Therefore, in their wish to produce a universal solution, the Government are stumbling into enacting for Northern Ireland the same flawed, unbalanced and damaging provisions as those relating to the rest of the United Kingdom, thereby opening the way to the possibility of claims that do not need to be based in fact, or to claims that can be asserted. They may well be rejected, but by that stage the damage will have been done. That is why the sensitivities of the situation require attention. I have flagged my concerns and suggested to Ministers a way that representatives of Northern Ireland constituencies--who sadly, are not on the Committee--may be able to express their views on the wisdom or otherwise of extending the provisions to Northern Ireland. That would avoid making a mistake that we should all regret.
<P>
<H5>12.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The clause provides the same protection against unfair dismissal in relation to national minimum wage rights for employees in Northern Ireland. It does so in the same way that clause 23 will do for employees in Great Britain, except that the legislation to be amended is the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, which applies the Employment Rights Act 1996 to Northern Ireland. That legislation was introduced by a Conservative Administration.
<P>
The national minimum wage will apply across the United Kingdom. All workers will have the same protection wherever they work in the United Kingdom. We discussed that matter extensively in relation to clause 23, and the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Daventry were dealt with then. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I will not; I am sitting down now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I take the Under-Secretary's point that our debate on clause 23 is relevant in this context, so I shall restrict my remarks to matters relating to Northern Ireland. Special factors relate to the Northern Ireland economy, whch means that we should be especially sensitive about the possible effects of UK-wide legislation--[Interruption.] There is a separate Employment Rights Act for Northern Ireland. Those who are chuntering from a sedentary position should accept that the clause raises particular sensitivities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend ask the Under-Secretary whether there were extensive consultations in Northern Ireland, and what was the result of those consultations? I hope that my hon. Friend has better luck rasing that matter than I did--the hon. Lady did not allow me to intervene ealier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I assume that the Low Pay Commission is visiting Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am glad to be sedentarily reassured of that. Five issues affect Northern Ireland specifically. First the Government's proposals will establish a national rate that will impact most severely on Northern Ireland, which has the lowest rates of pay in this country. The Government say that that is a good thing and we say that that ia a bad thing, but there is no need to rehearse those arguments again. The Low Pay Commission--which, as the Under-Secretary has just confirmed, is visiting Northern Ireland--might say that the situation there is unique. The relative gross domestic product per head and the wage levels--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing unfair dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Unfair dismissal, as applied across the board, will affect the unique employment situation in Northern Ireland. It may well be inappropriate to impose the terms and conditions that apply in the rest of the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland. That is why the clause is potentially dangerous. As I said, the minimum wage will have the severest impact, for good or ill--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot permit the hon. Gentleman to continue with that line of argument. We are discussing a very restricted clause, many aspects of which were debated previously. The clause is about the right of employees not to be unfairly dismissed in Northern Ireland, so I should appreciate it if the hon. Gentleman would stick to that subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall move on to my second point, Mr. Atkinson, which is about the particular sensitivities associated with unfair dismissal claims in Northern Ireland. Misunderstandings and community problems in the employment market have contributed to the general troubles in Northern Ireland over the past quarter of a century. To apply UK-wide legislation may cause problems because claims for unfair dismissal may well be used in Northern Ireland in ways that they will not be used elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is my hon. Friend suggesting that although it may not be the Government's intention, the clause may cause an inflammation of management-labour relations in the Province, which could be exploited with ghastly consequences by hostile forces?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I profoundly hope not, but the Government should be very wary about taking any risks. Have they considered whether applying the same employment conditions is the right way forward? I am aware of the Under-Secretary's sensitivities and I share them. If the Government want to introduce separate employment legislation for Northern Ireland, perhaps they should do so in a separate Bill. All hon. Members recognise Northern Ireland's special sensitivities. I am seeking to illustrate them in as responsible and low key a way as possible. I hope that the Under-Secretary recognises the seriousness of this matter. The Government's approach does not accord with the way that previous Governments have approached the Northern Ireland labour market.
<P>
Other problems are involved, including the possibility of cross-border capital movements and, one hopes, increased cross-border labour movement. We all profoundly hope that the border will become a normal land border in the European Union across which workers and employers will be able to move, and that Northern Ireland's economy will become more normal. When it does, terms and conditions, including potential dismissal terms, will be relevant. The possibility of Northern Ireland having an ordinary land border and being part of the United Kingdom means that its terms and conditions of employment must encourage inward investment. My fear is that the clause could potentially discourage inward investment. We all hope that the inward investment that occurred in Northern Ireland over the past two years will continue. The Government should reconsider the clause.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The amendment changes the way in which the proceedings are to be heard in employment tribunals. The present proposal is that they will be heard mainly under what is known as a sit-alone procedure in employment tribunals--the chairman sitting alone. The notes on clauses make it clear that the Government intend the sit-alone procedure to be used in cases where the determination of an employment tribunal rests on an assessment not of the facts but of the law. The three cases that the clause intends should be referred to employment tribunals are, as the notes on clauses, as ever helpfully, tell us:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``failure of the employer to allow access to records; appeals against an enforcement notice by an employer; and appeals against a penalty notice by an employer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is asserted, rather than explained, that these cases
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are likely to be relatively straight forward and turn on legal rather than factual issues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>1 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to make three points. First, I contest the view that the cases will substantially turn on legal rather than factual issues. Ministers, who helpfully provided the notes on clauses, say that the cases will be analogous to the unlawful deduction from wages by employers, whereas the contesting of enforcement notices relating to the national minimum wage will turn not on whether cash has been paid to an employee or a worker but on whether the national minimum wage rate has been paid. Here I do not need to elaborate, as the Committee is familiar with these arguments, but it rests on wider considerations than simply whether the pay that was contracted for has been provided. It turns on the valuation of benefits in kind, on the hours worked and on the relationship between hours worked and the amount paid, whether it be in cash, kind or other forms of benefit and remuneration. We labour slightly, as you know, Mr. Atkinson, under the difficulty of not being able to be entirely clear about what remuneration means in this context.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Member, but perhaps he will quickly explain the relevance of his point to the amendment, which relates to when the chairman should sit alone and when there should be a panel of three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am glad to, Mr. Atkinson, because the notes on clauses helpfully do that for me. Referring to the sit-alone provision, they say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It was designed for cases brought under jurisdictions in which the input of lay members was considered less essential.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is those which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``turn on legal issues rather than on disputes about the facts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment turns on whether these should indeed be sit-alone cases determined by the chairman alone or cases heard by a panel of three, by extension involving lay members.
<P>
The amendment turns, therefore, on whether the Government are right in the assertion that underlies the Bill that the issues presented before employment tribunals will be legal issues rather than factual issues on which lay members can bring their experience to bear. My argument, in a nutshell, is that lay members would bring a great deal of experience to bear, because in many cases the issues will not be legal ones but will rest on an understanding and interpretation of such matters as normal contractual relationships between employees and employers, the definition of hours worked for these purposes, the relationship between hours worked and pay and, indeed the value of benefits and other remuneration to be brought into account in the national minimum wage. These are not simply legal issues; they are factual issues on which lay members will have a great deal to say.
<P>
You have helpfully encouraged me to summarise the point, Mr. Atkinson. I have done so and I shall leave it there. If my hon. Friends want to pick it up, I shall encourage them to do so. I move on to two other points.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister is eager, as ever. I said that I had three points on the amendment, and my hon. Friends may have others or may wish to add to mine.
<P>
Secondly, we are dealing with industrial tribunals that are already burdened with many claims with which they are unable to deal without undue delay. The amendment highlights an issue that Ministers have not addressed: the extent of the potentially considerable additional volume of tribunal business.
<P>
The Minister looks quizzical. He said that he regarded enforcement notices as less than a yellow card, by which I understood that enforcement notices would be liberally distributed to industry. I suspect that there will therefore be a considerable number of appeals. We know that there are already delays in the industrial tribunal system. What additional pressures will be brought to bear?
<P>
That brings me to my third point. As I understand it--I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong--some of those delays occur under sit-alone provisions. What is the current extent of the delays, especially for those tribunals in which the chairman sits alone to hear claims? What is the availability to the industrial tribunal system of chairmen who are equipped to undertake and to respond to claims?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I draw my hon. Friend's attention to another unintended effect of the sit-alone provision. It further advances the trend towards a professional class being involved in such matters and moves away from the traditional structure of involving lay people in assessing questions of a judicial nature. That trend should be deprecated. We should resist any further moves to professionalise industrial tribunals or any similar quasi-judicial forum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. You would think ill of me, Mr. Atkinson, if I were to elaborate on an argument that has already been presented in the debate on a preceding clause. However, we are introducing another set of relationships between business and bureaucracy.
<P>
Businesses that are affected by the implementation of the legislation must be assured that the rules will not be enforced by an officialdom operating according to its own lights and responding to its own criteria within a rather closed loop that is not susceptible to the experience of a lay person. Within the system there should be a levelling of lay experience to sit alongside the professional or legally trained chairman.
<P>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would agree that although we want to diversify the pattern of those who hear claims in industrial tribunals, we do not want to move from a professional to an unprofessional approach. Clearly, tribunals will not be competent and efficient if they cannot deal in a proper legal manner with the arguments that are presented to them. However, it is important that they do so in a way that commands the confidence of business, especially with a procedure of the scale and complexity of this one. Its scale is perhaps the most initimidating aspect.
<P>
My arguments turn on three issues. The first is the scale of what is happening and the extent to which the tribunal system can cope, especially when the chairman sits alone. Secondly, there is the extent to which lay experience is necessary to inspire confidence in the system; and, thirdly, there is extent to which it is necessary, in view of the nature of the claims brought before an industrial tribunal, that tribunal members should be able to assess claims on the basis of facts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendments' purpose is to throw back to those who use a tribunal--accused or accuser--the decision on whether there is a need for lay people to be involved? Otherwise, that decision would be left to the chairman's discretion. Surely anything that increases choice for the parties invovled in proceedings must be applauded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is right. At present, a chairman sitting alone who felt that the case was one of fact rather than legal interpretation could exercise the discretion to sit in a panel of three. However, human nature being what it is, chairmen may tend to feel as able as anyone--lay or not--to determine the facts and to consider that the legal issues are more important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is it not also true that a chairman making a lone decision may be unfortunately constrained by resources and under pressure to agree to sit alone? Where matters of fact are to be considered, it would be in the interests of justice that lay members be included in the panel's composition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is absolutely right. The considerable delays in the system may also cause the chairman, or the system, to err one way or the other. The notes on clauses are not entirely clear on how able industrial tribunals are to respond to the Bill. It is not clear whether they may feel constrained to sit with professional chairmen alone or may feel that that would mean undue additional delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that a business man told me today of his fear of the possibility of arbitrary and capricious decisions if a chairman sits alone? That man would be more reassured by three people deliberating on a matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon Friend is fortunate to have been able to glean more information from the front line given the lengthy hours that we have spent in Committee. I wish that I had been able to spend more time in my constituency gathering such experiences. My hon. Friend is right. In the criminal justice system, there is an innate sense of confidence in a panel of 12 jurors. In the same way, additional confidence can be gleaned from having a panel of three, just as there is when magistrates sit. Arbitrariness and individual perception are less likely to colour the result unduly.
<P>
Confidence will often be vested in a chairman sitting alone when legal issues arise, because those issues can be readily tested by an appeal and an objective evaluation by others of whether decisions were accurate and reasonable given all the precedents. However, where facts are at issue, it is much more difficult to say whether one person is being arbitrary and much more difficult to mount an appeal on those grounds. It is therefore altogether better and more confidence-inspiring--not in all cases but when, as the amendment makes clear, the parties to the proceedings desire it--to be able to move to a panel of three instead of a chairman sitting alone.--[Interruption.] I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry had a point to raise but if he does not I am happy to conclude my remarks.
<P>
<H5>1.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall confine my remarks to the amendments, which lead me again to point out that the Bill's enforcement practices and mechanisms are very much founded on existing legislation. The provisions for the chairman of the industrial tribunal to hear cases alone--without the two lay members--reflect those provided in the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996. For the avoidance of doubt, I shall point out--not for the first time in our proceedings--that those provisions were introduced under the previous Conservative Administration.
<P>
One of the main reasons, perhaps, for the introduction of those provisions was the streamlining of the tribunal system. A green document dealing with employment rights disputes was issued by the then Department of Employment in December 1994 and was, again, published under a Conservative Government. That document considered the streamlining of the tribunal system and the possibility of the chairman sitting alone. Opposition Members, and especially the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, must recognise that far from the provisions placing an additional burden on tribunals, they reflect and fit in with existing practice and procedure.
<P>
The motivation for enabling certain cases to be heard by the chairman alone is clear--to provide a simpler, quicker and cheaper route to justice in cases in which the industrial expertise of the lay members may be less relevant. There are many cases in which such expertise is extremely relevant, and I am sure that all hon. Members would pay tribute to lay members of industrial tribunals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Clearly, the extra responsibility of hearing minimum wage cases would lead to tribunals having a greater total number of cases to hear. How long do people currently have to wait for industrial tribunals?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It depends on the kind of case. All kinds of cases come before industrial tribunals. If the hon. Gentleman is interested in this question--I assume that he is--I will ensure that a note showing the different categories of cases is distributed to all members of the Committee. I understand that the hon. Gentleman has a great interest in the matter.
<P>
As I said before, I believe that the chairman sitting alone is the correct option for the cases dealt with in clause 25 concerning access to records, appeals against enforcement, or penalty notice. There would, however, be a safety net. The chairman always has the option to convene, at his descretion, a tribunal of three. That would continue to apply to the national minimum wage cases in this category. Section 5(4)(c) of the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996 makes it clear that the chairman must have regard to the views of the parties before he decides whether to sit alone or to convene a tribunal of three members. That is right and sensible. The decision, however, would remain with the chairman. The amendments would remove the chairman's discretion for no apparent reason.
<P>
I was dismayed to hear a suggestion that a chairman can act in an arbitrary way in such matters. It is unfortunate that members of the Committee should suggest such a thing. I am sure that the hon. Member for Daventry would not suggest it and that he would wish to dissociate himself from the suggestion. Our industrial tribunal chairmen do a good job and are there to interpret the law according to the duties placed on them.
<P>
The amendments show a lack of confidence in the chairmen's ability to do the job. I have every confidence in the expertise of the chairmen of these tribunals. The amendments are not well founded. As I have explained, the safety net is there. If I have not succeeded in convincing Opposition Members, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Committee is becoming increasingly, and perhaps disturbingly, familiar with the Minister's tendency to refer to the practices of the outgoing Administration and praise them to the height.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> They could do no wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not sure who was said to do no wrong. We know that, in matters of public expenditure for example, the Government have merely replicated our proposals. I do not wish to turn to that. However, it occurred to me, as the Minister spoke, that I thought that the Labour party had been elected on the slogan ``Things can only get better'' yet now we hear--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are talking about industrial tribunals and whether they should have a sit-alone chairman or a panel of three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, Mr. Atkinson. I was merely responding in the spirit of debate to the Minister's speech. I hasten on, because it is only appropriate at this point, to say that I do associate myself with my hon. Friend's amendment. Indeed, detailed perusal of the text will show only that his is a touch more elegant than mine. I am clearly a better crawler than a drafter, as was clear from earlier in our proceedings. He has also been clever enough to get it selected, so he got in first.
<P>
Having criticised the Minister, I want to praise her in one respect. She, inadvertently perhaps, succeeded in praising me when she thanked all those who participated in tribunal activities. While she will know that the House of Commons Disqualification Act prevents one from doing it, I had two interesting years' service on the agricultural land tribunal. I learnt a great deal from that and felt that it was a very positive experience. I bring that experience to bear on the clause, first in respect of resources, because it is fair to say that the panels on which I sat broke new ground in two respects. One was that we were the first ALT panel that had to ring up the Lord Chancellor's Department and obtain instructions on how to subpoena a witness. The reason for that--an example of a sensitive situation involving a small number of people--was that the two parties wished to call an expert witness who was reluctant to appear unless forced to do so.
<P>
On another occasion the two panel members, excluding the legal chairman, went to inspect a piece of drainage, because we were the experts. We wrote a report for the chairman, which was eventually taken into account in our judgment. These are not extended ``Plain Tales'', Mr. Atkinson, because I make the points in relation to the resources required for a tribunal.
<P>
My final point might help the Minister's case, at least on the surface. I was sitting on a very extended panel which involved leading counsel and extensive cross-examination when, lo and behold, just as litigants feared the judge might die or meet some mishap, I met the even greater mishap of being appointed by the then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as his special adviser.
<P>
That immediately made it very difficult for me to continue to serve. I make the point because, had I not been there and had there simply been a legal chairman, I would not have been a problem. We overcame that by getting the agreement of all parties that, despite my apparent taint with the new appointment, I could conclude and proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Three cheers for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful for my hon. Friend's encouragement.
<P>
I come to the point. Simply drawing on experience, during all the time I was empanelled--as a farmer rather than a landowner--I never sought to act on one side or the other. I was part of a team reaching an overall appraisal of the situation.
<P>
Being seen to operate as a team is an important part of the acceptability of tribunals. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham said, I think, that there was a fear--stressing ``fear''--of arbitrary judgment; I am sure that he did not mean to suggest that chairpersons were anything other than objective. In my experience, panels of three work well. They need not contribute to delay and, in cases such as the one that I cited, may even reduce delay. There may be problems over resources, although members of my set of tribunals did not get paid at all, unlke those of the employment tribunals. Panels of three did not add to the costs and they reinforced the legal chairman.
<P>
Whether lay persons help to determine the facts is a matter not just of fact but of perception, a point that underlay the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham and for South Cambridgeshire. The point is not just what conclusion the chairman reaches as an independent and objective lawyer, but whether the process is seen as acceptable by the parties. Only the parties can trigger a three-person tribunal.
<P>
There are questions of perception and of practical application to particular cases. It may be that one party has a personal reason for preferring judgment by a panel. Perhaps, unlike all of us who praise lawyers to the skies, one party--employer or worker--has taken against the legal profession as a result of some unfortunate experience. In any dispute to be resolved by a tribunal, one party is bound to lose, so there will always be one disappointed litigant.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> The proposition that in every case one side will lose leads to the conclusion that half the lawyers are always wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have a feeling that Mr. Atkinson would not wish me to be tempted to respond. I shall have high-level consultations on that point outside the Committee with my hon. Friend.
<P>
In conclusion, an adverse judgment will be a one-off disappointment for the individual concerned. It may be more readily acceptable if it is the conclusion of more than one person. An individual sitting alone can be blamed by anyone who feels aggrieved, so it is more acceptable to have three people involved.
<P>
The Minister of State has consistently said, and I accept his good intentions, that he does not want the Bill to be discredited by lack of public confidence. Our amendments would assist that.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I apologise for surprising you, Mr. Atkinson. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire and I drew up the amendements together, and when they left our pens we agreed that my hon. Friend would speak to the amendments. However, he has generously allowed me to do so.
<P>
The amendment and those grouped with it are an attempt, as elegantly and as economically as possible, to reverse completely the sense of the clause, which itself attempts to reverse completely the normal operation of the burden of proof in English law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am a new Member, but am I right in thinking that it is not in order to read a newspaper in Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee's rules are quite clear about the fact that the reading of newspapers should not take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> If it was not an offending newspaper.
<P><b>
Mr. Green:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that sedentary intervention.
<P>
The amendment would restore the normal burden of proof in civil cases, which, for reasons that are largely obscure, the clause attempts to reverse. Under its provisions an employer will be guilty until proved innocent of an offence. It is one of the Bill's more extraordinary clauses because it seems to have been drafted in a rush of enthusiasm. By the time that Ministers and officials had reached that stage in the Bill, they must have been searching for ways to plug non-existent loopholes and their enthusiasm took them too far. Amendment No. 187 would restore in that particular law what is the norm in other parts of English law.
<P>
Until I had read the ever-helpful notes on clauses, I thought that the reasons behind the attempt to reverse the burden of proof were obscure. I now know that they are not obscure, but daft. The notes on clauses state that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reversal of the burden of proof is considered to be''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whitehall speak for ``Ministers reckon''--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a vital part of the minimum wage enforcement mechanism. It should ensure that those remunerated at a rate below the national minimum wage can more easily succeed in claims''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That explanation is fair and above board, and is one of the most helpful aspects of the notes on clauses.
<P>
The Government are trying to rig the game; they do not want normal procedures to apply in a court or tribunal, where both sides have an equal chance of succedding on the merits of their case. They want one side to win more easily than the other. I assume that the Minister will refer to that aspect because it is an extremely clear statement of the Government's intention. It is a bad objective, which is why we want to reverse it by inserting into the clause the word ``not''.
<P>
The reversal of the burden of proof is based on the misapprehension that when those from the employers' side arrive at the tribunal, they must be guilty. The notes state that the Bill is an attempt to help those who are remunerated below the rate of the national minimum wage. The position cannot be known at the outset; what can be known is that an allegation had been made that that was how the employers had acted. Given that they are defendants in such cases, for the Government to make it more easy for them to be prosecuted cannot accord with a sensible approach to industrial relations.
<P>
There are also subsidiary reasons why the reversal of the burden of proof is a bad provision, which the amendment would improve. Clause 26(1) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any civil proceedings any question arises as to whether an individual qualifies''.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr Lansley:</B> It is always helpful in such circumstances to be specific. For example, the words ``any civil proceedings'' could mean proceedings under child support legislation to secure maintenance from an absent parent. In those circumstances, is an absent parent to be assumed to be earning the national minimum wage even if he or she was not earning that sum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I can tell that my hon. Friend's postbag and surgery cases are similar to mine, in which the Child Support Agency looms large. Unless the Minister can assure me otherwise, that is what the clause will achieve by it referring to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any civil proceedings any question arises as to whether an individual qualifies . . . for the national minimum wage''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that all memebrs of the Committee have had cases when the earnings of an absent parent are held to be the key issue. If that parent must be assumed under law to be earning the national minimum wage, but is not, not only will the tribunal proceedings be warped, there will be wider ramifications. I hope that the flurry of activity on the Government Benches means that that had not occurred to them and that they are about to reverse their policy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise again for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but the clause is about civil proceedings relating to employment. We should confine the debate to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, particularly because that is not my understanding of the clause, which refers to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where in any civil proceedings any question arises''. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that the implication is that that refers only to employment proceedings. But I also require reassurance that the drafting would stand up in front of a judge when someone tested it in court.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Surely my hon. Friend would agree that in issuing civil proceedings in that context, an employee would be able readily to demonstrate his or her eligibility for the national minimum wage; if he or she were eligible, no question about qualification should arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree--that seems to be its effect. I would be happy for Ministers to explain why what is written in the Bill is not what is meant--some qualification is implicit but not stated. If that qualification is intended, it would improve the Bill, but what legal force would it have?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Ministers may wish to argue that it is positively damaging to include it because, as we have heard in regard to good faith and other matters, there will be some test of relevance that has not been written into the Bill--it would be embarrassing if it had. Perhaps that is what the Government want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That may be so. My reading of the notes on clauses also does not suggest anything like that, so it is a genuine mystery and I am grateful, Mr. Atkinson, for your having brought it to the fore. It will give the Minister a good chance to clear up what appears, on the face of it, to be strange drafting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise in advance to my hon. Friend if I am being incredibly dull, but I am struggling to understand this myself. Is not the essence of my hon. Friend's point that, as drafted, the Bill would reverse the burden of proof in any civil proceedings on the payment of the national minimum wage, whether or not the case was classed as a proceeding under the legislation? For example, if it were a proceeding in relation to Child Support Agency matters and the issue was whether someone had been paid at the national minimum wage rate, the provision as drafted would reverse the burden of proof.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is not being in the least dull and I am relieved to hear that I am not being in the least unclear. That is precisely my reading of the clause and I suggest that it would be the reading of any reasonable person. It does not say ``civil proceedings affecting employment'' or ``in relation to the national minimum wage''. There is no qualification: the phrase is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any civil proceedings any question arises''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is as widely drawn as it could be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Doran:</B> The hon Gentleman is getting excited about the point, as are his hon. Friends. If he reads the subsection to the end, he will see the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the contrary is established''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the qualification: if there is evidence that other income is earned below or above the minimum wage, it should be made available to the court and that overcomes the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> No. That is a different subsection, which deals specifically with the burden of proof. It does not address the point I am making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Gotcha!
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> No, we have got you on the point. We have not yet had any convincing explanation of what Ministers think the first line of subsection (1) means.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Sit down and we will tell you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I await the Minister's speech with more than usual interest. I hope that she can explain why apparently extremely clear drafting means something different from what it appears to mean.
<P>
Clause 26(2) contains the heart of the problem. Why is there no neutral burden of proof? Why is it assumed that people who claim that they are being paid below the national minimum wage need an automatic leg up in law? How will the clause improve the lot of those who are genuinely being done down by bad employers?
<P>
We must assume that the tribunal system will get things right. If employees have a good case, they will win; if they have a bad case, they will lose. By tilting the playing field the Government are ensuring that people who would perhaps lose a case under the normal burden of proof will now win it. In any other court, that would be regarded as bad justice, or injustice.
<P>
<H5>1.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like the Minister to explain that. It is not clear why not just employment law, but general law should be changed in this one instance. What is so special about this one corner of employment law that requires a reversal of the burden of proof? I am genuinely puzzled as to why the Government have chosen to go down this path.
<P>
Various other aspects of the clause are profoundly unsatisfactory, but I am determined to stick to the narrow points raised by the amendment, as I dare say that some of my hon. Friends will want to speak about other aspects. I hope that the Minister will recognise that I tabled the amendment in the spirit of genuine inquiry to establish exactly what the clause means, and that he will give a proper response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Avid readers will notice that, because I am a most modest person, the amendment that I tabled is even more modest than the one tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. It would reverse the reversal of the burden of proof unless there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any tangible evidence establishing the case of the worker in question''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment tabled my hon. Friend represents a more comprehensive reversal of the reversal of burden of proof. We shall not split hairs about the difference between the amendments, and I shall not repeat any of my hon. Friend's cogent arguments.
<P>
I pick up only one point from the notes on clauses, which I hope that the Minister will tackle. It is the surprising statement, which needs some justification, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it should make it more difficult for employers to rely on a typical working arrangements to avoid the duty to remunerate at the level of the national minimum wage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Earlier in our proceedings, I said that I would be sympathetic if the Government presented what in Revenue terms would be called an anti-avoidance provision, whereby purely artificial arrangements could be struck down. Rather than include in the clause a specific anti-avoidance provision, which would presumably be in the hands of the court, the Government are striking down the important legal principle of burden of proof. All my instincts are against that.
<P>
I come to some severely practical points that my hon. Friend did not mention. Subsection (2) provides that it will be assumed that, unless evidence is given to the contrary, a worker is paid less than the minimum wage. What happens if a temporary or casual worker--we should remember that as little as one hour counts in that--brings a complaint after his or her employer finds that the records of the employment have been lost or destroyed? Good as the Inland Revenue may be, what happens if it loses track of PAYE records that are evidential?
<P>
That is not an idle point. Most members of the Committee--perhaps Ministers at the DTI do not have the appropriate sense of urgency--are concerned about the potential impact of the millennium bug. What happens on 31 December 1999 if payroll records in businesses large and small are extensively damaged, destroyed or rendered unreliable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend refers to situations where employment records may have been lost or damaged, or where the Inland Revenue may have lost PAYE records. Could not the clause apply where there never was any employment and, therefore, there would be no employment records, such as those under clause 12, to be lost?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is possible. However, a case would presumably fall if it could be proved to the tribunal that there was no employment--but it is rather difficult to prove a negative.
<P>
The deliberate destruction of records by a disgruntled employee is an even more intense example than the inadvertent destruction of records. What would happen if someone fell out with the employer and destroyed or defaced such evidence to strengthen his subsequent case at a tribunal? Not every instance of arson or computer tampering by such disaffected workers results in clear proof--let alone a conviction--yet, perversely, subsection (2) might create a strong incentive for such disreputable actions. There will be a field day--anyone can use uncertainty, even that caused through no fault or wilful action by an employer, to bring a complaint and lever in extra, perhaps entirely undeserved, remuneration. That is not what the Government intend; I hope that it is not what they will achieve.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the reversal of the burden of proof is clear; it is revealed in the notes on clauses. Paragraph 2 of part 2 of the notes on clause 26 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reversing the burden of proof will assist in ensuring that only those genuinely falling outside the definition of worker in the bill are excluded.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that, when creating hurdles for the employer to jump, it is more likely that people will be wrongly included than wrongly excluded. I understand why, if there is to be wrongful inclusion or exclusion, the Government will prefer wrongful inclusion to wrongful exclusion. Is not it better to create a neutral burden of proof-- the outcome of which is neutral--rather than, as is admitted in the notes on clauses, an outcome that is biased against the employer?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has referred to the notes on clauses which make it clear that the objective of the provision is to make it more difficult, onerous and expensive for an employer to defeat a vexatious claim. Many employers faced with the mountain of overturning a presumption of guilt or non-compliance will simply cave in and accept the charge that is laid against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It might be as well, to avoid doubt, to say that removing the presumption in this way does not necessarily mean that there is a presumption to the contrary; it simply means that there is a presumption in neither direction and decisions are taken on the balance of the evidence. There is a danger that it might be thought that we wanted to protect employers. The amendment would simply put them on an even basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I think of three positions of a pendulum--the central position and the two extremes. I could understand the Government wanting to create a neutral burden of proof--the pendulum in the central position. However, they seem to have swung to an extreme position. That does not look like a desire to create a level playing field or a balance by which industrial relations can prosper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, because the overwhelming majority of people in the United Kingdom will henceforth be eligible for the national minimum wage, employers should have no difficulty demonstrating that fact? Therefore, is not it curious that the Government want to load the dice?
<P>
<B>Mr Hammond:</B> My hon Friend makes another valuable point. Given the right of workers under the Bill to require production of records by employers, it seems that it will almost always be easier for the worker to prove his case than for the employer to disprove it. that is yet another reason why it is inappropriate to reverse the burden of proof: one party will already have many benefits, specifically the power to require production of records.
<P>
It is unprecedented to reverse the burden of proof in relation to a civil proceeding in which one party--the accuser--will be supported by public funds. When that point was raised earlier, the Minister suggested that there were precedents in civil law for reversal of the burden of proof, but that must be considered in conjunction with the support by public funds of the person making the accusation. Not only will the person standing accused be presumed to be guilty, he will have to defend himself against a publicly assisted litigant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Not only is the field tilted in that way, but if, despite those obstructions, the employer wins, he will have no means of obtaining compensation for his time, trouble and money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right; I shall touch on that matter in a moment.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of part 2 of the notes on the clause makes what seems to be a most extraordinary statement. However, it is 2 am, and my Hon. Friends may tell me that it is not as extraordinary as it seems to me. The paragraph states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The reversal of the burden of proof does not however apply to establishing the actual amount the worker was underpaid. It will be for the worker to prove, and for the tribunal or court to determine, the amount due from the employer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to be almost contradictory. Notice will be served by the officer and the employer will be deemed to be guilty of the offence and must remedy it. The notice may specify an amount of arrears underpaid which the employer must immediately pay to the employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The tribunal, when presented with a claim in the absence of records and evidence, will decide that the worker was paid less than the national minimum wage, but will not be able to determine how much less he was paid. That is an Alice in Wonderland situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point exactly. At what rate will the employee be presumed to have been remunerated? The burdens of proof for the questions of whether he has been remunerated at the minimum rate and at what rate he has been remunerated are different. In the first case, the burden of proof lies with the accused employer while in the second, as I understand it, it lies with the accuser, the employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The potency of my hon. Friend's point must be clear to every member of the Committee. If the precise underpayment cannot be identified, it follows that it is not possible to identify what needs to be paid in compensation to redress the grievance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The issue is not whether an amount can be specified--clearly, an amount will be specified in the notice. However, if the matter is appealed, a bizarre situation would arise when the tribunal considered the notice. The notice will mention an amount, specified as the amount underpaid, yet the burden of proof will be the opposite to the burden of proof required to determine whether the notice of underpayment had been issued correctly. There is no qualitative difference between the question of whether there has been an underpayment and how much that underpayment was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sorry to intervene again; my hon. Friend has been generous in giving way. Is he saying that the enforcement notice served upon an employer would have to specify by how much that employer was paying under the national minimum wage? My understanding is that the enforcement notice would simply tell the employer to pay the national minimum wage, so the officer serving the enforcement notice may not guide the tribunal in resolving by how much under the national minimum wage the employer was presumed to have paid.
<P>
<H5>2 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I meant to say that if the notice specified an amount of arrears to be paid by the employer, it would specifically identify an amount. Not only is there no qualitative difference between the whether the minimum wage has been paid and by how much it was underpaid, but the officer would have had to establish by how much the employer had been underpaying before being able to state that there had been an underpayment and that the national minimum wage legislation had therefore been breached.
<P>
I see no logic in having two burdens of proof and suggest that the burden of proof reversal proposed in clause 26 should be eliminated. I concede, however, that the Government may argue that, in seeking consistency, they would place the burden of proof on the employer in both cases. Nevertheless, there seems to be a clear inconsistency between the two provisions.
<P>
We feel strongly about the reversal of the burden of proof because of its impact on employers. We have consistently referred in our debates to the small employer. He may not be particularly articulate or not be in a strong position to fight his corner. He will be served with a notice and required to start paying at a wage level that, on the face of it, would be higher than he had been paying. He will be in a confusing position if a genuine dispute is taking place over non-monetary components of remuneration. He will stand guilty of the offence of underpaying unless he is prepared to invest his own time and money appealing against the notice to defend his good name. As my hon. Friends have made clear, the most important consideration for small businesses will be the investment of the owner-manager's time, which could prove fatal to the business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend refers to the question of wider remuneration as covered by clause 15(1) and draws the Committee's attention to the potential for legitimate and genuine disputes about what an employee is or is not entitled to receive. Such disputes often arise over benefits in kind. Does he agree that the clause is particularly dangerous as a result of those grey areas of potential dispute? Will he animadvert on that subject?
<P>
<b>Mr. Hammond:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If there is a grey area or a genuine cause of dispute between parties, the reversal of the burden of proof, coupled with the other disadvantages that the Bill imposes on small employers, is unfair and unjust. That is my principle objection to the clause. I support the amendment because it will negate the clause.
<P>
My final plea is that although my hon. Friends have made an eloquent, practical case for the amendments, they have not referred to the moral dimension. I repeat for the umpteenth time that I am not a lawyer, but I have always believed that one of the principles of English law is that people are treated as innocent until proven guilty. I have always believed that it was worth going into the trenches to defend that principle. A compelling reason is needed to overturn a morally important principle. To do so when there could be genuinely grey areas and uncertainty--the Bill does not allow for the certainty of right and wrong-- is a morally repugnant and dangerous development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Atkinson, to be called to speak. A number of arguments have been eloquently advanced by my hon. Friends. It will therefore come as a relief and a source of satisfaction to you to hear that I do not propose to rehearse those arguments at length. The case has been made; it is improbable that Ministers will be able to break with precedent and answer it intelligibly or persuasively. They are more likely to rely on the largely silent Labour majority, most of whom have not read the Bill, let alone understood its contents.

<P>

<B>Judy Mallaber </B>(Amber Valley): I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw that remark. He said that we have not read the Bill and do not know what we are talking about. We have read the Bill and we know what is in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am happy to withdraw that allegation in respect of the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber). I know that the hon. Lady has a deep interest in and some considerable knowledge of the subject. That is also true of the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), who is sitting next to the hon. Lady and with whom she was in animated discussion until a few moments ago. The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) presumes a knowledge on the subject--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We always rely on the hon. Gentleman to wake us up in the small hours, but he must not do so in a way that is out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Far be it from me to be out of order, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Does my hon. Friend share my view that if Labour Members wish to demonstrate that they have read the Bill, they should contribute to the debate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We need to return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend's comment is relevant in one rather important respect, Mr. Atkinson, because the subject that we are discussing is burden of proof and the reversal thereof. It does not seem unreasonable that my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford should suggest that what I have just said imposes a burden of proof on Labour Members. It is for Labour Members to demonstrate their familiarity with the contents of the Bill, so I do not think that I was particularly unreasonable. Nevertheless, your good temper is essential, Mr. Atkinson, and I have no wish to do or say anything that might risk its replacement by ill temper. I happily concede that the hon. Member for Amber Valley knows a great deal about the Bill so I hope that she will not feel offended.
<P>
I was moved to contribute, relatively briefly--and I would be even briefer if there had not been stupid sedentary chunterings from Government Back Benchers and the Government Whip--by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. He made a powerful speech against the clause, as did my hon. Friends the Members for Ashford and for South Cambridgeshire. The last point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was especially powerful. He released himself from the minutiae of debate about practicalities and advanced an impressive moral thesis. The striking feature of the debate has been the way in which the Government, in defending their position on this clause and several immediately preceding, have put what can only be described as a Benthamite case. Their argument has been entirely utilitarian.
<P>
The Under-Secretary, in particular, has spoken in terms of what would be effected by ensuring that the national minimum wage is established and the objectives of the legislation achieved. That is not really the point at issue. My hon. Friend's point was that regardless of whether it would be more effective in utilitarian terms, it is morally offensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if we accept the argument of efficacy, reversing the burden of proof would make the enforcement of any legislation easier? Why not reverse the burden of proof across the whole English legal system? Why not create a situation where, when the police arrest someone, they throw him into jail and the poor blighter has to prove that he is innocent before he can get out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes the case powerfully. Far be it for me to suggest that it would be the general wish of Ministers to achieve such a state of affairs. One might have said that more cogently, and with supporting evidence, in the early 1970s when the Labour party was radically different. I do not suggest that that is their motive now, although I will have a little more to say on that point in a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Did not our debate a moment or two ago demonstrate the point that my hon. Friend makes so eloquently? When he said, in an uncharacteristically loose remark, that Labour Members, save Ministers, had not read the Bill, he implied guilt or delinquency without evidence. Evidence was immediately produced in regard to two hon. Members and they were able to satisfy my hon. Friend on the point. One could apply the principle more generally, although my hon. Friend received opprobrium for even making such an assertion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is right to suggest that I received opprobrium for making the suggestion and the hon. Member for Amber Valley quickly brought me to book on the matter. My hon. Friend will also have noticed--as will you, Mr. Atkinson--that when the burden of proof was rhetorically satisfied by the hon. Lady's intervention, but more particularly by her earlier contributions--on which basis I accepted her view--I was prepared to give way readily. I immediately acknowledged that I had been unfair and, perhaps, even mildly discourteous to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that, as always, I am enjoying his contribution; unfortunately, however, he continually veers out of order. We are talking about the reverse of the burden of proof in the clause--more mundane matters, but perhaps we could stick to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Of course I shall stick to the mundane--as you describe it, Mr. Atkinson--matters of the clause.
<P>
The moral argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was cogent. I am not persuaded that it need be the case that the minimum wage can be more effectively implemented, and compliance with the legislation ensured, by retaining the clause. Under the Bill, the overwhelming majority of people in the United Kingdom will be entitled to receive the full minimum wage, so there is no reason to impose a different burden of proof, under this and other clauses, than ordinarily applies in civil law.
<P>
<H5>2.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
When we have raised that point--it is of the most profound importance--Ministers have told us that it is characteristic of other pieces of employment legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend, like our hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, makes the distinction between the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence, but the burden of proof in civil cases is not so much a presumption of innocence as a balance of the evidence. I hope that that is what my hon. Friend is driving at.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I want there to be a presumption of nothing until the evidence proves the argument one way or the other. The employer must demonstrate and justify his position and the employee must do likewise. The matter must be resolved, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire says, on the balance of the evidence.
<P>
The Government are not proposing that these matters be determined on the balance of the evidence, however. As some of my hon. Friends have said, the Government's intention--it has not been denied-- is to ensure that, as far as possible, there is no debate in law on this point. That is what the wording specifically states. For example, subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall be presumed for the purposes of the complaint, so far as relating to the deduction of that amount, that the worker in question was remunerated at a rate less than the national minimum wage unless the contrary is established.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear why it is necessary so to word the clause.
<P>
It is not good enough for the Under-Secretary to refer to previous legislation. As we have said, those of us who sit on the Opposition Back Benches are parliamentary virgins--that also applies to most Back-Bench Labour members of the Committee. We were not party to those earlier pieces of legislation and cannot be held answerable for them.
<P>
My point is important even within the narrow confines of the clause. The Under-Secretary of State--a Minister of the Crown and a highly remunerated figure, who is respected the length and breadth of the United Kingdom--is trying at 2.18 am to persuade us to change our vote by citing precedent. The Minister of State has not steered clear of that, either. Both of them have, during the debate, tried to impress on us the importance of precedent.
<P>
Earlier, the Under-Secretary teased me by referring to the former Member of Parliament for Enfield, Southgate--the former Secretary of State for Employment, Mr. Michael Portillo. She also referred to legislation that had been taken through the House of Commons by my right honourable and noble Friend Lord Tebbit of Chingford. He is an estimable individual and one of my great heroes, as is my friend Mr. Michael Portillo. However, I was not present when those pieces of legislation were debated.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. What has that got to do with the burden of proof?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It has a great deal to do with the burden of proof, Mr. Atkinson. My lack of clarity at 2.19 am, despite my total sobriety, is obviously disturbing. I accept that it is my responsibility to improve on that.
<P>
What I am saying is relevant to the burden of proof, as the Under-Secretary tried to justify the clause with the argument that she thought would be most appealing to me--that similar wording in previous legislation was commended to the House of Commons or to one or other of its Standing Committees by either Mr. Michael Portillo or my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Tebbit of Chingford.
<P>
As a parliamentary virgin, I have two objections to that argument. First, I have no proof of the point that the hon. Lady makes, as I have not studied the proceedings to which she was alluding. Secondly, even if what the Minister claims is the case, it does not justify the expectation that Conservative Members should sign up to the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to follow the line of the hon. Gentleman's argument. He referred to the Minister. We are discussing clause 26, which relates to the reversal of the burden of proof. As far as I am aware, the Minister has not yet opened his mouth. Far be it from me to protect the Minister, but the hon. Gentleman should not blame him for something that he has not yet said.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Of course, in the context it is necessary to distinguish between one Minister and another--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Only the Minister of State is dealing with the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I had presumed, Mr. Atkinson, that there was collective ministerial responsibility, and therefore--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I tried to make it clear that we are talking about clause 26. The Minister has not yet opened his mouth during our consideration of clause 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am happy to concede that point, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sorry to interrupt what might be described as--to paraphrase an advertisement from about 10 years ago--a Bercow moment. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham is referring to the structure of the clause and how it relates to the Bill. Ministers have mentioned 1996 legislation, which was introduced by the previous Conservative Government. What I find striking about the clause is that it does not reproduce the reversal of the burden of proof that can be found in other employment law provisions. It seems to go further than other analogous rights exercised under employment legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. We should also bear in mind the fact that we are dealing with the introduction of a wholly new policy, which will be applicable across the country. That throws the Government's arguments into sharp relief.
<P>
We are talking about the burden of proof in claims of underpayment in respect of the new national minimum wage. The reference to precedent is supremely inapposite in that context. There is no proper precedent for the particular circumstances with which we are dealing.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire anticipated my next point, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has already alluded, but which bears repetition.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It does not bear repetition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Of course, Mr. Atkinson, I withdraw the word ``repetition''. I entertain no intention of engaging in an activity that would fall foul of the Chair.
<P>
There seems to be an inconsistency in the clause, which is of most serious concern to Conservative Members. It arises from the insistence that, for the most part, no proof is required by the employee. That is a reversal of the burden of proof--the employee is not required to prove his eligibility for the national minimum wage at a given time, or that there was a reduction of earnings. We think it an unfortunate state of affairs, but it is clearly specified in the clause.
<P>
We understand from the notes on clauses, however, that that reversal of the burden of proof does not apply to the establishment of the amount of underpayment that the worker suffered. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, that is extraordinary. It is not clear to us what the Government intend by that contradiction between one part of the clause and another. It throws the whole clause into total confusion and renders it largely unintelligible; it is one of a number of the causes of our disaffection with the clause.
<P>
A few moments ago, I noticed that the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)--who has not enlightened us with any contribution to the debate on the clause--was chuntering from a sedentary position. I invite him to dig himself deeper by making a contribution on this point. He should not underestimate, as he appeared momentarily to do, the scale of our anxiety and genuine discontent.
<P>
We are very bothered that there is a different burden of proof in different parts of the clause with no explanation for the need for that differential test; that causes us concern and unhappiness. There are powerful practical reasons for believing that on normal jurisprudential grounds, the minimum wage can be quite properly implemented and enforced on the basis of the burden of proof that applies in most civil cases. There is no reason to apply a different burden of proof.
<P>
So far, no Labour Member has disproved our argument. We have been accused of conjuring up a nightmare scenario, but no Minister or Labour Back Bencher has explained the practical need to apply a different burden of proof. Reference to earlier legislation does not suffice; it does not meet the needs of the case. What we need, and what I ask for from the Minister, is a practical explanation of what suffering would arise from the provision not being made.
<P>
To be utilitarian for a moment, before I conclude on the moral point, how many people would suffer, how many people would be deprived of payments that they should receive, and how many people would fail to have deductions restored to them as a result of applying the normal burden of proof, instead of the special burden of proof proposed by the Government? If the Government could persuade us that there was an overwhelming utilitarian case, that would have an impact on, and possibly battle with, the moral argument. However, It is not at all clear that there is such an overriding utilitarian reason for the Government's proposal.
<P>
We suspect that the Government have drafted the legislation in a lazy and carefree manner: they have been anxious to rush it forward. They have looked at precedent and transposed sections of earlier Acts into the Bill without due consideration of their necessity or proper regard for our legitimate concerns. The Government know that they can drive the Bill through the Committee--not least with the able assistance of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)-- and they do not seem greatly bothered about our concerns. We have genuine and deeply felt concerns about the clause.
<P>
Morally, the Government have not a leg to stand on--they are legless. They cannot morally defend their behaviour. Our concerns are both moral and practical. Whereas the Government appear not to be able to demonstrate that employees would suffer if the clause were not applied, there is a real danger of suffering for many employers if it is passed unamended. Labour Back Benchers have not offered examples. That is the point on which I will conclude.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was going to say that the hon. Gentleman is repeating himself, but as he is concluding he may proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson; I am coming to the end.
<P>
In advancing their arguments, my hon. Friends cited circumstances in which employers could suffer. Labour Back Benchers may not have agreed with the arguments, but circumstances were cited, evidence was offered, and particular situations were described. We have had no response to them.
<P>
What guarantee can the Minister offer that employees will be damaged if we do not pass the clause unamended, and that if we do, there is no risk of injustice or damage being done to employers? It is his responsibility to provide that guarantee; there is no purpose or merit whatever in his frowning from a sedentary position. He enjoys a good salary; he is a servant of the Crown. His responsibility is not just to ensure that the clause is voted through but to defend it coherently to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>2.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I predicted some months ago--I had a bet with myself--when we were considering draft clauses in the Department that when we reached the debate on the burden of proof, Conservative Members would almost have a nervous breakdown. We have been treated to one of the Committee's most mind-numbing discussions--and some of them have been pretty mind-numbing.
<P>
Buckinghamshire's very own werewolf has been coddling up a heady brew. He described employers being destroyed by having to provide information to the tribunal--information that they should currently maintain. Unworthily for him, the hon. Member for Daventry conjured up the image of low-paid employees acting as arsonists to destroy their employers' records. He suggested that employees would break into premises, rampage around and set fire to records in order--if they were not locked up for criminal damage before the tribunal met--to secure an income to which they would not have been entitled if the fire had not taken place.
<P>
We have also heard that the millennium bug will destroy the apparatus of the state and prevent low-paid workers from receiving the minimum wage. It has been a surreal debate. We smile and laugh about it, but the Opposition are supposed seriously to be probing the Government about our proposals. Is that as good as their opposition is going to be?
<P>
Most of the contributions paid no heed to the amendments; only generalities were debated. Most Conservative members of the Committee were clock watching while they were speaking, and when they were drying up, they intervened on each other and asked questions of each other, such as what they thought of each other's speeches and whether speeches were on-line or off-line. It was ludicrous in the extreme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Is the Minister questioning the way in which the Chair has conducted the debate?
<P>
<b>The Chairman:</b> I would have stopped the Minister if I thought that he was out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr McCartney:</B> I have great sympathy for the Chairman, who has handled the debate masterfully. I am talking about the conduct of Conservative Members and how they have prosecuted with some venom their case against low-paid workers.
<P>
Once again, when it comes down to the wire, Conservative Members try to find ways and means of ensuring that employers can continue to work in the margins to prevent people from benefiting from the security of the minimum wage. They want to amend the Bill to allow bad employers to avoid their responsibilities.
<P>
I am proud that the Government took the fundamental decision to reverse the burden of proof. For far too long, low-paid workers, who have little or no representation, have found it almost impossible to do anything about their employment status or to gain access to basic minimum rights in the labour market. That has been used unremittingly against home workers, agency workers and other workers whose employment status is doubtful. We have removed doubt about their status, and removed a further burden from them by changing the balance of access to information to determine whether they are entitled to the national minimum wage.
<P>
Let me be clear. By reversing the burden of proof, we are not suggesting that the measure is a presumption of guilt. That is not the issue. We want to determine whether someone is entitled to an underpayment or to the minimum wage as a matter of principle. Where does the information come from to determine that? Who maintains records? The employer does. Who has information about remuneration and emoluments? The employer does. Who maintains records about national insurance contributions and pay-as-you-earn issues? The employer does. Who maintains the details of employees? The employer does. Who maintains the record of hours worked by the employees? The employer does.
<P>
Who has responsibility for managing and maintaining the contract of employment? The employer does. Who has information about the contract of service for workers deemed not employees but general workers? The employer does. All the tests on information and proof lie with the employer. None lie with the employee. The reversal of the burden of proof is not an attack on employers, but an attempt to ensure that there is a level playing field when it comes to making such decisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, the hon. Gentleman can sit down. He has had ample opportunity to put his case. I am putting the case not only for the Government but for millions of workers who, over the years, have not had the opportunity or ability to make their voices heard. That is why we won the election. Electors wanted this Government to make a difference to the lives of millions of people, and that is what we intend to do. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Hon. Members cannot take it. They are happy to stand by and watch low-paid workers being battered from pillar to post, not knowing where the next penny is coming from and not knowing what the consequences will be if they ask for a decent wage. When it comes to putting the case for low-paid workers, Conservative Members do not want to hear it.
<P>
The clause applies only to civil, not criminal proceedings. It reverses the burden of proof on two matters that may come before an industrial tribunal, county court or other civil court. I refer first to the status of an individual making a claim for the national minimum wage. The onus is on the employer to show that the individual concerned does not qualify for the minimum wage because, for example, he is genuinely self-employed. That is an important aspect.
<P>
How many cases have arisen of an employer claiming that a home worker is self-employed, when that employer provides the materials, the equipment, the contract and everything to do with the job other than the provision of electricity in the home that is provided by the contractor? Yet, because of the burden of proof, on almost every occasion the employer has evaded his responsibility towards the home worker. That has led this year to home workers in Leicestershire being paid 38p an hour by an employer who is a multi-millionaire. Such conduct is not acceptable and we are not prepared to allow employers to use their status and ability and their relationship with the home worker to walk away from their responsibilities.
<P>
The second matter concerns the claim of failure to pay the national minimum wage. The onus is on the employer to show that the worker in question has been paid the national minimum wage. Such an assumption is reasonable. As I said earlier, who maintains the records? The employer does. There is a requirement under the Act for the employer to maintain records. Given that the source of information to determine whether the minimum wage is paid lies with the employer, such a test should be easy for the employer to pass.
<P>
The shift in the reversal of the burden of proof assists good employers as well as employees. It will make it absolutely certain in vexatious cases that employees cannot simply claim that they have had no opportunity to claim the minimum wage, when the employer acted within the law, carried out good company practice of maintaining records and can prove almost immediately that he is paying the national minimum wage.
<P>
The clause is as important to employers as it is to employees. It is a key element of our enforcement strategy and it will help vulnerable workers, especially agency and home workers who are deterred from taking action because their employment status is unclear.
<P>
It will make it difficult for rogue employers to dodge the law, and I make no apology for that. The clause will make it easier for workers of uncertain status to benefit from the law--and, again, I make no apology for that. It will not affect criminal proceedings.

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr McCartney:</B> No, I am not giving way. I have no intention of giving way.--[Interruption.] If Conservative Members had treated the debate with the seriousness that it deserved over the past hour, I would have given them the opportunity to discuss matters with me.
<P>
However, it is clear that there will not be a proper dialogue. Conservative Members have set out their stall; they are opposed to the proposal because they believe that it will act against the interests of rogue employers and will provide opportunities for low-paid workers. They object to the clause on that simple premise.
<P>
There is a massive gulf between us and it will not be resolved by my bobbing up and down to allow Conservative Members to talk their socks off at this time in the morning. I shall not give them that opportunity to maintain the debate. I ask my hon. Friends to oppose the amendments. I do not know whether we shall have a clause stand part debate, given that our previous comments have provided a taster of that. We want the clause to remain part of the Bill; it is essential and will make the national minimum wage arrangements work.
