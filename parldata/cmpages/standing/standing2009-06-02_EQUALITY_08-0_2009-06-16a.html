Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): I am pleased
to welcome you to the Chair again, Lady Winterton. In the 20 seconds
that I had before we adjourned our earlier sitting, I said that I
thought we could get through the amendments quickly, as the main point
behind them had been debated to a significant extent in our previous
sitting.</div>
<a name="09061752000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
amendments are essentially equivalent. One amends clause 12 and would
provide that sexual orientation includes manifestations of sexual
orientation. Another, possibly slightly better drafted amendment,
starred amendment 237 in the amendment paper, amounts essentially to
the same thing, which is that sexual orientation</div>
<a name="09061752000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;includes
manifestations of any such sexual orientation.&#146;.</div>
<a name="09061752000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 220 on page
147 of the amendment paper amends clause 13 and deals with direct
discrimination.</div>
<a name="09061752000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I explained
earlier that the concern was to put the provisions clearly into statute
law with the point of probing what the case law is in that respect, not
only because it is right and proper that manifestations of sexual
orientation are&#151;to quote the judge
again&#151;&#147;intimately wrapped up&#148; with one&#146;s
sexual orientation, but because it will help to make it clear to the
public, and particularly to employers, that they cannot rely on a
distinction between sexual conduct where it relates closely to sexual
orientation and sexual orientation itself.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div><a name="09061752000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
explained that there is a request, bordering on an expectation, that
employers will be able to do so when I referred to memorandum E14,
which we received from the Catholic Bishops Conference. The memorandum
says that the Catholic Bishops Conference would want to apply a conduct
test, even for, it is implied,</div>
<a name="09061752000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a residential
caretaker post if it involves routine contact with the local Catholic
community.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061752000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went on to say
that</div>
<a name="09061752000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is a
whole range of posts, paid or voluntary, where it is essential that the
Church has the right to prefer a candidate whose life is in accordance
with its ethos; these might include, for example, youth workers,
members of marriage preparation teams, and parish secretaries. What all
these have in common is a pastoral, representative, or functional role
where their effectiveness in the post for which they are being paid
would be severely limited if their life were openly at variance with
the teachings of the
Church.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an interesting phrase. I do not know whether &#147;openly&#148;
implies that it would not be an issue if they kept their private life
to themselves, or whether the employer would seek to investigate their
private life.</div>
<a name="09061752000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061752000546"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): Does the hon. Gentleman
accept that the link between sexual orientation and manifestation
varies? For some people, there is little gap between them, but for
other people, particularly in the Catholic Church, where nuns and
priests take a vow of celibacy, there is a large and distinct
gap.</div><a name="09061752000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000547"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not want to repeat everything that I
explained previously, but where a post falls within paragraph 2(8) of
schedule 9&#151;that includes proselytising roles such as nuns and
priests, any representative function and any post predominantly
involved with liturgy or the teaching of theology&#151;an
organisation would be entitled to discriminate on grounds of sexual
orientation. That is not the question. The question is whether, even
where those requirements are not met, such organisations can seek to
say that they are discriminating not on grounds of sexual orientation,
but mainly on conduct. I think that I have clarified that there is such
an expectation in the written evidence and elsewhere.</div>
<a name="09061752000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to stress the examples given by religious organisations in
the Amicus case. In his judgment in Amicus and others <i class="I">v. </i>the
Secretary of State, given on 26 April 2004, the honourable
Mr. Justice Richards gives examples of where
religious organisations are very clear&#151;and, to their credit,
they are very clear and consistent on this point&#151;that they want
to cover conduct without falling foul of the normal sexual orientation
provisions. For example, in paragraph 33, he quotes Roger Smith, who
was then, and might still be, head of public policy at Christian Action
Research and Education,
stating:</div><a name="09061752000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
inappropriate sexual activity on the part of an employee would be
considered grounds for dismissal. This would include behaviour
amounting to adultery from a married member of staff, and any other
inappropriate sexual conduct by unmarried members of staff. This would
include an unmarried employee&#146;s sexual activity with a member of
the opposite sex or with a member of the same
sex.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that the wish is to discriminate on grounds of homosexual
activity. Similarly, in paragraph 34, Mr. Justice
Richards cites Mr. Martin Eden, director of
strategic development for the Evangelical Alliance,
saying:</div><a name="09061752000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
affirm God&#146;s love and concern for humanity, including those with
an orientation towards people of their own sex, but believe homoerotic
sexual practice to be incompatible with His will, as revealed in
scripture.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div><a name="09061752000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In paragraph
35, Hilary Reeves, director and chairman of the trustees of the
Christian Schools Trust, talks about teachers, who are clearly not
priests:</div>
<a name="09061752000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
teachers&#146; own lifestyle must be a righteous one, as defined
above. That must, by definition, exclude from being a teacher in one of
our schools a person whose lifestyle is known, or is reasonably
believed, to include unrighteous acts as listed
above.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Included
in that
is</div><a name="09061752000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sexual
intercourse with a person other than one&#146;s spouse outside
marriage, with a close member of one&#146;s family, or with a person
of the same
gender.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving
aside the comparison between lawful sexual activity with someone of the
same sex and the unlawful activity of incest, and the equivalence,
which those organisations are entitled to make, between homosexual
activity in a faithful relationship with adultery, it is clear that
they wish to include such conduct as grounds for dismissal. I am asking
in both of these amendments for that to have to be justified on the
grounds of sexual orientation.</div>
<a name="09061752000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
oral evidence from William Fittall of the Church of England, when he
was drawn on this matter, he said
that</div><a name="09061752000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is reasonable that restrictions&#151;whether they be on marital
history or whatever&#151;can be part of the
requirements.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i><i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Equality Public Bill Committee, </i>9 June 2009; c. 69,
Q127.]</div><a name="09061752000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is, requirements which are imposed on people on religious grounds, the
sort of requirements in schedule 9, paragraph 3. I asked him whether he
meant gay people, and his answer, which can be read in columns 69 and
70, was clear that, even if it did not mean homosexuality, it did
include homosexual conduct.</div>
<a name="09061752000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already read the ruling of Mr. Justice Richards
in the previous debate, so I will not repeat that, but he makes clear
in his conclusions, in paragraph 119 of his judgment, his view, which
was not contested by either side,
that</div><a name="09061752000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
protection against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation
relates as much to the manifestation of that orientation in the form of
sexual behaviour as it does to sexuality as such.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061752000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">He says that he has
already mentioned that when looking generally at the fundamental rights
issues in the case.</div>
<a name="09061752000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope,
therefore, that the Committee recognises not only that there is a call
for sexual conduct to be grounds for dismissal or a detrimental
treatment, and to be seen as separate from sexual orientation, but that
the case law is clear that that is not permitted. Furthermore, we
should argue on principle as a Committee, and the House should take the
view&#151;</div><a name="09061752000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061752000548"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b><b class="B">:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that case
law would overrule this
statute?</div><a name="09061752000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000549"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> No. That is exactly the point I am making. I am
asking that the statute make it clear what existing case law is,
because that case was taken to clarify the statute. In a sense, the
statute was clarified by that judgment. It was in the High Court, so it
has precedence, but clarification would be helpful because, despite the
judgment, there is still the assumption, or the request, that this sort
of discrimination be
permitted.</div><a name="09061752000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the case law is clear. The intention of the Government at
the time of the employment regulations on sexual orientation was clear.
Even if it was not, the judge agreed with the Government&#146;s
position in his conclusions on the case. The Government did not appeal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>on that point. The current intentions of the Government are clear on the
point, but because this is a live issue and there is public debate, it
would be wise to make that clear in statute as well. As I have said,
this is not an attack on the beliefs of Churches, which are entitled to
their beliefs. It is about protecting the right of gay people not to be
discriminated against, in employment as well as in other areas, on the
grounds of sexual orientation under the proxy of their conduct not
being protected under sexual orientation legislation. That is what
these probing amendments seek to make
clear.</div><a name="09061752000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061752000550"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): It is good to see you
in the Chair this afternoon, Lady Winterton. You missed our exciting
debate on this very subject this morning. We, however, did not, so I
will be
brief.</div><a name="09061752000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only point that I would like to make at this stage is that, as we did
this morning, we appear to have quickly moved on to schedule 9, which
we will debate in due course. I will only mention it briefly, Lady
Winterton, so as not to test your patience. It seems to me that all the
points that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has made,
most of which I do not agree with, we can debate when we get to
schedule 9; we can debate paragraphs 2 and 3 of that and the extent to
which organisations can do the various things that he is suggesting
they can. It seems that, under both this clause and the previous one,
he is trying to pre-empt that debate and to set down much wider
conditions than are necessary for this
case.</div><a name="09061752000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000551"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am interrupting the hon. Gentleman, although he
did not interrupt me. This does not apply just to schedule 9. I was
using that as the best exemplar because in the provision of services
there are restrictions on discrimination on the grounds of sexual
orientation. I would not want to see, and I hope the Government would
not want to see, people discriminating in the provision of services on
the grounds of conduct that is intimately related to sexual orientation
by claiming that it is not sexual orientation discrimination. In order
to avoid having this debate under both those schedules and where it
applies elsewhere, one has to have it under either the definitional
clauses or under the clauses that describe direct discrimination. I do
not think that there is any alternative, otherwise I would certainly
have raised that when we considered the schedules as an
alternative.</div><a name="09061752000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000552"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying
what he is trying to do. The reason I think that what he is doing is
faulty relates to the points that he is making in this debate, using
schedule 9 as an example of why his amendments are justified. Having
listened carefully to what he is saying about the paragraph in schedule
9 that details other requirements relating to religion or belief and
what that would or would not allow someone to do, I am not clear that
organisations would be able to do what he says they would be able to
do. The wording of the schedule will not allow people to do what he is
complaining about. Therefore, I do not think that his justification for
these changes is sensible. I am just picking up his one point. I do not
wish to sound like a broken
record.</div><a name="09061752000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to echo the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, East.
From a religious perspective, referring to the particular Church he
mentioned, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>Catholic Church, there clearly is a difference between sexual
orientation and sexual practice, particularly in the roles of a
proselytising nature, priests and nuns and so forth, given the vow of
celibacy that priests and nuns take. For that religious organisation,
there is a clear difference and I would have thought that a religious
organisation above all would be capable of seeing the difference. I am
not persuaded by either the lengthy discussion we had this morning or
by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon&#146;s argument that
these two amendments should be carried by the Committee. My final
point, on which I am sure the Solicitor-General will be in agreement,
is that I am clear that he does not speak for the
Government.</div><a name="09061752000507"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000553"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> I second
that.</div><a name="09061752000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall keep this simple, I hope. These amendments seek to make explicit
the fact that it is unlawful to discriminate against a person on
grounds of manifestations of their sexual
orientation&#151;appearance, lifestyle, the people they see, the
places they go. However, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
answers his own amendment, because it is absolutely the case that
Amicus <i class="I">v.</i> the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has
interpreted sexual orientation regulations to say that such orientation
includes manifestations of sexual orientation. We have replicated the
words in those regulations in the Bill, in so far as they are relevant.
Consequently, there is simply no need to do any more; the law is
absolutely clear.</div>
<a name="09061752000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of a
footnote, the amendment would introduce a needless anomaly, because we
would put manifestation into the definition of one protected
characteristic without putting it into any others. There might be
manifestations of being a white British person, I suppose; always
singing &#147;Down at the old Bull and Bush&#148;, or going
foxhunting, or whatever we do.</div>
<a name="09061752000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000554"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point that the
amendment would bring manifestation into just one protected
characteristic. I agree with her because, as she said, I pointed out in
my contribution that the case law is clear. I was making the point that
there might be some merit in having the statute clear because of the
demand for that, since not every employer is able to access the case
law as easily as they would the statute. It might be particularly
relevant in this area, which is the only one, as far as I know, where
it is such a live issue. No one can doubt that it is a live issue after
the contributions that our witnesses and, indeed, other hon. Members
have made. Is there some merit, then, in clarifying the statute, as
well as what the Minister said about the
law?</div>
<a name="09061752000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000555"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> No. Quite honestly, the hon. Gentleman
is stretching it now. When we debate schedule 9, and whether
the exceptions are wide enough or too narrow, the hon. Gentleman can
raise those issues again&#151;and I have a dreadful feeling that he
will. However, the law is plain. The regulations have been interpreted
by the court. That is how our legal system works. The rule is that
sexual orientation includes manifestations of itself, and that would be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000556"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I note what the Minister said, and I am not
surprised that she recognises what the law says, which is in agreement
with the point that my amendment makes. That should give other hon.
Members pause to consider what implications that has. I recognise her
position that, just because something is made clear in case law, it
does not have to be replicated in statute law. However, in defence of
my approach, that is not always the approach that the Government take.
They sometimes seek the opportunity to put case law into statute, as
they quite rightly have with paragraph 2(8) of schedule 9.
Nevertheless, on hearing what the Minister says I am quite happy to beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000559"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> These measures should need only a relatively brief
debate. My amendment is similar in nature to amendment 132, tabled by
the Liberal Democrats, and it would leave the words &#147;because
of&#148; out of clause 13 and replace them with &#147;on grounds
of&#148;. That would effectively put the wording in the law back to
what it is at the moment. The reason for doing that is
twofold.</div><a name="09061752000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the &#147;on the grounds of&#148; formulation is consistent with
all existing legislation and with European equalities legislation. It
is the language that existing case law is already based on, and it
therefore gives certainty.</div>
<a name="09061752000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061752000560"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): The cardinal point, and
probably the only comment that I need make on this amendment, is that
any divergence or departure from the existing &#147;on the grounds
of&#148; is likely to give rise to legal argument. As my hon. Friend
has already said, it may well create further uncertainty or perverse or
difficult judgments that eventually have to be amended. It would be far
better to stick with what has been seen to work since the introduction
of disability discrimination in
law.</div><a name="09061752000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000561"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. This is the
only reason given in the explanatory notes for changing the
wording:</div><a name="09061752000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
change in wording does not change the legal meaning of the definition,
but rather is designed to make it more accessible to the ordinary user
of the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not quite sure who the ordinary user of the Bill is and it seems to
me that the ordinary users of most Acts of Parliament are lawyers, who
would be perfectly capable of understanding either formulation.
However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>it seems that there is a problem if something is changed that is well
recognised&#151;we may set up lots of unforeseen
consequences.</div><a name="09061752000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
the Equality and Human Rights Commission is supportive of amendment 7,
as is Citizens Advice, so there is clearly a fair bit of concern that
there may well be some negative consequences in changing the wording
and I am unconvinced by the reason given. The Minister says in the
explanatory notes that it does not change the legal position, and she
will no doubt repeat that, but given that there are no significant
benefits and there are risks that are clearly felt by a number of
organisations, will she reflect on whether that risk is worth
taking?</div><a name="09061752000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason&#151;this is where I suspect there is an argument about
whether the measure does or does not change the legal
definition&#151;is that the use of the word &#147;because&#148;
may indicate that it would have to be established that the
discriminator consciously intended to treat someone less favourably on
the protected grounds. On the current legal position, proving intention
is not required, so the &#147;because&#148; formulation may raise
the threshold for proving discrimination claims in that the complainant
may be required to prove a conscious motivation to discriminate. That
is what lies behind the concern from those organisations that this
measure may represent an inadvertent change in the law&#151;they
accept that it is
inadvertent.</div><a name="09061752000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final concern is that treating someone less favourably because of a
protected characteristic might be read as meaning that the protected
characteristic must be the whole or the main reason. Under current law,
the protected grounds should in no sense whatever be the treatment in
question, so covering less favourable treatment, which is only partly
attributable to the protected characteristic. Putting the word
&#147;because&#148; in the Bill could change the established
understanding of what is required, so introducing, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Daventry said, a lack of clarity, which may also provoke
more unnecessary legal
challenges.</div><a name="09061752000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister really needs to do the job of explaining not just why the
Government believe that this measure does not change the law, but why a
change of wording is necessary. Given that the Bill is carrying over
existing legislation, making a change requires more than the Government
saying it does not make any difference; they need a good reason for
making the change, given that some organisations think there are
significant risks involved. I will listen carefully to the Minister,
and if we are not persuaded by what she says we may seek to test the
mood of the
Committee.</div><a name="09061752000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061752000562"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): I shall speak
to Liberal Democrat amendment 132, which is not greatly different from
the Conservative amendment. It differs only in the word
&#147;the&#148;, which we are quite happy to go without. We will
support the Conservative amendment, because we agree that this measure
might open the door to legal
wrangles.</div><a name="09061752000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000563"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her slight
variant on our amendment, because I think it is the first time in
recorded history that I have ever spotted the Liberal Democrats using a
definite article about anything.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div><a name="09061752000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000564"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I do not know&#151;this place! Talk about
reform! Given that the measure might open some legal argument or
wrangle, and given that the existing wording has been the subject of
much testing and is tried and tested, it seems unnecessary to open it
up to further interpretation of meaning when that meaning is already
proven in case law. To get rid of that uncertainty, we will support the
Conservative
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000565"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> One of the key objectives of the Bill
is to simplify the law and make it more accessible. I do not think for
one minute that the only people who are going to read it are lawyers,
the easy-read bit at least. We deliberately put the plain
English&#151;the explanatory notes&#151;face to face with the
necessary legalese to make the Bill accessible to people way beyond
lawyers. With that principle in mind, it makes sense to talk in
ordinary English
language.</div><a name="09061752000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
word &#147;because&#148; is much more natural when one looks at the
reason for something. If someone is asked, &#147;Why did you do such
a thing?&#148;, the answer will mostly likely be,
&#147;Because.&#148; It is highly unlikely that people will say
&#147;on the grounds of&#148;, and that is the point. However, the
two terms mean the same thing. I do not know what they mean in&#151;I
am glad that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is here to
hear me mention it again&#151;the &#147;Evan Harris English
Dictionary of Peculiar Terminology&#148;, but in the &#147;Oxford
English Dictionary&#148;, the word &#147;because&#148; is defined
thus:</div>
<a name="09061752000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
reason of, on account
of&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061752000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">on
the grounds of. It is absolutely spot on and synonymous. I do not think
that it can be argued that there is any difference of
meaning&#151;they are absolutely
synonymous.</div><a name="09061752000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question in a case of direct discrimination is, &#147;Why was he
treated in that way?&#148; The answer would be,
&#147;Because&#148;, and that is what we need to capture. It need
not give rise to any legal wrangles. The courts are now rejecting
suggestions that a change in language necessarily implies a change of
meaning. There is no change of meaning. I have said it twice; perhaps I
have said three times now. It is very clear that there is no change of
meaning.</div>
<a name="09061752000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a 2005
case, Regina <i class="I">v.</i> Z in the House of Lords, Lord Woolf
said:</div><a name="09061752000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Techniques
in drafting of section 3 of the 2000 Act and section 19(3) of the 1973
Act differ. Section 3(1) of the 2000 Act is drafted more succinctly and
more clearly than its predecessor. It is in a crisper, more
contemporary style. However, there is no reason to think that the
difference in style means that it should be interpreted in any
different way from its predecessor in the 1973
Act.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the less reason for any court to think that it should be interpreted
differently. Now I am saying for the fourth time: there is no change in
the meaning from the change of words.</div>
<a name="09061752000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000566"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General, not least
for the assurance that she has given the Committee, which no doubt will
be remembered and may even appear in the courts in due course. It
occurs to me&#151;I defer to her legal knowledge&#151;that
&#147;on the grounds of&#148; is, in a sense, a more specific set
of tests referring to particular characteristics of the alleged
discrimination. It may well be that there is a concern where there is a
multiple complexity of factors involving discrimination or the
possibility of discrimination, some of which may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>be on grounds of the protected characteristics. Others might be much
more at large. Is the Minister satisfied that the new formulation
reflects the balance of those as well? As far as I am concerned, if
there is discrimination it is indefensible whatever the legal wording,
and I hope we are not reversing that in anything we are
considering.</div><a name="09061752000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000567"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Of course we are not. The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right. There are two specific examples where it
has been suggested that the measure might change the meaning. Let me
deal with those in a moment. I also add that there will be some
guidance and a rolling programme of training on the Bill in general to
make that point for county court and employment tribunal
judges.</div>
<a name="09061752000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first of
the two specific issues that were raised is whether &#147;because
of&#148;, unlike &#147;on the grounds of&#148;, may imply the
need for intent&#151;that is the concern of Conservative Members. The
answer is no: &#147;on the grounds of&#148; and &#147;because
of&#148; are both indicative of causation, but they do not imply
required consent. It is perfectly possible to characterise direct
discrimination as being because of a protected characteristic. The
courts will be able to reject the suggestion that because the word has
changed, the meaning has too, as I have just explained through the
mouth of Lord
Woolf.</div><a name="09061752000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other express concern is that, to be discriminatory, treatment does not
have to be based only on discrimination&#151;it could happen a number
of reasons of which discrimination is one. Would changing &#147;on
the grounds of&#148; to &#147;because of&#148; mean that the
discrimination need be the only ground for less favourable treatment?
Again, the answer is no, because they are totally synonymous and there
is no change in the nature of the essential question of why a person
claiming direct discrimination was treated in the way that he or she
was.</div><a name="09061752000508"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09061752000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is more modern and exactly as Lord Woolf decided. Its style is
crisper and more contemporary than that of more ancient law. It is good
to change and keep up. When a new Equality Bill is introduced to help
people with their rights at work or when they feel that they are being
discriminated against, they want to be able to look at one page for the
technical stuff and the other page for the explanation. That is why we
have put in the plain English: to encourage people to look at it. There
is no point in passing the Bill, after a long Committee stage, if it
just hangs around on the shelf and is only brought out by lawyers to
rebut discrimination. The point of the Bill is to change the culture
and to move forward the whole cause of equality. As we shall discuss
presently, it will require public authorities to drive the equalities
agenda through their policies. We want it to be as accessible as
possible, and this is just a small example of how we can do that. I
assure the Committee that it will not be to the detriment of
anyone&#146;s rights.</div>
<a name="09061752000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000568"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to
the Minister&#146;s dictionary definition, particularly given that
she used my name in reference to it. She read out the definition of
&#147;because of&#148;. It had three parts, one of which was
&#147;by reason of&#148; and another &#147;on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>grounds of&#148;. It does not necessarily follow that because a new
word includes another formulation that it is synonymous with that
formulation. It could include it, but go further. Regardless of what
the courts might determine, people reading the Bill might think that
&#147;by reason of&#148; is different from &#147;on the grounds
of&#148;. &#147;Reason&#148; implies a cognitive action, and that
might cover intent, which the Minister is keen to avoid. I do not think
that she has made the case that &#147;because of&#148; is
synonymous with &#147;on the grounds of&#148; by reason of that
dictionary definition. I do not think that the Government will find it
easy to defend their position, well intentioned though it might be,
during the Bill&#146;s progress, including in another place, because
of that problem&#151;and on the grounds of that
problem.</div><a name="09061752000081"></a>

Committee members have ploughed through both parts of the Bill, but, to
be perfectly frank, the words &#147;crisp&#148; and
&#147;contemporary&#148; did not leap out at me as I went through
the 200 or so clauses. It is a perfectly good Bill, but crisp and
contemporary it is not. It uses much language, such as
&#147;protected characteristic&#148;, that one does not generally

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000593"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> The amendment would permit a claim of direct
discrimination and harassment for multiple forms of discrimination. I
know that the Government are consulting on the matter but,
interestingly, the consultation document prompts this question: on what
principle of justice or fairness should new legislation aimed at
fairness deliberately exclude protection against discrimination based
on a combination of two or more characteristics, discrimination against
which are individually prohibited, because it would be burdensome to
business? The key is that justice is not about whether business finds
something burdensome to act equitably. The purpose of the measure must
be justice.</div>
<a name="09061752000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The business
community has concerns about the increase in litigation, because there
could be multiple bites of the discrimination cherry. It is concerned
that that would increase settlement costs and that it would be cheaper
to settle than to go to court. Under the Bill, cases of direct
discrimination and harassment on multiple forms of discrimination are
not outlawed, but we think they ought to be, and the Government are
consulting on the issue. However, all organisations seem to think that
such a measure is necessary, so I do not understand the need to consult
again.</div>
<a name="09061752000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reading of
the situation is that the Government believe that combining two
protective characteristics would be adequate, because it would cover
most claims, but that might result in permitting combinations of more
protective characteristics. In response to the &#147;Discrimination
Law Review&#148; consultation, public concern that the current law
does not adequately protect those who experience multiple
discrimination was identified. I am sure the Minister can think of many

claimant would be able to bring the appropriate claim for

this.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000594"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I shall be very brief. Having listened to the
evidence, I believe that the hon. Lady is slightly wrong in the way in
which she characterises what the Government have done. I read their
written statement and their consultation document. They acknowledged
that a great deal of the feedback to the &#147;Discrimination Law
Review&#148; said that there should be a multiple discrimination
provision, as the hon. Lady says. That is why they made a proposal
enabling claims that combine two protected characteristics in the
consultation document. I read both the written statement and the
discussion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>document that the Government published in April and thought that they
made a great deal of sense. We will obviously look carefully at the
specific legislative proposals that the Government introduce.</div>
<a name="09061752000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
evidence-taking session, there was a discussion about whether combining
two characteristics made sense, or whether more were needed. There was
general agreement that it should be possible to combine two, but there
was not much evidence of cases where two would not enable the
protection. There did not seem to be much evidence to support having
more than two characteristics, given the complexity involved and the
benefits that would be derived.</div>
<a name="09061752000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
fact that the law should be based on dealing with real, identified
problems, the proposal to bring in multiple discrimination on two
protected characteristics seems to be the right one. If, in future
cases, there are many situations involving more grounds, which the
Government&#146;s proposal would not solve, the matter could be
looked at again. From the evidence that we heard in Committee, the
Government&#146;s approach seems sensible. The hon. Lady&#146;s
amendment would insert &#147;more than one&#148;, implying that all
the protected characteristics could be brought together, and
regrettably, we are not able to support it.</div>
<a name="09061752000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000595"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those
remarks. This is a question of striking the right balance. I believe
that the law would not become more complex because that complexity is
already there as a consequence of the existence of the strands.
Intersectional cases would become less complex, because the law would
sit more naturally and suit the facts. Again, the fact that something
is more complex or burdensome should not be the guiding line as to how
many strands, protective characteristics or multiple discriminations
are allowable. However, I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>
<a name="09061752000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000596"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> That is important, because the Bill is not just
about what the law says, but about what happens in reality. Part of the
benefit of bringing different pieces of discrimination law together in
a more straightforward Bill, is that protection will not be offered
only by the law. The reality on the ground will be that all those
organisations that have to behave in accordance with the
law&#151;such as those providing goods or services, or
employers&#151;will find it easy to understand. The problem with
making something complex, particularly if it is disproportionate to the
wrong that we are trying to solve, is that in making it more complex,
it becomes more difficult. There might be a purer basis in law, which
we would all be happy with, but in practice, it might more difficult to
deliver the rights and protections that are so important for the people
we are trying to look after.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000597"></a>Lynne

to accept the amendment, and I will withdraw it after the Minister has

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000600"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendment would have the effect of
allowing claims of direct discrimination and harassment to combine in
an unlimited number of any or all protected characteristics. The great
mathematicians advising me have worked out that covering all the
possible combinations would give 511 possible combinations of action,
which not surprisingly, is rather a worry for business. It would be
highly complex, most people would find it excessively burdensome, and
it would leave individuals wondering where and how on earth they could
exercise their rights in the face of such a lot of possible
combinations.</div><a name="09061752000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recently published a document. There was a good deal of discussion in
the earlier review, as the hon. Member for Forest of Dean has said, and
the intention of the new document, &#147;Equality Bill: Assessing the
impact of a multiple discrimination provision&#148; was exactly as
expressed in its title. A clause in the document limits it to two
grounds. The point was to ask a specific question of a particular
business and other interested parties about what the impact of the
clause on that limited number of grounds would be, so as to provide a
some clear understanding about the l scope of the
measure.</div>

pm</div><a name="09061752000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
short, the hon. Lady&#146;s proposal would be unduly complex and
excessively burdensome and, since she has let the cat out of the bag by
saying that she is going to withdraw it, I shall not add any more
detail. However, our discussion document closed for responses last
Friday. We are looking at the feedback we have received and, once we
have done so, we will make a decision about whether protection from
multiple discrimination, as set out in our document, can be effective,
workable and proportionate. If it can, we will introduce
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000601"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> On timing, will the Minister confirm whether it is
subject to the question of how long it takes to go through those
responses? Do the Government intend to table an amendment to the Bill
on Report in the Commons, or wait until it goes to the other place? On
a procedural point, I think it would be better to allow the elected
House to consider it first, if that is possible within the
timing.</div><a name="09061752000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000602"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Yes, it is our ambition to do it

thank her for her response. Regardless of whether or not I withdraw the
amendment, it is important to have her thoughts on the matter on the
record. It is a matter of judgment and I accept the Minister&#146;s
view that the best way forward is to look at the combination of two of
the strands. I also welcome the fact that the Commons, rather than the
Lords, will be able to scrutinise the measure so, for now, I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000606"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I stand corrected. Amendment 194 states that
discrimination does not include marketing or promoting activities
targeted at a particular group of people, whether or not they share a
protected characteristic. It is tabled primarily to elicit some
reassurance from the Minister that routine, perfectly normal and
perfectly lawful business activities will remain as such.</div>
<a name="09061752000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the
Minister is well aware that it is standard business practice to segment
markets, and to target particular groups on the basis of sound business
principles. I hope that she will reassure us that that can continue and
that there will be no question, in the future, of subjecting
businesses&#146; marketing plans to rigorous legal scrutiny. They
have not required that scrutiny in the past.</div>
<a name="09061752000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
issues: one is market targeting, the other is limiting access to a
product or service. The second one is different and is deliberately not
part of the amendment&#151;that is something for separate discussion
later. There are, however, many companies whose business models could
be cast into doubt if we do not clarify this proposal. There could be
all sorts of dangerous and worrying implications if we do not nail this
down.</div><a name="09061752000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000607"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the
difficulties is that any discrimination likely to be alleged will
probably be indirect? For instance, a marketing programme might not
necessarily be expressed as only for the over-70s, or whatever, but in
practice it might well add up to that as a result of careful market
segmentation. People would then say, &#147;Ah, this is
discrimination.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000608"></a>John
Penrose:</b> My hon. Friend has summed it up neatly&#151;we
tabled the amendment for that reason, and to give the Minister a chance
to allay any fears among investors, management and staff in many
companies up and down the country. There are many examples. We have
heard evidence and submissions from companies such as Saga, which
specialises in marketing to, and providing holidays for, people above a
certain age. Club 18-30 self-evidently targets its products at the
other age range, and Sheilas&#146; Wheels markets insurance to women
drivers, as well as a series of other people. Those companies have
particular market aims and are targeting their advertising at certain
segments of the market. I am not sure, but it is entirely possible
there are holiday companies which market their products and aim their
promotional activities at Muslims wishing to go on the Hajj. Those
companies would be legitimate and we would not want to stop them. In my
constituency of Weston-super-Mare, there is a hotel which specialises
in holidays and respite for disabled people and their carers. Clearly,
everybody would want that to be perfectly legitimate and allowable in
future.</div><a name="09061752000137"></a>

Featherstone:</b> This is not an area I am particularly
familiar with. If a golf club wanted to attract members, but only gave
incentives or direct marketing to white people, would that cross the
line in any way?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div><a name="09061752000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000610"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I am hoping the Minister will sketch out where
she thinks the Bill already does this and provide some guidance as to
what is allowable, what will continue to be allowable, and where the
Bill draws the line. That is why we have tabled the amendment. I am
hoping it is straightforward for the Minister to give us comfort and
reassurance, but it is important that we get this on the record at an
early stage in the Bill&#146;s passage so that investors, management
and staff in any affected business can be reassured in
future.</div>
<a name="09061752000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000611"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Service providers want to maximise
business, and depending on the nature of it, that will entail
legitimate targeting of campaigns at certain groups. Like the
businesses that have been quoted, another example is a company that
specialises in selling make-up tailored to black women. They should be
perfectly entitled to target that audience by, for instance,
advertising in the black press or using photographs of black models.
The car insurance company which was quoted is an example that I would
have used too.</div>
<a name="09061752000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
where an advert discriminates against a person with a protected
characteristic that it would be unlawful. If the make-up advert
denigrated white women, or the car insurance advert indicated that
lesbians need not apply, such marketing would fall foul of the existing
legislation and of the Bill. Of course, the EHRC would take action in
such a case.</div>
<a name="09061752000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Technically
speaking, marketing and promotion is not a service so it is not within
the Bill&#146;s scope, unless it is discriminatory in the way I have
described. People receive flyers and read adverts before they use the
service. It is only at the point of the customer&#146;s engagement
with the service provider that it complies with part 3 of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061752000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000612"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Does the Minister accept that many companies
specialise within the marketing, advertising and promotional world,
advising those who produce the ads and promotional activities she is
describing? If they are participating in creating those promotional
vehicles, might they none the less be captured in that
way?</div>
<a name="09061752000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000613"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not know about that. The real
point is that if any marketing or promotion is discriminatory, it would
be in the scope of the Bill. It is discrimination so would come in as
such. However, the Bill deals with goods, facilities and services;
advertising is not within that definition. It is worth noting that the
stakeholders he alluded to&#151;representing financial services and
the age interest&#151;have concluded readily that marketing to
specific age groups is no problem. They are not asking for any change
from this legislation.</div>
<a name="09061752000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000614"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Perhaps the Solicitor-General could help on the
concern which built up in my mind as she answered. It is about the
nature of the campaign itself, picking up the point that the hon.
Member for Hornsey and Wood Green made. Suppose somebody&#151;it
might be for the best of motives, or it might not&#151;produces a
campaign that is presented as a general marketing campaign but uses
models who are all white. I am not talking about two or three, but
about a large population. One might reasonably assume that something is
going on; they are either totally culturally unaware, or they are
wilfully trying to misrepresent the population. Is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>activity discriminatory by itself? If so, with whom, as no service is
being provided, and what action can be taken about
it?</div>
<a name="09061752000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000615"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> In so far as it was discriminatory, it
would be discriminatory not so much for being targeted at a group but
for excluding a group. If it excluded or denigrated a group as it went
along praising its target group, that would be discrimination in the
ordinary way, and all the provisions that we are used to would fall
into place exactly as they would with any other kind of discrimination.
There is adequate protection. Targeting is not a problem as such, so
there is no need for the amendment. I therefore invite the hon. Member
for Weston-super-Mare to withdraw
it.</div><a name="09061752000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000616"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I think I understand the Minister to have
said&#151;I will play it back to her to ensure that we have got it
absolutely clearly&#151;that provided that promotional or marketing
activities are done constructively and positively to emphasise the
benefits of the thing being promoted and the group to which it is being
promoted, rather than running down anyone else, any company that
indulges in market segmentation or targeted marketing should be on the
right side of the law. If that is the case and I have understood it
correctly&#151;I think that I saw the Minister nodding just
now&#151;</div><a name="09061752000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000617"></a>The

inspiration.</div><a name="09061752000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000618"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Perhaps I should talk slowly until inspiration
arrives, in the shape of bits of paper from her advisers. If I have
understood it correctly, we would be willing to accept it. I am,
however, hopeful that the Minister will be able to confirm that before
I can say genuinely that I am willing to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000621"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I sensed that my hon. Friend might require some
assistance. While this is going on, will he consider also&#151;I am
still not wholly satisfied by the Solicitor-General&#146;s
response&#151;that when I described certain conditions that involved
a marketing campaign and not the provision of a good or service, she
said firmly that if it excluded a group of the population maliciously
or, as I suggested, due to a lack of cultural awareness, it would
somehow be covered by discrimination? However, if it is not directly
part of the provision of goods or services, how could it be? Will he
reflect on that, and perhaps reflect my concerns to
her?</div><a name="09061752000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000622"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank my hon. Friend. I see that inspiration
appears to have struck the Minister; at least, a piece of paper has
been passed to her. If she is willing to reply to us, that would be
helpful.</div><a name="09061752000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000623"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman noticed
how indirectly the paper was sent to me. In a nutshell, targeting is
fine as long as it does not exclude or disadvantage people. I hope that
that is clear enough.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div><a name="09061752000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000624"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the Minister for that. That implies an
approach in the Bill similar to that taken elsewhere to positive
action. It is okay to target particular groups of people in a positive
way, but denigrating them or running them down is not. On that basis,
and having had that clear instruction and reaction from the Minister, I

is an important amendment that deals with the question of
discrimination based on association and perception. Some of the points
were raised on Second Reading, so I will not go back to the beginning.
I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the ruling in the European
Court of Justice case of Coleman <i class="I">v. </i>Attridge Law. The judgment
was that discrimination on the basis of association in respect of
disability&#151;I think that the same thing should apply to age, in a
read-across to the need to care for old or young people&#151;needs to
be covered, and indeed is covered, in European
law.</div>
<a name="09061752000510"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09061752000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that on Second Reading and at the time of the judgment, the
Government said that they agreed and had no problem with that.
Furthermore, the explanatory notes state in paragraph 71 that the
definition in clause
13</div><a name="09061752000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
broad enough to cover cases where the less favourable treatment is
because of the victim&#146;s association with someone who has that
characteristic (for example, is disabled), or because the victim is
wrongly thought to have it (for example, a particular religious
belief).&#148;</div><a name="09061752000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a perception and, in that case, a wrong
perception.</div><a name="09061752000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point of the amendment is to probe initially, depending on the
Minister&#146;s response, the reasons why the Government are not
taking the opportunity to set it out clearly in the statute that direct
discrimination is to cover discrimination based on association or
perception. That seems a straightforward thing to do, although if the
Minister identifies problems with the phrasing of the amendment, it is
unlikely that I shall seek to defend the words in it, but if she does
not, the question remains why it is not in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061752000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of organisations share the view that I have expressed; it is not
an unusual view. For example, the Discrimination Law Association states
that it is important for these prohibited forms of
discrimination&#151;discrimination on the basis of association or
perception&#151;</div><a name="09061752000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
be referred to explicitly on the face of the legislation. In other
words, the prohibition on discrimination by way of association and/or
by reason of perception should be expressly
stated.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Equality Commission for Northern Ireland makes exactly the same point.
It says that the commission recommends that the Bill should expressly
state that discrimination due to perception and association is unlawful
in relation to all protected characteristics. Carers UK says that it
believes that carers, employers and even lawyers who are not experts in
discrimination law will have problems interpreting and applying the
provisions unless that is expressly stated.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div><a name="09061752000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
organisations have direct experience of dealing with these matters and
they see merit in placing the measure in the Bill. The Government must
have considered that and there must be a reason for not doing it. Given
the unanimity of view of those organisations, it would have to be a
good
reason.</div><a name="09061752000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EHRC makes exactly the same point in its briefing. It is concerned that
the measure is not in the Bill. It therefore completes a set of four
groups of people who are concerned that it is not included. In fact, it
makes the point that the explanatory notes do not form part of the Bill
and have not been endorsed by Parliament; they are not, and are not
meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Bill. Therefore,
relying on the explanatory notes is not ideal, and although ministerial
statements are useful, it is very difficult to ask people who need to
know about this provision to be aware of every ministerial
statement.</div><a name="09061752000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EHRC states that it would also like to see in the Bill express
protection from discrimination based on association and perception
generally. It says that for a number of reasons and it is important to
enumerate them. First, like the other organisations, the EHRC believes
that it is important to make it clear that that is covered as part of
an educational experience, although I know that that alone does not
warrant the inclusion of a measure in the Bill. Secondly, it is
concerned that there may otherwise be perceived to be some regression.
It says that discrimination because someone is perceived to be or is
associated with someone from a particular racial group or religion or
belief group or sexual orientation is currently prohibited in some
areas, and the concern would be that if the &#147;because&#148;
language&#151;we have already debated that, but not on this
point&#151;was not interpreted by the courts as including perception
or association, that would run the risk of
regression.</div><a name="09061752000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that that is a particularly strong point, because the
courts are clearly bound by what the Minister would describe as the
intention of Parliament and, indeed, the ruling of the higher court, at
least in the case of Coleman. However, the EHRC also makes the point,
which I agree with&#151;this point is important, given what the
Minister said about gender reassignment&#151;that perception is so
much a factor in respect of protection on the grounds of gender
reassignment, especially given how unhappy some of us are with the
existing wording, that it is essential that it is very clearly
understood that the protection is there in respect of the perception of
someone as undergoing gender reassignment, even if they are not or are
not proposing to be because, for example, they are merely
cross-dressing and they do not do so all the time with a view to going
on a journey, as the Minister calls it, permanently to change their
gender
identity.</div><a name="09061752000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has put on its website a copy of
a letter that it sent to the Minister, asked the Government the same
question: why is that provision not included in the
Bill?</div><a name="09061752000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is appropriate to ask now, rather than in a clause stand part debate,
about clause 13(4), which
specifies:</div><a name="09061752000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the protected characteristic is marriage and civil
partnership&#148;,</div><a name="09061752000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
far as work is concerned&#151;employment&#151;people cannot claim
direct discrimination by association, because it is only
where</div><a name="09061752000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;B
is married or a civil partner.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div><a name="09061752000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explanatory note
says, without explanation, so it is only a partially explanatory note,
that</div><a name="09061752000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
different approach applies where the reason for the treatment is
marriage or civil partnership, in which case only less favourable
treatment because of the victim&#146;s status amounts to
discrimination.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that that precludes discrimination by association. There may be a
good reason for that, but it is not explained in the explanatory notes,
which is
unfortunate.</div><a name="09061752000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the basis for my amendment, which I hope the Minister will look
kindly on, because, although it may not be the first preference in
drafting the Bill, I do not believe that it does any harm, and it will
certainly satisfy a number of organisations that have expressed
concerns.</div><a name="09061752000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000626"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I shall be brief. We touched on perceived
disability and discrimination by association when debating some of the
amendments that I tabled on clause 6 and, in that case, the
Minister&#146;s explanation was satisfactory, so I asked leave to
withdraw
them.</div><a name="09061752000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon makes some good points. Both
the Minister&#146;s explanation and the explanatory note say that the
wording in the Bill is clear enough and that it covers what the hon.
Gentleman mentioned, but state some concerns that are shared widely. I
will listen with great care to the Minister&#146;s detailed
explanation about whether the wording in clause 13
adequately captures the points raised by the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061752000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000627"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendment would make it explicit
that direct discrimination includes less favourable treatment of
someone because of their association with somebody who has a particular
protected characteristic, or because they themselves are perceived,
rightly or wrongly, to have that
characteristic.</div><a name="09061752000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause derives, in part, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon said, from Coleman <i class="I">v</i>. Attridge Law in the European
Court of Justice, which said that the European directive&#146;s
definition of direct discrimination implicitly includes the concept of
discrimination by association. Although the clause derives from that in
part&#151;it is written with large exclamation marks around it at the
moment because that is quite a recent decision&#151;in 1975, or
thereabouts, our domestic courts reached the same conclusion, which was
that, under the Race Relations Act 1976, direct discrimination
implicitly included discrimination by association. Our own courts have
also held that the definition implicitly includes the concept of
discrimination by perception in a different case in
1983.</div><a name="09061752000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say that because we do not have something absolutely new and we are not
putting it explicitly into the Bill, which the hon. Gentleman could
have argued would have been dangerous, because something new needs to
be written in large letters. I used that argument when I talked about
listing the people to whom the socio-economic duty was due, saying,
&#147;It is a new duty; let us list the people that it applies to so
that everyone knows who is in and who is out.&#148; That would have
been an argument had those two domestic judgments, both now more than
20 years old, not injected that interpretation into our domestic law,
pointing towards the conclusion in Coleman arrived at by the European
Court.</div><a name="09061752000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s definition of &#147;direct discrimination&#148;
includes those concepts. I am pretty ready to accept, honestly, that at
the very first look at the clauses there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>transparency argument for making the protection explicit, as some
definitions of &#147;direct discrimination&#148; in current
legislation do. However, the reason that we have not is to widen the
ambit of clause 13, being careful not to narrow it
inadvertently.</div><a name="09061752000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I explain what might at the moment look like an odd concept, I shall
say one more thing, which is that we want people to be able to access
their rights. I have spoken about that recently, in saying that
simplifying the language is an important component of encouraging
people to look, and to see what they are entitled to. One might say,
&#147;Well, let us put in association and perception,&#148; so that
they can see what their rights are in those connections. For the reason
that I am about to set out, it is not so wise to do that in this case
as it was in the question of &#147;because&#148;. Also, I venture
to suggest that discrimination by association or discrimination by
perception are quite complex ways of expressing something anyway, and
may not throw all that much light on what they are about for the lay
person.</div><a name="09061752000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
is the core of why we do not think that we should accept the amendment.
The &#147;because of&#148; turn of phrase in clause 13 is broad
enough and is intended to be broad enough to cover much more than just
cases in which the less favourable treatment is due to the
victim&#146;s association with someone who has the characteristic or
because the victim is wrongly thought to have that characteristic. The
formulation is intended to and does cover cases, for instance, of less
favourable treatment because of a refusal to comply with instructions
to discriminate. It is also intended and does cover a case in which
someone is treated as if they had a protected characteristic that they
neither have nor are perceived to have at the
time.</div><a name="09061752000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Direct
discrimination&#148; has a number of forms&#151;a lot of different
forms. Even after the Bill, what the definition covers will continue to
evolve through the case law. That is really the point. We do not want,
by specifying particular kinds of direct discrimination, to imply that
we are excluding kinds of discrimination that might come about in a
situation that we have simply not foreseen when setting out the clause.
So, we favour what we see as a broad
formulation.</div><a name="09061752000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is not perfect, as has been said, but it has been drafted in
such a way as not to preclude the clause&#146;s application to other
forms of direct discrimination. However, there is always that lawyerly
problem&#151;I forget how many members of the Committee, as well me,
are lawyers. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary, Government
Equalities Office, is. The danger is that, if we name something in a
section of a statute, by implication we exclude or devalue things that
are not named. In a nutshell, that is the thinking behind not putting
in association or perception
expressly.</div><a name="09061752000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the example quoted by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, in
clause 13(4), he would say&#151;he may be right&#151;that
discrimination by association or by perception are excluded. In a way,
by analogy with the arguments that I have just launched, that is a
powerful implication that association and perception are included in
all other aspects of clause 13. However, because there is a change in
perception and because it is so central to the world of carers that the
law has now emerged and crystallised in the Bill after the Coleman
case, we will promote it as strongly as we can to ensure that everyone
knows their rights. Outside the ambit of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>making the Bill clear, the availability of the new rights needs to be
made clear. People probably do not need to worry about that because
Carers UK has very much got the bit between its teeth. It is pleased
with these changes in the law, and it will certainly ensure that the
caring community knows that it will now have these new rights. We will
do everything that we can to support the ambition of making the rights
transparent.</div>

pm</div><a name="09061752000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will be content to withdraw his amendment
because of, first, my clear statement that association and perception
are included in the definition in clause 13 and, secondly, the danger
that I have set out of naming something and excluding something
else.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000628"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> May I give the Minister the opportunity to
respond, if she can, to the point that I raised on subsection (4) about
the explanation for that exclusion? I feel that that would be best
dealt with in this group of amendments, rather than in a stand part
debate. If she is able to do that now, I would be grateful, but I
understand if she is not, and she may be able to come back to it in an
intervention.</div>
<a name="09061752000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000629"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will return to that point in the
clause stand part debate if we have one. However, I do not know what
your view will be by the time that we get to the end of the many
amendments, Lady Winterton. I will either do that now or I will write
to the hon. Gentleman, but I shall let him
know.</div>
<a name="09061752000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000630"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is fine. I am grateful to the Minister for
giving a full explanation of the Government&#146;s position. I accept
that when there is a new provision, it is worth putting into statute. I
accept that this is not a new interpretation of the law, but I believe
that just because it is not new is not a reason for including it if
there are other reasons. I know that that was not the main part of her
case, and I am pleased that she recognised the argument for including
the provision in the interests of transparency, especially since she
felt strongly about the &#147;because of&#148; provision, where the
case is somewhat less strong.</div>
<a name="09061752000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000631"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman made a
point about subsection (4). Association and perception discrimination
have never been covered in marriage and civil partnership provisions
before, because there was never any evidence of need, so we have just
carried forward the existing protection to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09061752000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000632"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is useful in that narrow area, because I
suspect that it will be raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
and it and others can reflect on that answer to see whether a case can
be proposed for the exclusion. The logic is that other areas are
included because there is evidence of a problem. I will not push that
now, but it seems peculiar that, historically, there should have been
such non-coverage, even if there was no evidence of harm, because it
just sticks out. I shall have to reflect and seek
advice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div><a name="09061752000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000633"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman will probably
remember that I said this morning that the consultation showed almost
an argument for discontinuing this protected characteristic completely,
because there is so little evidence that it causes difficulty. As I
understand it, there is absolutely no evidence that association and
perception add to the almost non-existent difficulty that it causes. It
is right at the bottom of everyone&#146;s
scale.</div>
<a name="09061752000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000634"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I accept that. I am on the record as saying that
legislation should prioritise dealing with mischief, which is why I
raised the issue of sexual orientation discrimination in religious
organisations. It is not part of my mission to seek out areas that are
not covered for the sake of it. However, I will reflect on
that.</div><a name="09061752000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the Minister&#146;s reasoning, she was concerned that it is
important to not inadvertently narrow the ambit of direct
discrimination by a misplaced amendment that seeks to clarify. I
understand that, although we have not seen&#151;I am not inviting her
to do so now&#151;any direct criticism of the amendment that I have
provided or such an amendment that might do that. However, I recognise
that that is sometimes a good reason for not providing greater
explanation within statute.</div>
<a name="09061752000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come to
the Minister&#146;s core reason, which is the concern that including
something might imply that other grounds are covered by direct
discrimination. I was grateful to her for the information that she
provided about the other sorts of things that are covered, such as
detrimental treatment on the basis of a refusal to discriminate. The
danger of including some parts of the definition might, by extension,
imply that the others are not covered, and I need to reflect on what
she has said about that. One could say that, if there is a good
argument for including the measures in the Bill, she is still able to
say and make clear that their mere inclusion does not in any way
detract from existing protections covered by discrimination.</div>
<a name="09061752000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">On balance, I
am not persuaded that there is still a good reason to include such
matters, but it is important that the organisations that I cited read
the Minister&#146;s words carefully to see whether they are persuaded
by her. On that basis, I think it wise for us all to go away and
reflect on what she has said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09061752000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000635"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I beg to move amendment 133, in
clause 13, page 9, line 10, leave
out subsection (3) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) If the
protected characteristic is disability, nothing in this section shall
be taken to prohibit more favourable treatment of a disabled person on
the grounds of a disabled person&#146;s
disability.&#146;.</div><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I"></i><i class="I">An
amendment to retain the asymmetric nature of disability
discrimination.</i></div><a name="09061752000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a familiar discussion about disability and direct discrimination. It
is asymmetric and therefore we perhaps have to treat those with
disabilities more favourably to bring about an equal outcome, because
disability is different from the other protected characteristics in
that sense.</div>
<a name="09061752000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would allow duty holders to treat disabled people more favourably where
that is necessary to meet their needs. The reason for the amendment is
that the current wording in subsection (3) could lead to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>confusion, and it is not as explicit as the Disability Charities
Consortium would wish. The key principle is that achieving equality for
someone who is disabled requires, as I said, more favourable treatment.
That principle is enshrined in the reasonable adjustment duty that is
right at the heart of current disability discrimination law.</div>
<a name="09061752000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">An employer
might need to provide additional adaptations to ensure that someone
with disabilities can do their job, and that might be something that
would not be available to someone who is not disabled. In effect, the
person with a disability would receive more favourable treatment than a
colleague who is not disabled. The goal, as I said, is an equal
outcome.</div><a name="09061752000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the Conservatives have tabled a similar amendment to the
clauses on indirect discrimination. The problem with clause 13(3) as
currently drafted is that, according to explanatory note 74, it is
apparently intended to ensure
that</div><a name="09061752000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
relation to disability it is not discrimination to treat a disabled
person more favourably than a person who is not
disabled&#148;.</div><a name="09061752000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Disability Charities Consortium, which supports the amendment, is
concerned that such drafting might not achieve that intention and might
have unintended consequences, because the current drafting does not
explicitly refer to &#147;more favourable&#148; treatment, which is
such an integral part of disability discrimination law. It refers only
to treating
people</div><a name="09061752000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a way which is permitted by or under this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="09061752000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
DCC is concerned that that leads to a lack of clarity and that the
hard-fought-for key principle of more favourable treatment should be
made explicit in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061752000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
avoidance of doubt and to be absolutely clear that it is within the law
to treat those with a disability more favourably, the amendment is
unequivocal. It would replace the wording with a very simple statement
that would ensure that the meaning of the Bill, which is to allow more
favourable treatment for those with disabilities, could not be
thwarted. It would ensure that there is no regression from the very
important current protection from discrimination that disabled people
have, and it would be clearer for those who need to be sure of what
they are doing, whether they employers, service providers, statutory
authorities and any others who may be affected. Under the legislation,
they must be certain that they may treat people with disabilities more
favourably. I am sure that everyone in this room will agree with the
principle, but the argument is about the wording. How the Minister
responds will be helpful to the
courts.</div><a name="09061752000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000636"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Again, I shall be very brief. I have some sympathy
with the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns. We are looking for the Minister
to do two things. First, we want her to be clear about the effect of
the language in the Bill. The explanatory note is clear, but we want
the Bill to be clear. Secondly&#151;this goes to part of what the DCC
is talking about&#151;will she say a word or two about the guidance
either from the Department or the EHRC? We want to be clear about what
will be in the Act, but the guidance should be explicit for those who
have to use, implement and understand the law, and the intention behind
the law should be clear. That would be helpful.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div><a name="09061752000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
amendments have been intended to make the language in the Bill clear.
There are two parts to that. First, we would like the Minister to
comment on the legal effect of the Bill. Secondly, we hope that the
text that the EHRC produces once the Bill is enacted will be more
readable. That is critical, as it will be used by the man in the street
and business organisations. The Minister could well reassure the
Committee on those two points.</div>
<a name="09061752000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000637"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendment would make the intent of
clause 13(3) clearer. Our intention is to import into the Bill directly
the asymmetric nature of the protection that Disability Discrimination
Act 1995 gives to disabled people. That has always been our intention;
it continues to be our intention, and there is no
regression.</div><a name="09061752000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been pointed out, we say in the explanatory notes that</div>
<a name="09061752000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is not
discrimination to treat a disabled person more favourably than a person
who is not disabled&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061752000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">That could not be
clearer or more unambiguous. However, clause 13(3) could be clearer and
less ambiguous, and we do not think that we have achieved the same
transparency in drafting the clause as we have attained in the
explanatory
notes.</div><a name="09061752000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
heard from the disability charities in the evidence-taking sessions.
They were worried that the clause was not clear enough. There is
absolutely no disagreement about what we are doing in Committee, so we
would like to invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment on the
clear understanding that we are talking to the disability charities
with every intention of attempting to clarify clause 13(3) in some
better way. We have a target of doing so on Report if
possible.</div>
<a name="09061752000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000638"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister for that very helpful
response and clear commitment to what we all intend for this part of

find a clear wording. On that basis, I am more than happy to beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000641"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The amendment standing in my name and that of my
hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green covers some quite
complex areas of case law, and I will not be able to do it justice,
partly because of time and partly because, when I finished reading the
case that I found most useful, I had lost track of what was said at the
beginning, so long and complex was the judgment. However, there are
some juicy bits in it that make things clear.</div>
<a name="09061752000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case also
deals with the amendment and new clause tabled by the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East. It is useful that we are having this debate, because
there is a clear distinction in the position that I am taking, which
seeks to probe the position in case law and the position taken by the
hon. Gentleman in his amendment and new clause, which I think is wrong
and inappropriate.</div>
<a name="09061752000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to make clear what amendment 221 would do. If someone has a
requirement in respect of work based on a manifestation of their
religion, such as an unwillingness, inability or injunction not to work
on a day of religious rest, or some requirements related to clothing,
time for prayer or worship, I believe that they should have protection
from discrimination when a criterion that prevents them accessing that
right is not legitimate or proportionate to what it seeks to do. That
is indirect discrimination.</div>
<a name="09061752000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
supported a number of cases where religious individuals have been
treated unfairly by another party. The Sikh bangle case is a good
example. A young girl wanted to wear a bangle, but her school sought to
prevent her from doing so. That was clearly indirect discrimination on
the grounds of religion and belief. The court rightly reached the
judgment that it was not justified under the terms of the test for
indirect discrimination. I want to be absolutely clear about
that.</div><a name="09061752000512"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09061752000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am seeking to debate the expectation that we will increasingly see some
cases regarding discrimination on the grounds of a manifestation of
religion brought to employment tribunals. I will refer to Ladele
<i class="I">v.</i> London borough of Islington, because it is a useful case,
though not the only one. Suffering detriment on the basis of
one&#146;s view that it is wrong that two people of the same sex
should be joined together in a civil partnership is direct
discrimination, where no justification is permitted. I hope that the
Minister, who is wiser than me in such matters, can give helpful
clarification that that is the case, even if she does not accept the
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a load of similar cases before the tribunals at the moment. Many
religious organisations see it as their right, as indeed it is, to test
the issue in a series of different matters. It would be helpful if we
could say, from the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in
Ladele, which facts can be generalised to other cases&#151;which
would we, as a Parliament, want to consider the general rule and
intention?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="09061752000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me briefly
rehearse the case. It involves a lady with clear Christian views, who
at the time of the case was charged with providing civil partnership
work as part of her job for Islington council. On the basis of her
beliefs, which were genuinely and sincerely held, she did not want to
conduct the ceremonies or do the registration. There is no doubt about
the fact that it was considered essentially against God&#146;s will
and she did not want any part of it. However, she was pursuing a public
function, and the effect of her position was that she wished the
freedom in her role to discriminate against other
people.</div><a name="09061752000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Employment Appeal Tribunal overturned the judgment of first instance,
and did so in quite stringent and critical terms. It ruled that there
was no direct discrimination and that the indirect discrimination was
clearly justified by the council on the basis of its seeking to prevent
discrimination against gay people and to adhere to its own code of
practice with regard to
non-discrimination.</div><a name="09061752000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
illustration, I will refer to short segments of that judgment, as it
goes to the heart of the amendment and is critical. In paragraph 70,
Mr. Justice Elias, the president of the
Employment Appeal Tribunal, cited the 2007 case of Azmi <i class="I">v.
</i>Kirklees metropolitan borough council, where a Muslim woman
challenged a school&#146;s refusal to let her wear a hijab. That is a
well known case in public policy, and it was debated in the House.
Therefore, it is appropriate that we deal with it in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061752000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2007 case
said:</div><a name="09061752000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;She
was a language support teacher who provided such support for students
with English as an additional language. The school adduced evidence
before the Employment Tribunal to show that language support was more
effective when the teacher&#146;s face was visible. It refused her
request for that reason. Her claim for direct discrimination failed.
(The Tribunal considered that there was clearly prima facie indirect
discrimination, although it was justified on the facts.). The reason
the claimant wished to wear the hijab was her religious belief; the
reason she was not allowed to do so was because it interfered with her
effectiveness as a
teacher.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
motive for the detriment was not her religious belief, but another
motive. That is why my amendment makes clear that it will be difficult
to adduce direct discrimination on the grounds of a manifestation of
religious belief. That objective test will never be
allowed.</div><a name="09061752000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
judge went on to cite the 2008 case of McClintock <i class="I">v.</i> Department
of Constitutional Affairs, where a magistrate alleged that he had been
directly discriminated against for refusing to place children seeking
adoption with same-sex couples. Again, the case was all over the
newspapers and was raised during debate in this House. He
said:</div><a name="09061752000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department insisted that he should apply the law in accordance with his
judicial oath. The claim of direct discrimination failed before the
Employment Tribunal and was not pursued before the EAT... The
President commented that it was &#145;prudent&#146; not to pursue
the issue; the evidence was that anyone who was not prepared to give
effect to the judicial oath would have been similarly treated. His
treatment was not because of his religious beliefs but because of his
refusal to honour the oath. (In fact he was not able to establish that
his objections were based on religious grounds in any
event.)&#148;</div><a name="09061752000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a second key component: anyone who has that manifestation, whether
it is based on religion or not, will be treated in the same way in
cases such as this, whether it be by Islington council or the
Department of Constitutional Affairs. It would be helpful if, during 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>our deliberations, the Committee made it clear to people that they
should not pursue that line of argument in employment
tribunals.</div><a name="09061752000228"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000642"></a>John
Mason:</b> The hon. Gentleman used the word
&#147;oath&#148;, which I think is interesting. Does he agree that
we are looking for a pluralistic society? One example of that is that,
in the courts and in this place, one can either take an oath or affirm.
That gives a bit of flexibility. I do not agree with oaths as a
religious person, although other religious people do, and people of no
religion might also prefer to affirm. Is that not the kind of model
that we should be looking for&#151;one that provides some come and
go, some
flexibility?</div><a name="09061752000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000643"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not think that compliance with the oath is
the relevant factor; it may just have been terms of employment. While I
share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view about oaths, I do not want to be
drawn down that path as I do not think that is the key point in that
case.</div><a name="09061752000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
president of the Employment Appeal Tribunal went on to
say:</div><a name="09061752000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
to considerations of policy, direct discrimination of course cannot be
justified.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a key point and it provides the reason for me raising it with
relation to the clause. As one can never justify direct discrimination,
it is important that these cases are not found to be valid claims of
direct
discrimination.</div><a name="09061752000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
president of the tribunal
continued:</div><a name="09061752000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Tribunal were right to say that the fact that the claimant&#146;s
conduct was the result of her religious beliefs meant that she was
being discriminated against on religious grounds, the employer could
never justify any refusal to accede to an employee&#146;s demands
that he should be permitted to manifest his religious beliefs, however
bizarre they may be. For example, an employee who refused to work on a
particular day or days of the week for religious reasons, or who
insists on praying at various times in the day, or who submits that
carrying out various duties is incompatible with his or her religious
doctrine, could in all cases be entitled to insist on doing these
things and the employer would be obliged in all cases to accede to
these
demands.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, there is not the objective test that is allowed in claims
of indirect
discrimination.</div><a name="09061752000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
president concludes on that point, making reference to Ms Mountfield,
counsel for the
borough:</div><a name="09061752000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
Ms Mountfield put it, the religious belief would be a solvent
dissolving all inconsistent legal obligations owed to the employer.
That plainly cannot be right. Indeed, given in particular the fact that
beliefs may cover a vast range of subjective opinions, the consequences
would be
extraordinary.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee understands my particular concerns about
this.</div><a name="09061752000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
finish on the point about the European convention on human rights. Lord
Hoffmann, in Regina <i class="I">v. </i>Denbigh High School, another school
uniform case, is cited in paragraph 122 by the president of the
EAT:</div><a name="09061752000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Article
9 does not require that one should be allowed to manifest one&#146;s
religion at any time and place of one&#146;s own
choosing&#148;.</div><a name="09061752000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been argued that, regardless of what our discrimination law says,
this should be claimable indirect discrimination to preserve the right
to manifest one&#146;s religious belief in accordance with article 9,
but as members of the Committee will know, the right to manifest
religious belief under paragraph 2 of article 9 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>is qualified, unlike the right to hold the belief itself and to believe
what one wants to
believe.</div><a name="09061752000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
president, in paragraph 127 of his judgment, quotes from the judgment
of Justice Munby in R (E) <i class="I">v. </i>Governing Body of JFS&#151;Jews
Free School&#151;and others, an interesting judgment on other
matters. The president says
that</div><a name="09061752000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is important to realise that reliance upon religious beliefs, however
conscientious the belief and however ancient and respectable the
religion, can never itself immunise the believer from the reach of the
secular law, and invocation of religious beliefs does not necessarily
provide a defence to what is otherwise a valid claim. Some cultural
beliefs and practices are simply treated by the law as going beyond the
pale.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not a criticism of religion or of the lady in the Ladele case; it is
just a statement that we cannot operate proper employment practice if
people can claim direct discrimination on the basis of not being
allowed to do something that their religion tells them to do, having to
do something that it tells them not to do or not being prohibited from
doing something it tells them not to do, which is not what the employer
wants them to
do.</div><a name="09061752000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that the phrasing of the amendment might not be appropriate, but
it is designed to be not only an antidote to the point made in
amendment 36 and new clause 3 by the hon. Member for Glasgow, East but
an invitation to the Minister to give her view on whether the
Employment Appeal Tribunal&#151;which, unlike some other bodies, sets
precedents&#151;is appropriate in this
respect.</div><a name="09061752000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not had time, nor do I think I have the competence, to go into the
two-stage test that the hon. Member for Glasgow, East quoted in detail,
but it addresses the same sorts of issue. It may well be considered in
another place if there is any doubt about the
matter.</div><a name="09061752000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
save time, I will deal with amendment 36 and new clause 3, because I
know that we are keen to make progress. I note that amendment 36 argues
that</div><a name="09061752000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;less
favourable treatment includes placing tighter restrictions on
expression related to religion or belief than on expression not related
to religion or
belief.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that that is helpful, because it is generally in cases of
religion and belief that tensions between the strands arise. It is
unusual for someone to manifest their race in a way that engages the
rights of non-discrimination of people in other strands. It is one of
the features of religion that its beliefs and manifestations can cause
tensions in other strands, and it is our job, and the job of Parliament
more broadly in dealing with the Bill, to get that balance
right.</div><a name="09061752000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that such matters arise in
religion, and religious people must be able to make a claim of indirect
discrimination, but that direct discrimination is not the place for
it.</div><a name="09061752000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 is of even greater concern. It
says:</div><a name="09061752000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
public authority shall permit personal religious expression by those
working for the authority to the greatest extent possible, consistent
with requirements of law and the interests of workplace
efficiency.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the Minister will give her own response, but I think that the argument
will be
that</div><a name="09061752000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consistent
with requirements of
law&#148;</div><a name="09061752000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">makes
the new clause essentially unnecessary, as the law is what we are
debating. If the provision were to mean anything, it would, almost by
definition, fall outside the requirements of the law.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div><a name="09061752000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
needs to be considered, but why should personal religious expression
trump anything else, if that is the intention of the new clause? The
worry is what the new clause would mean and that the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East is essentially saying that there could be a general right
of conscientious objection for doctors not to prescribe contraceptive
pills to women who are not married, not to treat patients who have
alcohol problems on the basis of a religious objection to alcohol and a
series of other
things.</div><a name="09061752000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
strongly believe that that should not be permitted in the delivery of a
public service. It should not be allowed in the medical profession
beyond the existing statutory exemption that applies to abortion
services, which I support. Otherwise, we will end up with a broken-up
health care system, where individuals have to shop around for someone
willing to give treatment that complies with their religious
belief.</div><a name="09061752000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
object of new clause 3 is something we should resist absolutely, for
the reasons that I have given. What effect it would have in practice is
a moot point, given the
caveat</div><a name="09061752000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consistent
with requirements of
law&#148;.</div><a name="09061752000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look forward to hearing the views of other members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09061752000513"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000644"></a>John
Mason:</b> Thank you for the opportunity to speak under your
chairmanship, Lady Winterton. As I did this morning, I want to make it
clear that when I speak on religious matters, I am generally speaking
on my own behalf, not that of my party.</div>
<a name="09061752000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled the
amendments so that the Committee would have an opportunity to discuss
the place of religion in our society. To pick up on the final point
made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, it is not my
desire for religion to trump other protected characteristics, but it is
my desire that religion should not be trumped by them.</div>
<a name="09061752000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 36
would make it clear that it is a form of direct discrimination to treat
religious speech less favourably than non-religious speech. They should
be treated equally. It would reinforce freedom of speech for religious
people by requiring that any restrictions imposed on free speech are
not biased against religion. I hope that most hon. Members will think
that that sounds fair. The question is whether it is
necessary.</div><a name="09061752000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to refer to two cases that have not been mentioned so far.
The first is that of a woman called Caroline Petrie. She follows the
Christian faith and works in Somerset as a nurse. In December last year
she was suspended from work because she offered to pray for a patient.
Although the patient was not upset by the offer, she mentioned it to
another nurse, who reported the matter. Mrs.
Petrie was subsequently accused of breaking nursing guidelines by
failing to</div>
<a name="09061752000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;demonstrate a
personal and professional commitment to equality and
diversity.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a degree of publicity about the case, and eventually the primary
care trust invited the nurse back to work. Is it really harmful for a
nurse with faith, who cares about her patients, to offer to pray for
them? Surely that is not so unacceptable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div><a name="09061752000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000645"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not want to be drawn too specifically into
that case, but I accept that it is germane to the amendment. From the
point of view of a professional body, it is inappropriate for a health
care professional to seek to impose their personal views on a patient.
That is stated clearly in the general medical code of practice for
doctors, &#147;Duties of a
doctor.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is nothing to stop a nurse praying for a patient. It does not have to
involve the patient&#146;s knowledge, and as I understand it,
religious people would argue that it does not weaken the effectiveness
of a prayer if the person prayed for does not know about it. Neither is
it inappropriate for someone who is religious to accede to a request
made to them by a patient if they so choose. However, in strict,
professional terms, it is not appropriate for them to initiate that
conversation, as that is not the job of a health care practitioner but
the job of a priest. I do not understand why the nurse in this case,
who as I understand it had engaged in that practice before and had been
warned about it, could not desist from offering unsolicited prayers to
patients. There is freedom of belief and freedom of prayer, but there
is not the freedom to impose one&#146;s views on a
patient.</div>
<a name="09061752000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000646"></a>John
Mason:</b><b class="B"> </b>I suppose that I have a problem with the
phrase, &#147;seek to impose.&#148; I do not think that
Mrs. Petrie was seeking to impose anything. She
was offering another skill that she had. A similar example would be her
offering some extra bit of care to the patient&#151;if she was an
expert in massage, for example. However, I would have thought that
offering is slightly different from seeking to
impose.</div><a name="09061752000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
idea that prayer is only the job of a priest takes us down an
interesting route as far as religion is concerned. With regard to my
background, we did not believe in priests as such, in that we thought
that all believers were of equal value and could do all of those
things. I would not accept something contrary to
that.</div><a name="09061752000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061752000647"></a><b class="B">Ms
Diane Abbott</b> (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington) (Lab): I
take the opportunity of my Whip&#146;s being absent from the
Committee to intervene. The hon. Gentleman said that offering to pray
was not the same as an imposition, but surely a person who is ill in
bed and feeling vulnerable and unwell is not in a position to debate
whether they want to be prayed over. It is one thing for a patient to
ask for a nurse to pray over them. Personally, I would not want to be
prayed over, willy-nilly, if I was lying ill and frail in
bed.</div><a name="09061752000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000648"></a>John
Mason:</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point. A large part
of nursing is about sensitivity and getting to know the patient, among
other things. I agree that there could be a time when such behaviour
was clearly insensitive, but I suggest that at other times it could be
perfectly sensitive and
helpful.</div><a name="09061752000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have just realised that I did not answer a question asked by the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. Yes, I do believe that prayer
makes a difference, whether the person is or is not there to be prayed
for.</div><a name="09061752000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mrs.
Petrie was not alone in finding that expressing her religion could be
hazardous for her livelihood. In March this year, David Booker, a
Christian charity worker in Southampton, was suspended under diversity
rules after a conversation in which he answered a colleague&#146;s
questions about his religious beliefs on sexual ethics. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>Mr. Booker had worked as a hostel support worker
for four years. His bosses told him that expressing his religious
beliefs on same-sex unions broke the charity&#146;s culture and
diversity code of
conduct.</div><a name="09061752000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, the hon. Gentleman is not a great fan of religion, but he
was generous enough to say on Second Reading that he defended
Mr. Booker&#146;s rights to express, in
moderate terms, his religious beliefs about sexual
ethics.</div><a name="09061752000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000649"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I should explain that, having researched
Mr. Booker&#146;s case as far as I can, on the
facts as I know them, and no Committee member knows the full facts of
either of those cases, which are likely to be fact-specific, the
suggestion is that his conduct broke the code of practice&#151;I do
not think that the case has been decided yet&#151;designed to prevent
people from being harassed. That is really a question of whether the
definition of harassment in work, as reflected in an employee&#146;s
code of conduct&#151;if it was indeed reflected in such a
code&#151;is too broad. Before people dive for suspensions, there
ought to be a little more scope to discuss with a colleague, in
moderate terms, their religious views on a lonely
nightshift.</div><a name="09061752000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede that that is entirely
different from a health care professional dealing with a vulnerable
patient who has not asked any questions at all, and is suddenly asked
whether they are gay, for example. What does he think about a Christian
saying to someone who is gay, &#147;I&#146;ll pray for your
soul,&#148; knowing that position? That is a different matter. I hope
that he recognises
that.</div><a name="09061752000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000650"></a>John
Mason:</b> I accept that the two cases are different. However,
in both cases, whether it is an employee or a patient&#151;or anybody
else&#151;one wants there to be sensitivity. One of the ideas of
Christianity is that one is loving and sensitive, and so on. I have
been in situations where one just would not talk about religion or sex,
or anything, with some fellow employees, because it would be a
disaster, whereas it would be possible to chat with other people in the
pub or during a tea break, for
example.</div><a name="09061752000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the &#147;Pink News&#148; website spoke out in
Mr. Booker&#146;s defence. It ran a piece that
concluded:</div><a name="09061752000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whatever
the outcome of this case, it seems increasingly apparent that people
have more of a right to be gay than to be
religious.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can argue about the details of the law&#151;where it has been and
where it is&#151;but there is a feeling in society that religion is
the poor relation in some
cases.</div><a name="09061752000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment does not seek to stop employers placing limits on speech. It
asks the employers to be even-handed. No employer wants inflammatory
speech in the workplace. I am perfectly comfortable with that as long
as employers are consistent. If they want to ban all divisive
conversation in the workplace, they should apply that ban without fear
or favour, whether the subject is music, politics or football
rivalries.</div><a name="09061752000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
ban on divisive or offensive speech would not fall foul of the
amendment, as long as it was applied consistently to religious and
non-religious speech alike. The amendment is not limited to employment,
but would apply to a definition of direct discrimination on religion or
belief grounds for the whole Bill. It would, therefore, apply to the
actions of all those who were bound by the Bill, such as local
authorities and the police.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div><a name="09061752000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an aside, I
hope that the amendment sends a signal to those local authorities that
think that religious equality means banning Christmas and such like.
They would have to ensure that they were not applying one rule for
expressions of secularism and another for expressions of religion. I
accept that it is already arguable that imposing unfair restrictions on
religious speech constitutes direct religious discrimination, but with
all such cases, if we want to tackle real, live injustices, it seems
that we have to make the obvious more obvious. I could have cited other
cases.</div><a name="09061752000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister accepts that there is evidence of a problem that
needs addressing. As I said, there is a feeling that religion is the
poor relation in equality law&#151;the equality strand that dares not
speak its name. We should not have to state something so obvious in the
definition of indirect discrimination in clause 13, but with cases of
religious people coming off second best when acting fairly reasonably,
it seems that we have to do something to correct the imbalance that has
come about in the interpretation and application of equality
law.</div><a name="09061752000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 underlines what has already been said. It is based on the
guidelines issued by Bill Clinton in 1997 on freedom of religious
expression in the federal work place&#151;that is something
practical, which has been used elsewhere. As I said, I do not want
religion to trump other protected characteristics, I just want us to
have mutual
respect.</div><a name="09061752000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 221 would amend the definition of direct discrimination in
clause 13. An explanatory note cites the case of Lillian Ladele, who
was a Christian marriage registrar. As I understand it, in July last
year, at first instance, the employment tribunal found in Miss
Ladele&#146;s favour. Its ruling listed various acts of direct
discrimination committed against Miss Ladele by Islington council on
the grounds of her religious belief: failing to consider her for
promotion; deciding to discipline her and threatening her with
dismissal; concluding that she had committed gross misconduct; failing
to redress allegations that she was homophobic, and labelling and
treating her as homophobic; disregarding her concerns about her
treatment; and failing to apply its anti-discrimination policies to gay
colleagues who were mistreating her. The employment tribunal also found
that the
council</div><a name="09061752000485"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disregarded
and displayed no respect for Ms Ladele&#146;s genuinely held
religious
belief&#148;</div><a name="09061752000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that it created
an</div><a name="09061752000486"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for her on
grounds of her religion or
belief.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
in December last year, the Employment Appeal Tribunal overturned that
ruling. It accepted that Islington had acted in an improper,
unreasonable and extraordinary
manner:</div><a name="09061752000487"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
were clearly some unsatisfactory features about the way the council
handled this matter. The claimant&#146;s beliefs were strong and
genuine and not all of management treated them with the sensitivity
which they might have
done.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the tribunal ruled that it did not amount to religious discrimination.
It seems extraordinary for the Employment Appeal Tribunal to say that
the young lady was badly treated in connection with her sincere
religious beliefs, but that she should have no redress
whatsoever.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000651"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Gentleman highlights an important issue,
which the Minister could comment on when she responds, based on what
the Employment Appeal Tribunal said. Notwithstanding its ruling, it
made the point that some of the council management had not treated Ms
Ladele properly. Where there are conflicting rights, one solution might
be for the Equalities and Human Rights Commission guidance to advise
employers and other organisations on how to behave and on possible
steps to take to deal with employees sensitively. Rather than turning
into divisive court cases, matters could be resolved internally within
an organisation, with some give and take on the part of the
organisation and the individual. That might be a proper subject for
guidance. Will the Minister reflect and comment on that in her
response?</div>
<a name="09061752000514"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09061752000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000652"></a>John
Mason:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention; he
makes a very good point that we have touched on before: should there be
some kind of purpose clause or something else dealing with conflicting
rights? It is clear to the Committee that such situations have arisen
in the past and could do so again.</div>
<a name="09061752000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Miss Ladele
is taking her case to the Court of the Appeal, and some lawyers believe
that the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruling is so extreme in its
dismissal of manifestations of religious belief that she is likely to
win&#151;we shall see. Enshrining the EAT ruling in legislation as
suggested by amendment 221 is therefore a bit premature. I was slightly
taken aback by the explanatory note to the amendment, which states that
its goal is to ensure
that</div><a name="09061752000488"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one
cannot claim direct discrimination when one is treated adversely solely
on the basis of behaviour stemming from a religious
belief.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
people treated adversely owing to religious behaviour never be able to
claim direct religious discrimination, no matter how gross and unjust?
Surely that is not what we are aiming at. And does that not contradict
the approach of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon in
amendment 217, which states that all behaviour stemming from sexual
orientation should be protected? So behaviour stemming from religion
should not be protected, but that stemming from sexual orientation
should. I do not understand how that is
fair.</div><a name="09061752000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000653"></a>Dr.

<a name="09061752000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000654"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that we can have another
debate on amendment 217. The best way forward is for
Mr. Mason to proceed.</div>
<a name="09061752000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000655"></a>John
Mason:</b> Thank you, Lady Winterton. That is fair
enough.</div>
<a name="09061752000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position
underlined by the EAT ruling on Ladele, under which religious rights
come last, is not acceptable. Whichever side of the argument we are on,
we should not enshrine that position in legislation as suggested in
amendment 221. We should be rebalancing these matters; but I shall
return to that in later amendments.</div>
<a name="09061752000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000656"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> There is a theme to these amendments
and the new clause around safeguarding the rights of religious-minded
people. I must deal with them individually, however, because they all
come from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>different angles. If the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon will
bear with me, I shall deal first with the amendment and new clause
tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East.</div>
<a name="09061752000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is to clause 13, his intention,
as I think that he stated, is to make placing tighter restrictions on
religious expression than on non-religious expression a form of direct
discrimination. However, that is not possible, because direct
discrimination, as defined in clause 13, means treating somebody less
favourably owing to a protected characteristic, such as religion or
belief. It is not about religious expression, but about having the
characteristic of religion or belief. I shall try to dovetail my
argument into the case law that he quoted. Let us imagine that an
employer has a rule against employees expressing or promoting their
religion or belief in the course of their work. Someone who broke that
rule and was dismissed might claim that was less favourable treatment
because of their religion or belief, but if they were dismissed for
inappropriate promotion of their belief, the dismissal would not be
unlawful discrimination within clause 13.</div>
<a name="09061752000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
enough about the Booker case mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, nor about
the other case, but it sounded as though those people were disciplined
for breaking their employer&#146;s internal code of conduct. That is
different from being dismissed because of one&#146;s religion or
belief.</div><a name="09061752000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case of Chondol <i class="I">v.</i> Liverpool city council, an employment
tribunal about this issue, was upheld by the EAT, which said that
the</div>
<a name="09061752000489"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;distinction
between, on the one hand, the Appellant&#146;s religious belief as
such and, on the other, the inappropriate promotion of that belief is
entirely valid in principle (though of course in any case in which such
a distinction is relied on it will be necessary to be clear that it
reflects the employer&#146;s true
reason).&#148;</div><a name="09061752000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
that is different from dismissing someone because they hold a religious
belief. Clause 13 is about providing protection to someone who is
treated less favourably because of their religion or belief, so the
amendment does not fit into it at all, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw it.</div>
<a name="09061752000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense,
the hon. Gentleman could afford to withdraw the amendment anyway,
because most of what he seeks to encapsulate is in his new clause 3,
which is intended to guarantee freedom of personal religious expression
for those who work for a public authority, where those expressions of
belief remain</div>
<a name="09061752000490"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consistent with
requirements of
law&#148;</div><a name="09061752000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
do not have an adverse impact
on</div><a name="09061752000491"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
interests of workplace
efficiency.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not think that the new clause would make any difference to the
protection that is provided to people with a protected characteristic
of religion or belief.</div>
<a name="09061752000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
this a number of times today, but I had better say it every time the
hon. Gentleman alleges these things: we do not think that religious
rights come last or that religion is persecuted. We do not think that
religion is the poor relation or that religious expression is treated
in an inappropriate way. We do not accept for a minute what seems to be
his presupposition that religion is at the bottom of the pile
overall.</div><a name="09061752000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000657"></a>John
Mason:</b> I kind of accept that about the Government&#146;s
intentions, but does the Minister accept that some employers who
perhaps do not have such a detailed knowledge of the law tend to treat
religion as the poor relation?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div><a name="09061752000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000658"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not able to do an instant survey
of employers to find out whether they put religion first, second, third
or 57th. Anyway, what the hon. Gentleman is saying is not that, but
that it is perfectly acceptable to the Government that religion should
come bottom of the heap, and that that is what the Bill does, but I
repudiate that lock, stock and however many smoking barrels there were
in the name of the film&#151;two I think.</div>
<a name="09061752000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the
amendments are well meant, but they would not make any difference
because the Bill replicates the position under current legislation and
maintains a person&#146;s right to hold and to express religious or
non-religious beliefs. The measures are totally in line with article 9
of the European convention, which says that everyone has the right to
freedom of thought, conscience and religion. There is no provision to
prevent people from legitimately expressing their religious beliefs,
whether in the context of employment by a public authority or anyone
else, and we take the need to preserve the rights of religious liberty
and free speech in every sector of society very seriously. Any
legitimate freedom of expression will remain lawful as is required of
us under article 10 of the European convention.</div>
<a name="09061752000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are aware,
as I think the hon. Gentleman is because of the nature of his new
clause 3, that it is important to balance the right of freedom of
religious speech with other protected characteristics. The measures are
not about creating a hierarchy, but seek to strike a balance where
there are potentially conflicting rights, such as between religion and
belief, and sexual orientation. The provisions do contain a test of
reasonableness to apply where there are issues that may be construed by
some as harassment within the workplace: for instance, an atheist
church cleaner offended by crucifixes on display because that is not
the cleaner&#146;s beliefs. An element of reasonableness has to be
injected there, and the Bill does that, so as to balance the rights of
religious expression, and the other
rights.</div><a name="09061752000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment itself acknowledges that some legitimate restriction may be
imposed, perhaps on someone&#146;s right to freedom of religious
expression within the workplace. The new clause includes the proviso
that the liberty has to be consistent with the requirements of law in
the interests of workplace efficiency. We think that balance is already
in the Bill and the right to religious expression is adequately
protected. Amendment 36 to clause 13 should go, because it does not fit
in that place at all. New clause 3 does not add anything and would not
alleviate the concerns expressed, which I am sure we will debate again
when we get to the schedules. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press
both the amendment and new clause.</div>
<a name="09061752000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
221, tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, would
have the effect of clarifying the fact that it is not unlawful to
discriminate against people because of a manifestation of their
religion or belief. In other words, it is not unlawful for A to
discriminate against B because of a manifestation of B&#146;s
religion or
belief.</div><a name="09061752000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Religion
or belief has a wide meaning. That does not mean that each and every
need of a person who has a religious belief must be catered for. The
definition of religion or belief does not include manifestations of
those things. That distinction is present in article 9 of the ECHR,
too. So, somebody might wear particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>clothes, pray at particular times in accordance with the tenets of their
religion, express views, and say or do other things reflecting beliefs.
In such a case, if a person suffered a disadvantage because they had
done or said something related to that, it would not constitute direct
discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief under the current
legislation. It is a mirroring of the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East&#146;s position&#151;perhaps it is the same. It would be
direct discrimination only if a person with different beliefs or no
belief were treated more favourably in similar circumstances. That is
why the EAT in the Ladele case&#151;and courts and tribunals in other
cases&#151;was entitled to reach the conclusions it did. I think
least said soonest mended about that because it is going to appeal, is
it not? We do not want to comment on a live case. However, the Bill
does not change the existing law, so I hope I have satisfied the hon.
Gentleman that the amendment is not
necessary.</div><a name="09061752000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000659"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response;
I did not expect her to accept the amendment or even to recognise it as
necessary. However, what she said was supportive, as far as it
went&#151;given her view that even though we are discussing
legislation, she does not want to comment directly on a case that is
going to further appeal&#151;and I am relieved to hear
that.</div>
<a name="09061752000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
briefly to respond to a couple of points made by the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East, because it is important to clarify that I, for one, do
not believe that religion is&#151;or should be&#151;a poor
relation. Nor is it a form of discrimination that dare not speak its
name. Those sorts of cases are all over the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>. I am not
seeking to damn him, by association, or the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>. Indeed,
I am pleased to see that religious claimants are well resourced to
bring cases through the Christian Legal Centre&#151;that is their
right. I just want us to be clear in advance so that employers are not
dragged into the courts or scared of fighting a
case.</div><a name="09061752000515"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09061752000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am clear that, if there is outrageous behaviour&#151;I do not think
that Islington council was found guilty of this&#151;against someone
on the basis of their religion, that is harassment in employment and is
rightly covered. I have not tabled amendments to weaken the harassment
provisions, although I have some sympathy with the proposal of the hon.
Member for Glasgow, East to change &#147;or&#148; to
&#147;and&#148; in clause 24. I do not think that the fact that one
cannot bring a claim of direct discrimination on the basis of a
manifestation of religion means that employers are at liberty to treat
people badly on the basis of their religious views. In fact, quite the
opposite&#151;and rightly so, in my
opinion.</div><a name="09061752000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of a hierarchy, it is generally not the case that gay
employers or indeed colleagues give religious people a hard time. There
is not that sort of problem with religion being put upon by the other
strands. It is just a question of recognising that sometimes there is
tension. The way the Minister put it is right, and I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000662"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The two amendments are probing, self-explanatory
and explained by the Member&#146;s explanatory statements. I could go
into the history of where the provision first appeared and then did not
appear in a previous version of the regulations, but I will not seek to
do so. I think that the Minister is in a position to respond to the
points on the basis of the amendment as written and the Member&#146;s
explanatory statements, and I look forward to hearing her
response.</div>
<a name="09061752000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000663"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is not a defence, if a gay person,
for instance, is discriminated against, to say, &#147;It is not
discrimination, because I am being myself.&#148; There is no such
defence at all. I hope that that is sufficient for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s purposes.</div>
<a name="09061752000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000664"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I would be grateful if the Minister could directly
answer the question as to why the provision appears in respect of
religion but is not expressed in respect of sexual orientation or
indeed the other strands. I think that she is saying that the same
applies to all the others, even though it is not written. If she is
saying that, that is useful. I would be grateful if she could confirm
that and explain whether there is a reason why that is not included. As
I have admitted, I am not going to press the amendment, but it was
proposed in the spirit of wanting to hear whether there is a reason why
religion and belief is picked out in the way it
is.</div>
<a name="09061752000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000665"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The provision is not new. Clause 13(6)
is there because there are religions with different sections and
different kinds of adherence to the religion. Judaism and Islam, for
instance, encompass a range of views from orthodox to liberal and
moderate. The extremes in differences in outlook and lifestyle are
considerable within those religions, with the attendant potential for
discrimination by some of the followers of another sector. That is why
there is a separate provision for religion.</div>
<a name="09061752000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
reassure the hon. Gentleman that the interest groups that he talks to
regularly, apart from that sector, are not aware of any potential for
difficulty in other strands. Even if they were, the Bill protects that
situation. That is why the religion provision is different from the
others. As a woman, it is no defence say, &#147;There cannot be
discrimination against another woman.&#148; In fact, if I have
discriminated against her, it is discrimination&#151;end

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000666"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister is being helpful and I recognise the
historic basis. She will recall that, in the draft employment
discrimination regulations, nothing was said, and then in another
proposed measure there was a provision that was the opposite to clause
13(5). I think that it was changed to ensure that clause 13(5) exists
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>it is. I merely note in passing that earlier she quite rightly warned us
that, if something is explicit on one ground, there is the
danger&#151;albeit without the helpful explanation she gave of her
view&#151;that it would be deemed not to apply to the other grounds,
simply on the basis of its inclusion here and their absence from the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000669"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> This covers the Malcolm case and there is much
that could be said but, in view of the time, I am going to restrict my
remarks to a description of what my amendment does, rather than
consider the analyses and critiques that have been made of the clause.
I want it recognised that there is concern about the wording of the
clause, particularly in relation to clause 14(1)(b) and its meaning.
Even if I am brief, I hope that the Minister is as full as she can be
in her response, in order that people are satisfied that the Government
understand the concerns raised around this matter. It is clear that
most organisations that support the amendment, or the thinking behind
it, recognise that it is the Government&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>intention to reverse that part of the Malcolm case that had the effect
in our law of depriving some disabled people of protection that they
thought they had. It is not a question of motive; it is one of
drafting.</div><a name="09061752000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
some consideration and discussion with interested bodies and outside
experts&#151;because I am not an expert in the history of
discrimination law&#151;we have put together one long amendment and
withdrawn others that were smaller in order to assist the Committee in
looking at the provision. If we compare the amendment to the clause as
written, the first thing the amendment does is change 14(1)(b). It gets
rid of this difficult-to-interpret
provision:</div><a name="09061752000492"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person (A) discriminates against a disabled person (B) if....(b)
because of B&#146;s disability, the treatment amounts to a

changes it
to</div><a name="09061752000493"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b)
the treatment amounts to a
detriment,&#148;</div><a name="09061752000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
then goes on to qualify that stem subsection. I will be asking the
Minister to explain in her response what is meant by clause 14(1)(b). I
am not going into the various interpretations that have been put on
that. Suffice it to say that my inbox is full of people confused about
the intention behind
it.</div><a name="09061752000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
part of the amendment that introduces new subsection (1A) is intended
to capture what I think the Minister is seeking to do in subsection
(1)(b) but in clearer terms by saying that the detriment may arise from
A treating B</div>

<a name="09061752000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">To save time
I will not read out the view of the Equality and Human Rights

it.</div><a name="09061752000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed

otherwise the same as those of
A.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will understand that that includes within it an important
concept for disability discrimination, which goes to the heart of the
issues raised by the Malcolm case.</div>
<a name="09061752000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (1C)
specifies:</div><a name="09061752000497"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For

am conscious of the fact that new subsection (1C) is a little premature
in its drafting, because it comes before subsection (2). It probably
belongs after and I recognise that flaw in the drafting.</div>
<a name="09061752000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
it is important to recognise that the combination of measures in the
amendment delivers what the Government are seeking to do. I think that
there is no difference between most of the disability organisations and
the Government, the Liberal Democrats and, I believe, the other
Opposition parties with regard to what is being aimed at
here.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div><a name="09061752000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000670"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I took the approach of tabling a probing amendment
simply to prompt discussion rather than because I wanted to remove
paragraph (c), so the hon. Gentleman need not have a long complicated
reason as to why amendment 8 is not very
good.</div>
<a name="09061752000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000671"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is even better to have a short and
uncomplicated discussion, therefore, on amendment 8.</div>
<a name="09061752000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will understand that, for reasons of brevity, I have not gone into all
the background, because I know that the Minister will seek to do that.
I very much look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to
the
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000672"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I will also seek to be brief. The hon. Gentleman
raises a good point. We agree with the concerns that he has expressed.
We have just chosen a different approach, on the basis that we too are
not experts in this area. We have tabled an amendment to remove
paragraph (c). It is a probing amendment, to prompt this discussion. It
also reflects the fact that, at the evidence session, the Minister made
it clear that the Government intend to put the law back to how it was
before the Malcolm judgment, to have that appropriate balance, and they
do not want the law to regress. Given those assurances, therefore, our
amendment was intended to probe the extent to which the clause achieves
the Government&#146;s
aim.</div><a name="09061752000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to touch on a couple of issues. First, I want to ask the
Minister whether the provisions in the clause adequately return the
concept of disability discrimination to the concept that existed prior
to the Malcolm judgment, or is the clause similar but different,
striking that appropriate balance that is talked about in explanatory
note 77? Secondly, I want to get the Government&#146;s view about
whether the safeguards in the clause are sufficient to prevent a
Malcolm-type judgment occurring, which would put us back in the
position that we are in now, requiring a legislative solution all over
again.</div>
<a name="09061752000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman touched on one area that has raised some concern, which is
the knowledge requirement referred to in subsection (2). A concern that
has been raised by, among others, the EHRC relates to whether that
requirement correctly puts the onus on employers and others to take
steps to satisfy themselves about the nature of somebody&#146;s
disability. The amendment that the hon. Gentleman tabled, which the
EHRC supported, was intended to ensure that employers had to take a
proactive approach and could not just express disinterest in these
matters or even remain deliberately ignorant of them, in order to
provide themselves with a defence.</div>
<a name="09061752000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
there is a balance to be struck. Employers and other organisations
cannot be expected to know every facet of someone&#146;s life; it
would not be reasonable for them to take steps to do so. Indeed, taking
steps to do so might be thought to be discriminatory. Does the Minister
think that that balance has been correctly struck, given that some
disability organisations&#151;the Disability Charities Consortium for
example&#151;believe that the provisions are a regression? They
specifically say that the provisions are a regression from the rights
that disabled people currently have under the Disability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>Discrimination Act 1995, under which, they say, there are no knowledge
requirements. It is important for the Minister to cover that point in
her
response.</div><a name="09061752000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister feel that the provisions in the Bill place too great a
faith in the ability of those who hold the duty not to discriminate to
understand that certain behaviour is related to a disability? In other
words, is the level of understanding that someone is required to have
about a disability and consequent behaviour too high for someone to
reasonably have? If the Minister covered those points, I would be
satisfied, which is the purpose of my amendment, as would the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, given what he has
said.</div>
<a name="09061752000516"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="09061752000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000673"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am charmed by the admission from the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that he tabled the amendment
just for the sake of having a discussion. I therefore do not know
whether he wants me to deal with amendment 8. It is fine if he is
content not to press the amendment to a Division; we have had a
discussion, and he has had his share of
it.</div><a name="09061752000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
191 would make significant changes to clause 14. The clause is intended
to address the consequences of Lewisham <i class="I">v.</i> Malcolm, which
frankly made it difficult for a disabled person to show that they had
been subjected to disability-related less favourable treatment. We
introduced clause 14 after consultation. We intended to address the
impact of the case by introducing indirect discrimination for
disability, but key stakeholders convinced us that adequate protection
for disabled people would be achieved only if we had a provision that
emulated disability-related discrimination. We accept that, and we are
convinced that going with provisions outlawing indirect discrimination
regarding disabilities&#151;our intended direction plus what we took
from stakeholders&#151;will achieve the outcome that we want for
disabled people.</div>
<a name="09061752000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
provision in the 1995 Act, clause 14 is intended to provide that the
disabled person demonstrates that they have been subjected to
detrimental treatment because of something connected with their
disability and, secondly, that the duty holder should be able to
justify that treatment. However, we have revised the wording from the
1995 Act because we cannot simply carry it forward as the finding in
the courts said that we did not achieve the protection that we
intended. We therefore dropped the requirement for a
comparator.</div><a name="09061752000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
191 proposes additional and substantial revisions to the drafting and
moves away from the &#147;because of&#148; formulation, which is
also in clause 13 on direct discrimination. I guess that it therefore
seeks a greater distinction between clauses 13 and 14. It would also
link the detrimental treatment to</div>
<a name="09061752000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a reason
arising from B&#146;s
disability&#148;.</div><a name="09061752000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether my next couple of sentences will be entirely
satisfactory for either of the two hon. Gentlemen who have spoken in
this debate, but I am optimistic. We recognise that there could well be
a case for amending clause 14 to make it more distinct from clause 13
and, again&#151;this is very contingent on the evidence that we have
heard&#151;to provide greater clarity that the provision is intended
to cover discrimination that arises from matters connected with a
disabled person&#146;s disability. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>We all agree on the aim and intended outcome, but the Government
acknowledge that we need to look at whether we could express them more
clearly in legislation.</div>
<a name="09061752000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
sufficient for the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, I ask him
to withdraw the amendment so that we can consider whether that
provision, or something else, is the best way to achieve our intention.
If he is not content, I could go on to say why we cannot accept some
parts of his amendment and why it will not fill the
gap.</div>
<a name="09061752000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000674"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> In the same way as when we were speaking to
amendment 133 to clause 13, can the Minister say that she intends to
bring forward either a rewritten clause or an amendment on
Report?</div><a name="09061752000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000675"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Yes, we intend to do so on
Report.</div><a name="09061752000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000676"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I thank the Minister for what she has said so far.
I would like her to briefly set out some of the issues relating to
amendment 191&#151;I promise not to intervene for clarification,
which might reassure her. I will then consider what she has said,
because I think that she makes a very reasonable case. However, given
the amount of effort that has been invested in amendment
191, it would be useful to hear her response to
it.</div><a name="09061752000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000677"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Proposed new subsection (1B) relates to
a situation in which a person subjects a disabled person to
discrimination arising from disability, even if that person has
subjected a non-disabled person to the same detriment, where the
non-disabled person&#146;s circumstances are otherwise the same as
those of the disabled person. The provision in clause 14, however, does
not require a comparator for establishing the detriment because of
somebody&#146;s disability. Instead, it applies where the treatment
to which the disabled person is subjected is detrimental because of the
disability. It is immaterial that somebody else, disabled or not, has
been subjected to the same treatment. Proposed new subsection (1B) is
therefore unnecessary and, indeed, on one view, it goes back to older
law.</div><a name="09061752000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (1C), which would amend the knowledge requirement of
clause 14, would prevent someone from using lack of knowledge as a
defence against discrimination arising from disability unless they
asked the person they intended to subject to a detriment whether they
had a disability. Clause 14 provides for someone to use lack of
knowledge to demonstrate that they did not commit discrimination
arising from disability, but other provisions in the Bill put the
burden of proof on that person to show that they have not discriminated
against a disabled person. Taken together, we think that those
provisions provide appropriate protection for a disabled
person.</div><a name="09061752000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of principle, the Bill does not place an onus on a disabled
person to make a declaration about their impairment, and neither does
it place an onus on those with duties under the Bill to make inquiries
of a disabled person, because we think that it is for the disabled
person to decide whether or not to declare the impairment. Similarly,
we think it inappropriate to require a person to make inquiries to
determine whether somebody is disabled, because it would place undue
burdens on those with duties under the Bill. For example, a pub 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>landlord would be put in an invidious position if they had to ask
everybody they intended to throw out of their premises for drunkenness
whether they had a disability or not. That example writes the issue
quite large, but it makes the
point.</div><a name="09061752000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that the current provisions achieve an appropriate balance
between the rights of the disabled and those of people with duties
under the Bill. Proposed new subsection (1C) would be superfluous and
probably swings too far in a different
direction.</div><a name="09061752000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are our main reservations about the amendment. As I have made clear, we
are open to the disabled lobby&#146;s arguments that we should alter
clause 14 to make it clearer and different from clause 13 in order to
re-register the difference between disability as a protected strand and
all the others. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, we will
do our best to return with something by Report. We will obviously
discuss that with the Committee, but we will take our lead from the
disability
lobby.</div><a name="09061752000358"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000681"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendments will restate the test
for pregnancy and maternity discrimination in clauses 16 and 17. The
current test for pregnancy and maternity discrimination in the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 has led to the current drafting of
the Bill, which states that a woman must not be treated &#147;less
favourably&#148; for reasons of pregnancy or maternity. It is
unclear, on one view, with whom or with what treatment is to be
compared, so we have tried to make the position clearer. It is settled
law that a woman claiming discrimination because of pregnancy or
maternity is not required to compare her treatment with that of an
actual or hypothetical male or female comparator, and the Bill does not
change that. Clause 16(7) will clarify the current position by
introducing an objective standard by reference to which it can be
tested whether discrimination has taken place.</div>
<a name="09061752000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was what
we wanted to achieve by including in clauses 16 and 17 the test of
reasonableness. However, a number of organisations, and several right

<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>intention, would be to weaken the existing protection against pregnancy
and maternity discrimination, which is not what we

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000687"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Amendment 223 is meant to probe the
Government&#146;s reasons for restricting protection for
discrimination on the ground of maternity to 26 weeks after conception.
Amendment 200 does the same for breastfeeding after the age of 26
weeks. I wish to discern why, if the clause is about protecting women
from discrimination, it is time limited. Surely the point of ending
discrimination is just that&#151;to end it.</div>
<a name="09061752000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">During a
brief discussion on breastfeeding in a previous sitting, the Minister
said that it was important for women to breastfeed for six
months&#151;I totally agree. All the clinical advice advocates
breastfeeding for at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>least six months to give a child as much immunity as possible,
particularly against allergies, and it obviously is the most suitable
feed for the transition to solid food. However, I want to move away
from the purpose of encouraging women to breastfeed. As the Minister
said, if we name something in the Bill, that which is not named takes
on a different import. Putting a reference to 26 weeks in the Bill
would therefore give employers and others leave to discriminate beyond
26 weeks. I am sure that that is not the intention, but it gives rise
to a concern. There should be no limit, and I do not want anyone to
discriminate against a woman who is
breastfeeding.</div><a name="09061752000517"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="09061752000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that in Scotland this measure has teeth. If an employer
discriminates in such a way, the law comes down on them very heavily. I
should like to see us following in Scotland&#146;s footsteps in this
regard. I hope that the Minister will clarify why 26 weeks has been put
in the Bill. Outside, we are encouraging breastfeeding, so why are we
giving leave to those who might wish to discriminate against women who
breastfeed post-26 weeks? Surely that cannot be the intention of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061752000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000688"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have discussed this matter before.
Last Thursday, I think, an amendment was tabled to extend protection
against maternity discrimination from 26 to 52 weeks. I will not wholly
repeat my reasons for resisting the amendment, which was withdrawn, but
they apply equally now. However, amendment 223 would have a much more
dramatic effect. Without the proposed deletion, the subsection
states:</div><a name="09061752000499"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person (A) discriminates against a woman if, in the period of 26 weeks
beginning with the day on which she gives birth, A treats her less
favourably because she has given
birth.&#148;</div><a name="09061752000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the subsection is amended, it would effectively say, &#147;A person
(A) discriminates against a woman if he treats her less favourably
because she has given birth ever.&#148; The hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon seems to be nodding his head in favour of that, but
such an amendment would create a separate course of action,
discriminating against a woman who may be 95 at the time because she
gave birth when she was 17. That is going a long
way.</div>
<a name="09061752000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000689"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> My nod was to my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornsey and Wood Green, who asked me whether the Minister was right in
saying that the amendment does have that effect. We have tabled a
probing amendment on the time limit because our previous attempt to do
that was lumped in with a group, so we did not debate whether six
months or two years was the appropriate time. I certainly accept what
the Minister says about the amendment&#146;s effect, but the purpose
behind it&#151;questioning whether there should be a time limit as
low as 26 weeks&#151;is what we hoped she would
concentrate on, having made very effectively the point she has just
made.</div><a name="09061752000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000690"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Therefore, we will not accept the
amendment. We introduced protection against maternity discrimination as
part of the implication of the gender directive, which prohibits
pregnancy and maternity discrimination in accessing and supplying goods
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>services, but does not define maternity. The ordinary meaning implies
recent childbirth, as opposed to parenthood. The conjunction of
maternity and pregnancy in the new directive also implies that
childbirth has been recent. Maternity is intended to refer to a limited
period of time after childbirth. We defined maternity as 26 weeks,
during which time a woman is protected from unfavourable treatment
because she has given birth. We are determined that 26 weeks is an
appropriate period, for the reasons that I gave last week. In a
nutshell, the first 26 weeks after childbirth cover the important first
months when mothers are with their babies, during which time exclusive
breastfeeding brings health benefits to both mother and child. The
period also corresponds, as I said last week, to the period recommended
by the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health for
exclusive breastfeeding.</div>
<a name="09061752000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">Breastfeeding
is probably the most obvious feature of maternity. It would clearly be
maternity discrimination&#151;unfavourable treatment because of
having given birth&#151;to ask someone to leave a restaurant or get
off a bus because she is breastfeeding. However, there are other
aspects of maternity and other cases in which mothers should be
protected from discrimination for a limited time, so if a landlord
refuses to let a room to a woman with a three-month-old baby because he
thinks that a crying baby would make it more difficult for him to let
the other rooms, that is probably maternity discrimination as
well.</div><a name="09061752000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000691"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I would like the Minister to elucidate why
we have taken a different decision from Scotland. Scotland&#146;s
provision runs to two years, which seems much more equitable. Is there
a reason for that
differentiation?</div><a name="09061752000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000692"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Because we are right and they are
wrong,
basically.</div><a name="09061752000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
200 would prohibit unfavourable treatment of a woman because she was
breastfeeding, whatever the age of the child. That is less draconian
than the earlier amendment. It would, in a sense, be a protected
characteristic all on its own, but in fact breastfeeding is, as I have
set out, only one aspect&#151;albeit an important aspect&#151;of
maternity.</div><a name="09061752000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
favour supporting the period of 26 weeks with special protection, for
the reasons I have given about bonding and the health advantages of
exclusive breastfeeding during that time, but that does not mean that
someone who is treated badly because she is breastfeeding a baby of
over six months is unprotected. That will be direct discrimination on
the ground of sex, as clause 13 makes clear. She will need a
hypothetical comparator, but it is usually obvious that she has been
treated less favourably than he would have been. There has been a
successful claim of direct sex discrimination on exactly that basis,
brought by a former mayor in Trafford, which as I recall was about
breastfeeding in the mayoral
limousine.</div><a name="09061752000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000693"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I accept entirely that the Minister&#146;s
motives are well meant, based on a point of principle and rational in
respect of the exclusive breastfeeding period of 26 weeks. However, she
has not made the case that legislation&#151;I think we agreed on this
previously in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>respect of clause 1&#151;should be relied on to send a message about
the importance of breastfeeding during the first 26 weeks. Indeed,
legislation should not be used in that way, especially when there is a
potential detriment, which is that the message might be&#151;if we
are talking about messages, it can work both ways&#151;that because
there is specific, as she put it, protection up to 26 weeks, it only
goes up to 26 weeks. Some people may feel that that is the case. I
agree with the Minister that it does not only go up to 26 weeks, but
the message sent by the legislation, which is not sufficiently
justified in her terms, runs that risk. Therefore, there is a strong
case for her considering carefully whether my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendment in this respect is better&#151;and it replicates the
situation in Scotland, I would
hope.</div><a name="09061752000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000694"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Well, it does not replicate Scotland.
What Scotland has, as I have known throughout but skilfully kept from
the hon. Gentleman for a few moments, is the Breastfeeding etc.
(Scotland) Act 2005 to safeguard the health of children aged under two
by ensuring that they have the right to be fed milk. It covers
breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. Anyone who contravenes that law
commits a criminal offence. I still think that we are right and they
are wrong, but that is the
difference.</div><a name="09061752000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision is not about sending signals exclusively; it is also about
making a point of protecting the particular period that we think is so
important. I am directed to draw hon. Members&#146; attention to
clause 13(7), in which sex discrimination is defined to show that less
favourable treatment of a woman includes less favourable treatment of
her because she is breastfeeding. It also states
that</div><a name="09061752000500"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a case where B is a man, no account is to be taken of special treatment
afforded&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061752000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">anyway,
it does not matter about B in this case. The point is that sex
discrimination is specifically set out to include less favourable
treatment because of breastfeeding, so it certainly is not a case of no
protection after six months. It is different protection but it is just
as effective, for the reasons I have set
out.</div><a name="09061752000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope, again, that hon. Members can be persuaded to withdraw their
amendments on the same point that we discussed last
week.</div><a name="09061752000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000695"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I shall reflect on what the
Solicitor-General has said, but I am not totally at ease with the idea
that a marker will be put down around 26 weeks. I have some concerns
about that, but I take her point that the actual protection is
there.</div><a name="09061752000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000696"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I think it only fair to the
Solicitor-General&#146;s Scottish sister, Elaine Smith MSP, to point
out that in her letter to us she states that the Scottish Parliament
would, as the Solicitor-General said, recognise that the criminal law
is not the best way of dealing with this issue, but that it did not
have the power to deal with it in any way&#151;whether at 26 weeks or
two years&#151;through anti-discrimination legislation because it
does not have the necessary powers to allow such a route to be pursued.
It is only fair to point out that the Scottish MSP who was behind the
private Member&#146;s Bill accepts the point made by the
Solicitor-General, but perforce had to handle the matter in the way
that she did because of the powers of the Scottish Parliament&#151;if
it were to deal with the point separately. It might be argued that it
should not have done that, but it did.</div>

term &#147;proportionality&#148; is bandied about a great deal in
this place, increasingly so because it is the language of parts of the

Nevertheless, in this area, where careful judgments need to be made
around indirect discrimination, as we discussed earlier, it would seem
helpful to our courts, and to complainants and defendants&#151;or
whatever the correct terms are in employment tribunals and county
courts&#151;for us to use the language of community

pm</div><a name="09061752000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to include the concept of necessity, which is not obvious
in the word &#147;proportionate&#148;. The language for many
Community law directives talks about discrimination being
&#147;necessary&#148; as well as &#147;proportionate&#148;. I
do not understand why the mother legislation that we have signed up to
in the treaty uses &#147;necessary&#148;, as distinct from
&#147;proportionate&#148;, if &#147;proportionate&#148;
includes &#147;necessary&#148;. The Government have to have an
almighty justification for not doing what the amendment suggests. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000699"></a>The

means of achieving a legitimate aim&#148;</div>
<a name="09061752000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">to the wording used in
the European directive. We do not think that we should do that; it is
unnecessary and our phrase is better. The phrase in paragraph (d) has
been used for a long time to describe objective justification in
British law and its full meaning is well understood by courts and
tribunals. Means that are &#147;proportionate&#148; must be
&#147;appropriate and necessary&#148;, which are the words that the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon would include. Both concepts
are included in the test that we have used, but they need not be
necessary in the sense of being the only possible means of achieving a
legitimate aim. It is sufficient that the means are not more
discriminatory than any other means that could have been chosen to
achieve the same end. Since the test encapsulates what objective
justification is, the words &#147;objectively justified&#148; would
add nothing at
all.</div><a name="09061752000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a risk that changing language well established in British law could
lead to an excessive narrowing of the scope of justification beyond
what the directive requires, because that change could be&#151;and
&#147;necessary&#148; has been&#151;interpreted very strictly by
our courts. However, they are obliged to interpret the legislation
compatibly with the directive and they know how to do that. In a
nutshell, this is well-tried and well-used language that everybody
understands. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal adds nothing, so we
see no point in the amendment. Therefore, we respectfully invite him to

state that there could be more favourable treatment in relation to the
protected characteristic of disability. However, the Minister
generously offered to work with the DCC to look at the wording of
clause 13 and to return on Report, and this proposal essentially covers
the same
argument.</div><a name="09061752000420"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000704"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Amendment 9 would remove disability
from the list of protected characteristics. I know that the hon.
Gentleman does not intend to do that, because it would be detrimental
to disabled people and would deny them protection from indirect
discrimination, as is the current situation. That is contrary to the
key aim of the Bill, which is to strengthen protection where gaps exist
and to streamline it. We are filling a gap by putting disability into
clause 18. As we streamline the legislation , we are bringing
disability into line with other protected
characteristics.</div><a name="09061752000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have recently said, when we looked at the response to the Malcolm
judgment, we consulted on giving protection from indirect
discrimination. About half of the responses favoured that, but we were
persuaded that doing so would not be enough. That is why we are
introducing protection from discrimination arising from disability. We
were also convinced that protection from indirect discrimination would
help to prevent systemic forms of discrimination against the disabled.
One can readily think of examples, such as an employer who makes a
practice of requiring all management trainees to go on an Outward Bound
course. That would be indirectly discriminatory towards a particular
group of disabled people who work for the company. We think it is right
to put disability in the clause to deal with such
situations.</div><a name="09061752000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a draft EU directive that, if passed, as we think it will be, will
protect people from discrimination on the grounds of disability, age,
sexual orientation and religion or belief in areas beyond employment.
That will cover access to goods and services and the functions of
public bodies. It includes a provision that would require us to provide
specific protection from indirect discrimination for all protected
characteristics. That is still under negotiation, but the principle of
indirect discrimination is well established and will inevitably go 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>forward. We have included disability in the list to ensure that we give
disabled people an appropriate level of protection and to meet that
anticipated
requirement.</div><a name="09061752000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
198 makes it plain that introducing protection against indirect
discrimination for disability does not prevent disabled people from
being treated more favourably. As the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged,
we have gone over that ground. I hope that I can short-circuit the
debate by saying that we agree that we must make plain the asymmetric
approach towards disabled people that it is intended will be adopted
under the Bill and that we will do that by redrafting clause 13. That
is preferable to the adoption of amendment 198. If he is satisfied with
that, I will not pick holes in the
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000705"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I
am comfortable with her suggestion on amendment 198. As I said, we have
discussed that issue and she has been constructive about how she will
approach that by looking at clause
13.</div><a name="09061752000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
9 is a probing amendment. The Minister has explained what extra
benefits disabled people will have through the inclusion of that
protected characteristic in clause 18. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09061752000426"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09061752000427"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000706"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I beg to move amendment 224, in
clause 18, page 13, line 23, at
end add &#145;pregnancy and
maternity&#146;.</div><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">This is to probe why pregnancy
and maternity are omitted from the list of protected characteristics
for indirect
discrimination.</i></div><a name="09061752000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment probes why pregnancy and maternity are omitted from the list
of protected characteristics for indirect discrimination. I understand
that there is an argument that by definition it would be indirect
discrimination on the basis of gender, but I would argue that it
probably would do no harm to have a list that is consistent throughout
the Bill. Therefore, the question at least deserves an answer that is
not totally dismissive. In order to help us make progress, I will leave
my remarks at that
point.</div><a name="09061752000429"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000707"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> But the hon. Gentleman none the less
answers his own question. A woman who is indirectly discriminated
against because she is pregnant, or is a new mother would, by
definition, be able to make a claim of indirect sex discrimination,
since any provision or practice which disadvantages pregnant women or
new mothers is disadvantageous to women. That is the current position
and we are not aware of any difficulty, so we just go forward with the
law as it is. I hope that that satisfies
him.</div><a name="09061752000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000708"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I note what the Minister says and I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09061752000431"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000709"></a>John
Mason:</b> I beg to move amendment 37, in
clause 18, page 13, line 23, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) If the
protected characteristic is religion or belief, for the purposes of
subsection (1), and subject to subsection (2), a provision, criterion
or practice is discriminatory if it requires persons of B&#146;s
religion or belief to act in a way which contravenes the stated
doctrinal or ethical teachings of the religion or
belief.&#146;.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I"></i><i class="I">Makes clear that requiring a person to act contrary
to the accepted teachings of his or her religion or belief is a form of
indirect discrimination. N.B. Indirect discrimination is still
permitted if it is proportionate&#151;see Clause
18(2)(d).</i></div><a name="09061752000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
other Members, I am happy to make my arguments brief, especially as we
have already touched on some of this. I thank the Solicitor-General for
her assurances that she sees religion as one of the strands and that it
is not being disadvantaged. It is good to have that on the record from
her previous statements and I take those reassurances at face value.
The point of the amendment is the link between religious belief and
behaviour. We have touched on that, both in sexual orientation
behaviour and with regards to religion. I argue that it is very hard to
separate the two, although I accept that to some extent there are
differences.</div>
<a name="09061752000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
how far the state should go in regulating a religion and religious
behaviour is hard to determine, but we need to get the balance right.
Clearly, there are examples of the state going too far and, for those
who are familiar with the Bible and Daniel and the lion&#146;s den,
Daniel was told not to pray in public. That was going too far: he went
into the lion&#146;s den, but he was saved. At the same time, I
completely accept that it should not be the case that every individual
just claims religion as an excuse for absolutely anything. That is why
we are not saying it would be a total exemption, but we are talking
about things contravening the stated doctrinal or ethical teachings of
the religion or belief, which I hope protects against people just
having their own, individual, very strange ideas. That is probably
enough just to make the point and I accept that this is building on
what we have been saying before.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000710"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I urge the Committee to reject the amendment,
obviously in polite terms, in the spirit of the stage of the debate
that we have reached. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> For several reasons.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Islington, South and
Finsbury says that if I give reasons in a Public Bill Committee, that
might make some Members change their minds. Well, they could do it on
any basis, but it is
important&#151;</div><a name="09061752000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000711"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> I do not want the hon. Gentleman to
misunderstand me, but I just want to make it clear that he may well
find that he is pushing at an open door. Perhaps we could, given the
hour, appeal the light and go home.</div>
<a name="09061752000437"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000712"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point, but I want to
make a couple of brief points. It is not satisfactory to argue for
special protection for religion while at the same time arguing that it
should be treated the same in every other way. That is asking for
special treatment on the basis of doctrinal and ethical teachings. In
fact, religion already benefits, because political statements of view
receive no protection at all under discrimination, whereas arguably
quite contentious views founded on religion benefit from some
protection albeit, as we know from our previous debates on direct
discrimination, not as many.</div>
<a name="09061752000438"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000713"></a>John
Mason:</b> If the hon. Gentleman would like to introduce an
amendment suggesting that political beliefs should be protected, I
would be very supportive.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000714"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The harassment provisions in employment give
protection for the treatment of people manifesting their religion in a
way that is not available for people who are manifesting their
political, aesthetic or cultural opinions. Religion and, indeed,
philosophical belief&#151;it is not exclusive to religion&#151;is
already given status. The hon. Gentleman need not worry that it is
being treated like anything else. The fact that it is often in
scripture or ethical teachings is, rightly or wrongly, acknowledged in
the law. We should be careful; Scientology would be covered by his
proposal, as would a whole series of other religions, sects and cults.
The hon. Gentleman needs to be careful in what he is asking us to
endorse. Secondly, his explanatory statement says:</div>
<a name="09061752000504"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Indirect
discrimination is still permitted if it is
proportionate&#148;</div>
<a name="09061752000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">under the test which we
have already discussed, however it is framed, of clause
18(2)(d).</div>
<a name="09061752000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we
have the same problem, as the hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways.
If the proposal means anything&#151;and the requirement that the
amendment should be subject to clause 18(2) is the relevant
issue&#151;it does not add any additional protection and should not
be accepted because it makes no difference. If it is his intention that
subsection (2) should be diluted in some way, in respect of something
that just happens to be</div>
<a name="09061752000505"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;stated
doctrinal or ethical
teachings&#148;</div><a name="09061752000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">then
for the reasons I have given, I urge the Committee to oppose the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09061752000443"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061752000715"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I imagine what the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East is looking for is legitimisation or conscientious
objection, but the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has put
his finger on the point that clause 18 allows justification for
something like that in some circumstances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div><a name="09061752000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the hon.
Member for Glasgow, East seeks to say is that a provision, criterion or
practice is discriminatory if it requires somebody of a religion or
belief to act in a way that contravenes the stated doctrinal or ethical
teachings of the religion or belief. From the point of view of
protecting the religious, we do not think that that is necessary. It
would be potentially unlawful under the Bill for a provision, criterion
or practice to require an orthodox Jew to work on a Saturday, for
example. The question would be whether such a requirement could be
justified under clause 18(2)(d) in particular circumstances.</div>
<a name="09061752000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifying
that one form of behaviour which is clearly covered by the definition
is to be regarded as indirectly discriminatory is an odd thing to do,
because it is already covered. As we rehearsed on an earlier provision,
it may raise questions about others and it might be unclear whether a
provision would be regarded as indirectly discriminatory if it
contravened beliefs which are not doctrinally or ethically linked to a
religion, but which are nevertheless commonly held. I think the hon.
Gentleman is familiar with that argument. Putting it in a nutshell,
this would muddy the waters, and it would not give any enhanced
protection to the religious. The best way to deal with it is to put in
the unamended definition of indirect discrimination, make it applicable
to religion or belief as we do already, and that is
that.</div>
