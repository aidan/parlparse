<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000384"></a>The
Chairman:</b> After our evidence sessions of last week, we now
move to more familiar
territory.</div><a name="09012758000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012758000385"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): On a
point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I appreciate that the nature
of the Bill means that there is no formal programme motion debate, and
I seek your guidance on how we might address a particular issue. As you
are aware, the Bill has had some high-profile attention as a result of
news stories in the press. Will I be able to ask the Minister for Local
Government whether he has been approached by Members of the other place
about the matters before
us?</div><a name="09012758000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000386"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I must stop the hon. Gentleman. The
Programming Sub-Committee has set a timetable for this Committee. The
matter that he raises has absolutely nothing to do with the contents of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="09012758000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000387"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Atkinson. I do not wish to criticise the Chair or answer back, but my
point is relevant. The Government&#151;like any Government&#151;are
well aware that they can get their business through the Commons without
any great difficulty. Therefore, we go through the whole process that
we have seen in the Commons. The concern is that in the Lords, where
there is no majority&#151;at least as the Lords is currently
constituted&#151;amendments can be tabled that have a lot more sway
than is, perhaps, the case here. That is the reason why I wish to put
the issue on the
record.</div><a name="09012758000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000388"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. It is clear that nothing in the Bill is
relevant to what the hon. Gentleman is saying. As to what happens in
another place, that is up to another place, and is equally irrelevant.
I appreciate what he is trying to do, but it is not in
order.</div><a name="09012758000013"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000391"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I take this opportunity to formally welcome you
to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, and to thank you for the
excellent way in which you conducted our evidence sessions. I am sure
that you will agree that they were very useful, as well as informative
and helpful to us. That leads us nicely to the matters that we will be
discussing this morning and in future
sittings.</div><a name="09012758000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Solihull, goes to the heart of the business community&#146;s concerns
about the Bill. As we heard in the evidence sessions, there are grave
concerns about the ability of businesses to influence the decision on
whether a supplement is enacted in their area. The Minister of State
has been keen to point out that the consultation is a key part of the
Bill, and that is welcome, but as we heard time and again, there are
concerns that that does not go far enough. A ballot would be the
ultimate reassurance to the business community that the extra
contribution that it is asked to make will be put to what it believes
is a good
use.</div><a name="09012758000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would include the business community in deciding what is of
recognised benefit and interest to an area by making sure that the
majority of that community is satisfied that the projects funded by the
supplement will promote economic development. As it stands, only the
levying authorities need to be satisfied of that. It is important to
make it clear in the Bill that, since the supplement will be a key
contribution by businesses, they have a role in the consensus on moving
forward.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div><a name="09012758000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 5
to 7 refer specifically to ballots, and insert the need for a ballot in
all cases. As we went through our evidence sessions, one issue emerged
time and again: while the business community had concerns about the
timing of the Bill, they were prepared to accept that, where important
projects were being taken forward in the local area, business should
make its contribution. We heard that this form of property tax was
perhaps not ideal and that there were issues regarding owners of
property&#151;as opposed to tenants&#151;and how they could make a
contribution. The fundamental concern was that the business community
should have the right, through a ballot, to sign up to, or reject, any
proposal.</div>
<a name="09012758000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
British Retail Consortium was asked about a ballot, Jane Milne
said:</div>
<a name="09012758000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is, as far as we are concerned, the single most crucial step as to
strengthen the safeguards. There are already safeguards within the
Bill, but we do not feel that they go far
enough.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Business Rate
Supplements Public Bill Committee</i>, 20 January 2009; c. 19,
Q82.]</div><a name="09012758000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
heard from the British Chambers of Commerce. Mr. Frost was
asked whether it would be more reassuring to include a ballot. He
said:</div><a name="09012758000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Yes,
to use that terminology, it is far less scary, because it gives the
business community the ability to become involved. The worry with the
other programmes that I have mentioned is that they would be seen as an
imposition.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Business Rate
Supplement Public Bill Committee</i>, 20 January 2009; c. 24,
Q99.]</div><a name="09012758000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr.
Grail, representing British BIDs, expressed concern that where a
proposal for a business improvement district was being developed, if
there were no ballots on a business rate supplement in the same area,
businesses might feel that the only chance they had to prevent being
overburdened by additional taxation would be to reject the BID. There
were concerns that the lack of a ballot on a business rate supplement
might influence how people would vote on a BID in the same
area.</div>
<a name="09012758000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our
earlier sessions we heard that many Members, of all parties, felt that
the BID process has been constructive and useful, and has achieved a
great deal in areas where it has been enacted. Conflict between a BID
process and a business rate supplement, if there were to be no ballot
for a BRS, could be a crucial issue.</div>
<a name="09012758000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Solihull and I were also keen to show through our
amendments that we feel that Crossrail is a different case, so it was
interesting to hear the evidence from the Confederation of British
Industry&#151;it feels that Crossrail is separate, as well. Karen Dee
said:</div><a name="09012758000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Businesses
will vote for something if they see that it is of benefit to
them.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Business Rate
Supplements Public Bill Committee</i>, 20 January 2009; c. 39,
Q163.]</div><a name="09012758000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed the issue then and the feeling was that Crossrail is
different: the process has gone on for a very long time and there has
been a great deal of debate; and there has been a Bill through
Parliament allowing us to look at the issues very closely. For that
reason, we concluded that the provision for a ballot in all cases
should not apply to
Crossrail.</div><a name="09012758000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will want to reply to that and say that we
should either have a ballot in all cases or in none, but it is clear to
Opposition Members that Crossrail is a unique project. Given its scale,
scope and national importance, and the clear expressions of will and
involvement by all parties throughout, it should be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>treated separately. That is why our amendments would provide for a
ballot in all cases other than Crossrail, including all new
projects.</div>
<a name="09012758000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key issue
is to take the business community forward with us. The Local Government
Association felt very strongly that it would be able to do so through
debate and consultation with the local business community. I hope that
that would be the case in many projects and that a ballot would deliver
a yes vote, or would not even be approached, as there was already that
consensus and the feeling that everybody was moving forward together.
However, there still seems to be a concern in the business community
that, without the ability to call for a ballot to focus
everybody&#146;s mind and ensure that the process is as constructive
and inclusive as possible, the consultation might not prove as
effective. So I am certainly very happy to commend the amendment to the
Committee. From our point of view, the significant amendments in the
group are 5 and 6, which would make a ballot compulsory, no matter what
the size of the contribution being made by the BRS to the
project.</div>
<a name="09012758000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000392"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman indicate who would qualify
for such a ballot? I do not wish to do the Government&#146;s arguing
for them, but it seems that this is a rather complicated situation.
Would the qualification be on the basis of being a leaseholder at a
particular time, a freeholder or an owner of property, or of having a
particular interest? As he will know, in relation to the existing
business vote in the City of London, in my constituency, it is only
relatively recently that the qualification has gone beyond simply those
in partnership and sole practitioners of businesses to a corporate vote
with a complicated structure. How does he envisage the ballot and the
qualification for it working?</div>
<a name="09012758000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000393"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> We are not seeking to change the conditions in
the Bill about who would qualify for a ballot, and when we come on to
talk about thresholds, we will discuss those on whom the rate will be
imposed. The issue is that the Bill defines a set of circumstances that
would trigger a ballot, which is when a certain percentage&#151;30
per cent. or so&#151;or more of the total scheme budget is to be
funded by the BRS. Below that proportion, it will not be necessary to
hold a ballot. Given the evidence that we heard and the written
submissions that we had from the business community, there is a great
deal of concern that the provision does not go far enough and there
should be a ballot in all circumstances, and that is what my amendment
seeks to
introduce.</div><a name="09012758000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will therefore be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response. I
suspect that I can anticipate some of the arguments because we
rehearsed them a little during the exchanges&#151;I hesitate to call
them debates&#151;in our evidence sessions. I will obviously wait to
hear what the Minister has to say, but I hope he will feel that the
evidence that we heard in our earlier sittings is convincing enough to
move to having a ballot in all circumstances. If I am not entirely
satisfied, I may well seek to press some of the amendments to a
vote.</div>
<a name="09012758000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012758000394"></a><b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): Welcome back to the
Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I am delighted to see that it is as
sunny in London as it was in the north-east of England when I was there
yesterday.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div><a name="09012758000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have much
sympathy with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for North
Cornwall. In broad terms, my colleagues and I are minded to support it
but we have tabled our own amendments. They are grouped here in a
different formulation but they would achieve essentially the same
objective. I shall speak to those as well as to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment.</div>
<a name="09012758000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that the amendment concerns two of the
Bill&#146;s key issues. Principally, there is the question of whether
there should be a compulsory ballot in all cases. My hon. Friends and I
adopt the stance that to meet the Government&#146;s objectives of
ensuring that the BRS system has credibility in the business community,
a ballot is essential in all cases. The threshold that the Government
propose&#151;that a ballot should be required only when the BRS will
raise more than one third of the total cost of the scheme&#151;seems
to us, with respect, a somewhat arbitrary figure. One can think of
schemes, particularly some of the joint schemes, that are proposed for
transport infrastructure where a quarter or a fifth of the total cost
would be a very large sum. In the evidence sessions, Government Members
talked about transport schemes for bridges and tramways&#151;that is
substantial capital investment&#151;and a quarter or a fifth of the
cost would be a very substantial burden to place on
businesses.</div><a name="09012758000352"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09012758000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be, if the case is convincingly made, that businesses will consider
it a worthwhile investment, and I do not have an objection to that.
That is why my hon. Friends and I have always supported the concept of
the business improvement district and would be happy to see it
implemented further. The key test, however, is that businesses can buy
in.</div>
<a name="09012758000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
particularly concerned in the present economic climate about the
potential imposition of large levies without a ballot. We are worried
that, without a ballot, there will not be the necessary discipline on
local authorities that choose to take up a BRS scheme, although in the
current climate how many schemes are likely to be proposed is
questionable. Witnesses from the Local Government Association could not
think of any bodies apart from the Greater London authority proposing a
project. However, as and when the schemes arise, it would be a useful
discipline and serve to concentrate minds if local authorities knew
from the outset that they would have to take the business community
with them and produce something that is acceptable to a majority of
them through the double-lock mechanism, which is a sensible
safeguard.</div><a name="09012758000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Minister for publishing the consultation guidance,
as he promised he would, last Friday afternoon. I do not disagree with
the aspirations that it sets out for the early involvement of the
business community, but the fact is&#151;I speak as one who has been
involved in local government for much of my career&#151;that some
local authorities are more proactive and assiduous than others about
involving their business communities. A mechanism that requires local
authorities to engage with their local businesses, because they need
businesses&#146; votes at a very early stage, would surely be more
effective.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000396"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I shall give the Committee a highly publicised
example that is now in the process of being overturned. When the
previous Mayor of London chose to consult on the western extension of
the congestion charge, he went through every statutory hoop and
requirement that he was obliged to go through in such a way as to be
proof against judicial review. It was clear that the businesses, and
indeed residents, did not want the extension to be imposed, but the
regime, which is the same as the one that will be in place for BRS,
enabled him to ignore the opposition and go ahead. The fact is that,
under the current rules, a situation could arise where a local
authority&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I think the Minister wants to
intervene.</div><a name="09012758000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000397"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b> I am trying
to follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s logic. Given the example that he
cites, his logic seems to be moving towards the proposition that there
should be a ballot in London, as elsewhere, if there is to be a BRS.
That appears to contradict some of the amendments that he will speak to
later.</div><a name="09012758000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000398"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for raising that
point, but if he follows my argument, he will see that that is not the
case. I shall discuss later why Crossrail is a different case. Under
the present regime, if a local authority has the political will to
impose a scheme, it is not obliged to take the majority of businesses
with it. The evidence and the example that I cited demonstrate that
that was the case under the previous Mayor of London.</div>
<a name="09012758000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
in the Bill and the existing arrangements give local authorities the
opportunity to decide, by a narrow political majority, to implement a
scheme, even though it might have been rejected by businesses or there
is clear evidence of their opposition. It would be better to test the
proposal and get businesses on board. I hope that the hon. Member for
Halton is correct in his aspiration that local authorities will not go
down a route that will bring them into conflict with local businesses,
but localism always carries that risk. Businesses in the present
climate need to have some protection against
that.</div><a name="09012758000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point that worries many businesses and is flagged up in the
consultation document is that, without the ability to have a ballot,
there is a risk of an accumulation of burdens being placed on them. We
will come to automatic set-offs for BID levies later, but the BRS and
BID schemes, as well as the possibility of community infrastructure and
workplace parking levies, could impose a cumulative burden. A real
concern in the business community was demonstrated throughout the
evidence sessions about that cumulative burden being, for many
businesses, the straw that breaks the camel&#146;s
back.</div><a name="09012758000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
all those reasons, if the Government are genuine about giving local
authorities a power to raise revenue that is truly and demonstrably
additional, it is important that the local businesses who
pay&#151;who may pay substantial sums&#151;are able to have a say
on whether they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>convinced that there is genuine additionality. If
the case is made out and the local authority engages with its business
community from the start, it is much more likely to get a result that
everyone buys into, which would be to everyone&#146;s
advantage.</div><a name="09012758000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Government will think again about the amendments. I
cannot for the life of me see why they would not. The Minister will
probably say that he has come to a pragmatic and rational decision that
a third of the cost is a reasonable ballpark figure for the threshold.
It might be, but he could equally say the same about a quarter or a
fifth, because an element of arbitrariness is inevitable in any
threshold. Some sort of de minimis exception might be better, and the
Minister conceded that we could discuss that. If there is not to be
such an exception, there should be a
ballot.</div><a name="09012758000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
why we do not take that stance on Crossrail, I am perfectly happy to
say that Crossrail is and should be an exception, for the perfectly
good reason that Crossrail is a project that has been discussed and
consulted on within London among business rate payers and voters.
London has had an election&#151;a democratic process&#151;in which
all the major party candidates standing for Mayor were committed to
Crossrail and the funding package for the project. Londoners had a
chance to have a say on
Crossrail.</div><a name="09012758000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000399"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Sadiq Khan):</b> Will the hon.
Gentleman remind us how many people with businesses inside London but
who live outside London had a say in that
decision?</div><a name="09012758000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000400"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> It is interesting that the Under-Secretary says
that, because of a point that struck me during the evidence sessions.
Is he hinting that there should be the reintroduction of the business
vote in such circumstances? I am sure that his hon. Friends would not
like that. My answer to him is that not only was there a democratic
election in London, but all the representative business bodies
supported the Crossrail funding package. Equally, those same people
said, &#147;Although we accept that it works in London for Crossrail,
we do not want it imposed
elsewhere.&#148;</div><a name="09012758000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000401"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> If my hon. Friend will allow me to half-answer the
Under-Secretary&#146;s question, of course a significant number of
businesses in the City of London, with people who are employees or
partners of the business but who live outside, were able to have their
say. I accept that it was by no means an entirely satisfactory
arrangement, but an important cross-section of the business community
had its say&#151;including those in the business community who live
outside London. The City of London corporation, as the Under-Secretary
and my hon. Friend will be well aware, keenly supports Crossrail,
albeit not without making certain criticisms&#151;for example, about
the route, which we shall discuss later. None the less, in that rather
unsatisfactory way that we have in the context of the corporation, the
business vote has had a certain say. In fairness, I should say that the
business community is very much in favour of Crossrail, and wants it to
be built as soon as
possible.</div><a name="09012758000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000402"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that. I accept
his point that, inevitably, unless return to the &#145;50s system of
a separate business vote, which no party 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>is proposing, that arrangement is imperfect.
However, in a large area of London, there was the ability for a great
number of Londoners, including a number of business rate
payers&#151;not all, of course, because some live outside the
boundary&#151;to have a
say.</div><a name="09012758000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, because of how the Crossrail process has been gone
through&#151;by the previous Mayor and the current on, as well as the
candidate for the Liberal Democratic party and others&#151;there has
been a genuine attempt at dialogue and engagement across the political
parties and a broad political consensus within London. That was
reflected in support for the project before the scheme was brought
forward by the business community&#151;London First, the London
branch of the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI supported a BRS
as part of the funding package. They were not saying that it was an
ideal measure, but in the case of Crossrail, they said that they were
prepared to chip in and that that was a mechanism through which they
could move the project forward. That is a pragmatic and sensible enough
view, but it does not mean that that approach is appropriate anywhere
else in the country.</div>
<a name="09012758000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">What amused
me in part of the Under-Secretary&#146;s comment is that he seemed to
present my hon. Friends and I as people who are denying the rest of the
country a great opportunity. I suggest that what we are seeking to do
is to save the rest of the country a potentially great burden. The
Government are trying, through characteristic sleight of hand, to take
the consensus and agreement that a BRS scheme is an appropriate
mechanism for Crossrail and use it as a stealth device to increase tax
burdens elsewhere in the country, where we know from the LGA there is
no demand. There is a demand in London&#151;the Mayor of London
submitted evidence saying why that was so, as did London business.
There is no such evidence elsewhere.</div>
<a name="09012758000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000403"></a>John
Healey:</b> Stealth tax? I am struggling with that. It is a
common phrase that we hear from the party opposite, but how can the
hon. Gentleman describe a business rate supplement as a stealth tax
when there has been a public report from Sir Michael Lyons, a White
Paper, and parliamentary scrutiny in both Houses of the legislation? If
a local authority believed that a business rate supplement was
appropriate for its area, there would be lengthy discussion, formal
consultation and, in some cases, a ballot. I simply cannot see how this
measure merits the description of stealth tax, which surely implies
something that people were not aware of, not expecting and were
suddenly confronted with. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that, for
the purposes of serious scrutiny, that is simply not helpful or
accurate?</div><a name="09012758000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000404"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am surprised that the Minister departs from his
normal precision in following my argument. I appreciate that he may
have had one or two little distractions over the weekend, but perhaps
he could follow my argument carefully. I accused the Government, and I
do not resile from the accusation, of using the consensus on the use of
the BRS as part of the Crossrail funding mechanism as a stealth device
to then impose a tax-raising power elsewhere in the country, where
there is not the same level of demand as has been demonstrated in
relation to London and Crossrail.</div>
<a name="09012758000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That can be
described as a stealth device for this reason: although there has
certainly been debate in the broader context of Lyons and the White
Paper about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>the BRS, until the Government published the Bill,
there was nothing to suggest that they intended to make the link
between the funding of Crossrail, which has had its own separate Act of
Parliament, and rolling out the BRS power elsewhere in the country.
That was not necessary; the two could have been decoupled. The
Government could have introduced a Bill to fund Crossrail and then a
separate Bill to consider the broader principle of rolling out BRS
elsewhere in the country. That is the stealthiness of which I accuse
the Minister.</div>
<a name="09012758000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012758000405"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman presents his position as defending the rest of the country
from the imposition of a burden. I shall give him the benefit of the
doubt and assume that he does not see his role as a London MP as
imposing an unreasonable burden on London, because that would be the
logic of his position. He clearly does not think that, because he
thinks that Crossrail will deliver benefits which are such as to
outweigh the cost on business of paying the BRS in London. Why does he
believe that a similar arrangement should not be possible outside
London?</div><a name="09012758000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000406"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> With respect, the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
logic is flawed. In the case of Crossrail and London, where there is a
broad consensus, it is perfectly reasonable to go down a route that was
established before the Bill was introduced: there was commitment and
sign-up to a BRS part-funding the package for Crossrail. However, the
Government then coupled the Crossrail project with rolling out the
broader Lyons proposals, which was not necessary.</div>
<a name="09012758000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do I say
that we are protecting part of the country from a burden? I say it
simply because, without a ballot in all cases, there is the prospect of
a BRS being imposed on businesses in areas where there is no demand. In
London, the consensus had arrived before the Bill appeared. What the
Government are doing is using inverse logic&#151;saying that because
there is agreement in London without a ballot, we do not need a ballot
anywhere else. That is the false logic that is being deployed in the
debate, not any argument put by the
Opposition.</div>
<a name="09012758000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09012758000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000407"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Will my hon. Friend make it clear that if we were
discussing the Bill 10 years ago&#151;in other words, before the
Crossrail Bill had been considered&#151;we would have been arguing
just as forcefully for a ballot on Crossrail? However, we are now a
long way down the line in the Crossrail process. The amendments are
therefore geared towards involving the business community through a
ballot system. As my hon. Friend rightly says, there is a certain level
of arbitrariness regarding the threshold&#151;the proportion of the
overall spend&#151;before a ballot is held, but we want to involve
business as far as we can through a ballot.</div>
<a name="09012758000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crossrail is
a bit of a red herring. I can understand why Government Members are
making a lot of it, but the reality is quite straightforward, because
we are so far down the line, for want of a better phrase, in relation
to Crossrail. Had the Bill been introduced 10 years ago, Crossrail
would clearly have been part and parcel of the provisions on ballots
that we are now trying to establish.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div><a name="09012758000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000408"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I very much agree with my hon. Friend. We have to
be realistic as far as Crossrail is concerned. We are where we are, and
if we had not adopted the stance that we did in relation to Crossrail,
no doubt the Government would have accused us of trying to block or
sabotage Crossrail. They cannot do that, because we made it very clear
that we are realistic about where we are with Crossrail, and that we
want to get on with it. What they cannot do, although they are trying,
is to use Crossrail as a shield against criticism of their proposals
elsewhere in the country. If they want to deflect criticism or reduce
our criticism of their proposals for other areas of the country, they
could do so by accepting the amendments that we and the hon. Member for
North Cornwall have tabled providing for a ballot in all cases. There
would then be an appropriate safeguard for businesses and the
criticisms would have far less force. They choose not to do so, so the
situation is of their own making.</div>
<a name="09012758000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012758000409"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Neil Turner</b> (Wigan) (Lab): I would like the hon. Gentleman
to clarify two points. First, he talks about the consensus within
London, but every party was in favour of Crossrail. How can one judge
the degree of consensus when the people of London did not have the
opportunity to vote against it? All the candidates in the London
mayoral elections were in favour of it. Secondly, may I remind him that
elections in London are held once every four years, but in the rest of
the conurbations of England we have elections every year? These
projects will take place over a number of years. It will tend to be
large projects that are supported by the supplementary business rate,
so there will be the opportunity for consultation over a number of
elections. The situation will not be the same as in London, where a
project could be introduced after an election and be sorted out before
the next one.</div>
<a name="09012758000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000410"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, but he
has not been listening to some of the previous arguments. The fact that
all the major parties stood on the platform of supporting
Crossrail&#151;for exactly the reason that my hon. Friend the Member
for Cities of London and Westminster gave, that everyone accepted that
we were where we were&#151;demonstrates that there was substantial
buy-in among the voters. People could have voted for Respect, and I
suspect that the UK Independence party and the British National party
were also rather critical of Crossrail, but they did not, for obvious
reasons.</div>
<a name="09012758000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also had
evidence from representatives of the London business community that in
the circumstances, to kick-start Crossrail, London businesses were
satisfied that the mechanism was one that they could live with. The
fact that there are annual elections to the unitary authorities
elsewhere in the country does not alter the argument. It is perfectly
fine and helpful to have elections so that voters&#151;the domestic
council tax payers&#151;can have their say on whether to have a
council that continues with a BRS scheme. I do not have a problem with
that, but that is no reason to say that non-domestic rate
payers&#151;those who contribute not through council tax, but through
the BRS&#151;should not have a ballot, so that they can have their
say. The two are not mutually exclusive in any
way.</div><a name="09012758000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government conceded the principle that there should always be a
ballot for a BRS scheme to be imposed, none of this argument would be
necessary. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>The local authority could go forward, taking the
domestic council tax payer vote with it in the elections in the
ordinary way, but it would also be able to get buy-in from the business
occupiers through a ballot. There would not be the potential conflict
that the Government&#146;s scheme gives rise
to.</div><a name="09012758000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a rather larger nutshell than I had intended&#151;although I hope I
have enabled hon. Members, including Labour Members, to vent their
views&#151;those are the reasons why we proposed our amendments and
have sympathy with those tabled by the hon. Member for North Cornwall.
We certainly wish to see votes on such matters in due course. The other
amendments in my name in the group are consequential, relating to the
holding of a ballot in every case apart from Crossrail. I hope that
that deals comprehensively with this group of
amendments.</div><a name="09012758000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012758000411"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="09012758000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to enter the private grief of Crossrail as regards
London&#146;s payment for it, but outside London many people are
dubious about the scheme. They fear that it will cost about &#163;25
billion, perhaps more, but do not see it helping them in any way. They
feel that that amount of money could be much better used on
infrastructure
elsewhere.</div><a name="09012758000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
got my bit about Crossrail out of the way, let me explain why a ballot
of businesses is vital if we want acceptance of the concept from the
business community. I need not tell the Minister about the need to
reassure business, because the evidence is plainly in front of him,
from almost every business organisation in the country. From my own
anecdotal evidence, local business is frightened to death of giving
government&#151;particularly local government, which has not proved
to be the most efficient instrument in this country for moving our
society forward&#151;the ability to raise even more money from the
community, particularly the business sector and at a time when
Government support for local authorities has been reduced over the
years in percentage
terms.</div><a name="09012758000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me tell the Committee why the business community is so concerned. That
concern surrounds two major areas. The first concern arises from the
appalling episodes and examples of consultation undertaken by local
government the length and breadth of the country. We have one at the
moment in Northamptonshire, where the portfolio holder responsible for
the consultation has herself said that it has not been well organised.
In fact, I have not seen one local government consultation that has
been well
organised.</div><a name="09012758000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thrust of the Government argument seems to suggest that it is okay not
to hold a ballot, if less than 33 per cent. of the total cost is to be
borne by business, because there will be consultation. I would like the
Minister to present evidence of quality consultation in local
government. I would like him to tell me how many people with an expert
knowledge of the art of consultation are employed by local government.
I would like him to show me where consultation has been accepted by the
local populace as being effective and meaningful, because in my
experience the opposite is
true.</div><a name="09012758000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
worked in the business of marketing and public relations for most of my
adult life, I look at the consultations emanating from local government
in my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>part of the world with horror&#151;horror at the amateurish nature of
the whole process every time. The Minister needs to reassure us as to
why he thinks there will be this massive step change in the quality of
local government consultation in order to pursue his argument that, in
the context of projects involving a contribution of below 33 per cent.
from business, such consultation will allay those fears. I assure him
that it certainly will not.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000412"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> My hon. Friend makes some interesting points about
consultation. Does he not accept that, particularly in relation to
quite a few local programmes, all too often there are some deep-rooted
interests whose concern, however much consultation they get, is the
outcome of a particular inquiry? How would he address the fact that
there is always a small minority that can be consulted until the cows
come home&#151;in whatever efficient or inefficient way&#151;but
that ultimately, if the outcome of the inquiry does not go its way, it
feels that it has not had a fair
say?</div><a name="09012758000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000413"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that interjection
because it raises an important point. The obvious answer is to bring in
professionals. However, to do that throughout the whole nation would be
massively expensive. The alternative is to ensure that local government
is much more equipped to deal with consultations from its own
perspective. It should not see a consultation as simply asking the
questions to get the answers that it wants. Furthermore, in a
consultation where there has been a sizeable view in opposition to the
council&#146;s plans, it should not then override it as being
meaningless and ignore it. There is no reason why it should. There is
no law that says, &#147;You have to take note of a given
consultation.&#148; There is also no sanction where people who do not
have a vote are involved in that consultation, and therein lies the
serious problem. The whole question of consultation therefore needs to
be looked at as a separate issue in local government. However,
consultation is not the answer to reassuring local businesses regarding
projects where the projected amount that they will need to pay is less
than 33 per cent. by the levy of the rate. The second reason why they
need reassurance is that very fact in itself.</div>
<a name="09012758000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish I
could tell the Committee that the projections of a given capital
project made by local authorities were worth putting great faith in.
The truth of the matter is that, over the length and breadth of the
country, assessment of projects by Government, and especially by local
government, have been way off target when the total is presented at the
end of the project.</div>
<a name="09012758000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall cite
a situation where a local authority says that the cost to be generated
from a local rate of a given project is only 30 per cent. of that rate,
so there is no need for the ballot. We then find, after the ballot is
taken and the rate is levied, that the cost of VAT contribution turns
out to be less, in total, than was projected by the local authority.
The business rate contribution therefore becomes 40 per cent. of the
total. Do the Government then give that money back? There is nothing in
the Bill to say that they should. Again, the situation will simply be
created where business feels that it has been conned.</div>
<a name="09012758000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Business sees
itself as the milch cow for the Government and has done for some time.
Not only are we going to see increasing congestion charges, much of
which will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>be paid by business, but workplace parking levies are being introduced
as well. We are seeing charge after charge being levied on business, as
though it can continue to provide a massive share of the money spent by
Government at all
levels.</div><a name="09012758000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09012758000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will simply open up the fear that, create more suspicion that and
add to the thought that the Government&#146;s only concern for
business, when it comes down to action rather than words, is that it is
a milch cow and is there for local government to grab whatever it can
in its interests, and not necessarily in the interests of business. The
only way to convince business that it has a proper say in this matter
is to give it a proper vote on every project that requires a
supplementary business rate.</div>

us is central to the Bill, if hon. Members want to debate it I suggest
that they do so now. I will accept a more wide-ranging debate, rather
than wait for a clause stand part debate at the end. That is a warning
shot for anybody who has anything else to say, before I call the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000415"></a>John

Atkinson, particularly as we enter the scrutiny period of the Bill.
Like other hon. Members, I look forward to serving under your
chairmanship and that of your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dean. It is
great to see such a strong scrutiny Committee, made up of hon. Members
who have long experience in local and national Government, from the
north and south of the country, and those with business experience that
they can bring to bear on our deliberations. That can only strengthen
our scrutiny of the Bill, and I look forward to that.</div>
<a name="09012758000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
probably all surprised at the level of interest in this Bill in certain
sections of the media over the weekend, and look forward to the
amendments that may be tabled in the other place when the Bill arrives
there.</div>
<a name="09012758000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments that we are debating strike at the core of the Bill, which
is the proper relationship between a local authority and the businesses
in its area, and the degree to which there is a common, shared interest
in the future prosperity and economic development of that area. I think
that all hon. Members would accept that, as we heard in evidence from
local government and business last week, we are considering the
legislation in an era that is different from two decades ago. We must
be careful not to base our judgments about this legislation on outdated
mindsets, or myths about local government wanting to soak local
business for everything it can get. Frankly, we put have put those days
well behind us, and I was particularly encouraged to hear confirmation
of that from the business organisations that gave evidence last
week.</div>
<a name="09012758000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
deal with the sort of relationships that are currently in place and,
through this Bill, how they need to be strengthened. We are legislating
for the potential use of a supplement and a power not just next year or
the year after, but&#151;if appropriate and if determined by a local
authority with its local businesses&#151;at any time in the future,
should there be a strong case for doing so.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="09012758000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000416"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> On that general point, is the Minister personally
uneasy at the idea that we lack a democratic safeguard in this regard?
He is quite right that local authorities work much more closely with
their local businesses in trying to plan for the regeneration of
particular parts of the local authority area. However, as we have
repeatedly pointed out, there are many business men and women who do
not live in the locality. In other words, they have no say on the
election of a particular authority. Does the Minister instinctively
feel uneasy at the lack of any democratic safeguard, notwithstanding
the desire of business and local authorities to work together more
closely?</div>
<a name="09012758000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000417"></a>John
Healey:</b> No, because the democratic safeguard is in the
elected local government. The requirement is for elected local
government to account for its decisions, and to be subject to scrutiny,
public cross-examination and challenge and, ultimately, to being voted
out of office for those decisions. That is why the hon. Gentleman will
see that, when we get to clause 2, the proposed levying authorities all
have that direct democratic mandate. Some have argued that transport
authorities ought to have similar powers, but they do not have a direct
elected mandate&#151;the democratic safeguard. In the end, we elect
our politicians locally and nationally to make decisions that sometimes
have to mediate or adjudicate between competing interests, which can
sometimes never be reconciled. Ultimately, our job is to stand up and
account for our decisions. If people do not like them, there is a
strong debate and then, essentially, the opportunity to get rid of us.
I am not uneasy in the same way as the hon. Gentleman is, because we
framed the Bill to be based in democratic elected local government.
That is local government&#146;s proper role, and the proper place to
have the ultimate
accountability.</div><a name="09012758000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Cornwall moved amendment 1 and indicated that he
might want to press it to a vote. I hope that I can dissuade him from
doing so. I shall then come on to the two central issues at the core of
our debate and the other amendments: whether there should be a ballot
in all cases, and whether London&#146;s Crossrail is an
exception.</div><a name="09012758000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 is directed at the question of economic development. I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will find that the draft guidance, which was published
on Friday, underlines what is already in the Bill. It clearly says that
a business rate supplement and the funds it raises must be spent on
projects that promote economic development. Before we get on to where
we disagree, let me attempt to stake out territory that I am confident
we agree
on.</div><a name="09012758000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
all members of the Committee and all our parties would accept that
local authorities have a central and important role in the economic
development and prospects of their area. Sir Michael Lyons was strong
in his conclusion on that in his recent report. The all-party,
Conservative-led Local Government Association is strongly of that view.
The sub-national review of economic development and regeneration, which
was published in summer 2007, concluded that. Lyons and the
sub-national review, on the proposition that local authorities have an
important role and require policies and some freedoms in order to play
that role effectively, said that they should have the power to raise
additional funds to promote economic development. That is precisely
what the business rate supplement will allow them to do.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="09012758000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am on
areas of agreement, I was encouraged by some words of David Frost. I
was not surprised, because I know the British Chambers of Commerce and
its director-general well. He confirmed
that</div><a name="09012758000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a number of parts of the country...there is a need for more local
determination and...the ability to raise additional revenue from
the business community&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Business Rate Supplements Public Bill Committee, </i>20 January
2009; c. 21,
Q85.]</div><a name="09012758000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposition in amendment 1 is to prevent a business rate supplement
from being levied unless those businesses that will pay the supplement
are satisfied that the project to be funded by the BRS will promote
economic development of the area. I agree with that proposition, but I
can say to the hon. Member for North Cornwall that it will not come as
a surprise to any businesses. As part of the different relationships
that are already in place from a couple of decades ago, local
authorities already develop and consider their long-term plans for
economic and social development, and environmental improvement, through
their sustainable community strategy, local strategic partnerships and
detailed discussions with business. In almost every area of the
country&#151;every one of us could point to significant business
people in our own areas who are playing a part&#151;business is
involved with those discussions and ultimately, the decisions that
local authorities take.</div>
<a name="09012758000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The latest
example is the set of local area agreements that the Government agreed
with local government last year. In all except one of the 150 local
area agreements, local authorities, in wider conversations and with
wider support, have picked priorities for themselves that reflect
concerns about improving their local economies. For example, six of
Cornwall&#146;s 28 local area agreement priorities are economic in
nature; three of Bromley&#146;s 30 targets are focused on
the economy. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster may
be interested to know that his local authority is the only local
authority out of the 150 in the country not to make any of its
priorities economic. That is a matter for the local authority, and no
doubt it has discussed it with local businesses.</div>
<a name="09012758000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back
to the BRS, that sort of discussion and consultation will be part and
parcel of any consideration that a local authority gives to the
potential role for a business rate supplement, even before the formal
consultation stage, which we shall come to later in our deliberations.
Any proposal will need to explain clearly why it is necessary to
consider the project, even before consideration is given to funding it.
The Bill and the draft guidance that I have published make it clear
that any proposed project plan should set out how the project will
improve the economic development of an area. I sympathise with the
proposition of the hon. Member for North Cornwall, but in practice the
amendment would mean that the local authority would need to demonstrate
that the majority of the business community that might be affected by a
BRS was satisfied that it would promote economic development before it
could go ahead. It is difficult to see how one could satisfy that
requirement without a ballot.</div>
<a name="09012758000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, the local authority would be balloting on whether the majority
of the businesses thought that the project proposed would contribute to
economic development, and not on whether businesses accepted or agreed
with the idea that a BRS might play a part. That is clearly absurd. The
amendment would lead to serial balloting in the process of a BRS and
that is its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>ultimate flaw. I shall come to the arguments of principle regarding
balloting in a moment, but if the hon. Gentleman presses amendment 1 to
a vote, that is the logical and practical flaw in his
proposal.</div>
<a name="09012758000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not least
because of my local involvements, but also as a Minister, as the
Committee would expect, I understand keenly and clearly the concerns
that businesses have about the business rate supplement, although they
are from time to time rather overstated, which does not necessarily do
their case much good.</div>
<a name="09012758000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000418"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I find that remark rather surprising. Is the
Minister saying that a robust opposition to a given Government proposal
will be less well favoured because of its robustness? Is that what he
is telling us? If so, that is a worrying
situation.</div>
<a name="09012758000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000419"></a>John
Healey:</b> No&#151;quite the opposite. The strength of the
case and the extent to which it is likely to be carried in the
decisions that the Government or this House take rest on how well it is
put, not simply on how strongly it is put. It is as true in this field
as in any other that organisations sometimes do not best serve their
cause by overstating the concerns and anxieties that are at stake.
Nevertheless, in framing this Bill we have taken the concerns of
business
seriously.</div>
<a name="09012758000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09012758000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the safeguards in the Bill, which we will come on to in more detail,
is the requirement for any local authority, if the BRS is expected to
contribute more than a third of the total proportion of any project
cost, to be subject to a ballot. That is despite equally strong
arguments from the all-party Conservative-led Local Government
Association that there should be no requirement for a ballot, and that
any ballot should be a decision for the local authority itself, as
appropriate. The all-party Select Committee also takes a view that is
different from ours. It does not seek the requirement to have a ballot
where a project&#146;s cost amounts to more than a third from
BRS.</div><a name="09012758000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evidence sessions bore this out. On the one hand, we had the CBI saying
that we should have ballots in every case, whatever the contribution
from the BRS. The LGA argued that ballots are unnecessary and should
not take place unless the local authority decided it was appropriate.
The most interesting, and overall perhaps the most balanced, evidence
came from the director general of the BCC. He was clear with us in
recognising the constructive relations that generally exist between
local authorities, business organisations and the business community
now. He also recognised the concerns that businesses have about the
prospect of legislation enabling a BRS.</div>
<a name="09012758000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
director general ended by confirming to the Committee, in response to
questions from my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich, that the BCC accepted the third threshold proposed in the
Bill. That threshold is designed to recognise that business should not
have a blanket veto on any business rate supplement as a contribution
to a major project for an area. However, it is also designed that,
where a business is likely to do more of the heavy lifting in the
financing of a project, it should have that reassurance and extra
opportunity to vote on its introduction.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000420"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I understand the logic about the heavy lifting, but
will the Minister address the point, raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, South and other Members, that the assessment of
heavy lifting should perhaps not be in terms of the proportion of the
expenditure as borne, but also of the quantum? One can envisage some
schemes where a quarter will amount to a financial contribution that
could fairly be described as heavy lifting.</div>
<a name="09012758000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000421"></a>John
Healey:</b> We deal with quantum concerns with the
Bill&#146;s proposal that there will be a 2p cap on the scale of a
business rate supplement. That is an area where we were again urged
strongly by all parties in the LGA to go a lot further, and we will
come on to debate that.</div>
<a name="09012758000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000422"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Does my right hon. Friend not think it slightly
odd that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who argued that
Crossrail should not be subject to a ballot but that every other scheme
should be, is now suggesting that the quantum of the contribution
should be a factor? There can be no scheme that I can imagine in which
there is a greater quantum of contribution from business than
Crossrail. Is that not an indication of how hopelessly confused and
intellectually bankrupt the Opposition&#146;s case
is?</div>
<a name="09012758000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000423"></a>John
Healey:</b> Quite so. I also think that it exposes the
weakness of an approach that says that one specifies quantum figures in
legislation because it is difficult to do so in a way that is
appropriate for all parts of the country. My right hon. Friend is
right. The Bill is framed so that, in the case of Crossrail, the
quantum across Greater London would raise about &#163;178 million a
year. The quantum of a similar supplement raised across
Northamptonshire would be just over &#163;9
million.</div><a name="09012758000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly,
we in this House cannot legislate on that sort of thing without
creating an inflexibility that would be totally dysfunctional. I
understand the quantum question being a concern of business, but we are
dealing with that by a cap on the size of the levy and by a threshold
of a &#163;50,000 rateable value above which businesses would be
liable for any business rate supplement&#151;at a stroke taking out
the vast majority of businesses in any
area.</div><a name="09012758000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000424"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> What analytical statistical base did the
Government use to set its figure of a third as the cut-off point for a
ballot? I assume there is an analytical base, and I would love to have
it
explained.</div><a name="09012758000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000425"></a>John
Healey:</b> It is a matter of studying the impact assessment
of any business rate supplement and, in the end, a judgment. We believe
that the judgment strikes the right balance, as I described earlier. I
shall come to that in a moment, but now I would like to turn to the two
principal questions that underpin the different amendments of the
Conservatives and the
Liberals.</div><a name="09012758000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
both parties&#146; amendments propose that there should be a ballot
in all cases in which the levying authority wishes to introduce a
business rate supplement. Second, they propose that the requirement to
have a ballot should not apply to London.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="09012758000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000426"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister is accurately setting out the
position of my party and, I believe, of the Conservatives, except in
one respect. He just said that the ballot requirement should not apply
to London, but that is not what our proposal says; it says that it
should not apply to Crossrail. At some point in the future, when
Crossrail has been funded and we are all happily taking trains through
the heart of London, if other projects emerge, they should be subject
to a ballot in the same way. We were specific about saying Crossrail,
not
London.</div><a name="09012758000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000427"></a>John
Healey:</b> I shall deal with in a moment. To all intents and
purposes, for the discussions and the proposition before the Committee
and before London&#151;the business rate supplement&#151;the
proposal is to levy to the 2p limit. That proposal comes from the Mayor
and will fund Crossrail for 24 years. The hon. Gentleman may be taking
a very long view and seeking framework legislation for 25 years plus,
but the core of the argument is not changed by the technicalities of
his slightly deficient
amendment.</div><a name="09012758000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
third requirement for a ballot applies across the board&#151;to be
clear, it is not limited to any type of project or to any geographical
area. The two principal questions raised by the debate are whether the
Committee accepts that any contribution&#151;however large or small a
proportion of a project&#151;from a business rate supplement should
be subject to a vote and, secondly, whether we accept that Crossrail is
unique and therefore warrants unique treatment in the legislation. I am
disappointed that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is still
arguing from the Front Bench that London is an exception to the rest of
the country&#151;particularly when Crossrail is of national
significance, not least with the national taxpayer putting in the
largest single contribution to the funding package.</div>
<a name="09012758000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
accept what underpins the hon. Gentleman&#146;s basic argument: that
there should be one rule for London and one rule for the rest of the
country. In the gentlest terms, that is such a narrow view&#151;one,
unfortunately, that we suffered throughout the 1980s and 1990s, when
Government economic policy could barely see beyond the limits of
Greater London and the south-east, and through which so many of the
economic problems and economic potential of the rest of the country
were largely ignored. I do not want us to legislate for the BRS in a
way that says, &#147;We are interested in London, we will legislate
for London and the rest of the country can go hang&#148;. I cannot
accept that as a basic proposition for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="09012758000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000428"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I do not wish to go down the narrow alleyway of a
history lesson, but the Minister will be aware that many people in his
own party are expressing concerns today at the rescue of the banking
system&#151;at the perception that it is a London rescue, with a lot
of other industries obviously having great difficulties with the credit
crunch.</div>
<a name="09012758000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I go back to
the point I made earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst. If we were discussing this Bill ten years ago, no doubt
Crossrail would be part and parcel of these amendments. In other words,
we would not be making any exception for Crossrail. It is simply a fact
that Crossrail is so far down the line that it should be given the
go-ahead and not necessarily be subject to the ballot safeguards that
we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>regard as important. Looking forward&#151;I go back to what the hon.
Member for North Cornwall had to say&#151;we are not trying to make
London an exception; we are making the specific Crossrail project an
exception.</div><a name="09012758000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000429"></a>John
Healey:</b> For the purposes of this debate and Bill, London
and the Crossrail project are the same thing. To divide them is a false
basis for argument. I am disappointed that the Liberal Democrats are
taking such a London-only view, essentially overlooking the interests
of vast swathes of the country, some of which is led by Liberal
Democrat local councils.</div>
<a name="09012758000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me come
to the two principal questions&#151;first, the one of
balance.</div><a name="09012758000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000430"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> With respect to the Minister&#151;because I am
sure he does not want to misrepresent what has been said&#151;if he
is saying that there is genuine concern for the rest of the country, I
accept it. Can he answer why, if we are to pursue an evidence-based
approach, there is no evidence from the LGA of anywhere else in the
country with a desire to take up the powers proposed for
them?</div><a name="09012758000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000431"></a>John
Healey:</b> Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts that any
Government ought to be looking to the long term and ought to be capable
of legislating and coming up with policy that is not simply in response
to the demands placed on them. I hope that in this passage of the Bill
we will see a different approach from his party from five years ago,
when it raised exactly the same opposition to business improvement
districts, through which we set a new framework, allowing local
authorities to discuss and develop with local businesses propositions
to benefit their areas. It was a visionary move and forward-looking
legislation from the Government&#151;and, in particular, from the
then Minister who led it through the House, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich&#151;which has proved a great
success over recent years. There are 67 business improvement districts
in place, many in areas led by Conservative local councils. I encourage
the hon. Gentleman to take that longer-term view of the legislation
that the Committee is considering this
morning.</div>
<a name="09012758000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000432"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Is the Minister not raising the same concern that
we are&#151;that the BIDs project was specifically designed to
involve business at every stage of the
process?</div><a name="09012758000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000433"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> So why did you oppose
it?</div><a name="09012758000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000434"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I did not. I was not here. I will speak for myself
on this matter, so I do not want any of that nonsense.</div>
<a name="09012758000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Business is
involved at every stage of the BIDs process, which has the effect of
bringing business into the humble issue of community and its impact on
the people whom we serve. That is the opposite of this exercise, which
will drive business away because it will not be involved. It will just
see the price at the end of the day and know whether it was right or
wrong, whether it has been balloted or not, quite frankly. So the Bill
is not doing what BIDs did, and that is one of its
failures.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div><a name="09012758000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09012758000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000435"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who gives me
the cue to go on to BIDs. He encourages me to use BIDs as a model, and
others have cited them as the proper model for a BRS. However, the BRS
is unlike BIDs in a number of ways. BIDs have a time limit of five
years and their footprint is essentially localised. They are often
there to support revenue funding for things such as improvements in
local streets and police community support officers&#151;things where
the benefit to the businesses involved are direct and immediate. Unlike
BIDs, schemes funded by the BRS&#151;Crossrail is the clearest case
in point&#151;are likely to be considered appropriate for much wider
areas and to offer much wider benefits, beyond the immediate interests
of the businesses in that area and, because of the likely time scales,
beyond the interests of those businesses that may, if the BRS is
introduced, be paying it. So the BRS is different from BIDs, which
leads us to our view that the balloting question needs to be dealt with
differently.</div>
<a name="09012758000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me tie in
the question of Crossrail at this point. Like Crossrail, any other
potential project that might attract a BRS will almost certainly
involve other sources of funding. Local council tax payers, through
local authorities, make a contribution; national taxpayers, through
central Government, make a contribution; and they are likely to do so
precisely because of those wider benefits that such a project could
bring across a wider area.</div>
<a name="09012758000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say
what for me is the principal question. Where other sources of funding
are part of the package for a big project bringing wider benefits, and
where there is a will to see investment from other sources so that such
projects bring those wider benefits&#151;just like
Crossrail&#151;those who argue for a ballot in all cases have to
explain whether it is right that businesses should, in all those cases,
have a vote and a veto on whether the project goes ahead? In other
words, should business be able to block projects even if the will, the
desire and the approval is there from people who are not in business
but who have an interest in the benefits that a project could bring to
an area? Is it right that businesses should have that vote and veto
when they may be paying a quarter or a tenth of the project funding, or
when a BRS may contribute a negligible proportion of it? That is the
question at the heart of whether a ballot is right in all
circumstances, and that is why we have taken the view that it is not
right to give businesses a vote and a veto in all circumstances,
whatever the proportion of funding for a project they would contribute,
but that it is right to put a ballot in place where business is
required to pay more&#151;more than a third&#151;of the project
costs.</div><a name="09012758000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now turn to the question of Crossrail. Is it unique and should it
therefore warrant unique treatment in the Bill? In my view,
Crossrail is a very special project but it is not unique. It is special
in its scale. For the purposes of the BRS, it is also well developed:
its business plan, project plan and funding package are clear. To that
extent, it is well ahead of the field in relation to the potential use
of the BRS. However, I think it is easy for Members of all parties here
to consider that other major transport projects similar to Crossrail
may be highly desirable, play a big part in economic development and
bring benefits to other areas of the country&#151;projects for which
the BRS could play 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>a part in the funding package. They may bring a
similar relative investment and have similar relative economic
importance as
Crossrail.</div><a name="09012758000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Cornwall has argued that Crossrail is special
because it has been subject to legislation. Some transport projects in
the future, for which the BRS may be appropriate, may also require
legislation. If they do, why rule them out of benefiting from a BRS,
using that argument to justify a carve-out for Crossrail? The point is
that, when Parliament has considered a project and given it the
go-ahead&#151;Crossrail in this instance, but potentially other
transport projects in other areas&#151;is it right that a business
vote could stop the project later? Essentially, that is the argument
advanced by the hon. Member for North Cornwall. He is trying to
justifying a rather odd position, which, when I gave evidence, I
described&#151;perhaps a bit harshly, but I still maintain that this
is the case&#151;as illogical and intellectually
inconsistent.</div>
<a name="09012758000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crossrail is
special&#151;it is more advanced than any other potential
project&#151;but it is not unique in terms of what we, or other areas
of the country, may want to use BRS to contribute towards. For that
reason, it is not correct to say that it needs a special carve-out, and
that we should invent a set of principles to cushion Crossrail and give
it special treatment in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09012758000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee will forgive me for dwelling a rather long time on that
point. I shall deal with the points that have been raised and the
amendments, but I dwelt on those questions because they go to the core
of the Bill, and many other points that we will come on to are in a
sense derived from the decisions that the Committee and Parliament will
take on
them.</div><a name="09012758000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will discuss the provisions for detailed consultation and explore
concerns about business consultation and influence on any potential use
of the BRS under clauses 5 and 6, but I can say now that levying
authorities that want to use the BRS will be required to draw up a
prospectus, which will be the basis for formal consultation. The
prospectus will need to set out the detailed plans for expenditure,
including the time scales and funding sources, in addition to how the
supplement will work, the assessment of economic benefits that could be
brought to the area and the costs of the project; I have published the
draft guidance that will help to frame that requirement to consult. The
prospectus will allow businesses to see clearly and cross-examine the
costs and benefits that may be proposed. I published the draft guidance
at this stage partly for formal consultation over the next
12 weeks and partly to inform the Committee&#146;s
deliberations of the relevant clauses when we get to them. In summary,
we are trying to strike an appropriate
balance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000436"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="09012758000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000437"></a>John

the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09012758000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000438"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am still concerned about local
authorities&#146; ability to consult and the quality of the
consultation. Will the Minister give us some reassurance that, as part
of the process of ensuring that the Bill works fairly and properly, he
will ensure that that quality is improved?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="09012758000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000439"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. Indeed, part of my purpose in producing the draft
guidance covering consultation is precisely to collect views,
particularly from people such as himself who may be concerned about the
nature of the consultation process over the next 12 weeks, on whether
that could be strengthened, and if so, how. If the hon. Gentleman wants
to submit a view to me, I would be pleased to receive
it.</div><a name="09012758000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, we are trying to strike a balance between giving business a
degree of reassurance to which we believe it is entitled, and the
interests of others, including local residents, who may benefit from or
share an interest with business in a project supported by a BRS going
ahead, and who may contribute a share of such a project&#146;s
funding. On the question of balloting, those others may therefore say
that it is appropriate to give business a vote or a veto if a BRS is to
contribute a third or more towards a project&#146;s costs, but not if
it makes a smaller contribution and the financial heavy lifting comes
from other sources. Business should not be able to block a
project&#146;s going ahead on that
basis.</div><a name="09012758000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that, in the light of the explanations that I have given during
our debate, amendment 1 will be withdrawn and the hon. Members for
North Cornwall and for Bromley and Chislehurst will not press their
other amendments, but will accept that we have striven to strike an
appropriate balance in the
Bill.</div><a name="09012758000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000440"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I wonder whether I might seek your guidance,
Mr. Atkinson, before I remark on the Minister&#146;s point
about pressing amendments to a vote. Would it be possible to vote on
amendments 1, 5 to 7, 10 and 12 all together? I do not intend to press
them to a vote now, but would it be possible to vote on them en bloc,
or would there have to be a separate vote on
each?</div><a name="09012758000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000441"></a>The
Chairman:</b> No, we cannot do that. We would only vote on
amendment 1 at this stage. If hon. Members want to vote on the
subsequent amendments, which have been grouped with amendment 1 for the
convenience of debate, they will have to be voted on in their proper
place in the Bill
later.</div><a name="09012758000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000442"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I will
signify my intention to press for a vote when we reach the appropriate
point. The reason I mention that is that, as the Minister has quite
rightly pointed out, amendment 1 relates to the theme under discussion,
namely consultation with business and being able to demonstrate that
business supports the scheme, but the crucial issue is the ballot,
which, as I understand it, is dealt with later in the Bill. We will
have the opportunity to vote on, for example, amendments 5 to 7, which
are on the issue of a ballot, when we reach them. That is the crucial
question for hon. Members, certainly on this side of the
Committee.</div><a name="09012758000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000443"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is correct.</div>
<a name="09012758000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000444"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Along similar lines to the hon. Gentleman, I point
out that amendment 25, which is the principal amendment in my
name&#151;the others are essentially consequential&#151;is grouped
here for the purpose of debate, but it is actually an amendment to
clause 4, and I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>therefore wish to put the Committee on notice that when we reach it, in
due course, I anticipate dividing the
Committee.</div><a name="09012758000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000445"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am getting some helpful guidance. If hon.
Members indicate that they wish to vote on amendment 25 when that
comes, they will not be able to vote on amendment 5, as the one
cancels out the other. So voting will be restricted to amendment 25 or
amendment 5, but not
both.</div><a name="09012758000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000446"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> But we can have a vote on amendment 1 now,
Mr.
Atkinson?</div><a name="09012758000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000447"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Yes. I am sorry to have interrupted,
Mr.
Rogerson.</div><a name="09012758000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000448"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I do appreciate that I threw the debate slightly
off course with my question, Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09012758000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has been
a useful debate on what is the most important issue for many of the
witnesses we heard from in our previous sessions. I will focus, first
of all, on the points made by the Minister in response to the
individual amendments.</div>
<a name="09012758000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 1
would set out a clear indication that the business community&#146;s
views matter, and that for a project to proceed it must be clear that
the business community is convinced that the economic development case
has been made. Although I accept the Minister&#146;s claim that the
only way to do that would be to have a ballot, I would have thought
that it might be possible to set out clearly in that ballot that the
business community supports the measures in light of the intention to
promote the economic development of the
area.</div><a name="09012758000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09012758000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister made a number of further points about balloting, and therefore
amendments 5 to 7 and 10 to 12, as well as amendment 25, to which the
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has just referred. Why should
we not have a ballot for Crossrail? The hon. Member for Cities of
London and Westminster made a very good point when he said that if
Crossrail were a new project being proposed subsequent to the Bill
being considered, of course we would be calling for a ballot. However,
Crossrail is different; in the view of many, it is unique. In the
Minister&#146;s view, it is not unique; it is very much the same as
any other project which might emerge, but I think the time scale makes
it very different. Most of the witnesses that we heard from were clear
in pointing out that they felt it to be unique as well. I think that
most politicians in London would say that Crossrail is a project of
unique significance, having had vast amounts of consultation and
scrutiny. I therefore believe that it is of a different magnitude, or
at least that we have arrived at a formulation different from that for
any subsequent scheme elsewhere in the
country.</div><a name="09012758000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that he was sympathetic. I am very grateful for his
sympathy and he did look as though he was wrestling with himself and
was quite anguished as he tried to reconcile all these important
arguments. It might help to point out that, unlike the Conservative
party&#151;we will no doubt develop this argument when we debate
later clauses&#151;my party does not believe that this measure should
be restricted to London. We believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>that it is a useful tool, and we heard from the Local Government
Association that many projects may now emerge that require a BRS. We do
not have a problem with that as a concept. The problem is that there
needs to be a ballot. That is our opinion and that of many
organisations representing the business
community.</div><a name="09012758000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
distinction between not having a ballot on Crossrail specifically and
not having a ballot in London at all is crucial. The Minister said that
25 years may be the lifetime of this legislation and by then it may
well have effectively run its course. A few years ago, it was my
privilege to serve on the Committee considering the Bill that became
the Commons Act 2006, where we were looking at legislation that dated
from the 12th and 13th centuries. It is important that we
consider the possibility that future projects in London will be funded
under any regulations that we play our part in approving. Most people
accept that there is a difference between Crossrail and other projects
that may emerge elsewhere in the country.</div>
<a name="09012758000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
returned to a point that he made in his evidence to the
Committee&#151; that a ballot will effectively give business a veto
over those projects. I think that he is saying that if a third or more
of the cost of a project is funded by the BRS, he is quite happy for
the business community to have a veto, but if it is slightly
less&#151;1 per cent. less for example&#151;he is not happy for it
to have a veto. I do not believe that it is a veto, but he has
presented it to the Committee in those terms. Government Members who
say that there is an intellectual inconsistency ought to consider their
own arguments about this concept&#151;or spectre&#151;of a veto
quite closely, because surely they apply equally whether the
contribution is more than a third or less.</div>
<a name="09012758000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lower the
proportion of the overall financial package provided by a BRS, the less
important it is to that project&#146;s advancement. Far from being a
veto, the ballot is merely a way for the business community to say to
all the other funding partners that it is not convinced that it will
reap equal benefit from the economic development in question, so they
should go back and look at it again. That important point needs to be
borne in mind. Through the consultation, local elections and the
mechanisms for contributions that may be made by central Government to
a project that is proposed by an elected government body, there is in
many cases accountability to these other sections&#151;a veto, if one
likes, on behalf of the other funding partners. To pick out the
business community and say that it will be handled differently is
inconsistent and unfortunate. Regardless of whether the BRS will form
more or less than a third of the funding package, the point is that it
is still 2p on the rate to a business in an area where a BRS is
imposed. It will be of no comfort to the business that the overall
contribution is less than a third, because it is still paying its 2p,
without the benefit of a vote. The fundamental problem with the
Government&#146;s argument is that businesses in an area where a
greater contribution is to be made are to be allowed to have their say,
even though their own contribution will be no different from that of
businesses in an area where the contribution makes up less than a third
of the funding
package.</div><a name="09012758000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are problems and intellectual inconsistencies in the
Government&#146;s argument. I therefore very much wish to press the
amendment to a vote, so that we can have the Committee&#146;s
decision on that important question. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>would also like the opportunity later of a vote on whether a ballot is
crucial to the proposal. I believe that it is, and I therefore signal
my intention to press to a vote my amendments on the ballot
proposal.</div><a name="09012758000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000465"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> As hon. Members will appreciate, the effect of the
amendments is to restrict the scope of the definition of
&#147;levying authority&#148; to the Greater London authority. I
can be brief because this harks back to our earlier debate, but I was
not convinced by the Minister&#146;s reply, for the reasons already
stated. We believe that it is possible to decouple Crossrail from the
roll-out of BRS elsewhere nationally. Amendments 22 and 23 amend the
definition of levying authority in clause 2 and the other amendments
are consequential, changing the references to levying authorities
elsewhere in the Bill. The arguments have been made; I need not say
more.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div><a name="09012758000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000466"></a>John
Healey:</b> Essentially, the amendments would make a business
rate supplement an option for London only, removing the possibility for
other local authorities in England and Wales to choose to fund a
project through a business rate supplement. It is precisely the sort of
special treatment that we cannot accept as a Labour Government, and
especially as a party that is concerned about the whole country. We are
concerned about jobs, investment and the long-term business success of
all parts of the country, not only
London.</div><a name="09012758000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have tried to explain to the Committee, we do not accept the
arguments made this morning that London is different and should
be treated differently in the Bill, or that Crossrail is different. It
is the most developed example of a project for which a business rate
supplement is appropriate. It is an exemplar, rather than an exception,
and from it we can draw good lessons for the way in which a BRS could
and should work in other areas.</div>
<a name="09012758000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our
evidence sessions, I was struck by the fact that both business and
local government representatives accepted the principle that a BRS
should be available across the country, not only in London, despite
their concerns about details such as balloting. There is a lot to gain
from giving local authorities greater ability to raise investment for
local economies, particularly in the way that we require them to do so:
in consultation and in partnership with business. The potential would
be lost if the amendments were accepted. I hope that the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst will not insist on pressing them, but if he
does, I will ask my hon. Friends to resist.</div>

Neill:</b> I have listened to the Minister and he is
superficially persuasive. Unfortunately, the Government&#146;s
actions belie their reasonable words. He presents the measure as an
enabling opportunity for the rest of the country, but there is great
suspicion of the Government&#146;s real motives elsewhere in the
country. For the reasons rehearsed, there is acceptance that a funding
package for Crossrail is in place that people now want to implement.
However, juxtaposing this new potential tax-raising power given to
local authorities elsewhere and the Government&#146;s slashing the
money available for local authorities to support business development
gives rise to a real fear that the proposal comes from the
Treasury&#146;s desire to transfer burdens from central Government to

fact that it is the second year of a three-year settlement, which has
secured certainty for local government, and with the removal of
restrictions that were in place on many of the funding streams. The
proposal gives local authorities greater freedom to decide their
priorities and to fund them.</div>
<a name="09012758000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000469"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> It was not a blank look; it was astonishment at the
Minister&#146;s chutzpah in trying that one on. In reality, he knows
that that 4.2 per cent. relates to the overall funding settlement. He
knows perfectly well that that has been roundly criticised by the local
authority associations, in particular because it does not reflect the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>many costs shunted on to local authorities and the additional burdens
such as adult social care, or the fact that local authorities are
seriously suffering over the outworking of the formula, which he and I
have discussed in the past.</div>
<a name="09012758000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000470"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am interested in the stance that the hon.
Gentleman is taking, not least because his party&#146;s leader and
shadow Chancellor have already set out national plans for the coming
financial year, which would involve a &#163;3.7 billion cut in
general Government expenditure. If not an increase of 4.2 per cent., as
we propose for next year, what would his settlement be for local
government in the next financial year?</div>
<a name="09012758000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000471"></a>Robert

either&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000473"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> My specific response is that the Minister
knows full well that that and his earlier comments, which were
in order, do not present the whole picture. The funding for the local
authority business growth incentives scheme, which is specifically
targeted at assisting business and economic development, has been
reduced from &#163;1 billion over the past three years to &#163;150
million over the next two years. That is why people are
suspicious.</div><a name="09012758000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000474"></a>The

I am sure he will be in order&#151;he always

I want to clarify: is the position of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party
that the provisions of this Bill&#151;that is, to be an extra tool
for local government with the business community&#151;even if subject

elsewhere in current circumstances but in due course there are other,
better means to give business incentives to local authorities. We are
not convinced by this mechanism at this time, except for getting
Crossrail up and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000492"></a>Robert

page 2, line 10, at end insert &#145;,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) which promotes the economic
well-being of its area, including the provision of transport

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000493"></a>The

amendment 2, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000494"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> We now turn to definitions of the use of money
raised by BRS. I tabled the amendment in a spirit of genuine enquiry
and helpfulness.</div>
<a name="09012758000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">One concern
raised in the evidence sessions by a number of witnesses from the
business community was the definition of economic development. It links
to the concerns that are rightly set out in the consultation document
that the Minister has provided about how the business community can be
reassured that there is genuine additionality in the funding and, if
business is to contribute, how it can be assured that the money is
genuinely channelled towards economic benefits, rather than substituted
for funding for other activities.</div>
<a name="09012758000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
starts by referring to</div>
<a name="09012758000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expenditure...on
the project to which the BRS relates&#148;,</div>
<a name="09012758000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">but subsection (3)
defines what the money can be used for almost by exclusion. It says
what BRS money cannot be spent on, but you will remember,
Mr. Atkinson, that in the evidence sessions many business
organisations said that they would like the Bill to contain a more
comprehensive definition of what it could be spent on by way of
economic development. The amendment endeavours to achieve
that.</div>
<a name="09012758000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
amendment were made, as well as saying that the BRS money may be spent
only on the project to which the BRS relates and that the authority
would otherwise not have incurred that expenditure&#151;it is
genuinely additional&#151;the clause would state that the BRS money
may be spent only in a way that promotes the economic well-being of the
local authority&#146;s area. We set out specific examples of such
expenditure, which I suspect have been well rehearsed, both in the
documentary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>evidence&#151;the White Paper&#151;and our
evidence sessions. I do not think that anyone would argue against such
areas of expenditure attracting the interest of authorities for a BRS
scheme, but the amendment is intended to reassure businesses that there
is a requirement to stick to a definition that is in the Bill, and that
should for any reason there be a straying beyond that, they would have
recourse through the usual provisions&#151;judicial review and so
on.</div>
<a name="09012758000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that local authorities would not stray, but the amendment is intended
to help and to make the spirit of co-operation more effective, which I
am sure is something that, after the controversy of the earlier
debates, we all genuinely wish to see, having got thus far. That is the
spirit in which I move the amendment, and I am interested to hear what
the Minister says about how we can achieve that better definition,
which seemed to be a genuine&#151;not an obstructive&#151;desire on
the part of
business.</div><a name="09012758000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000495"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I shall not detain the Committee long, but I
cannot fail to observe the extraordinary contortions and intellectual
confusion displayed by the Opposition. We have just heard them arguing
that the Bill should be limited to London and the Crossrail scheme;
however, the amendment, which was obviously tabled at the same time as
the others, is based on a widening of the remit to include provision
for training, employment and other desirable objectives, which the hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst knows perfectly well could not be
contemplated for at least 25 years because the proceeds of the business
rate supplement have been predicated in London for the support of
Crossrail throughout that
period.</div><a name="09012758000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000496"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is always courteous, but I
am sure that he will appreciate&#151;he has been here long
enough&#151;that it is not beyond the wit of anyone to have worked
out that had we by some chance and some fluke of arithmetic in the
Committee succeeded in limiting the Bill to Crossrail, I might not have
moved the amendment. I would have thought that that was
obvious.</div><a name="09012758000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000497"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> So here we have the Opposition, who have said
emphatically that they do not want anywhere else in the country to get
the benefit of the provision, saying that although they would like to
see the remit expanded to include certain activities such as training
and skills development, those things would not be available anywhere
else in the country. They would only be available in London where they
could not work because the proceeds of the business rate supplement
have been predicated for at least 25 years on Crossrail. That is a
product of a party the whole approach of which on this subject of
relations between business and industry and the promotion of economic
development shows no sign whatsoever of an ability to learn any
lessons.</div><a name="09012758000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative party wrong-footed itself five years ago when it opposed
BIDs. It did not understand the importance of the scheme, to which it
is now, at a late date, a convert. It recognises that it made a
mistake, but it cannot learn a lesson and it is about to commit the
same mistake again. I forecast that in a few years&#146; time we will
hear the Conservatives talking about how excellent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>it is to have a framework in which business and the local authority can
work together for economy development&#151;business rate supplements.
I look forward to that day when wisdom prevails, but in the meantime I
am appalled at the Opposition&#146;s
incoherence.</div><a name="09012758000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000498"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Although I share the concerns of the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst and his hon. Friends about some aspects of
the Bill, I agree with the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
on this issue. As we saw in the last vote, there is a clear difference
between the parties&#146; views on whether the provisions should be
available&#151;subject to a ballot, which we have already
discussed&#151;outside London. My party believes that the provisions
should be available in other parts of the country, as long as there is
a clear coming together of the business community, local government and
all the other funders to
deliver.</div><a name="09012758000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall speak to the amendments that stand in my name and that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Solihull to highlight the thinking behind them.
They are probing amendments, to which I hope the Minister will have the
opportunity to respond briefly. Amendment 2 deals with education. We
question whether there might be provision for training and skills to be
involved in a scheme is funded by a BRS, as opposed to specific primary
and secondary education, which is funded as a core function of the
relevant authority. The purpose of the amendment is to probe the
Government and see whether their intention is to allow local
authorities, as part of their economic development schemes, to fund in
that way the provision of training and
skills.</div>
<a name="09012758000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000499"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I was rather taken aback by the remarks of the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. It seems to me that there
was a sizeable degree of illogical thinking in those remarks. He is the
man who presented the BIDs concept to this House and who said that it
was vital for business to be as involved as it possibly could be in all
the activities relating to the project. He is clearly aware of the need
to encourage businesses to be involved, and, I have no doubt, the great
scepticism that businesses, particularly small and medium-sized
businesses, feel about expenditure that is said to be to their great
benefit. They hear those words and become frightened, because all too
often in the past they have been told that a particular project or
fundraising exercise will be to their benefit, but have found that they
are the payers, to very little benefit indeed.</div>
<a name="09012758000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
thought that the right hon. Gentleman, who produced the BIDs scheme so
well, would have supported the argument that to create confidence
within the business community, we need to define the role that a
business rate supplement can play and the projects it can be involved
with as precisely as we are able. The more open the definition, the
more room there is for suspicion in the business community,
particularly in small and medium-sized businesses. It is that sector
that will be particularly hurt if the burden of a large project lasting
10 or 15 years is placed on it to extract the BRS. I would have thought
that he would be pleading with the Minister to expand the definition,
on the basis that that would give greater confidence to the business
sector.</div>
<a name="09012758000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The business
sector made it clear to us that it is immensely concerned about the
loopholes in the Bill, which it thinks is loosely written. It is
concerned about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>giving local authorities the right to extract what it sees as greater
dues from them. To define that in more sensible terms would be helpful.
I urge the Minister to take that plea seriously. If he is unable to
tell us today what he might do, he should come back with a better
definition, even though he might reject the
amendment.</div><a name="09012758000254"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000500"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am grateful for this short debate. We are
dealing with an important part of the Bill, which is drafted to give
the sort of assurance that the hon. Member for Northampton, South seeks
and, to some extent, the clarification that the hon. Member for North
Cornwall is looking for. I suspect that there is no great difference in
our general approach to the provisions and to what is right in
principle. I accept the intention of the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst in moving the amendment. He is concerned about
substitution, as indeed is the hon. Member for Northampton,
South.</div>
<a name="09012758000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09012758000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal first with amendment 2; in a sense, it touches on the same
concern&#151;the risk of substitution. In other words, BRS might be
used to fund services for which local authorities should already be
providing funding. Were the hon. Gentleman inclined to press the
amendment to a Division, I should make it clear that it seems to weaken
the safeguards because it narrows the definition set out in clause
3(3)(c) to primary and secondary education rather than broader
education services. The effect would be that the business rate
supplement would be restricted to primary and secondary
schooling.</div>
<a name="09012758000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">If hon.
Members consider the guidance that was published on Friday, they will
realise that local authorities could not propose using BRS revenue to
fund housing, social services, education services in general, services
for children, health services or planning services. We made that
provision for a reason. The Bill is designed to give the reassurance
that local authorities cannot use BRS as a supplement to fund services
that it has a statutory obligation to provide.</div>
<a name="09012758000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of training and skills, if a proposition was part of a
prospectus that demonstrated an investment in training and skills and
in promoting the economic development of an area, it could be
acceptable for BRS to be an element of such funding. If the hon. Member
for North Cornwall was using amendment 2 to seek such an indication, he
now has it and will not need to press it to a Division.</div>
<a name="09012758000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 46
proposes that BRS revenue could be used only to fund expenditure that
promotes the &#147;economic well-being&#148; of an area,
including</div>
<a name="09012758000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision
of transport infrastructure and the promotion of employment and
employment skills, investment, regeneration, business efficiency and
competitiveness.&#148;</div><a name="09012758000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand why the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst might want
to probe, but the amendment would unnecessarily limit the potential use
of BRS.</div>
<a name="09012758000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
already contains clear and appropriate limitations. Clause 1 makes it
clear that BRS revenue can be spent only on projects that, the
authority has established, contribute to and promote the economic
development of an area. As I said, clause 3 prevents sums raised by BRS
from contributing to the provision of services that a local authority
has a statutory obligation to provide.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div><a name="09012758000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
limitation&#151;or lock, if the Committee wills&#151;is that the
Bill makes it clear that BRS funds cannot be used for expenditure that
the authority would have incurred if it had not established a BRS.
Although limits are appropriate&#151;we have set them out in various
parts of the Bill&#151;we do not want to be too prescriptive or
restrictive on whether a local authority could use BRS revenues.
Provided that the link to economic development can be properly
established, it is right that local authorities should have the freedom
to propose the type of project for which they wish to use BRS
funding.</div><a name="09012758000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Committee will accept that general approach. If members have
detailed views on how to frame guidance, I would encourage them to
submit those views to the consultation that I launched on
Friday.</div>
<a name="09012758000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000501"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I
hope that he will undertake that the Department will be equally
open-minded in its discussion with business over the guidance. If that
is a means whereby this can be achieved, then so be it; I am more
interested in the objective than the means.</div>
<a name="09012758000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000502"></a>John

Committee that I would welcome it if business organisations that wish
to contribute views&#151;either formally, in writing to the
consultation, or during the consultation period&#151;were to approach
us. I encourage my officials to hold such discussions with business
organisations where they have views to contribute on this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000506"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I apologise for the unseemly haste with which I
was seeking to debate this issue under the previous group. These
amendments look further at what may or may not be done with the money
and how it may be used by the organisations that might be involved in
spending it. They are probing amendments and are intended to help us
understand the Government&#146;s point of view.</div>
<a name="09012758000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, provisions under clause 3 allow the GLA, as a levying
authority, to permit other bodies to spend some of that money in
pursuance of a project, but not in other cases. The Minister referred
to passenger transport authorities in other parts of the country, which
are not directly elected and therefore are not intended to be levying
authorities. However, they may well be involved in the spending of
moneys, or the delivery of a scheme. We are seeking to understand how
they might be involved, and whether there are provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>in the Bill to allow for that money to be moved. I am sure that the
Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I am assuming that the
current provisions are there to allow the GLA, for example, to work
with particular boroughs if they are incurring some of the costs of
part of the delivery of a project, so that the money could be
reimbursed to them. If that is the case, we are trying to find out
whether there needs to be flexibility in other parts of the country for
other relevant authorities to spend some of that
money.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000507"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I have heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but I am
not entirely sure what he is driving at. The Minister may be able to
help me, but my understanding is that the references to the GLA in this
context arise because of the particular nature of the relationship
between the GLA and its functional bodies, Transport for London being
the most obvious one in this area. However, it is unique and does not
relate to any situation elsewhere in the country. Perhaps that is the
answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s situation, to some
degree.</div>
<a name="09012758000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000508"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst for trying to assist me. However, despite the amendments
and the remarks by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, neither of which
are clear, I am not sure what he is seeking an answer to. I would
welcome an intervention to clarify that; otherwise, I shall consult the
record and try to sort it out.</div>
<a name="09012758000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000509"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> As a London MP, the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst has clarified some of the issues in this provision. I was
merely seeking to find out whether the Minister felt that there might
be circumstances in other parts of the country where a BRS might be in
operation, where similar arrangements would need to be in place to
allow money to be moved between organisations. I sense that the
Minister is about to find some inspiration on this and I am sure he
will reassure me that these amendments will not be
necessary.</div>
<a name="09012758000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000510"></a>John
Healey:</b> I think that my mind is becoming a little clearer.
We have framed the legislation to allow other local authorities,
singularly or together if they are proposing a BRS, to enter into
arrangements for part of the delivery of a particular project that may
be supported by a BRS in the same way that we are making provision for
the GLA and TfL, which we know will be necessary for the one clearly
BRS-related project that is on the stocks&#151;Crossrail. I am
confident that we have framed the legislation to cover that possibility
were it sensible or required in other areas related to a BRS, but I
shall look again at our provisions if the hon. Gentleman thinks we have
not.</div><a name="09012758000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000511"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, and to the hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst for clarifying the matter. Hon.
Members from at least two parties are keen to see that, with certain
safeguards, other areas of the country may be able to explore the
option. I wanted to ensure that they have similar provisions in place,
allowing them to make best use of it and allowing efficient delivery,
as in the provisions set out for London in the case of Crossrail. With
that reassurance, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>and the Minister&#146;s saying that he will look at the provisions

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000525"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move amendment 8, in
clause 5, page 3, line 35, after
&#145;office&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;, and the
principal offices of any relevant billing
authority,&#146;.</div><a name="09012758000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may seem a minor point, but although we have had discussions about
London and particular circumstances that pertain there, certain
circumstances pertain to rural potential levying authorities as well,
given the great distances involved. The provision in clause 5, as it
stands, sensibly says that a prospectus should be available on the
internet and copies should be available for inspection at the principal
office of the levying authority. That may be a problem in two-tier
authorities&#151;it may well be in London&#151;where the levying
authority is a body at some distance from people. Those people may be
involved in a lengthy, sometimes difficult journey in order to go and
inspect the prospectus, if they do not have the ability to look at it
on the web or if they would prefer to see a hard copy and ask questions
of the relevant officer when they are consulting
it.</div><a name="09012758000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point of my amendment 8 is that the principal offices of the relevant
billing authority should also be in possession of those documents for
people to inspect, so that those living at some distance from county
hall, for example, in a large rural county, where there may not be
particularly regular or frequent public transport, have the opportunity
to consult the documents. The prospectus concerns everybody, so
although the business community will naturally want to have a look,
council tax payers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>too, for example, might want to view the prospectus and contribute to
the general consultation. It is important, therefore, that people
living in the area covered by the levying authority have the maximum
opportunity to inspect the prospectus. It seems sensible, therefore, to
extend the provision of the relevant documents to the offices of
billing authorities as well as to those of the levying
authorities.</div><a name="09012758000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000526"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a fair
point.</div><a name="09012758000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000527"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am also concerned about this matter. I have
already drawn attention to what I consider to be the weakness in the
ability of local authorities to consult properly. Part of that weakness
lies not only in the document produced for consultation but in the
ability to make people aware of such documents. That affects the entire
prospectus issue. Will the Minister consider ways to notify the public
of what is going on in the first place, so that they can visit sites
where the prospectus might be available? Will he also consider
increasing the number of those sites? In rural areas, in particular,
finding out about such matters in the first place is a serious problem,
not to mention getting to the place where the information can be
obtained. In particular, some elderly business people might not be
quite up to using the internet in ways that we might
expect.</div><a name="09012758000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000528"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> The hon. Member for North Cornwall introduced his
amendment by saying that it was a minor one, but it is not, for three
principal reasons: first, because it gives me the opportunity to
welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, and to say what a pleasure it is
to serve under your chairmanship; secondly, because it allows me to
make my maiden voyage in my new role, which it is a pleasure to have;
and thirdly because it gives me the chance to introduce a series of
clauses that set out in more detail some of the requirements contained
in clause 4, which we have not yet had a chance to
discuss.</div><a name="09012758000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 8 would require hard copies of the prospectus to be made available
at the principal offices of the billing authority as well as the
authority proposed in the supplement. We are keen to ensure that
prospectuses are easily accessible during the consultation, which is
why we have required hard copies to be made available at the principal
offices of the levying authority and why electronic copies will need to
be available on that authority&#146;s website. I accept the need for
accessibility, but that need should be balanced with the additional
costs that we expect authorities to meet when proposing a supplement.
Authorities will not be able to recoup the costs of producing and
publishing a prospectus through the BRS&#151;not that anyone is
suggesting that they should. We need to show some restraint, therefore,
in the requirements that we place on authorities.</div>
<a name="09012758000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing is
preventing a good local authority, especially in a rural part of the
country, from doing the very sensible things suggested by the hon.
Members for North Cornwall and for Northampton, South. The latter made
a very good point: we must not all assume that everyone is computer
literate and has access to the web. We expect local authorities to take
note of their points. They know their areas better than we in Whitehall
do. Committee members, whichever side of the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>they sit, do not want us in Whitehall to impose burdens on local
authorities when elected councillors know their communities far better
than we
do.</div><a name="09012758000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are trying to set out an approach that strikes the right balance to
ensure that prospectuses are widely available while keeping costs
minimal. Requiring billing authorities to make copies of the prospectus
available at the principal offices, which the amendment would do, would
increase costs and be prescriptive, but would not necessarily result in
a significant improvement in availability. Making copies available in
the principal offices of the lower-tier authorities could lead to
confusion for ratepayers, who might not realise that the upper-tier
authority&#151;the levying authority&#151;is responsible for the
project. That is a big concern for the Committee. For that reason, I
urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, which is by no means
a minor one.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000529"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am somewhat mystified by the argument that the
Minister is seeking to make. For potentially multi-million pound
projects, we are talking about a bit of photocopying and the provision
of a prospectus. His right hon. Friend the Minister for Local
Government will be well aware that the situation in my local area is
about to change. At present we have six district authorities, which
would be billing authorities, and Cornwall county council, which as the
top tier would be the levying authority if the provisions were enacted.
Providing six copies of the relevant information to bring it that much
closer in a very rural authority such as Cornwall&#151;I use it as an
example because it is the one that I know best&#151;would make a
difference.</div><a name="09012758000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept, of course, that local authorities may choose to provide that
information elsewhere, but the business community, local taxpayers and
so on are used to the billing authority being the authority with which
they interact when paying their bills and having any queries
answered.</div><a name="09012758000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000530"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that what we envisage
and what his example demonstrates is a conversation between businesses
and key stakeholders? His point about rural parts of the country
relates to our hope that stakeholders will join the conversation. Some
people call that consultation; some call it partnership. During the
course of that discussion and consultation, we would expect such points
to be made. We expect that good local authorities, such as the one that
he is fortunate to have in his constituency, would respect the views of
key stakeholders and ensure that copies were available, but does he
believe that we in Whitehall should impose that throughout the
country?</div><a name="09012758000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000531"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Absolutely, just as I believe that we should
impose a ballot, at the risk of being out of order. The provisions are
crucial to ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place so that
people have the opportunity to interact. The Minister rightly points
out that there will be a consultation process, which is to be welcomed.
Were I proposing that every business should be sent a copy of the
prospectus, I might agree that that would be burdensome to the local
authorities involved. However, to say that a copy should be available
nearby at the local authority office for consultation is not
particularly burdensome.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div><a name="09012758000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did not anticipate pressing the amendment to a vote, because I thought

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000545"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I beg to move amendment 35, in
schedule 1, page 22, line 16, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_brev">&#145;11A A description of the
arrangement by which persons paying the BRS shall be represented upon
the governing body of any organisation set up for the purpose of
delivering the objectives of the BRS, or if, such organisation is not
to be set up, how such persons are to be involved in the oversight of
the delivery of those
objectives.&#146;.</div><a name="09012758000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to another measure about which concerns were raised by the
witnesses from the business community who gave oral and written
evidence. We have sought to strengthen the involvement of business,
something that the Ministers have said they desire. I hope that we can
broach it in a constructive spirit.</div>
<a name="09012758000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to an earlier question, the Minister said he hoped that a dialogue
would go on in the drawing up of the BRS schemes. I do not dispute it;
I also hope that that is the case, but we think that it needs to go a
stage further. As well as dialogue beforehand, there needs to be an
ongoing dialogue about the implementation and outworking of the scheme.
If businesses are contributing, in varying degrees, it is important
that they do not lose control once something is signed off and is up
and running. I suspect that it will be in everyone&#146;s interests
to have ongoing business involvement.</div>
<a name="09012758000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s proposals talk in terms of the national project
panel in the drawing-up and creation phase. Obviously, it is not
practical to have that in the implementation phase, but I hope that it
might be possible to ensure that there is business involvement in
implementation, as businesses have skills and experience that they
could bring to bear to ensure that the BRS is rolled out in the most
cost-effective and efficient manner. They would then have a stake in
it, and would be able to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>supplement the skills that local authority and other public bodies have
in that regard, thereby making for collaboration.</div>
<a name="09012758000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
cases, the local authority will propose to deliver the scheme itself,
but in others it might be necessary to set up a special purpose vehicle
to deliver the scheme, particularly if there is an infrastructure
project. Such a vehicle might have a board of directors or some other
governing body; its nature could vary according to the legal status of
the organisation set up to deliver the purpose, or the SPV. We seek a
mechanism whereby business would be represented on and involved in that
governing body, or controlling mind, in relation to delivery as well as
planning. It seems logical to achieve the sort of partnership and
collaboration that I accept Ministers want. That is the
background.</div><a name="09012758000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
hope that the amendment would be a constructive addition to the Bill.
It would not only reinforce business confidence, but bring practical
benefits to both business and the broader community, including council
tax payers, by ensuring that there was efficient outturn for the
project, which will have been given the
go-ahead.</div><a name="09012758000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012758000546"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am sympathetic to what is set out in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment. We have heard at some length how
successful the BIDs model has been, around the country, at delivering
extra investment in a very localised area. In addition to the ballot
issue, which we have addressed, part of that model concerns the ongoing
engagement and involvement of all the funding partners in delivering
the scheme, so that they have confidence that it is being delivered in
accordance with what was originally set out, and so that any slight
variations, or reports on how things are proceeding, are part of
engagement in line with previous consultation.</div>
<a name="09012758000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sympathetic to the idea that a similar case could be made for having
greater involvement in the delivery of a project that a BRS would fund.
We have previously debated, or at least discussed, the fact that we do
not have the tradition of having a core, uniform business rate for
local authorities, but this issue is over and above that. Business is
being asked to contribute, and it is important to have some reassurance
that business will be heard and that we will get the benefit of
business experience. In delivering projects of this kind, it would
undoubtedly be beneficial if local businesses that are strongly engaged
with economic activity had such
opportunities.</div>
<a name="09012758000337"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012758000547"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): Does my hon. Friend agree that there
is also a concept of natural democratic justice in the proposal, which
would involve and use the expertise of local business, thereby gaining
commitment? Given that local business is being required to make an
economic contribution, surely it should have a say in the running of
