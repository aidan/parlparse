<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I have studied the report of the Committee's first sitting with care, and I thank those who included me in the kind remarks that they made about my co-Chairman, Mr. McWilliam. I am grateful for that. I note also that the Committee's proceedings have been conducted with great equanimity. I trust that that will continue.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to set limits on infant class sizes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 4 in page 2, line 4, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) The LEA and the governing body shall exercise their functions in relation to subsection (4) so that no non-infant class in the school is thereby disadvantaged.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the first to speak this morning, Mr. Gale, may I welcome you to the Chair. I am sure that the wise guidance given by Mr. McWilliam will be continued by you.
<P>
I intend to be brief. The amendment is important. When debating the previous group of amendments, both sides agreed that class size matters and that our desire was to see class sizes reduced. The Committee also accepted that although it is important to focus our attention initially on class sizes in key stage 1 the infant years it is also important to have regard to class sizes in key stage 2. Indeed, we referred to evidence showing that class size matters for pupils of all ages in primary and secondary education.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that reductions in class size at key stage 1 do not adversely affect class sizes at key stage 2. The amendment would ensure that, in reducing class sizes in key stage 1, local education authorities and governing bodies would not increase class sizes at key stage 2.
<P>
I remind the Committee that, at column 78 of the report of our previous sitting, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Later, when we discuss amendment No. 5 to clause 2, which has been tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, we shall be giving assurances that we shall monitor and take steps to guarantee that children in junior years are not affected detrimentally by our policy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that, when replying to this brief introduction, the Minister or his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will say what steps the Department intends to take to guarantee that children at key stage 2 will not be detrimentally affected. However, it will not be easy because of the difficulties to be faced at key stage 2. It is interesting to note that, at column 79, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Obviously, as the class size pledge rolls on year by year, it will benefit eight, nine and 10-year-olds." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 11 January 1998; c. 78 and 79.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may or may not be the case. Even if the Government want to see class sizes at key stage 2 reduced, it is possible that the measure will have a detrimental affect. For example, we are well aware that an appeals panel could require a school at key stage 2 to take additional pupils. That may be particularly likely at popular schools, because parents will have tried to get their children into the school at key stage 1 but failed as a result of the class size limit, and will therefore have another go at key stage 2. Admissions appeals panels decide cases at key stage 2 on a different set of rules.
<P>
The funding arrangements for key stage 2 will also be different. Under most local management of schools formula, the smallest amount of money per child is spent at key stage 2. There could be a problem in that, given their limited resources, schools might not be able to reduce class sizes at key stage 2, even if the Government want them to do so. Therefore, there could be a squeeze on key stage 2.
<P>
In several other circumstances, pressure could be put on key stage 2 because of the policy of reducing class sizes at key stage 1 without the comment that we seek in the amendment. I shall be brief to give the Under-Secretary an opportunity to provide the assurances that we seek. If she does not give us those assurances, we will press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
<P>
On Thursday, I referred to concerns expressed by organisations such as the National Association of Head Teachers, which wrote to the Minister about the inflexibility of the policy of class sizes of 30 for five to seven-year-olds. The NAHT also expressed concern about vertical grouping. Conservative Members share the concern of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) about the knock-on effect of the Government's rigid policy not only on five to seven-year-olds but on key stage 2, especially children aged eight. In order to manipulate a policy to restrict class sizes to 30 for five to seven-year-olds, appeal panels or schools might jig the system, which would have a detrimental effect on those aged over seven.
<P>
In an interview on BBC "Spotlight" on Sunday, in which the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) participated, it became clear that vertical grouping is very much in the Government's mind. Clearly, the Government expect vertical grouping to be used to accommodate the rigidity of the policy of limiting class sizes to 30 for five to seven-year-olds, the effects of which will fall on those over the age of seven.
<P>
I shall quote from the transcript of that interview. The interviewer asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What happens to the 31st child?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Devonport replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Rather like what happens now. If the class is getting too large the Head Teacher and the Governors will very often make a decision to move children on into other classes in the school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that will have implications for those aged over seven. The hon. Gentleman continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So a school with a very small number of classes," <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is typical, especially in rural areas 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>say, three or four classes, usually spreads the children round and there is some vertical groupings. That's what happens now."<P>
</UL></FONT>
[Mrs. Angela Browning]
<P>
The interviewer asked a supplementary question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What happens to the 31st child where you have a class limit of thirty and some child living nearby needs to get into the school, are we going to end up with that child being bussed five to 10 miles into the next village?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If that's what the parents wanted, yes. But we would want to see if they could accommodate some children in the group in other classes in the school and that happens now in rural areas."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Government made their election pledge, parents supported it; they thought that, under the policy limiting class sizes to 30 for five to seven-year-olds, additional resources such as an extra classroom and/or an extra teacher would be made available when more than 30 children presented themselves in any locality. We have not completed our consideration of clause 1, but it is already clear that those resources will not be made available. The clause affects not only five to seven-year-olds, but the whole school, including children aged over seven.
<P>
We shall support the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrat party, as we believe that the Government are playing a game with the electorate. They made a pledge that they could not honour, so they are now contriving to deliver it through vertical groupings, by filling empty places, and by obliging parents to transport very young children across large distances early in the morning and late in the afternoon. It would be helpful to know from the Under-Secretary whether vertical groupings are officially part of Government policy or whether the hon. Member for Devonport was off-message on Sunday.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> Along with other Labour Members, I welcome you, Mr. Gale, to the Chair and hope that you enjoy the Committee's deliberations. Like the hon. Member for Bath, I, too, shall be brief, especially as my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to some of the points raised when we consider amendment No. 5.
<P>
We are sympathetic to the thinking behind amendment No. 4, in that we would not expect schools to accommodate the pledge on class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds by increasing class sizes at key stage 2. Nevertheless, I shall ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, as we do not think that it represents the best way in which to achieve the hon. Gentleman's aim.
<P>
Given the horrific picture draw by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) of how we would implement our policy, I should stress that, in costing the pledge on class sizes of 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds, we made no assumption that class sizes would increase for other year groups in the primary phase. The resources that we secured for key stage 1 class sizes were not dependent on a switch of money from key stage 2. As my hon. Friend the Minister said last Thursday, we have made available to schools an extra œ835 million, some of which will be spent on key stage 2 pupils.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will accept those assurances. It is not our intention that the pledge should be delivered through an increase in class sizes at key stage 2, but we do not want to tackle the problem by accepting the amendment. We will be able to monitor class sizes at key stage 2 through local education authority statements the plans funded under clause 3. Although we do not want to proceed in the way suggested by the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we are sympathetic to the principle behind it and that he will withdraw it. If not, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response. I gave her the opportunity to explain how she would ensure that the policy would not result in an increase in class sizes at key stage 2. Her response was to say that the Government did not expect that to happen. She also said that the costings for reducing class sizes at key stage 1 did not rely on any transfer of funds from key stage 2. That may be so, but many of us are not convinced that the costings for key stage 1 were right in the first place. To say that it is not the Government's intention to transfer funds is not an assurance or an explanation of how the policy will be implemented.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the Government would monitor the statements produced by local education authorities and, in the early days, consider their plans before offering funding. If the Government do not state that they will not fund a plan of which they do not approve, they will have some difficulty.
<P>
More importantly, I hope that before long money will not be subject to a bidding system whereby local education authorities' plans may be accepted, but become a normal part of local authority funding, which authorities will have the right to determine how they spend. The Minister said earlier that the Government have no intention of imposing class size limits at key stage 2. We have heard none of the assurances that I have been seeking.

<P>

<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I was intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's comment. He appeared to be disagreeing with the Government's policy, which is to give money by specific grant for the direct purpose of reducing class size. Is he saying that Liberal Democrat policy is simply to allocate money to local authorities, which they could use for whatever purpose they chose whether the reduction of class size or preparing a grand suite of offices for the mayor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not know of many examples of authorities preparing grand suites of offices for mayors. Our policy is clear; I explained it in relation to previous amendments. We would place a statutory limit on class sizes for all primary school classes key stage 1 and key stage 2. That would then be one of the many requirements that local education authorities were expected to meet. How they chose to do that would be up to them to decide within their funding limits.
<P>
The problem with the way in which the Government have sought to introduce their policies is that in many cases it involves a separate bidding process. Local education authorities find that they have to bid for funds against each other. We would prefer a fair allocation of resources and a legislative framework that set requirements for local education authorities to meet. Authorities should be able to decide how best to use their resources to meet the requirements.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in the interview I cited earlier on "Spotlight", the Liberal Democrat leader of Somerset county council, Chris Clarke, was asked about how his LEA would deliver the pledge of 30 to a class. He was asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So you're behind Labour, are you?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Clarke replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No. They give with one hand and take back with the other."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no extra money no increase next year to pay for them."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When asked whether the pledge was deliverable, that council leader said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No. There is not enough money."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Foster:</B> Well, that simply backs up what I said about whether the Government have got their sums right, but that may be an appropriate subject for another debate. The Government have certainly tried to hype up the amount of additional money that is going to education. Local education authorities certainly do not feel that they are benefiting from some surprise pot of gold.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): I want to get the point about money absolutely clear. In order to achieve the maximum class size of 30 for ages 11 and below, a Liberal Democrat Government would have to introduce legislation that made it absolutely clear that local authorities had to use the money on that provision, not on special needs or discretionary grants, for example. I am talking, not about mayor's parlours, but about the totality of the education budget. The country needs to know how precise the Liberal Democrat pledge is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman it is nice to have a speaking Whip in Committee; it makes a pleasant change. Surely the hon. Gentleman is aware that local education authorities have for many years had a large number of responsibilities imposed on them by Government. They use the money that they are given in my view, it often is not enough to fulfil their legislative requirements. That applies to the delivery of the national curriculum, to the way in which their support services operate and to their school meals obligations. Previous Conservative and Labour Governments have imposed a raft of legislation on LEAs, yet the Bill proposes to impose additional requirements on class sizes, at least for key stage 1. I should prefer LEAs to be responsible for such requirements and for other requirements, and to be able to decide how best to deliver them.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> It is not clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The whole way in which LEAs operate, presumably, is not clear to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Madel).
<P>
When we debate amendment No. 5, we shall press the Minister for assurances on how he will ensure that children on key stage 2 are not disadvantaged by the Government's policies on key stage 1. Although I have been disappointed by his responses thus far, in the hope that he will be able to offer us assurance in relation to amendment No. 5, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I appreciate that it takes hon. Members a little time to warm up, literally and metaphorically, but I allowed the previous debate to range a little wider than I might otherwise have done and I also allowed a couple of lengthy interventions. I am watching.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in Clause 1, page 2, line 4, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) Regulations under this section shall make provision enabling the governing body of any maintained school to disapply the provision of this section from its school, if such disapplication be supported in a ballot by the majority of parents of children for the time being in the school.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This may be the final opportunity under the clause to give parents the powers that the Secretary of State seeks to take to himself. The amendment proposes that governing bodies should be able to disapply provision of the clause if they are supported by a majority of parents in a ballot. We want the Government to take account of the fact that parents and governing bodies know far better than the Secretary of State or local LEA what they require in their school.
<P>
As parents and governing bodies will be particularly affected by the clause, I make no apology for again drawing attention to the position in rural primary schools. Ministers have not given a substantive answer to the question of the 31st child in a class. The amendment would allow parents and governing bodies some flexibility, subject to a democratic ballot, when making such decisions. Opposition Members will support the Bill's provisions that build on the improvement in standards achieved by the previous Government and will support the Government in improving standards where they are seen to be failing. If, after a democratic ballot, parents and governing bodies exercised their right to vary the Bill's provisions to give some flexibility over class size and standards within the age group covered by key stage 1, but standards still fell, questions would rightly be asked and solutions delivered. We know from existing data, however, that the magic figure of 30, which does not appear in the Bill, is not always the determining factor in achieving high standards and is not always a target that all parents want. Other factors the quality and standard of the teacher, parental preferences, the need in rural primary schools sympathetically to consider the exact number that there should be in a class must be taken into account.
<P>
It is something of a dilemma that the Secretary of State shold feel that he knows better than parents. Later in the Bill for instance, in clause 77 the Government say that parental preference is important, and they have built mechanisms into the Bill to allow that to be expressed. However, that seems not to apply to parents of children aged between five and seven.
<P>
The Government should trust parents and governing bodies they know their schools only too well. If a[Mrs. Browning]
school is failing, intervention is needed (Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Not all schools are run by Labour councillors from Lambeth. There are some excellent schools in other parts of the country that have not been subjected to Labour or Liberal Democrat LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): When will those ballots take place? Will the 31st child trigger a ballot? If so, what is that child to do sit outside the gate while the ballot take place?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> No. Governing bodies, on which parents are represented, should have the flexibility to decide whether to disapply that part of the Bill. They should be able to do so as part of their normal work, and not have to wait until the 31st child applies. If the Government allowed that flexibility, schools could make a corporate decision about whether or not to apply for a parental ballot. I do not suggest that they should wait until there is a crisis. The question asked by the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) 
<P>
Several hon. Members rose 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am already replying to an intervention. I shall allow others to intervene in a moment. The very fact that the hon. Gentleman felt the need to ask about the 31st child shows that it would be a crisis point a crisis precipitated by the rigidity of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> Bearing in mind the ill feeling stirred up by the ballots on grant-maintained status, which resulted in the Secretary of State being asked to investigate and to rerun the ballots, and bearing in mind also the proliferation of ballots that would result from the amendment, does the hon. Lady envisage LEAs having a class-size ballot department to supervise the ballots, or the Department for Education and Employment having a class-size ballot section to monitor them? Has she made an estimate of the likely cost?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that we shall come later to ballots for grammar schools. The Minister sent me details about that on two full sheets of A4 paper setting out the complexity of the Government's policy. A ballot in a primary school on one key issue is a simple matter. It could be conducted democratically within the school, supervised by the governing body.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned ballots for grant-maintained schools, but the hon. Member for Devonport knows only too well, as he frequently interfered in such matters in my constituency [Interruption.] Labour Members look askance, but in the previous Parliament the hon. Gentleman, whose constituency is about 60 miles from mine, rose on the Floor of the House to discuss a specific ballot in one of my primary schools. He and his friends in the Labour party and the trade unions busybodied themselves in everyone else's ballots.
<P>
The hon. Member for Waveney seems genuinely to believe that parents are not responsible enough to make such a decision for themselves in a ballot supervised by a governing body. That is indicative of what we see from clause 1 to the end of the Bill that the Secretary of State and the Government do not trust the democratic process.

<P>

<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am already responding to an intervention. The Government do not trust parents or governors; they want to take back the power to the centre so that they have the say, not the parents or the governors.
<P>
Now, who was next?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): The hon. Lady has said that an expectation of parents, when voting for the Labour party last May and for its pledge in respect of the provision, was that it would be applied rapidly to schools throughout all sectors. Let us suppose that a ballot resulted in a 55:45 vote in favour of disallowing class limits and that the reaction of the sizeable minority was such that those parents lost confidence in the school governors or, even worse, threatened to withdraw their children from the school. How would the hon. Lady cope with that situation?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> That very question will be facing parents in the future. It will be part of the everyday decision-making process of parents who believe that the local school is right for their children. They could be satisfied with the school's standards, its locality or even because they attended that school. For whatever reason parents chose a particular school for their child, they will be turned away because of the dogma and rigidity of the Secretary of State who thinks that he knows better than them. For example, parents of children in a particular primary school may decide that flexibility should be built into the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough) rose 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene in a moment. Quite a queue is building up.
<P>
Given their knowledge of how a particular school works, parents may decide that 33 is a reasonable class size and that flexibility can be applied. However, the Secretary of State is saying that parents should not be allowed to make such decisions under the democratic process and that he knows what is best for each primary school class throughout the country. That is wrong. Experience has shown that parents know their schools better than the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): Will the hon. Lady clarify the wording of the amendment? It states that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the majority of parents of children for the time being in the school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Presumably, she thinks that all parents have the right of choice. Each year a school has a new intake and, thus, a new set of parents. Does not the amendment imply that a ballot would have to be held each year? If the new intake of parents did not vote in the same way as the majority of parents had voted the previous year, would not the 31st-plus child have to change schools?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> No. The status quo would obviously apply to all children in the school at the time. There would clearly be provision for the ballot to be revisited. Under the amendment, the ballot should apply in the first instance, particularly to those parents who had children in the school at the time. In other words, one would not have to widen the franchise to parents of children on the waiting list or of those who had been through the school. We wanted to make it specific that the provision would apply to parents of children in the school at that time.
<P>
The democratic process in such a ballot, as in any other type of ballot, is that if there were a change of mind to alter what had been agreed previously as happens in general elections the majority has its say, as a result of which processes are changed. Under the Bill, parents will have no say. They will be obliged to do what the Secretary of State wants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Has the hon. Lady finished her speech or is she giving way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am not sure, Mr. Gale; it seems such a long time since I began my speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Lady giving way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am a little confused about who will be balloted. We are discussing a reception class the first year of nursery education. Surely it is those parents who send their children to the school who should be balloted on whether they want their children educated in a class of more than 30 against the wishes of the Secretary of State. Therefore, how can it be decided which parents in, say, an urban locality are included in the ballot?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It is quite simple. We have stated in the amendment that those involved should be,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>parents of children for the time being in the school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For the reasons that I gave, we do not want to extend our proposal to a wider group of parents because we want to keep it simple.
<P>
A matter of principle is involved whether the Government accept that parents should have the right, through a democratic process, to vary a rigid requirement. If that principle is accepted, we would be happy to consider the details the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Under the amendment, parents of rising fives could express a preference for which primary school they wanted their children to attend, knowing that the parents with children at that school had decided that there should be flexibility around the number of 30. Parents who did not agree with such flexibility could choose a different school. Parents, especially those who knew the school's track record, would know that the parents and governors had decided flexibility for good reasons perhaps they could cope with larger classes by providing an extra classroom assistant depending on the number above 30. That would produce the sort of result, in the ethos of the school, that the parents wanted. Are the Government interested in listening to parents and giving them powers, or does the Secretary of State want to keep all such powers rigidly to himself?
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Can the hon. Lady explain the difference in thinking that has transformed the Conservative party since leaving office? Can she explain the difference in being rigid in government about the number allowed to be in a nursery class, for example, and not allowing parents to vote to have nursery classes that are not properly staffed, and a Government who are saying that there must be proper staffing in infant classes? What is the difference in principle between what they decided and supported in government and are now saying in opposition? If they support parental power, why did not the previous Government give parents greater powers in a huge number of issues for example, in the national curriculum on whether schools should have a morning assembly?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is refreshing to discover that so many Back Benchers want to take part in the debate, but I remind hon. Members that the purpose of an intervention is to put a point briefly to the hon. Member who is speaking. It has been difficult at times in this debate to determine who is speaking and who is intervening. Hon. Members should keep interventions to a normal length. If they then wish to make speeches, I am sure that they will be able to catch my eye.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I will be brief, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I am happy to stand on the previous Government's record of devolving powers down to governing bodies and parents. The previous Government changed education from the calibre of governors to the concept of parental choice. Under the Bill, the Government want to claw back those key matters on which parents and governing bodies now take decisions for themselves. As our debates continue, we shall see that that is the tenet of the Bill it is taking power back to the centre.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> What is the difference 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I would like to reply to the hon. Gentleman, Mr. Gale. The point about the staffing ratios in infant and nursery classes is clear. There is flexibility in infant classes. The hon. Gentleman will know that in classes of over 30, very often it is those extra two, three of four pupils who produce the funding for the infant teacher to have a classroom assistant. What has become very clear as this clause has been discussed outside the House, and from the sort of feedback we have had from classroom teachers, is that the rigidity of the clause will mean that there will be one teacher with a class of 30, but no classroom assistant because of a lack of funding.
<P>
Last weekend, one primary teacher said that if the clause is carried as I am sure it will be that would mean a loss of œ20,000 to his school. So when the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) talks about the pupil-teacher ratios, especially in infant classes, he should be aware that the Bill will mean less money for schools and fewer teachers and classroom assistants.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): The debates on clause 1 have shown exactly how much new Labour is committed to the good old socialist belief that the[Mrs. Theresa May]
bureaucrat knows best. The core of our amendment, however, is that parents and governors know what is best for the children in their area. It would give parents and governors the flexibility to determine how education is provided in infant classes and to decide whether the statutory limit imposed by the Secretary of State is appropriate to their schools or whether, in the particular circumstances, it should be disapplied.
<P>
I shall comment briefly on some of the issues that the proposal raises. The first relates to vertical grouping, which I have mentioned in previous sittings and which my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) referred to this morning. I illustrate my point by using the example of an infant school in my constituency that has replaced vertical grouping with year groups, much to the delight of teachers and parents. When, on a recent visit, I asked the head teacher and chairman of the governors how they thought that they could accommodate the limit on class sizes, they said that, because there were class sizes of 32 or 33 in year groups, the limit would be impractical and that they would have to return to vertical grouping.
<P>
Vertical grouping is a sensitive topic. It can work well in some circumstances but there are real concerns about its educational correctness my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton mentioned those expressed by the National Association of Head Teachers. The amendment would enable parents and governors of a school that faces the prospect of having to introduce vertical grouping to meet the statutory limit to say that they do not feel that that would be right for the school. They would have the flexibility to disapply the limit and choose to operate in the way that they have found to be best for the children in the area.
<P>
The issue is whether the Secretary of State or parents and governors know best what is right for infant school children in an area such as my constituency. Many people who put their faith in new Labour and its education policies will be disappointed to discover that new Labour is no different from old socialist Labour in thinking that bureaucrats, rather than parents and governors, know what is best for children.
<P>
The amendment would provide governing bodies and parents with a reasonable degree of flexibility to choose, for practical and educational reasons, not to impose the limit for example, when resources have not been made available for the extra classroom or teacher. Under the amendment, a school that is worried about what will happen to its children will have the flexibility to decide what is best whether children should attend that school rather than, as the hon. Member for Devonport suggested over the weekend, be bussed to a different school some miles away or whether vertical grouping should be introduced. Parents and governing bodies will be able to say what is right for the children in their schools.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I fundamentally disagree with the amendment and with what the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) has said. Liberal Democrat Members regard the amendment as a wrecking amendment. It would undermine the very principle of a class size limit of 30. Once that principle is breached, the essence of the clause is undermined. Many of us have been fighting for a great many years for a Government to introduce such legislation.
<P>
Would there be any limit under the amendment? The amendment does not state a limit of 31 the limit could be up to 41 if governors and parents so decided. Is there a specific limit at which Conservative Members feel that the education of children in a class would be affected? The amendment leaves a question mark over the issue of class size. I thought that the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) had admitted that class size matters, and that Conservatives now accepted that it is fundamental to delivering quality education in primary schools.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I made it clear on Tuesday that I acknowledge that class size is an issue of course we acknowledge that. The hon. Gentleman said that he regarded the amendment as a wrecking amendment. What he means by that is that if parents choose to allow a more flexible regime in particular school, his view, or that of the Secretary of State, should be more important in the management of that school than the views of the parents whose children attend that school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I draw his attention to the 50-plus pieces of legislation affecting what happens in our schools introduced between 1979 and 1997. The effect of a great deal of the legislation introduced by the Conservatives was not to give parents greater choice and greater say although I acknowledge that that was the effect of some of it but to impose a great deal of what happens in our schools. I remind the right hon. gentleman of the over-prescription of the original national curriculum and of other mistakes that were made. We need to get the balance right, and I will explain to him why the amendment is a wrecking amendment.
<P>
We want the new Government not only to have pledge cards in their pockets to hand out at election time but to deliver what they promised last year. The Minister smiles 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister is looking in his pocket for his card, or perhaps he has his times tables in there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am glad that the cards are so durable.
<P>
However, we do not want the Government to have an easy ride on the issue. The amendment would let the Government and LEAs off the hook; it would provide the option of breaking the commitment to class sizes of 30. It would be a fudge; that is why it is a wrecking amendment. It would also make it difficult for an LEA to plan to honour the pledge for class sizes for primary schools at key stage 1 in this Parliament. We want to hold the Government to that commitment.
<P>
The principal reason why we oppose the amendment is because we as a party are opposed to the whole principle of ballots.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman say ballots or balance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am talking about parental ballots for schools. We do not believe that ballots can successfully reflect the whole issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I think that the record will show that the hon. Gentleman said, "As a party, we are opposed to the whole principle of ballots." Just so that we do not misunderstand him, would the hon. Gentleman repeat his point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, who has given me a lesson on accuracy. I am talking about ballots over schools because it is an important issue and one that we long fought his Government over indeed, we would fight the present Government over it if they tried to introduce it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Could I clarify the matter? In saying that the Liberal Democrats are opposed to parental ballots, is the hon. Gentleman saying that parents, as a collective body, should not be asked their views on any issue involving the running of a school? If they do not support ballots, they are presumably saying that there is no issue about which they believe parents' views should be sought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We do not believe that it is right for parents to be balloted on the entry or otherwise of a child from another family. If I may give the hon. Lady a clear example: if a child from a difficult family or with special educational needs, particularly behavioural difficulties, came to a school as would be the case in many urban areas it would be wrong for parents, knowing the circumstances, suddenly to be asked to be balloted on whether they wanted that child in. That is one of the principal reasons we are opposed to that form of ballot.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am sorry if I did not explain my amendment as clearly as I might have done. The amendment is clearly about the principle of parents being able to hold a ballot to decide whether they wish to apply flexibility to the legislation that we assume it is not specified in the Bill will state that the maximum class size will be 30 pupils. It is not about parents having individual ballots that deal on a case-by-case basis with individual children. It is the principle of those parents being able to say that, while the law specifies a maximum of 30, in particular circumstances, they think that 33 or 34, or whatever number it happens to be, can be accommodated without disadvantaging the other children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Lady makes the very point that I was making. The amendment proposes that the ballot will be decided on the basis of an individual child and individual parent, and that is what will decide whether a particular child can go to a particular school. That is why we oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I was fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's contribution, for several reasons. I had for a long time laboured under the misapprehension that the Liberal Democrats believed in some form of local decision making. I was hoping to intervene, but sadly my colleagues got there before me and then the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) sat down and denied me the opportunity. The point that I would particularly have liked to pursue was that of the Liberal Democrats' objection in principle to parental ballots; does the same logic extend to the belief that local communities, through local democracy, are incapable of making such decisions? It would have been most interesting to see whether the Liberal Democrats believe that such matters should always be centrally directed from Whitehall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the Liberal Democrat party is, perhaps more than any other, the party that believes in the importance of democracy. We have refined and developed a range of policies on where decisions are best taken on particular issues. For example, we believe that the decision about whether there should be flexibility on class size would best be taken by the democratically elected local education authority.
<P>
We shall later debate proposals on the future of grammar schools. The Government have a proposal, which the Conservatives will no doubt support, to allow parental ballots on their future. We believe that the local, democratically elected local education authority is best placed to make that decision, but that would not prevent the opportunity for widescale consultation with local people. I apologise for such a long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I cannot, of course, speak for the Chair, but I am grateful for such a long intervention, even though it was inexplicit and left me little the wiser. If I heard him correctly, the hon. Gentleman said that he believed that class sizes should be a matter for the local education authority. Yet that is not specified in the Bill and, as far as I am aware, the Liberal Democrats have not tabled amendments to that effect it would have been interesting had they done so. I am a democrat and tend to believe in ballots as a matter of principle. I would welcome any shift from the gross inflexibility in the Bill, which seeks to impose a rigid class size of 30 regardless of whether local parents want it. [Interruption.] Any change a ballot of parents or of the wider community would be in the spirit of the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is an undercurrent of murmuring throughout the Committee. Hon. Members are entitled to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The two Liberal Democrat members of the Committee were responsible for the undercurrent of murmuring; they clearly needed to have a serious discussion on the point.
<P>
I emphasise that any shift to greater flexibility and greater local decision making contrary to the sweep and thrust of the Bill, which in so many areas, particularly the measure on class sizes, imposes an inflexible limit decided by the Secretary of State would be welcome. Just as I would welcome a comparable measure that gave the local education authority the right to vary the class size if the local community wished, I would have wished and hoped that the Liberal Democrats would have supported our amendment, which also gives greater power to the local community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that if the Liberal Democrats later table an amendment giving effect to the principle that the hon. Member for Bath just espoused, I am sure that it would secure his support and that of all our hon. and right hon. Friends? In the spirit of the Committee, I hope that the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Bath, may be able to attract support from elsewhere in the House for the important principle that there should be greater flexibility to reflect local circumstances. That is an important principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I very much welcome the support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. As an independent-minded Member, who seeks to represent my constituents, it is a great pleasure when my Front Bench colleagues offer such rapid and complete support for my exposition of Conservative policy. I cannot help reflecting that it is instructive to observe the difference between Conservative Members, who have a consistency of principle we are able to arrive at such points of agreement among ourselves precisely because we believe in the principle that parents should decide how their children are educated and some other members of the Committee, who have considerable difficulty in reaching such agreement. They have no coherent principle, but instead display a sort of variable geometry.
<P>
I apologise to Liberal Democrat Members. I am not in the habit of spending so much time discussing them or their policies. Although I am very used, at the local level, to Liberal Democrats adopting completely different policies from those that they espouse at Westminster, I have been amused and intrigued to see the extent to which Liberal Democrat Members also espouse different principles in Parliament.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In the light of what we have heard, does not my hon. Friend think that it is strange that the Liberal Democrat members of the Committee have supported the Government when they have deigned to challenge the Bill, they have withdrawn their amendments yet leaders of Liberal Democrat-run county councils such as Somerset say openly that they do not support the Labour policy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are all used to party political skirmishing. We are discussing the balloting of parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. If I may say so, despite your admonition to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton, I am grateful to her. The point about the difference at local level is also well made by the issue of grammar schools. The Liberal Democrats in Altrincham appear to support grammar schools. However, I suspect that that is a matter for future discussion.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrow, East asked about the practicalities of ballots when they would take place, and so on. I found that remarkable, given the Government's general reluctance to include such details in the Bill. The Bill gives no details of how ballots on grammar schools will take place. It is instructive that Labour Members expect a higher standard of openness about detail from the Opposition than they do from their Government. I would welcome more detail in the Bill on a whole range of measures, but we cannot be accused of hiding the detail of the balloting procedure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) said that ballots cause acrimony among parents and local communities. That is far from being the experience in my constituency. In the ballot in my old school, Altrincham grammar school, in which 78 per cent. of parents voted, 74 per cent. of parents voted for grant-maintained status. There was no acrimony; there was a high degree of consensus that that was the way forward for the school. The school has indeed been highly successful since that decision was taken.
<P>
That reinforces the principle that local communities and parents are best able to take decisions about how their schools are run and how their children are educated. I support the amendment because, as far as I can see, the Bill makes little concession to the important principle of parental choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was going to warmly welcome you, Mr. Gale, to our proceedings, but given the temperature in the Room this morning, that is rather difficult. However, I am sure that we are all looking forward to your chairmanship and guidance.
<P>
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) say that parents should decide on these matters. We therefore look forward to his support when we come to the clauses that give parents the right to decide whether or not there is a selective system of education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the consistent principle that I stressed in my remarks. I would be happy for that matter to be decided by local democracy and to see borough councils making that decision, as they did in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> So the hon. Gentleman will support our amendment!
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As I have failed to entice the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West to support the Government, he may, as the hon. Member for Bath suggests, want to support the Liberal Democrat amendment on that matter.
<P>
I know that the matter of the 31st child is important to all members of the Committee. When we reach clause 77, we will explain exactly how the admissions arrangements will operate. I will then explain what steps the Government will be taking to ensure that there is no adverse effect on a 31st, 32nd or 33rd child. We can offer those children, as well as the 27th or 28th child, the benefits of the policy. I will explain how that can be achieved when we reach clause 77, because it follows directly from our proposed arrangements for admission.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether clause 77 will allow an appeal panel to determine that the 31st or 32nd child should be given a place at a school, notwithstanding the statutory limit on class sizes imposed by the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I doubt whether you, Mr. Gale, will let me speak for long on what may or may not be in clause 77. Clause 1 gives the Secretary of State a power by regulation to place a limit. Clause 77 deals with the admissions procedures that flow from that. That is where the question of the 31st or 32nd child will be addressed. On behalf of the Government, I will then give details of how we shall accommodate the 31st or 32nd child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I accept that the Minister does not want to enlarge on clause 77 indeed, Mr. Gale, you would not allow it however, the amendment would allow parents to disapply the provision on class size following a ballot. My hon. Friend the Minister for Tiverton and Honiton made it clear that the amendment seeks to allow flexibility in dealing with what the Minister calls the question of the 31st child. Do the Government recognise the need to ensure that, whatever regime is put in place, it should be sufficiently flexible to deal with the 31st child and that that must sometimes mean class sizes of more than 30? Is that what the Minister is announcing? If so, it is important and germane to our discussion of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, I am not announcing that. I am indicating that, within the admissions procedures that we shall bring forward, we will implement the pledge that we gave at the general election there will be no five, six or seven-year-old in a class of more than 30. However, we believe that we can achieve that without creating the sort of difficulties that have been referred to by the Opposition. I am afraid that hon. Members will have to wait until we reach the relevant clause to discuss admissions and how the admissions panels will operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Committee is debating clause 1 and being asked to consider the implementation of a key election pledge, yet that pledge can be implemented only through the admission of individual children to schools. We are now being told that although the principle is introduced in clause 1, our debate on the implementation of that principle as it applies to individual children must wait until we reach clause 77. That is unsatisfactory.
<P>
I return to the question, which I asked in the context of amendment No. 61. In response to my question, the Minister said that he would not announce that there would be classes of more than 30. However, if parents want their child to be admitted to a particular school and into a class of more than 30, the Government, through the Minister, will have imposed a second preference on those parents and on that child.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I accept that there is an overlap between the matters covered in clause 77 and clause 1, but I believe that it is possible for the Minister to respond within the bounds imposed by the amendment and for hon. Members to phrase their questions within that context. I shall therefore be as generous as I can to both sides.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful for that ruling, Mr. Gale, because it will allow me to deal with some of the issues that we shall discuss in detail when we reach clause 77.
<P>
Conservative Members seem to assume that the 31st child will have to be turned away from the school gates. Even with my poor numeracy skills, I can work out that 16 plus 15 equals 31. Schools could possibly be organised in classes of 16 and 15 which would meet the Government's pledge to the electorate. That will make it a more expensive pledge to meet, because such an arrangement will need an extra teacher and incur additional capital costs.
<P>
The Committee will be provided with those details when we reach clause 77. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Charnwood and other Conservative Members will await them with interest. The pledge can be delivered by using the money that will be freed up from phasing out the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Say that again with a straight face.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The figures are very clear. I am smiling because I know that the pledge can be delivered. I am pleased that our policy will benefit 400,000 young people, rather than just the 38,000 pupils who benefit from the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I am worried that the numeracy powers of the Department are failing so fast that the Government cannot grasp the implication of suggesting that there could be classes of 15 or 16 instead of 31 pupils. The cost implications of implementing such a policy would surely exceed the money being freed up from the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If the hon. Gentleman took account of the considerable sum that will be freed up from the assisted places scheme, he would realise that that money will enable classes of 31 or 32 to be divided in two, so providing extra places and delivering our pledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister give an absolute assurance that the only money used to meet the pledge will be that released from phasing out the assisted places scheme and that we should take no note of the Under-Secretary's reference to an additional œ835 million being made available? That œ835 million will not be used to meet the class size reduction pledge.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall deal with funding released by phasing out the assisted places scheme in later debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We have made it clear that the recurrent costs of delivering the pledge to have classes of 30 or fewer for five, six or seven-year-olds during this Parliament can be met from phasing out the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Not the capital the recurrent costs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We can meet the recurrent funding costs of delivering the class size pledge from phasing out the assisted places scheme. We have been consistent on that the pledge can, and will, be delivered.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Minister give an assurance that, despite having to work within strict limits, the[Mr. St. Aubyn]
number of mixed-age classes will not increase? Surely there will be a temptation, or a necessity within some schools, to move children up or down a year to meet the rigid limit rather than opting for the much more expensive option of having classes of 15 or 16 pupils.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that the amendment deals with the balloting of parents, and the debate must be restricted to that. I know that it is tempting to discuss issues beyond the scope of the amendment, but the rules of debate are clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We can all understand frustration about the way in which Committee proceedings have to take their course. Obviously, later clauses have an impact on this debate. Given the Chairman's guidance, we must restrict ourselves to the specific matter under debate. However, I thought it helpful, given the context of the debate, to say that we shall provide details when we debate the relevant classes.
<P>
I can understand the principles that underpin the amendment. The Government have no problem with parental ballots indeed, we shall propose them when dealing with grammar schools and selective or non-selective education. However, the amendment is flawed because it would deny opportunities to those who want their children to enter a school I believe that we can overcome such problems while giving votes to parents whose 10-year-olds attend the school and who are not affected by the class-size pledge.
<P>
The amendment would undermine the principle of reducing class sizes to 30 or fewer pupils. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton will withdraw the amendment. In case she does not, I invite the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> That was an unsatisfactory response. The purpose of the amendment is to build flexibility into the system through the balloting of parents. The Minister is now saying that the amendment is not necessary because when we reach clause 77 he will identify to the Committee those solutions that would overcome the inflexibility of such a system. I must remind members of the Committee of the concern that we expressed at the start of the sitting. We talked about the lack of draft regulations, codes of practice and other details that are pertinent to the clauses that we shall have to debate and vote on before the substance of the Minister's argument is revealed to the Committee. That is a classic example of the problems we are faced with by not having the appropriate information made available to us.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Minister is saying that our concerns, which are reflected in the amendment, will be dealt with later in our proceedings, it is extraordinary notwithstanding your comments, Mr. Gale, about the relevance of the clause as opposed to clause 77 that such information was not circulated in advance of this sitting. May I ask the Minister, through you, Mr. Gale, that in future he does as he promised to do at our first sitting, which is to make such information available in a written format in advance of the Committee having to discuss such matters? Clearly, the hon. Gentleman has relevant information to hand that will be made available later, but he has denied us the opportunity to examine it in the context of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall reaffirm the commitment that I gave at our first sitting when I highlighted those provisions where draft principles would be laid before members of the Committee. We shall honour that commitment and pledge in relation to those specific points to which I referred in our first sitting.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister's response to our amendment has been typical of the Labour party's approach to any difficult or specific question that it is asked, whether in the Committee or elsewhere. That response is, "Trust us. All will be revealed later." That is not satisfactory. The matter is far too important and we shall press the amendment to a Division.

I refer first to parental choice in respect of denominational schools.

We come back to the vexed issue of what happens if the threshold of 30 has been reached and there is no other school of the same denomination within a reasonable distance. We want the Bill specifically to deal with that problem, especially as an admissions panel may agree that a child should be admitted to a school for that reason.
<P>
In discussing the previous amendment, the Minister described his formula for dividing classes and providing an extra classroom and an extra teacher. If he can promise that as a pledge, it could resolve some of the issues raised by the amendments. It is incumbent on him notwithstanding clause 77, to set out how he intends to give parents who express a denominational preference the opportunity to send their children to the school of their choice.
<P>
We should also take into account the question of siblings children whose brothers or sisters have gone through a school. It is not just a question of practicalities. Parents and children often work together, especially in the rising five age groups. When children begin to go to school full time, they gain confidence by becoming familiar with the school and by looking at the pattern of what a sibling is doing. It is important that the second or third brother or sister is reassured that he or she will attend the same primary school as his or her siblings. Such children are profoundly concerned that they will be divided from their siblings.
<P>
The amendments also deal with the distance that a child may have to travel to find an alternative place. We want to ensure that there is some flexibility when no alternative place, especially at a denominational school, is available within a reasonable distance. When the Minister replies, it would be very helpful if, instead of telling us to wait and see, he gave us substantive answers to the questions about distance, siblings and denominational preference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We will not support the amendments 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am not surprised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Lady is not surprised. There is little evidence that parents opt for a school at key stage 1 because it is denominational, although we accept that some parents do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If I may make a little progress first, I shall then gladly give way. In North Yorkshire the authority that covers my constituency there are many village schools, a large proportion of which are denominational. Parents send their children to those schools primarily because they are the local village schools although, as I said, we fully accept that some parents seek out a denominational school.
<P>
Yesterday, I asked Bishop David of Ripon, who heads the Church of England education team in the House of Lords, about the Church of England bishops' view on the amendment. Their view is simple: they want the amendment to be opposed. Like the Catholic bishops, the Church of England bishops support the principle of reducing class sizes to 30 in all schools, including denominational schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is embarrassing his hon. Friend the Member for Bath and his party this morning. He said not only that he was opposed to ballots on principle, but that ther record will bear this out there is little evidence that parents opt for denominational schools on a denominational basis.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman must take parental choice more seriously than that. The amendment does not deal with parents who chose denominational or non-denominational schools for other reasons. The point is that parents who choose primary education from a school with a religious basis whether it is Church of England, Catholic, Muslim or Jewish should have their choice respected. During our first sitting, I made the point that parents who choose a non-religious basis for their child's primary education should also have their choice respected. If the hon. Gentleman is to be consistent with his party's principles, he must surely take parental choice and the basis for that choice more seriously than he has done twice during this morning's sitting.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind Front Benchers that they have the opportunity to make speeches, so interventions must be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is deliberately trying to misrepresent my views 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members do not deliberately seek to misrepresent other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am extremely sorry, Mr. Gale. I appreciate that no member of the former Government would deliberately try to misrepresent anything; I apologise for any such suggestion.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman was mistaken in the way in which he has picked up my point. Nothing that I have said detracts from the fact that we believe that parents should have the right to send their children to whatever school they like, according to their beliefs. However, in North Yorkshire and, I am sure, in all other rural authorities parents send their children to the most local and convenient primary school. If that happens to be a Church of England school, that is the school that they will choose. That is borne out by what Bishop David said to me. The Church of England does not support the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 concerns siblings. Most schools and local authorities would accept that the question of siblings is important to admissions policies. However, I found the right hon. Member for Charnwood somewhat hypocritical when he spoke about the assisted places scheme the abolition of which is providing much of the resources for the proposals. Siblings were never guaranteed places in public schools under the assisted places scheme. Neither are siblings guaranteed places in grant-maintained schools, and they are certainly not in grammar schools on which point the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will no doubt rise to intervene. We oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Perfect timing the hon. Gentleman saved me the need to intervene. Of course I believe that siblings should be entitled to a place in grammar schools if their abilities justify it; I have no difficulty[Mr. Brady]
whatsoever with that. For the record, it should be said that Conservative Members pressed amendments to the assisted places legislation to ensure that assisted places should continue to be available to siblings again, if they meet the admissions criteria of the school in question. It is quite wrong to accuse my right hon. Friend of hypocrisy in this matter; we have been entirely consistent on it.
<P>
My experience of denominational schools is entirely different from that of the hon. Gentleman. Many of my constituents choose to send their children to denominational schools; indeed, that is of paramount importance to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> At key stage 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> At all stages of their children's education. I find it remarkable that a Church of England bishop apparently does not agree with the importance of providing denominational schooling. If that is so, presumably he wants the church to withdraw from that activity. I see little point in the Church providing school places if parents do not want those places because they are in Church schools. My experience is that many of my constituents want denominational schools.
<P>
Following the Minister's earlier remarks, I would welcome an assurance that the same enlightened approach, guaranteeing that a class of 31 would be split into 15 and 16, will be extended to denominational schools. It would set a great many minds at rest if we could be sure that no child would be excluded from a denominational education school simply because of an arbitrary limit on class sizes.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): Despite what the hon. Gentleman said, not every parent who now chooses a denominational school has the right to have his child educated there. Admission is in the hands of the school admission authorities; it is not simply a case of parental preference.
<P>
Would the hon. Gentleman comment on the construction of amendment No. 62? Paragraph (a) seems to stand alone and give parents an automatic right to send their children to a denominational school should they express that preference. There is no "and"; there is no link between paragraphs (a) and (b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Perhaps the inclusion of an "and" would make the amendment clearer; we would have no difficulty with that. However, the purpose of the amendment is clear. It is that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No limit under this section shall be effective to prevent the admission of a child".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment directly relates to clause 1. Many parents send their children to denominational schools for reasons other than their denominational character, which is perfectly reasonable. It is often done because denominational schools are the best schools in the area. That emphasises how important it is that parental choice should be maintained.
<P>
I shall briefly mention the matter of siblings. In the modern world, with the difficult domestic arrangements and the busy and complicated lives that people have today, the Government should recognise the enormous difficulty caused for familities who have to send children to a number of different schools. It can be a great problem. As I said, we raised the matter earlier in the context of assisted places. The problem is compounded in relation to denominational schools. The Government will make it difficult for parents to choose a denominational school if a class of 29 can accommodate one of their children, but not both.
<P>
The amendments complement each other. The Bill limits parental choice. Parents may believe that the right religious content and character is important in their child's education, and that all their children should, if possible, go to the same school, but the Bill does not allow it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I ask the Committee to reject the amendments. Amendment No. 62 is fundamentally flawed and is opposed by the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church. The Government value the constructive partnership that we have developed with the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, and the Bill is better than it would have been if it had been based only on the White Paper. We were able to respond positively to some of the reservations and concerns expressed by the Church education authorities, and the Bill presently commands their support.
<P>
I believe that the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church would be hostile to amendment No. 62 because it effectively removes denominational schools from one of the key pledges on which the Government were elected to reduce class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds to 30 or fewer pupils. The Churches want the benefit of that policy. They can see that they would be excluded under the amendment. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred to Bishop David of Ripon. I am not sure that he would like to be referred to as the leader of the Church of England education team in the House of Lords, but he chairs the Church of England board of education. It is interesting that he expressed his concerns about the effects of the amendment. From my discussions with Bishop Konstant, who speaks on behalf of the Roman Catholic church education authorities, I am sure that he would also be concerned about the effects of the amendment.
<P>
When the hon. Lady moved the amendment, she did not say whether the Conservatives had consulted the Church education authorities about the contents of the amendment, which means that they probably have not. I am concerned that such a fundamental issue, which effectively excludes denominational schools from the class size pledge, should be tabled and debated in the Committee when no consultation with the relevant Church education authorities has taken place.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I am conscious that I will have to phrase my intervention carefully. The Minister referred to the commitment of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church to the class size limit, therefore suggesting that the amendment should not be passed. In doing so, has the Minister borne in mind our discussions on the previous amendment, when we said that both Churches are committed to the resource implications of the admissions policy which the Minister told us would make such an amendment irrelevant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have no doubt that both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church are aware of any financial consequences of our policy. In our discussions with both of those organisations, they told us that they fully support the commitment to reduce class sizes for children in key stage 1. I have no doubt of that support. It is irresponsible to table such an amendment when we should be looking forward to a constructive partnership with the Church authorities. Her Majesty's principal party of opposition has tabled an amendment that would exclude all those denominational schools from the class size pledge without any consultation.
<P>
On amendment No. 63, there is no problem with siblings being given priority within the pledge. There will be nothing to stop admissions authorities attaching such priority to siblings. However, we believe that it is inappropriate that siblings should once again be excluded, over and above our pledge to the British electorate. They can be accommodated, for the reasons that have been outlined in Opposition Members' speeches, and given a priority, but within the pledge of a class of 30 or fewer. Amendment No. 63 is therefore inappropriate as it seeks to undermine the pledge on which we were elected to office. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am disappointed that another amendment that would introduce flexibility in certain cases has, yet again, been rejected by the Minister. We did not consult bishops but we consulted parents [Interruption]. The Minister pours scorn on their views. We have accepted that parents' views are not given much importance in the Bill. However, where parents want to express a preference, they should be able to do so. Under paragraph (b) of the amendment, a child would be accepted if the admissions authority of a denominational school had expressed its willingness to do so. It is therefore not something that we suggest should be foisted on denominational schools; it would be in partnership I hope that the Minister is listening with the admissions authority of that school.
<P>
The Minister's response is extremely disappointing. I hope that when we come to discuss clause 77, the Government will address problems such as those outlined in the amendments and that we can have some reassurance on the matter. Otherwise, we can assume only that, yet again, official bodies, not parents, have the Government's ear.

<B>The Chairman,</b><i> being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:</i>

Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Plans by LEAs for reducing infant class sizes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 5, in page 2, leave out line 10 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) draw the attention of the Secretary of State to all consequences in each school to which the statement relates of compliance with sub-section (1) of this section, and".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Consistent with making progress on the clause, I should like to say that, as we argued throughout the debate on clause 1, the implementation of the introduction of class sizes of no more than 30 in key stage 1 will have a knock-on effect, particularly at key stage 2, in primary schools and that the amendment seeks clarification from the Minister on issues such as standard numbers, vertical grouping, key stage 2 class sizes, accommodation, over-subscribed schools and transport arrangements, all of which flow from the Government's implementation of clause 1.
<P>
The Minister assured the hon. Member for Bath who still remains my friend that he would deal with some of those issues and I invite him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am pleased that the Committee is making progress on this important measure. I said earlier that we have to be mindful, in regard to schools and particularly key stage 2 pupils, of our pledge to reduce class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds and we intend to do that through the powers that the Secretary of State has under clause 2. Clause 2(6) refers to the Secretary of State being able to approve the plans and the LEA's statement on the steps to deliver the pledge and the restrictions on class size that the Secretary of State will specify under the power given to him in clause 1.
<P>
For the benefit of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, I can say that when the Secretary of State examines the statements from LEAs, we intend to give detailed scrutiny to the situation facing children of junior school age to ensure that they are not adversely affected by variations in organisation as a result of the class size pledge for five, six and seven-year-olds. The attraction and the benefit of the process outlined in[Mr. Byers]
clause 2 is that the statement that the local education authority prepares will provide the Secretary of State with the opportunity to conduct the monitoring process. I referred to that at our previous sitting when discussing an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. We can monitor, through the statement and that process, how the class size pledge is being delivered and take into account other general consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> We are not surprised by the Minister's argument, but does he not accept that it is vital that local education authorities are given advance notification of what aspects of their statements will be considered unacceptable by the Secretary of State? My hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred to other issues, but it will also be important for LEAs to be told that a plan will not be accepted if, as a result of the reduction of class size in key stage 1, there is a knock-on increase in key stage 2. Will such matters be notified to the LEAs?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> A range of issues will need to be covered in our guidance to local education authorities about the statements that they must provide. It is wholly appropriate that effective and wide-ranging consultation takes place on what will form part of that guidance.
<P>
To express a personal view, I believe that the consequences for eight, nine and 10-year-olds will be one of those issues, but we shall need to consult both on that and on those raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough when he moved amendment No. 5. We will want to do that before we issue guidance to assist local education authorities to prepare their statements as outlined in clause 2.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> During the consultation process, will the Minister be looking to Ofsted to add an additional chapter to the reports that it makes on schools about the consequences of the changes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I had no thought of offering a role to Ofsted in such arrangements, but there may be some merit in that proposal. We shall discuss matters with Ofsted to see if it can play a useful role in looking at standards and the quality of education as a result of the pledge for five, six and seven-year-olds and, most important, in terms of whether eight, nine and 10-year-olds are also benefiting from the pledge. I have no objection in principle to Ofsted being involved in the process if we consider that that will be an appropriate role for it to play.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> On a point of clarification, will the Minister say whether it would be acceptable if an authority said that the only way in which it could accommodate the statutory limit on the class size, when it had separate infant and junior schools, was to merge the two schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I would be concerned if that happened, because the authorities would be mixing key stage 1 pupils with key stage 2 pupils. One of the attractions of the pledge is that it covers key stage 1 pupils. That is why we do not expect to experience in practice some of the difficulties that were referred to earlier, because of key stage 1 pupils being grouped together either in separate classes or in mixed-aged teaching. Key stage 1 is the organisational unit that most primary schools will be adopting and that is appropriate. It is highly unlikely that a school would wish there to be a mixture of infant and junior pupils key stage 1 and key stage 2 pupils in the present circumstances.
<P>
I hope that I have assured the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the proposals on which we shall want to consult under clause 2 and the statement that local education authorities must produce. That will allow the Secretary of State to monitor effectively the way in which the class-size pledge is delivered in practice. That is the appropriate way to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In the light of the Minister's response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead, will he reflect on my request that he gives an undertaking that the number of mixed-aged classes in England and Wales will not rise as a result of his acceptance of an LEA's proposal? Will he look at the impact on mixed-age classes of the scheme that LEAs put forward?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman is tempting me to adopt a far more intrusive role for the Secretary of State than even we would want. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Charnwood would condemn us outright if the Secretary of State were to intrude on how individual schools organise themselves. Such a detailed intrusion would be inappropriate and would conflict with the policy of delegating budgets and monetary management control to individual schools.
<P>
In the light of the assurances that I have given, I hope that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will feel able to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment if not, I invite the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) on finding a level of detail that even the Minister does not want to impose on LEAs or schools. As is often the way in Committee, we find ourselves debating from a slightly oblique angle one of the key principles that underlines several clauses in the Bill.
<P>
I shall deal with that principle briefly now because it will arise in a much more serious and important way when we debate education development plans under clauses 6 and 7. I do not want to let the moment pass without reflecting on the fact that clause 2 will place a requirement on LEAs to deliver to the Secretary of State, for his detailed examination, plans setting out their intentions for the delivery within their schools of the provisions of clause 1.
<P>
We shall not support the amendment, which requires the LEA to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>draw the attention of the Secretary of State to all consequences in each school"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the implementation of clause 1. I understand that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough had agreed that policy with the hon. Member for Bath. I am not entirely sure that that is the case because I had understood from the hon. Member for Bath that the Liberal Democrats want to focus the implementation of education policy on LEAs. However, the amendment would require LEAs to report to the Secretary of State all consequences in each school of the implementation of that policy.
<P>
What is left of the principle of local implementation if LEAs are required to report all consequences for each school of the implementation of that policy? That is diametrically opposed to the principle that the hon. Member for Bath has proposed. Be that as it may, the important point about the clause is that it is the first we shall return to this point in debates on development plans and on early-years plans of three major planning processes that the Government are imposing on LEAs, requiring each LEA to prepare a detailed plan for submission to the Secretary of State.
<P>
The follow-up clauses on education development plans contain powers for the Secretary of State to intervene to change the detail of plans prepared by LEAs. In the last analysis, if the Secretary of State is not satisfied with the implementation of a plan, he can, under clause 8, give orders to staff members working in local education authority offices.
<P>
Liberal Democrat policy on the subject is not entirely clear, but Conservative members of the Committee do not believe it a desirable development to focus such authority and power in the schools service on the office of the Secretary of State. As I said during our first sitting, the Government must set out their thoughts on this question: what is the local education authority's proper role in the management of the schools service?
<P>
We understand that a code of practice is being prepared that will try to answer that question, but the same question arises under the clause in particular, under the terms of the amendment. Do the Government believe that local education authorities should be given responsibility for implementing the class size pledge under clause 1, or do they believe that the teeth of their policy rest with the Secretary of State and in his powers under clause 2 to approve or amend local education authority plans? Do the Government believe that the local education authority or the Secretary of State holds the key to improvement? We would prefer the governors and the professionals who work in the schools to be the key implementers of the improvements, which we all want, in the quality of service delivered through our schools.
<P>
In our consideration of the Bill we shall keep returning to that question, as the Government have not answered it. We hear about informal briefings in which the Minister says that he is a sceptic if I may use that word neutrally on the ability of local education authorities to deliver the Government's ambitions, which is why, in private, he acknowledges that he is taking unprecedented new powers over local education authorities.
<P>
The Minister should say whether that is his view. If it is, he should set it out in greater detail than the Chairman will allow him to do in an intervention. If not, he should counteract the numerous reports that are circulating in the education world attributing the view not just to the Government, but personally and specifically to him.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. I hope that we will have the opportunity later in our proceedings to have a proper debate on this key issue, which we need to address. For the record, I should say that I believe that where local education authorities work well, they add value to what schools can do, but that where they fail, they become part of the problem. The Government will not stand to one side and allow them to fail. We will put the interests of children first, which is why we need some of the new powers contained in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That is a pleasant presentation of the issue, but it does not answer the question. Should the Secretary of State or the local education authority, as the democratically elected local organisation, be responsible for delivering the service, or should, as we would prefer, accountability be focused on the school? That is a theme to which we shall often return during our proceedings.
<P>
We shall vote against the clause when we reach clause stand part, and we shall certainly vote against the amendment, which would make the clause worse. The clause will enhance the power of the Secretary of State and be the first step down the road of making the school service a nationally accountable service through the personality of the Secretary of State to Parliament rather than as it has been since 1944 a service accountable to a local electorate through the democratically elected local education authority. That is the choice before the Government; the clause is a move in the wrong direction.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood for deftly exposing how the Minister is seeking power without responsibility. The Minister cannot demand all the information and the level of control provided in the clause but turn a blind eye to some of the practical side-effects.
<P>
I represent a constituency in Surrey the schools in which have come third in the country in the performance league tables published this week. That is not least because Surrey for many years under Conservative leadership as well as when it was a hung council devoted extra resources to teaching in primary schools. By devoting those extra resources, Surrey has achieved a low average class size in primary schools and in the early years, but it has not followed a dogmatic rule that every class size should be under 30.
<P>
I do not blame the Minister for the dark effects of the proposal; I blame the forces of darkness that one of his colleagues warned us about before the election. A powerful election slogan was seized upon that carried a lot of hidden, dark side-effects, as well as the possibility benign promise that class sizes generally would reduce. It is greatly to be regretted that instead of simply aiming to reduce the general level of class sizes in the early years which is something that we could all support in the light of recent research evidence a dogmatic target will be applied across the board.
[Mr. St. Aubyn]
<P>
I regret that the Minister is ducking the consequences of the policy on the number of mixed-age classes, for example. As he well knows, classes of 15 or 16 would require capital expenditure on new classrooms way beyond the budget provided by freeing up money from the assisted places scheme. To afford the cost of meeting one-off cases of 15 and 16 in a class, schools that have a library would have to close the library, or slash their expenditure on information technology which is important at primary as well as at secondary level. It is much more likely that children will be forced to go to other schools much further from their homes, or that children who are especially bright will be pressurised to go up a year, or that those who are less bright will be pressurised to go down a year, which may not be in their best interests.
<P>
It is not right that the interests of individual children should be made secondary to the dogmatic attainment of a pledge that owes more to the spin doctors of Millbank than to children's educational needs during those important years. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance on that.
<P>
I think that the Ministr told us that he has just over œ22 million allocated for the coming year. I hope that he will not allocate resources to areas favoured for party-political advantage rather than for any other reason.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind the hon. Member that the clause deals with the compliance of local authorities; he is going a little wide of the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale. However, one of the many consequences of the clause may be that the Minister will be tempted to cherry pick. I raised the question at an earlier sitting and the Minister still has not answered me or explicitly said how he will deal with the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that in allocating the first tranche of money the œ22 million to be paid from this September there will be no cherry picking. Our choice will be based on criteria that we shall publish when we announce the local authorities whose applications have been successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance. He has not explained how he will guarantee it, but he will no doubt have the opportunity to do so later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman was as surprised as I was when the Minister said that he would announce the criteria at the same time as saying which LEAs had been successful. It would have been more helpful if he had said that the criteria would be published first and before the list of successful LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. He reinforces my anxiety that, despite the Minister's good intentions, there are forces of darkness at work that he may find more powerful. For that reason alone, I support the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> It seems that there are forces of darkness everywhere in this place.
<P>
I respond first to the right hon. Member for Charnwood. We have a great deal of sympathy with what he says, because we, too, would have preferred the Bill to say what LEAs were expected to deliver. That applies as much to key stage 2 as to key stage 1, and would have addressed many of the issues raised by Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members.
<P>
The problem is that LEAs will not have to take cognisance of how individual schools implement the plans. It is important that schools should be able to say how the plans affect them and, if necessary, to make their views known to the Secretary of State. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
We were pleased to receive the Minister's assurance that much of what we want from the amendment will be imposed on LEAs through guidance. We would have preferred the Minister simply to accept the amendment, especially as a series of guidance notes to LEAs will achieve exactly the same as the amendment. However, we understand the Minister's position and are pleased to receive those assurances. We would be pleased to know also when the consultation on that guidance will be available for debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 2, line 15, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) In the course of preparing the statement the authority shall have regard to recent experience of parental preferences expressed in the arrangements provided under section 77 of this Act.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Notwithstanding what I said in the previous debate, the amendment seeks to ensure that plans prepared under the process reflect considerations that we think important. That thinking lies also behind amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 67, which we shall debate shortly.
<P>
I hope that the Government and their supporters will consider the amendment, which is designed to work within the structure that the Government have established. It would simply require that, in drawing up the plans required under clause 2 the reservations that I expressed in the previous debate remain local education authorities should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to recent experience of parental preferences expressed in the arrangements provided"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under clause 77.
<P>
The Minister said that he was confident that when we reach clause 77 he would have proposals to put to the Committee. He argued that they would demonstrate that the delivery of the Government's class size pledge could be reconciled with the expressions of parental preference about which school parents wanted their child to attend.
<P>
I welcome the fact that the Government have thought about the problem of reconciling the class size pledge with giving effect to parental preference. But, in response to my amendment, I want the Minister to assure me that individual LEAs, in preparing their plans under clause 2, will have to demonstrate not merely that they have undertaken the survey of parental preference that is required under clause 77, but that those preferences are reflected in their plans.
<P>
As we made clear when we discussed clause 1, one of our major concerns about the implementation of the Government's class size pledge is that it is in danger of becoming a penumbra under which LEAs channel children into schools that do not reflect the desire of the local education authority to fill empty places and to deliver what would be reported as being more efficient education. It could reflect the substitution of the choices made by the LEA about the type of infant education offered in its area for the choice that parents left to themselves may make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> How recent is recent? I ask that specifically because we have already heard of the problems created by fluctuating parental preference in the education system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> If the Government wish to table an amendment that covers, redefines or confines the word "recent" or seeks to substitute a different concept, I am willing to listen to such a proposal. I have been a Minister; I have been provided with notes by which to respond to amendments in Committee stages. At the beginning of each clause is drafted the response that a Minister may make to resist a certain amendment on the grounds that it is technically defective. I never used such an argument when I was a Minister, because the Opposition, who have to work with a word processor, ideas and not much else do not have the capacity to produce the refined drafting used in a Bill that a Minister has available to him.
<P>
If the principle is accepted that LEAs must reflect parental preference in the plans, I am willing to withdraw the amendment and allow the Government to substitute in its place their amendment, which no doubt would be technically superb in a way that mine is not. That does not worry me in the least. I have no pride of authorship about the words of the amendment.
<P>
What does matter to me is the principle that a local education authority must demonstrate that, in drawing up the plans required under clause 2, it is reflecting parental preference as a key priority. I do not want simply to be reflected an efficient use of resource or the views of the LEA, whether its officials or its members, about the best type of infant education in a particular area.
<P>
The principle that I want written into the Bill concerns the parental engagement in decisions about the education of their children, so that the LEA is required when drawing up its plans to reflect that parental preference as an important influence on the policy that it develops. We must all be aware of the danger that an LEA, faced with the constraints that will always be present in planning the use of public resources, will occasionally prefer to fill places in schools that parents do not choose rather than responding to parental desire to expand the number of places in preferred schools. We tabled the amendment to safeguard against that danger. I hope that the Minister will recognise the need to incorporate that principle into the Bill; at the very least, I hope that in response to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, the Under-Secretary of State will make it clear that when the Department for Education and Employment assesses an LEA's plans, in the name of the Secretary of State, it will be required to demonstrate that the principle has been respected.
<P>
I give the Ministers credit for not, by and large, relying on the technically defective argument; they seem to have circulated it fairly extensively around their hon. Friends. I understand that, but I say to Labour Members that when they are presented with the argument that the amendments are technically defective, they might like to reflect

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I must tell him that my intervention came it may surprise him to know entirely from my own head. The right hon. Gentleman must not confuse the behaviour of his own Conservative Back Benchers in the previous Parliament with that of ours in the present one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Whether the focus of the attack on the amendments as being technically defective came from the Front or the Back Bench, the point remains. It is the principle that is important and I hope that the Minister will address it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am slightly confused about what the amendment is trying to achieve because, without simultaneously debating clause 77, which deals with the issue, I think that the right hon. Gentleman would agree that it is difficult to get to the heart of his argument. I hope that the Minister will agree to the proposal and incorporate it into the Bill, in which case we can get on to the next amendment. Would the right hon. Gentleman state whether the amendment seeks to elicit from the Minister an assurance that every parent should be guaranteed his or her first preference? If that is so, we could not support that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful. Of course I am not seeking that end and of course I recognise that there are constraints on the fulfillment of parental preference. The amendment seeks to ensure that, in drawing up the plans for the future development of primary schools and giving effect to the pledge for five, six and seven-year-olds, the expansion of places should be in the schools that parents choose, not those that they do not, when it is realistic to do so. We should ensure that the system expands in a way that most closely reflects the expression of parental preference. Of course it is true that the Secretary of State will not be able to give every parent his or her first choice that has never been possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> But that was the point that I was trying to make; if the Minister accepted the principle that schools could expand according to their popularity which seems to be the objective of the amendment that would clearly make it difficult for him to deliver the pledge within the available resources. If that is the amendment's intention, we will not support it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will look at the amendment constructively, as it gives the Government an opportunity to say whether, as we hope, they intend to enshrine some form of parental preference in the Bill.
[Mrs. May]
<P>
It is of great concern that, in our debate on clause 1, the Government set their face against the concept of parental preference, choosing to follow the Secretary of State's view that the bureaucrats, not the parents, know best. They refused to provide the flexibility that would allow parental preference, so if they also reject amendment No. 64, they will be saying to parents that they are entirely setting their face against it.
<P>
Under the amendment, local education authority plans submitted to the Secretary of State on how to implement the limit on class sizes would not simply consist of shunting children into available empty places. The plans would reflect the desire of parents in the area to exercise their preference, for whatever reasons, for certain schools. If the Government reject the amendment, they will be saying that they are not prepared to accept the extremely important principle of parental preference.
<P>
I hope that no one will suggest that the amendment is a wrecking amendment which would prevent the Government from delivering their card pledge. That is not its purpose. It was tables to give the Government the opportunity, which I hope they will take, to say that they accept the principle of parental preference.
<P>
There is a danger that, in implementing the card pledge on class sizes, the Government will simply use up empty class places, where they are available, rather than accept that the reason there are empty places is often because parents do not want their children to go to a certain school. We are suggesting that, in drawing up their plans, local education authorities take account of the fact that parents have shown a preference for certain schools in an area. The local education authority should not say, "We have X number of places available, so children can fill those."
<P>
We are concerned about the Minister's comments on clause 77, but there is a difficulty arising from our inability to discuss that clause. As we said during the Committee's first sitting, the Government are not bringing forward detailed proposals in time for us to debate them in our consideration of all the relevant clauses. How the Government intend to exercise clause 77 is relevant to the amendment and to clause 2.
<P>
We are also concerned about the Minister's assumption that it will be easy to implement the pledge on class size. The implication is that the Government believe that children can simply be put into whatever empty places are available. They should ask which schools are doing so well that parents want to send their children to them, and how that parental preference can be accommodated through extra resources.
<P>
I am sure that when the card pledge was put before the electorate, parents believed that, if the Labour party came into government, the limit on class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds would apply in the schools of their choice. They did not believe that the pledge would be delivered simply by pushing children into those schools to which they were not choosing to send their children.
<P>
The amendment is a genuine attempt to give the Government an opportunity to say that they believe in parental preference. All we are saying is that the local education authority should be required to take account of parental preference in preparing its plans. Of course, the Secretary of State might then refuse the authority's proposals, but that would be an interesting comment on how the Government view parental choice.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State, in responding, will view the amendment as a genuinely constructive attempt to enshrine the principle of parental preference in the Bill. This is an opportunity for the Government to stand up and say that they believe in parental preference by accepting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I very much welcome the support of the Liberal Democrat members of the Committee for the amendment, if I have understood them correctly it is sometimes rather hard to understand what our Liberal colleagues are telling us. I know that the Minister and members of his party are sometimes reluctant to accept common sense when it comes from Conservative Members; that might almost be termed a psychological flaw on their part.
<P>
I hope that as well as the comments we have already heard, the Government will take into account the comments of the leader of one of the teachers unions, Mr. Nigel de Gruchy. He said that the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is too preoccupied with structures rather than standards."
<P>
Frankly, it is not good enough to say in response to the amendment that it would upset the structure that the Department is trying to impose on the delivery of education. If anyone cares about standards, it is parents. Why do they have a preference for a particular school? It is not only because the results of a school are seen to be good, it is because the standards of education the standards of the teachers are seen to be the best.
<P>
We have perhaps not yet paid enough attention to that point. We cannot hope to deliver the proposed reduction in class sizes in a meaningful way without addressing the problem of standards. I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the first report of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, which states:
<P>
We welcome the Government's commitment to raising standards in schools. However, success will depend in large measure on the quality of the teaching force and ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of able, motivated teachers in post."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have heard little from the Under-Secretary about how that will be achieved. Parents will be most concerned about the implications for teacher standards of implementing the Government's proposals.
<P>
When we were taking evidence for the report, I was able to ask another union leader, Mr. Hart, whether he thought it more important to get the quality of teachers right first, or simply to get class sizes down. Mr. Hart replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It must be to get the quality of the teachers right, that must be the answer. Unless we can recruit teachers of the right quality and in the right quantity, we simply cannot get off first base".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there we have it not just Conservatives but those who are normally well disposed to the Labour party are expressing reservations.
<P>
It will be of great concern to parents which they will be able to express through their preferences if the amendment is accepted that teacher quality is maintained when trying to expand teacher numbers. That is an additional reason why the amendment should be supported.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am going to ask the Committee to reject the amendment, although we have sympathy with the thoughts behind it. I am happy to put on record yet again that the Government believe in parental preference. We said that last week, and we have said it again in our debates today. Of course we believe in parental preference we choose those words rather than parental choice because of the point made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, which is that it is difficult to promise parents that they will always receive their first choice. I do not think that that is the intention behind the amendment. Of course we put on record our wish to allow parents to exercise preference as to where their child should be educated.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Guildford, of course we are also interested in standards of education. The Bill is not just about class size 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may be for the convenience of members of the Committee to be reminded that they can leave papers in the Room, which will be locked between now and our next sitting. The Committee may also like to know that we have asked to have the heating put on. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] That will probably mean that it will be like a greenhouse when we come back.
