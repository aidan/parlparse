<P>
Question accordingly negatived.  
<P>
</FONT><B>Ms Debra Shipley (Stourbridge):</B> On a point of order,  Mr. O'Brien. In the light of this morning's discussion,  which raised serious points that would bear further  consideration, I should like the Committee to adjourn until  next week.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett (Denton and Reddish):</B> I do  not wish to delay the Committee, but I should like to  impress on my hon. Friend and on the Minister that if we  adjourn today it is important that relevant amendments are  ready by Monday. I stress in particular that subsections  (2)(b), (c) and (d) need to be clarified. The Committee  needs to know what will happen about the important  question of the appeal mechanism. A clear statement  about legal aid would also be very helpful.  
<P>
As I shall not be present next Wednesday, it would  be helpful if another Committee member could table the  amendments that have already been accepted for  consideration. I would also ask Committee members to  look carefully at my new clause 2, which is one  mechanism by which pressure could be put on those on  the list to make that fact known when applying for jobs.  If the Government introduce a list, there will be a great  deal of criticism if someone is employed as a nanny or  something similar and no mechanism exists for that  person to inform their prospective employer that they are  on that list.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for  Stourbridge (Ms Shipley) for her brief remarks and her  request for an adjournment of the Committee. It showed  that this morning's discussion was practical and  constructive in every respect. I am glad that she has taken  on board some of the points that were made. I hope that  the spirit of our debate will encourage her to consider this  morning's discussions carefully over the next few days.  I look forward to hearing her response when we meet  next week. I heartily endorse our approach it is the right  way to proceed and I congratulate the hon. Lady on her  sensible decision.  
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I am grateful to my hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge for giving the  Committee a proper opportunity to reflect on some of the  points that were raised today.   
<P>
The Government feel that we need to consider the Bill's  appeal provisions relating to provisional inclusion on the  list. That is why my hon. Friend sought leave to adjourn  the Committee. She and I and other Committee  members will have an opportunity to discuss the best  way to proceed.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish  (Mr. Bennett) re-opened the argument about the phrase  "would have considered"	 in clause 2(2)(b). As I  understand it, that is not why my hon. Friend the Member  for Stourbridge sought leave to adjourn the Committee.  We want to consider the appeals mechanism, and how  it relates to provisional registration and to inclusion on  the list.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Bennett:</B> I want to press the Minister on the  question of legal aid. Giving people legal aid so that they  can be represented at a tribunal is an important safeguard  for civil liberties.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern,  but I am not currently able to make specific comments on  that matter. I suspect that we shall return to that matter  later perhaps on Report.  
<P>
Further consideration adjourned. [Ms Shipley.]  
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at twenty-four minutes to  Five o'clock till Wednesday 24 March at half-past  Ten o'clock.
