<P>
Clause 131 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 35</center></H4>
<H4><center>Value added tax: charge at reduced rate</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Thirty-fifth schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The schedule is about the reduced rate of value added tax to be charged on certain energy efficient materials, and the grants under which they can be installed. It is worth discussing the subject to ascertain what the benefits are, especially in environmental terms. Also, we ought to find out what compliance costs may be involved in making an already complex part of the law even more complex.

<P>
My first general question is whether the Government have calculated the possible environmental gain in terms of reduced CO2 emissions. We know that the domestic sector is a large contributor to global warming, especially as regards CO2 emissions. The Government are bringing into the commercial sector what we consider to be a misguided and unnecessary tax, which is the climate change levy. We have debated that at length already. In commercial circles, there are complaints that the Government appear to concentrate almost entirely on the transport and commercial sectors to the exclusion of the domestic market, in which CO2 emissions continue to rise.

<P>
Although there are good social reasons for a cut in VAT on domestic fuel and power, it cannot be disputed that its unfortunate environmental effect is to encourage the wasteful use of energy. If the price of a commodity is cut, all things being equal, more of it will be used. With powerful forces reducing the price of energy, especially electricity and gas following the liberalisation of the markets from the previous Government's privatisation programmes, there is a danger that domestic sector CO2 emissions will rise even faster than in other sectors.

<P>
The encouragement to install energy-efficient materials-heating controls, solar panels, better boilers-is undoubtedly right. The previous Government set up the home energy efficiency scheme, which will always be associated with the late Peter Morrison, and we did much to launch the grants schemes, which are valuable. The Government are adding a reduced value added tax rate on some pieces of equipment and types of material. I would like them to give more details about the environmental gains that they think will arise from that move, which is elaborated in schedule 35.

<P>
My second question is about compliance cost. It is regrettable that the Government have not used the opportunity to overhaul the relevant parts of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, an area of tax law that is beginning to creak. The area is complex and the provisions will make it even more impenetrable. An opportunity has been missed to rewrite that aspect of VAT law. Will the Minister consider taking that opportunity, perhaps in quieter times and possibly by giving the task to the tax law rewrite committee? We could have a more transparent system with fewer compliance costs.

<P>
What assessment have the Government made of the costs to business of complying with the reduced rates? The industry might not be complaining too loudly because of the opportunity to sell more products, but the whole economy and not only industry will bear an increase in clients' costs due to greater complexity. Customs and Excise might have to employ more people to help business to comply and to conduct the necessary checks and so that it can take enforcement action when there are abuses. Given that the lower rates have had effect since April, the Minister might be able to tell us about the experience of that.

<P>
On the details of the schedule, the explanatory notes stated that the measure would not apply to do-it-yourself goods because that would conflict with EU law. That is unfortunate. Has the Minister tried to modify that position? Change can be made only with unanimity but, in my experience, when the case is clear and when interests in other countries are not radically affected, such things can often be done by consensus. I would be grateful for information about that.

<P>
Solar panels are referred to as qualifying but there is no information about whether the associated costs of installation, pipework and wiring are also covered. It is not adequate that only panels will attract a lower VAT rate because the installation of such equipment does not consist of simply purchasing panels-that often forms only a minority of the overall cost. I should be grateful for information about that.

<P>
Where the lower rate applies to equipment, would it not have been better and simpler to have increased the rate of grant and to have left the VAT rate the same? All that will happen otherwise is that one part of the public sector will give money to another. The reduced VAT rate will only affect the rate of grant necessary to achieve the same output. There is an element of circularity about the schedule. Did the Government, in the interests of simplicity, consider increasing the rate of grant rather than reducing the VAT rate, which is paid by the public sector in any case?

<P>
A number of other artificial boundaries are listed in paragraph 9 of the schedule. My last question is whether that list is exhaustive and specific, or whether the Financial Secretary envisages an element of discretion at the margins, where grey areas might arise. Energy efficiencies change as new products come on to the market. Certain types of equipment may be found not to be particularly energy efficient or their efficiency could be overtaken by other technology or other techniques of achieving the same output. Although the schedule can be amended, I wonder what research has been conducted to ensure that the list is the right one and that it has been tested by experience.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I want to raise a few questions. Although we welcome the concessions made by the schedule, I remind the Financial Secretary that the changes have been campaigned for long and hard over many years, not only by pressure groups but by hon. Members and those in the building industry and elsewhere who could see the obvious benefits that would flow from them. I have parliamentary answers and letters from Ministers in my files explaining precisely why it would be impossible to make those changes, so I am grateful that at least one Treasury sinner has come to repent.

<P>
I wish to coax the Financial Secretary a little on some of the implications of the changes made by the schedule, and where they might take us. The hon. Lady will be aware that the schedule is directly connected to fuel poverty, that many homes are poorly insulated and expensive to heat and that that contributes significantly to the greenhouse gas emissions that the Government, in another arm of their policy, are keen to control.

<P>
Following the Treasury's conversion, I wonder whether the Government will now lend more direct support to the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill when it returns to the House on 21 July, to ensure that it, too, finds its way on to the statute book during this Session. Both those issues are long-running and a resolution is long outstanding. Although we broadly welcome the provisions of schedule 35, we want the whole cake, not only part of it.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) mentioned the interaction between the current grant-giving facility and the reduction in VAT. It is understood that the amount of grant that needs to be paid will be reduced by the amount of the rebate in VAT payments, but will the Financial Secretary give an undertaking that the total quantum of grants allocated will not be reduced? In other words, the Government have the opportunity to make additional grants, so it need not simply be a trade-off between grants and VAT with no net benefit to those at the receiving end.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells also mentioned ancillary installation costs. ``Ancillary'' is a by-and-large word. In my former existence in the building industry, I specified many systems and supervised their installation. The installation costs often exceed the cost of the equipment and the plant. I would like reassurance from the Paymaster General on how those installations cost will be accounted for in the calculations.

<P>
We welcome the provision and shall support it. However, there are issues at the margins on which we seek reassurance; will additional money be available for the vital job of ensuring that we have efficient low-energy homes in this country over the coming decades?

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): While the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) wants the whole cake, I would not go as far as that-I would not be so profligate with the nation's finances. However, I put in a further bid for one or two more crumbs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I shall be delighted to join the hon. Gentleman in his search for crumbs and hope that we are successful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall not go down that road-but we will peck away at this issue.

<P>
Amendment No. 468, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), has not been selected but deals with the important point, which my hon. Friend may cover now that he is present, of supplies of services and materials for churches. Religion is important in this country and people take it seriously; indeed, the Financial Secretary and I will probably lock horns on the issue during the Committee stage of the Census (Amendment) Bill, which deals with whether a question on religion should be included in the next census. The Government consider that religion has an important role in terms of planning public life and of good government.

<P>
The Paymaster General may tell me-I hope that she will-that the issue is covered by the definition of ``relevant charitable purpose'' in proposed paragraphs aa) and ab). Religion is a charitable objective and it qualifies for charitable relief. None the less, there are some wonderful churches in Britain that need to be maintained to the standards that we all appreciate. Religion is part of the nation's heritage, but it is also at the heart of the community. Whatever the religion, worship is important to many people and they want to be able to do so in a building that is dry, warm, watertight and in good condition. To find that they are being taxed on maintenance of their place of worship would stick in the throat of many people-indeed, many people do not know about it. So I put in a plea to the Minister that she look at that issue, which is so important to many people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I apologise for my tardiness in arriving this morning. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate because the issue that I touched on in my amendment-which, in your infinite wisdom, Mr. Cook, you decided not to call-raises some pertinent points.

<P>
The cost of conserving the buildings for which the Church Commissioners are responsible is high. The assets of the Church Commissioners, which were fabled for their enormity in times past, are now much diminished, particularly when considered relative to the costs and liabilities that they face. In some countries, such as some Scandinavian countries, the entire cost of maintaining church buildings is borne by the state, but I believe that we are right to look to those who support the Anglican religion to maintain the buildings that reflect their part in the community. Many in the Anglican Church would recognise that the burden of maintaining their buildings demonstrates that they have a living and active community. However, it is hard to reconcile that obligation for their upkeep, and the fact that the buildings have such an important part to play in the community in which they are based, with the paying of value added tax at the full rate on the cost of repairs.

<P>
I believe that the Church Commissioners own more grade I listed buildings than any other owner in the country. The amendment was intended to ensure that some relief would be available, particularly in the case of grade I listed buildings with very high repair costs. I have not been able to obtain firm figures, but I am given to understand that the VAT paid on repairs on church buildings is of the order of £40 million a year-a staggering sum. Limiting the proposal to grade I listed buildings would probably bring the Church about half that, which is not a huge amount for a Government who in recent weeks have given out more in a further subvention to the disaster known as the millennium dome.

<P>
In the 2,000th year of Our Lord, it would be an appropriate gesture for the Government to take up what was proposed in the amendment, and extend the lower rate of VAT, which is, after all, a conservation proposal as expressed in the schedule, so that it applies also to our great churches-and small ones too. In the village where I live, in Surrey, there is a completely unreconstructed Norman church, a magnificent example of its type. It is a small, modest church, but it is of great beauty, and I believe that it has the oldest pews in the country, dating from the 13th century. The pews recently needed repair and, while the local community chips in to the cost of such matters, it would be of help-there and elsewhere-if the VAT element could be subject to relief.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Does the hon. Gentleman have an interest to declare, particularly as his surname is Saint Aubyn?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not believe I have any interest to declare, although there was, indeed, a St. Aubyn, who was popular around Europe in the 5th century AD. However, any churches in his name do not fall within the provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps I should declare an interest in that my mother-in-law is one of those people who have been touched for pew repair funds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I support the schedule, which is a small step forward in a long-running campaign, within the House and outside it, to improve energy efficiency. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), who chaired an all-party group on energy efficiency and lighting and worked with my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove and, I believe, Conservative Members, to push that cause. We are debating an important step forward.

<P>
I suggest to the operators of the new home energy efficiency scheme that energy insulation should be a top priority. It has a great many benefits, not just in lowering the energy bills of pensioners and those with modest incomes, but in improving the environment and raising the quality of housing stock, which, I am sure hon. Members will agree, from the evidence of their weekly advice sessions, is important for many constituents with damp, cold homes. Energy insulation also has an important effect in other respects, such as reducing noise nuisance. I was reminded of that only last week when I attended a committee meeting of Chessington Hall residents association. I was asked to lobby on its behalf for better noise and energy insulation for the flats on the Chessington Hall estate.

<P>
I would like the Minister to say a little more about the Home Office initiative on making pensioner homes more secure, although perhaps I should have paid more attention when the matter was debated on the Floor of the House. However, I am delighted that the Government have proposed a scheme that will provide for a reduced rate of tax on home security goods that are installed at the same time as central heating in the homes of less well-off pensioners. According to the explanatory notes, the scheme will cover
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>locks and bolts for windows, locks, bolts and security chains for doors, spy holes and smoke alarms.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is welcome, but will the Minister say a little more about the scheme, which seems to be somewhat restricted?

<P>
The reduced rate will apply only if the goods are installed at the same time as a heating scheme, and I wonder whether the Government have considered extending the scheme more widely because we are all aware of the importance of security measures for crime prevention, especially for the elderly. More generally, the reduced rate will not apply to goods purchased for do-it-yourself installation, but given the importance of the environmental challenge, as well as the needs of the people at whom the scheme is targeted, have the Government given any thought to extending the scheme to include DIY installations? We have not tabled an amendment to that effect, but it would be good to hear that the Government will review the possibility of extending the scheme. That would give a massive boost to householders, as well as to the small businesses that could install such improvements, and would extend the philosophy behind the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I am always in favour of being nice to people and letting them have their money back, but I am a little concerned about the measure. We are spending £35 million. At least, that is what the Government say that they are spending, in table A.13 on page 151 of the Red Book. We must ask what we are getting for the money. How much real change in behaviour will be achieved through the relief? Will people rush out to insulate their homes? Will there be a sharp reduction in energy wastage and will we reduce fuel poverty as a result of the measure? The answer is that those effects are extremely unlikely.

<P>
My best guess is that a large proportion of the £35 million is dead-weight cost. I should like to declare an interest, which is that I am in the process of insulating my home. I will be part of that dead-weight cost, although I shall be delighted to receive the handout. Actually, I must check whether the scheme will date back to the commencement of the work because, if it does, I shall be all right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman in favour of tax relief for private medical insurance, and would that not also have a dead-weight cost?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have always been wary of relief for medical insurance, which does have a high dead-weight cost, but if I were to start talking about relief for health insurance this morning, I feel sure that I would be sitting down again fairly quickly. It is very kind of the Liberal Democrat spokesman to offer me that opportunity, but with your permission, and, I suspect, with your enthusiasm, Mr. Cook, I shall decline.

<P>
If the Government expect us to take this measure seriously, and if it is to be any more than window dressing-a sort of lollipop measure that sounds good-they must give us an estimate of the dead-weight cost, together with a clear explanation of how they calculated that figure. What proportion of the £35 million is dead-weight cost? If any of us sat down for five minutes, we could think of better ways of using £35 million to assist with fuel poverty and improve insulation. The general principle of the tax system should be simple and straightforward and there should be as few rates-especially indirect tax rates-as possible. I regret that the Budget starter proposal will not enforce that principle, and that there will be an increasing number of multiple rates in the VAT system.

<P>
Will the Paymaster General give us a breakdown of the £35 million? What is the Government's estimate of the dead-weight cost in that sum, and of the extent to which behaviour will change as a consequence of the measure?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I have much sympathy with the line taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie). I will certainly not vote against the schedule because, as he rightly says, we would all like to find ways to reduce the tax burden. However, I am unenthusiastic about measures that reduce it in such a bureaucratic and judgmental manner. I am strongly in favour of a simple tax system that applies uniform tax rates across the maximum possible range of activities, while leaving as few nooks and crannies as possible for tax advisers to exploit. Such people earn their living by advising us which form of activity falls within the rules passed by Parliament, and which fall without, so that we do not have to read the small print of those rules ourselves.

<P>
For example, security experts must be salivating at the prospect of advising their clients about the types of equipment that fall within the categories given in the explanatory notes of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>locks and bolts for windows, locks, bolts and security chains for doors, spyholes and smoke alarms.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There must be numerous opportunities for the inventive producer of such equipment to add something designed primarily for another purpose to that category to claim the VAT exemption. For example, something previously known by another name could be redefined as a spyhole. I have not thought about all the commercial activities that the Government are opening up through the measure.

<P>
Whenever we make a judgment that certain activities should attract a lower rate of tax than that generally applied to such expenditure, we do two things. We create the opportunity for unnecessary and wasteful tax advice, which distorts the behaviour of both producers and consumers. In addition, we increase taxes for those at the margin who are not caught by the measure, although we are not doing so by a huge amount in this case, given that the cost is £35 million. The measure reduces tax on spyholes for pensioners, but increases the tax on everything else. Those of us interested in the tax system should be disciplined enough to resist the temptation to cut taxes on those things of which we approve, by remembering that the effect is to increase tax on everything else.

<P>
I will not make a great issue of the principle, or vote against the measure, but the precedent that it creates is unfortunate. I hope that we shall all resist the temptation to look for headlines every Budget day by-apparently-handing out £35 million to activities of which we approve. We tend to hand money back to a defined group of people because, basically, there are votes in giving them back their own money. This is not a huge example of it, but at the margin that sort of activity is wasteful; it distorts behaviour and, most important, the tax burden on everyone else is higher than it needs to be.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Dawn Primarolo): Good morning, Mr. Cook. The debate has been interesting in that it has divided those who want to see the tax system remain constant, so that VAT remains at 17.5 per cent.-

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> So that the Paymaster General answers the argument that I advanced rather than an argument that I did not advance, I should make it clear that I am in favour of all taxes being reduced. My approach to doing that will make it a great deal easier for this and future Governments to cut the rate of VAT. It is the hon. Lady who wants to leave it at 17.5 per cent., not me.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is a little more sensitive than he need be about what he thought I might say next. I am prepared to accept what has been said. I was about to say to those who want to see a downward change in the present rate of 17.5 per cent. that it would be a huge, costly exercise and that constraints would be placed on such changes by other legislation such as insurance premium tax provisions and some anti-avoidance measures. None the less, the general thrust of the argument has been about the rationale and justification for a reduced rate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I got the impression from what the Paymaster General said a moment ago that it was not the Government's policy to reduce the mainstream rate of VAT below 17.5 per cent., even if that were affordable. Is that the Government's position?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This is not a general debate about the Government's attitude to VAT. I shall not pre-empt whatever my right hon. Friend the Chancellor may or may not want to say. We are talking specifically about energy-saving materials. I shall answer the Committee's questions, particularly the six questions asked by the right hon. Member for Wells.

<P>
The clause and the schedule reduce the rate of VAT on energy-saving materials in all homes to 5 per cent. That is the lowest rate allowed under European legislation. The clause also extends the reduced VAT rate to all grant-funded installations under new schemes being developed to help the fuel poor in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

<P>
Some comments have been made about previous ministerial explanations. I make no apology to those hon. Members who questioned Ministers-most questions were addressed to me-for replying on the basis of what we were told was the current interpretation of European law. Nor do I apologise to the Committee for the fact that we are continuing to argue our point of view and to press the Commission on the matter. I shall explain the background to the change.

<P>
We are introducing the VAT cut in response to research that firmly links older, colder homes that have poor thermal efficiency with ill health and excessive winter death. We have consistently made that argument to the Commission to justify the extension. The Commission no doubt judged that against the backdrop of our other actions to tackle the problem. Hon. Members will know that there are 20 per cent. more deaths in winter than summer on average in the United Kingdom, and that that is related to the age of people's homes.

<P>
We expect the measure to improve the quality of life of many people in the UK, as it will make it cheaper for them to improve the thermal efficiency of their homes. Members of the Committee must see the measure alongside that objective. We have a twin policy. The insulation of homes is one factor, and the other is the social problem of people living in poorly insulated homes and suffering the health consequences of that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Paymaster General made an important point about how the Government squared the reduced rate with the Commission. Do member states not have a new, greater power to introduce reduced rates of VAT when to do so could promote employment, especially in the building industry. This measure will utilise energy-saving materials. Will the Paymaster General confirm that increase in the freedom and ability to assist in such matters?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, member states can now decide to use an experimental reduced rate of VAT, at a lowest rate of 5 per cent., for certain categories. The objective of the measure is to generate employment. The Government considered the measure and found that there was no case for us to apply the reduced rate, as the policies that we operate elsewhere in the system tackle those issues. I think that the reduced rate operates over six categories, and there will have to be a review at the end of the two years to see whether it has contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Do the Government disagree with the Commission's logic? Do they think that the scheme is a load of old nonsense and a crazy way to try to reduce unemployment? The Prime Minister has been trying to tell his continental partners for some time that a detailed intervention with myriad measures such as this is no way to try to develop an employment policy. Will the Paymaster General further state her opposition to the Commission's approach?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Government certainly believe that our policy approach, which includes measures such as the new deal, is a better way to tackle unemployment. The growth of employment in the UK does not suggest that we would benefit from participating in the scheme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will, but I am being teased down the route of discussing the Commission's views on reducing unemployment, and that is not the subject of this discussion. The right hon. Gentleman has sat down; I thank him. If he wants to speak about the matter in some other way, I shall be happy for him to do so.

<P>
The schedule took effect on 1 April. It set a rate of
5 per cent. on the installation of insulation, draught strips, hot water, central heating controls and solar panels supplied and fitted by a contractor in all homes.

<P>
Government-funded schemes such as the home energy efficiency scheme are being extended to tackle fuel poverty even more effectively. The new home energy efficiency scheme now provides a combination of insulation and heating measures to help the fuel poor. The aim is to help 450,000 households by 2002. To mirror that, the clause extends the reduced VAT rate to all grant-funded installations under the new schemes. The VAT cut will help an extra 7,000 fuel-poor households. Keeping the reduced rate in line with the scheme also means that the grant schemes remain simpler for installers to operate.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Of course, the grant-funded installation applies also to central heating systems and home security goods, to which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) referred.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Can the Paymaster General confirm those figures-that the scheme is designed to help 400,000 households, but the reduction in VAT will assist only a further 7,000? I raised with her the point about whether the money saved in the grant scheme could be reinvested, but the figures that she has given do not seem to represent a complete reinvestment figure.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is a complete reinvestment, and I was going to deal with the hon. Gentleman's point. There is no clawback of the VAT advantage in the HEES. What is provided is additional. The HEES funding is not being reduced because of what is happening with respect to VAT.

<P>
Before 1 April, the reduced rate applied only to grant-funded installation of energy-saving materials. Now the 5 per cent. rate applies to all installations made under grant schemes that help the fuel poor, such as the home energy efficiency scheme and equivalent measures.

<P>
To respond to an issue raised by the right hon. Member for Wells, I had hoped to be able to table amendments for today's sitting to include in the schedule the installation of wind and water turbines at all homes-for completeness and given that solar panels have been included. However, for technical reasons related to parliamentary procedure, I must table them on Report.

<P>
The first question that the right hon. Member for Wells asked was about the estimated saving. The installation of energy-saving materials at the reduced rate will reduce annual carbon emissions by 140,000 tonnes per annum. The compliance costs are very small, because the scheme is simple to implement. The majority of installers are already familiar with the reduced rate in HEES. The right hon. Gentleman said that he did not expect us to have received complaints, and we have not. The full compliance costs with respect to the regulatory impact assessment were lodged in the Library. The installers are not expected to establish whether customers are entitled to a grant. That is up to the grant-giving body. The right hon. Gentleman also asked whether more Customs and Excise staff would be needed. The answer is no.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells also asked about DIY energy-saving materials. I know that, when he was the Minister with responsibility for Customs and Excise, that was discussed. We are still unable to introduce a reduced rate for those energy-saving materials because of the interpretation of European law. We have now gone to the widest point at which the reduced rate can be applicable, but I continue to lobby the commissioner and the Commission on the matter to make the case for DIY materials. The issue is not closed as far as the Government are concerned. We are still advancing the arguments. We have not succeeded in our persuasive attempts, but we will continue to deploy those arguments and others that we develop to make the case for applying the reduced rate to DIY materials.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked whether the installation costs of solar panels were covered by the reduced rate. All installation costs, but not goods alone, are covered by the reduced rate. The hon. Members for Hazel Grove and for Kingston and Surbiton made that point about installation, too. I have answered the point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove about grants. The grants were increased in the comprehensive spending review. The schemes have been changed, and the reduced rate accompanies and supports the funding.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about the list in paragraph 9. It is specific and comprehensive in respect of materials that are used primarily because they are energy saving. The list can be amended if necessary. There was a question about the interaction between the grant and the reduced rate. The grant will not be reduced. The fact that extra homes will benefit from the schemes illustrates the contribution made by the reduced rate. Grants cover the total cost of installation and of goods, with a 5 per cent. VAT rate. When grants do not apply, there will be apportionment. The issue relates to the grant's operation.

<P>
Several points were raised about churches. With regard to what the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) said, I note that the distinction is that churches not used for business purposes can receive a reduced rate for the installation of energy-saving materials. The hon. Member for Guildford raised both that question and the wider question of reduced rates for repairs on churches. That question is not connected with the specific issue, which is about energy-saving materials only. I would be in order if I drew my answer to a close now, having explained the circumstances in which churches would pay the reduced rate of VAT on those materials. The hon. Gentleman argued for another reduced rate for repair and maintenance of churches. There is no reduced rate for repairs; the Government chooses to assist churches through grants from funds. There is wide lobbying for a reduced rate for church repairs, but I see no prospect of the Government changing their mind with regard to the operation of VAT in that area.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does the amount given out in grant exceed the amount of VAT paid by the Church Commissioners?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not know the answer to that, but I suppose that it depends on how widely the question is framed, in terms of the associated tax reliefs received by the Commissioners to assist them in their activities, whether those reliefs relate to VAT, income from grants or to other direct tax reliefs. That is a complex question, to which I do not have the answer today.

<P>
Much play has been made of the question whether the scheme is too complicated and whether installers will struggle with it. As I hope that I have made clear, the scheme was already operating in part, and installers have not experienced any trouble with it since April.

<P>
I shall now turn to the two points raised by the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and the hon. Member for Chichester. The right hon. Member for Charnwood suggested that the measure might be another paradise for ingenious tax planners, who would redefine a spyhole in order to find some way around the legislation. However, Governments would be paralysed if they were constantly concerned about whether people would abuse the tax system. I believe that the provision is drafted sufficiently tightly to prevent such activity, but as has previously been said in Committee, it is a foolish Treasury Minister who says, ``never'', because abuse is a constant challenge across the entire tax system.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester asked me about the dead-weight cost and I cannot give him a specific answer. I have explained the social reasons for the scheme and the number of extra homes that will benefit from it. I have also given the Committee information about the reduction in carbon emissions that the scheme will bring about. The Committee must view the schedule in the broad context of environmental and social policy relating to cold homes and the associated illness. I am sorry to say that I do not have an estimate of the numbers of new installations, but I shall try to obtain those figures for the hon. Gentleman, who is familiar with the potential dead-weight costs of policies. He may have been at the Treasury when relief for private medical insurance, which carried a huge dead-weight cost, was introduced. I am not making a party-political point because it is valid for Governments to consider whether the cost of such a measure is justified by the benefits. We believe that the cost of our proposal is justified as part of a broader strategy on warm homes and reducing carbon emissions. If people's homes are better insulated, they will use less energy. I commend the schedule to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for trying to answer some of the questions that I raised, and I should be grateful if she would try to obtain an estimate of the dead-weight cost. If she does not have such an estimate to hand and it cannot be passed to her by her team of supporters, perhaps she will write to me to let me know. It is crucial to form an opinion about the dead-weight cost that the measure will incur before embarking on it. If the dead-weight cost is high, if almost everyone will continue to behave in exactly the same way as they did before, and if the whole £35 million will be absorbed by a handout to people like myself who would have gone ahead with home insulation anyway, then a large question mark hangs over the efficacy of the measure on both the social and environmental criteria to which the Minister referred.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is contradiction between the two arguments put by the Paymaster General. I trust that she will correct me if I am wrong because I did not hear her clearly at the crucial point, but I understood her to say that the measure would result in an identifiable saving of 140,000 tonnes per annum of carbon pumped into the atmosphere. If that is the case, an estimate must have been made about the behavioural effects of the measure by one means or another, at least to the extent of finding out how many people will take up the scheme. It should be reasonably easy to derive from that a rough estimate of the proportion of people who would have gone ahead with their home insulation in any case and those who would not.

<P>
I would therefore be grateful for a more thorough estimate from the Paymaster General. There is no point in bouncing the issues to and fro; if she says that she will look into the matter and write to us in due course, I will accept that. It would be far better to have the facts after the Government have had time to consider the issue. However, the question of the dead-weight cost is crucial in terms of such a measure, which seeks to change behaviour. Without it, I do not see how we can estimate whether it is a good or a bad idea.

<P>
We need to put-the Minister may know the numbers off the top of her head; I do not-the reduction of 140,000 tonnes per annum of carbon pumped into the atmosphere into perspective. We need to know whether that emission saving is good value for money or bad, and how it would look in the context of other measures to reduce carbon emissions. We are told on page 113 of the Red Book-although, as with everything in the Red Book, the passage is so impenetrable as to be virtually unreadable; the most basic and important facts are elusive-that the climate change levy will reduce carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes by 2010. I do not know how that figure builds up, whether it has a long initial taper or whether it will go to a fully working level in one go. There is virtually no information to enable us to work out exactly how that number would relate to the 140,000 tonnes per annum-which, at a cost of £35 million, works out at about £4 a tonne. What is the economic cost of extracting it by other means, for example through the climate change levy or, more interestingly, through a pure carbon tax targeted at that purpose?

<P>
Those facts are at the periphery of answering the question whether we should go ahead with schedule 35, but the Minister has made them more central by saying that one of the reasons why the Government introduced the measure was to reduce carbon emissions. We therefore need clarification on those matters. I would be grateful if she could come back to us with some figures, explaining the costs per tonne and what estimates she has made of the behavioural effects that lie behind the figure of 140,000 tonnes. I end by repeating my request for a thorough estimate of the dead-weight costs, without which we cannot come to a clear view about whether we should have gone ahead with the measure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her reply. I welcome the fact that she did not listen to the siren voices of Conservative Members.

<P>
We normally hear erudite and positive contributions from the hon. Member for Chichester, but I do not agree with him today. He was rather negative about tax measures that might change people's behaviour, such as tax relief on private medical insurance. However, the Conservative Government were supported by both sides of the House when they introduced the reduced rate of tax on unleaded petrol, which was an extremely effective environmental measure. That reduction had similar benefits to the measures before the Committee today, as the logic of the hon. Gentleman's arguments suggested. He focused on the issue of dead-weight costs, but they are notoriously difficult to calculate. For example, it would have been incredibly difficult for the then Minister to calculate the dead-weight costs of the reduced rate of excise duty on unleaded petrol.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Dead-weight cost estimates were given at the time. I remember the intense debate about what differential would deliver a change of behaviour. Those estimates were eventually-perhaps initially, but I cannot be sure without checking-put into the public domain. I ask merely that the same approach should be made here. I shall answer in a moment the other more general attack that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made on my alleged illogicality.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, because the hon. Gentleman has confirmed that a tax change can bring about a change of behaviour. I did not suggest that the Government should not provide that information. It would help the debate if they could have a stab, a best guess, at what the dead-weight costs might be, but it would be no better than a best guess. I do not know the particulars of the debate to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but I imagine that the civil servants who tried to estimate the dead-weight costs on the rate of excise duty on unleaded petrol would be the first to admit that such estimates are generally no better than putting a finger in the air.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the calculation of dead-weight costs should take account of the excess winter deaths that the tax rebate is designed to mitigate?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. It brings me to my other concern about the remarks made by the hon. Member for Chichester. He emphasised the £4 a tonne that it would cost to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. That is a narrow way of analysing the provision. As my hon. Friend says, one must take account also of the reduction in the number of winter deaths and the greater comfort and quality of life that will be enjoyed by pensioners and others on low incomes who will have warmer homes as a result. If those benefits are included in the calculations, it would be proved that the measure gives much greater value to taxpayers than he suggests.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that, without that modest tax benefit, improvements for the elderly and those who now live in cold homes would never come about? Surely, if those benefits are available, they will be acted upon in any event. Indeed, the Government should have done a great deal more to assist the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> There are many ways to improve the warmth of pensioners and those on low incomes. The Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill, which ought to have been drafted with better deadlines and targets, should be pushed through. However, the hon. Member for Guildford must be careful in what he says, because Conservative Members have tried to delay that Bill. I hope that, before the 21 July, he will try to persuade them against filibustering.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is it not a fact that the Government filleted that Bill in Committee, taking out any teeth that it might have had? My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) wants to take the time to put teeth back into it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It is not apparent from the remarks made by the hon. Member for Southend, West that he is trying to put teeth back into the Bill. However, I am sure that you will rule me out of order if I continue with that line of debate, Mr. Cook.

<P>
The Paymaster General focused on the discussions, which are central to our debate, that she and her officials have had with the Commission. She said that she wished to continue with them to develop the scheme further. I wish her well in those discussions, and request that she put as much effort into them as possible.

<P>
I drew a parallel with the issue under discussion and that of the reduced VAT that the Commission has allowed-in six categories, according to the Paymaster General-for activities that might assist in employment generation. Conservative Members pooh-poohed that idea and said that it was a bad form of intervention. They have suggested that the European Union want to harmonise taxes and take power from the nation state on issues such as tax, so it is odd that they are against a proposal by the Commission that has the reverse effect. The Paymaster General should use that example to show that members of the Commission and our European Union partners are in no way trying to harmonise tax. I urge her to ask for new flexibility in VAT rates in respect of the environment, and to push on with the experiments in respect of employment. Member states should be given more flexibility and reduced VAT rates when that can be shown to have a positive effect on the environment. I hope that she will take up that suggestion.

<P>
I presume that, on Report, the Government will amend paragraph 8(4) by inserting ``wind turbines'' after ``solar panels''.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We will insert ``wind and water turbines''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Although that insertion will be welcome, it demonstrates the ludicrously narrow way in which the schedule is drafted, and the need for the Paymaster General to win the argument with the Commission and widen it. I am not sure that many pensioners or people on low incomes will install wind and water turbines. We will support that amendment on Report, but we would like an estimate of any increase in the number of pensioners and people on low incomes who install such energy-saving equipment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not want to prolong the debate, but I should mention my disappointment that, whenever the Government come under pressure, the Liberal Democrats and, in particular, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton quickly leap to their defence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give an estimate of the frequency with which the Liberal Democrats have voted with the Conservatives or the Government in the Committee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not carry such information in my head. I am delighted that the Liberal Democrats are making a slightly better effort with the Finance Bill than they do on the Floor of the House. However, I do not have the numbers to hand. [
Interruption.] From the response to that remark, it would seem that the rest of the members of the Committee have them in their minds.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should like the Committee to concentrate on schedule 35 and I should like remarks to be made clearly so that everyone can hear. At the moment, comments are being made that are indistinct from where I am sitting. 

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Most are indistinct to me, and those that I can distinguish do not inform me much-notably those from the Government Whip, who seems temporarily to have lost his voice and gone in for some kind of ventriloquism.

<P>
I do not want to prolong my remarks. I have two brief points to make. It is an obvious response to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton to say that all changes in taxation change behaviour. The question is whether those changes are beneficial, overall, to the economy. If they are not beneficial, but distort the economy, the gross domestic product, and therefore the tax yield, will be reduced. That will bring about a cost elsewhere in the economy greater than the benefit produced by the measure in question. That is what my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood was pointing out in his intervention earlier. That basic point seems to elude many hon. Members with respect to the clause.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that we should try to measure whether the proposal was a good idea by considering the lives that could be saved by it. That is irrelevant unless set against alternative uses of the £35 million. We cannot make the appropriate estimate until we know what the dead-weight cost of the measure is. Until we know what changes in behaviour will occur, we do not know whether one life will be saved by the measure. We have no idea at all. That is why I want to know-if the Paymaster General is kind enough to promise further estimates, that will be the end of the matter-the Government's best estimate of the proportion of the £35 million that will go to people who would not otherwise have insulated their home. Of course I know that the Government do not have an exact figure, but they could make a guesstimate. That is what working in the Treasury is all about, year by year-making difficult forecasts, guesses and guesstimates.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for her replies to our points, but she did not really deal with the issue of the growing complexity of our tax system. I asked about the compliance cost of the measure, and she pointed out that no complaints had been received so far from the sector affected. However, I made it clear in my introductory remarks that no such complaints should be expected, because, by and large, an industry that is being favoured by a lower VAT rate will probably not complain. The extra benefit to it will more than offset any extra cost incurred in complying with the VAT change. Nevertheless, there is a kind of national overhead and the cost goes up when the VAT system becomes more complex. The Treasury should have tried to estimate that before presenting another measure to increase the system's complexity without even attempting a rewrite of the underlying parts of the tax code.

<P>
The other point that was not fully answered related to the behavioural changes that the measure should be expected to produce. The Government must have made an estimate. In estimating the CO2 reduction as 140,000 tonnes, they must have estimated the dead-weight cost. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester will be setting a good example. He said that he would soon be busy lagging his pipes, but that his undertaking of that work was entirely uninfluenced by the cut in the VAT rate. That is a good example of a cost being incurred to the Treasury without producing a change in behaviour. It is a dead-weight cost and it will therefore not show up in the 140,000 tonnes.

<P>
Perhaps the Government have the figures, but we have not yet been told them. There is a strong smell, in the clause and schedule, of the Government wanting to be seen to do the right thing yet being extremely imprecise about the effects. The figure of 140,000 tonnes is very small compared with the colossal exchange of carbon from its gas form into solid form and vice versa that takes place every year in the natural operation of the carbon cycle. It is another example of an intensely bureaucratic way of not achieving very much.

<P>
The Minister announced that the provision is to be further extended to wind and water turbines. Again, there is an element of political correctness about that. It is by no means certain that the installation of such equipment will be without environmental cost, which in some cases could outweigh any reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. A constituent of mine tried to erect a wind turbine on his house and ran into a storm of opposition from those who lived nearby, who said that it would be noisy and visually intrusive. It was then discovered that the technology was imported and that it was somewhat unreliable.

<P>
I cannot remember the outcome of that case, but we must challenge the idea that alternative energy is automatically a good thing. If all the technologies that reduced carbon dioxide emissions were to be pursued, the undoubted way forward would be a big extension of nuclear power. However, those who advocate doing something about global warming are the first to criticise nuclear power. It is estimated that those other externalities, those other risks and costs, would outbalance the advantage of nuclear power, even though it produces electricity with negligible carbon dioxide emissions.

<P>
The Hinckley Point A nuclear power station in Somerset is to be decommissioned in the next few years. If it is not replaced, our carbon dioxide emissions will increase. However, the Liberal Democrats and others in Somerset presumably believe that building another Hinckley Point power station would be unwise because the associated risks and the long-term problems of waste disposal would outweigh the global warming benefits. I hope that exactly the same consideration will be brought to bear on wind and water turbines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has raised a number of wide-ranging and complex issues, which may go beyond the scope of matters that you want debated, Mr. Cook. I simply commend to him a booklet that I published called ``Energy-Clean and Green until 2050'', which will answer many of his queries.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My point is a rather simple one. Of course, the simplest point of all is that the Liberal Democrats are in a complete muddle about their environmental policy.

<P>
The problem is that the Government, rather uncritically, propose boosting certain forms of energy generation without asking what the offsetting costs might be. In giving a tax boost to certain forms of energy production, they should not only quantify the supposed benefits more precisely. They should also assess the other external costs, which might outweigh the benefits. That is a fairly simple concept, but it was not reflected in the remarks of the Paymaster General.

<P>
We are disturbed by the compliance cost and are still in the dark about the supposed benefits. Some of the issues are worrying, but we have debated them long enough. We will put down a marker-the Government must think more profoundly before advancing massively complex tax measures with doubtful environmental outputs.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There are 28 per cent. more deaths in winter than in summer in houses built before 1850; the figure declines to 15 per cent. more deaths in winter than in summer in houses built after 1980. I was a touch surprised by comments made during the debate on a reasonably modest schedule, the objective of which I thought that the Committee would have supported. The Government are introducing proposals regarding the installation of energy-saving materials in all homes at a 5 per cent. VAT rate. The policy is not exclusively environmental, but is multi-purpose, as I sought to suggest to the Committee. I agree that the environmental consequences are modest, but the proposal will none the less make a contribution. I would have thought that the wider issue of installation of energy-saving materials in homes as a matter of social policy specifically to tackle winter deaths would be applauded.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester continues to say that there is a dead-weight cost. He could always volunteer to donate the difference between VAT at 5 and 17.5 per cent. if he thought that he should not benefit from the reduced rate. Having argued about complexity, the Opposition have criticised a simple measure that would get money directly to those who would be deterred from installing energy-saving materials. I do not wish to provoke an argument. I have answered the hon. Gentleman, but I want to be more precise in subsequent answers to him. For instance, he asked about the expected growth in installation of energy-saving materials. I do not want to mislead him, and I agree that I should write to him on such issues, because he raises a fair point. A Government's judgment of whether there are dead-weight costs is acceptably set against the several objectives that the policy is capable of achieving.

<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): Does my hon. Friend accept that insulation of one's home does not represent a finite cost? One can choose to insulate to a greater or lesser extent. The hon. Member for Chichester might choose to insulate his windows, regardless of whether the rate of tax was 17.5 per cent. or 5 per cent. As a result of the new measures, he might decide to invest in insulating his roof and walls. We should perhaps visit him in a year or two to see whether that is the case.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Fortunately for the hon. Member for Chichester, arranging an awayday to his home is beyond the remit of the Committee. I am sure that he is mightily relieved to hear that. Although we would enjoy ourselves enormously, there would be no reduction on the duty paid on the wine with which he would no doubt provide us because that, too, would be beyond the remit of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) is right. The reduction will lead to a greater number of installations because people will be able to make their money go further. The hon. Member for Chichester legitimately asked how much further they would be able to make it go; I said that I would supply him with an answer.

<P>
On the point raised by the right hon. Member for Wells about nuclear power, we have been discussing the schedule-with which hon. Members have said that they agree-for some time, and I do not want to try your patience, Mr. Cook, by widening the debate to the environmental consequences of different ways of generating power. However, I must respectfully tell the right hon. Gentleman that that is not a valid point in relation to the schedule, which I hope the Committee will support.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Schedule 35 agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is an anti-avoidance clause, with which schedule 36 is associated. Is the Paymaster General happy that the clause will be enacted without legal challenge, because it would seem to reverse an entitlement conferred by the 8th VAT directive? The Paymaster General might have been involved in discussions about that, but will she reassure the Committee that the Government are in the clear in respect of a well-founded legal challenge based on the fact that the directive has overriding status?

<P>
On another point, there does not seem to be a de minimis threshold to the requirement for those traders to register, and, in some cases, their supplies will be negligible, so the Government could be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Will the Paymaster General also comment on that? Finally, might not the provision catch some innocent transactions or, more disturbingly, upset a business that has been sold several times? If the original supplies were sold some years ago, the present owners of the business might be completely ignorant of the transaction. They might have bought the business unaware that certain goods had been supplied and VAT reclaimed-the circumstances at which the clause and schedule are aimed. It is objectionable in principle that a clause enacted today could seek to unravel transactions or a chain of transactions that were undertaken in good faith. The clause could mean that a current owner of a business or supplier of goods is caught by a transaction carried out a few years ago when the law was different. Apart from those few queries, I am not minded to hold up the clause or schedule, but those matters should be examined in a little more detail.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The loophole is created by an interplay between two measures, one in the 8th and the other in the 13th directive, that were supposed to be unconnected. Those two measures were originally designed to help business. The first allows overseas businesses to obtain VAT refunds on their business purchases in the United Kingdom. The second means that businesses do not have to register for VAT just because they sell capital assets. That exempts small businesses from having to register simply because they occasionally dispose of a valuable asset. The loophole has been exploited in a damaging avoidance scheme sold to very large businesses, particularly in regard to company cars. The measure stops that occurring.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised three specific points. The first was on whether the measure is secure from challenge under European law or whether it is outside European law. I told him that it was not outside European law. Member states are not entitled to include capital assets within registration thresholds under EC rules and the measure does not allow that. Some people believe that the measure could be successfully challenged, but we disagree. European rules provide that overseas businesses should be liable to pay VAT. We do not believe that we are open to challenge on that because we are doing what we are supposed to do in that regard.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's second question was why there was no de minimis provision to prevent the measure from applying to small disposals. No overseas business has to register for VAT if it is prepared to forgo its VAT claim on the purchase or import of the goods concerned, which puts overseas businesses in the same position as UK unregistered businesses. A de minimis limit would simply leave the overseas business its existing unfair advantage, through the interplay between the two provisions, over UK businesses.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's final point was on transactions. No examples of the problems that the hon. Gentleman describes have come to light. Businesses that have registered were using the interplay between the two provisions that we seek to prevent. On knowledge about one company taking over another, companies provide warranties for themselves to make sure that they are covered in such eventualities but where an issue needed to be considered, I would expect Customs and Excise to consider the matter with a light touch-the only companies registering are the ones that seemed to be exploiting the loopholes. The de minimis limit would be inappropriate because it would put UK businesses at a disadvantage. The question of legal challenge arose in regard to the inappropriate use of two separate measures and we have restored the position whereby both directives apply. That does not cause a problem with our European partners.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification and particularly for her assurance that the measure might not be so rigorously enforced in cases where application of the clause would be inequitable. I assure her that some warranties would not have been sought in respect of past VAT claims, for the good reason that the clause and schedule were not on the statute book-or perhaps even contemplated. She is right that general warranties are sometimes sought and given where businesses are sold, but in many cases they are more specific and might not be covered by the provision. She appeared sympathetic to that point. In the light of her other remarks, we will not press for a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The clause cannot pass without comment. It increases the rate of landfill tax to £11 a tonne. We have another tax escalator whereby a tax will relentlessly go up, apparently without too much worry about collateral damage. The explanatory notes state that the yield
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is somewhat lower than anticipated  last year.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Has that been caused by the unfortunate and disagreeable side effect of people beginning to avoid or even to evade the tax? The most obvious way in which they can do so is to throw the waste into the nearest canal. Fly tipping is a problem. There is an incentive for it if fly tippers do it not only for their convenience, but to avoid a tax. Rather than responsibly taking the waste to the nearest landfill, they may simply throw it away. Now they will have an increasing financial incentive to do so. I would like the Financial Secretary to comment on the prevalence of fly tipping. Does he have figures on its incidence? Is it increasing? Does he know of any other cause for the apparent lower yield from past increases in the tax?

<P>
Why is the revenue from landfill tax not being used to offset other business taxes, as was the original purpose? When we introduced it, we used it to cut national insurance contributions by 0.2 per cent., if I remember correctly, which was approximately the same as the yield. The Government have stopped that, so the money seems simply to be a general tax measure, disappearing from view into the Consolidated Fund. It is certainly not being used to help business beyond the extent of funding the environmental trust, which was a provision built into the original legislation.

<P>
Will the Financial Secretary assure the Committee that a review will be carried out as to whether the tax is efficient, not only as a tax raiser but in environmental terms? That returns us to the point about fly tipping. The Government have announced that the escalator will go on until 2002. If damage is being caused, there ought to be a provision for coming off the escalator. The Government were tremendously enthusiastic about a similar escalator for road fuel duty until the damage became unsustainable. I refer to political damage; that was the only damage that the Government were interested in on that policy, although it did huge industrial damage. In a parallel way, the Government might be persuaded to reconsider landfill tax and its rates, if it is true that there have been unfortunate and unforeseen behavioural consequences.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms)</b> As the right hon. Member for Wells said, the clause increases the standard rate of landfill tax from £10 a tonne to £11, with effect from 1 April 2000. The increase continues the programme of pre-announced landfill tax increases set out in last year's Budget. The increases send out a storm signal to waste producers and management companies to switch away from landfill towards waste minimisation, reuse and recycling. No one disagrees about the importance of reducing the amount of waste disposed of through landfill. The landfill tax undoubtedly has a significant part to play in that endeavour, which is why the previous Government introduced it, as the right hon. Gentleman said.<P>

<P>
The rate will increase by £1 each year until 2004, when the cost will be £15 a tonne and the measure will be reviewed. We will monitor the impacts of the landfill tax over that period to facilitate a better understanding of how behaviour is changed by the varying rates. We will consider the relationship between those rates and other factors that affect the production and management of waste. The expected revenue yield from the increase in the standard rate is £30 million on a non-indexed basis.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me a couple of questions. The Government take a dim view of fly tipping, whoever is responsible for it. However, there is not yet significant evidence to support the view that the introduction of the landfill tax by the previous Government, or subsequent increases in the rate, has given rise to a substantial increase in fly tipping. The Tidy Britain group was especially concerned about that issue and carried out a survey in the past year, which demonstrated that, although there is a modest increase in reports of that activity, it is primarily domestic rather than commercial waste that is being fly-tipped. Households do not directly pay the landfill tax, whereas those who produce commercial waste have an incentive to avoid it. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we take seriously both fly tipping and the illegal dumping of waste at sites exempt from waste management licensing. We have asked the environmental regulators to continue to seek out and prosecute those responsible. There are severe criminal penalties for fly tipping, including up to five years' imprisonment and unlimited fines on conviction.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked me why there was not a further cut in employers' national insurance contributions, as there was when the landfill tax was introduced. In 1997-98, that reduction cost more than the tax raised. If there were a cut in national insurance contributions to correspond to the £1 increase, the effect would be tiny. When the climate change levy is introduced on 1 April 2001, the £1 billion revenue raised will be used to fund a cut of 0.3 percentage points in employers' national insurance contributions and additional support for energy efficiency measures. It would not be sensible to add the small sum of £30 million to the large sum that is being recycled through reduced employers' national insurance contributions following the introduction of the climate change levy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I did not suggest to the Financial Secretary that the cut should necessarily be made annually. I asked what had happened to the revenue from the existing increase. The Government inherited a rate of £7 a tonne; by degrees, they have doubled it to £15 a tonne. Rather than pocketing it all, they have ample scope to apply that revenue to the business sector-or to a narrower sector. We have discovered a new stealth tax, which was not announced before the general election. The Government are taking the revenue from an existing tax, which was being reapplied to the business sector, and are now using it for general revenue purposes. I am disappointed to learn, by implication, that the revenue will not be applied as we applied it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he thought that the employers' national insurance contribution rate had been reduced by 0.2 per cent. I am not certain, but I recollect that it was 0.1 per cent. The additional £1 raises £30 million, so it seems more consistent with the lower than with the higher figure. Only a small sum is at stake.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is about six years since I had responsibility for such matters, but I seem to remember that the original annual revenue from the landfill tax was just under £500 million. That funded a small but significant cut in national insurance contributions. Employers' national insurance contributions represent such a large sum that it costs a lot of money to make such a small reduction. However, we applied the whole of the revenue to that cut in NICs.

<P>
The Government had the opportunity to continue that philosophy and, if that is what they had determined to do, they could have applied it in the same way once they had built up a sufficient sum from the increases in the landfill tax. Their failure to do so casts doubt over whether they will do what they say on the climate change levy. They promise to recycle the revenue, but they may do to that tax what they have done to the landfill tax. They might do it initially, but stop once the tax has been implemented. After the initial revenue has been applied as they suggest, future increases would go into the Treasury coffers, and no attempt would be made to return it to the corporate sector. Unfortunately, it is simply another way of taxing business.

<P>
We have been told of the environmental justifications, but they could easily unravel and be eroded by side effects such as fly tipping. The Minister has given us some assurance about that, it is being watched and it is not a desperate problem at the moment, but common sense leads us to suppose that if the tax reaches an intolerable level, the incentive to fly tip will increase. A good and enforceable tax at a low rate can become a bad and unenforceable tax at a higher rate, and we are getting into that territory if the Government persist with the escalator.

<P>
We have voted against such increases in the past. I am sure that we shall do so again. However, given the hon. Gentleman's assurance that he is at least watching the problems of fly tipping and so on, we do not propose to divide the Committee.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 136 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 137</center></H4>

<H4><center>Disposals which are not taxable</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I seek some information about subsection (2), which deals with an issue that I have raised with the Treasury on several occasions-the difficulties that the levy causes for recycling businesses. Subsection (2) appears to meet many of the concerns of companies that have talked to me. Under the existing regime, such companies find themselves in serious difficulties if they take material, segregate it and then supply it to other contracts in other situations. My attention was drawn to at least one firm that had gone out of business as a result of the operation of the levy.

<P>
I look to the Financial Secretary to give me some information about the intention behind the subsection. I hope that it meets the difficulties that I described, but I may want to interrogate him a little further, depending on his response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause introduces new paragraph (a), in which I think that the hon. Gentleman is especially interested. It also amends section 62(7)(b) of the Finance Act 1996. The paragraphs specify the cases in which regulations may treat material comprised in a disposal and held temporarily as not being a taxable disposal. They include cases in which inert materials are stored for restoration purposes.

<P>
We introduced an exemption from the landfill tax on 1 October 1999 for inert waste used to restore landfill sites and to fill working and old quarries. The exemption facilitates the rapid restoration of sites, reduces the impact on the landscape and promotes the use of waste soils for the benefit of the environment.

<P>
From the same date, the rules allowing temporary disposals were also extended on a extra-statutory basis by Customs and Excise to allow the storage or sorting of inactive material for future use. That allowed site operators to store and use restoration materials without incurring tax in cases when the material could not be immediately placed in the area of the site being restored or filled.

<P>
The clause will allow for legislative amendments to give effect to what is already allowed on an extra-statutory basis. They will give certainty to the waste management industry, so firms such as those that informed the hon. Member for Hazel Grove of their concerns will welcome them. The changes will also encourage the use of waste soils for the benefit of the environment, so I commend the clause to the Committee. I hope that that explanation provides the assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary. The operation that has been described to me is one in which materials are brought from, say, demolished buildings or site works. Segregation then takes place, and materials capable of reuse such as second-hand bricks and top soil are stored on site until they are moved elsewhere at an appropriate time. In effect, there is a holding area. That does not seem to be precisely what is covered by the paragraph, which appears to cover storage on a site before use on that site. Will the Financial Secretary clarify the position in those circumstances?

<P>
A viable business opportunity has existed for a long time to recycle such materials. It is developing in relation to second-hand road surfacing material, for which the same issues can arise. Material may be taken from the original location, stored, segregated or processed and reused on other contracts in places outside the holding area. The followers of that line of business are caught in a quagmire of overlapping levy arrangements. I hoped that the Financial Secretary would give me some assurance that that issue was tackled in the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause deals at least in part with the hon. Gentleman's concern. The previous legislation dealt with temporary disposals, but the clause deals with disposals that are held temporarily. That is the change that is being made. A question raised by the earlier drafting was in whose eyes the disposal was to be considered temporary, because as far as the dumping was concerned, the disposal was final. If that were not so, there would be no taxable disposal at all and no need to make it non-taxable. The clause refers to the material comprised in the disposal being held temporarily pending something else happening to it. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman, but if he wants further clarification, perhaps he will drop me a line-or pursue the matter further now.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 456, in page 106, line 28, after ``communications'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and in any event shall be made-

<P>
(a) in respect of an annual return required to be made under regulations made under section 203 of the Taxes Act 1988, before 6 April 2001 and of an amount at least equal to £50 per return;

<P>
(b) in respect of a return required to be made under section 9 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, before 30 September 2001 and of an amount at least equal to £10 per return; and

</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is the anti-spin amendment. What the Government propose in clause 139 is unobjectionable. The only question is about the way in which the regulations will be set up. The aim of the amendment is to proble what is intended. I hope that the Financial Secretary, who managed to avoid the breakfast to which he subjected me and his Permanent Secretary this morning, was spending the morning happily burrowing away, so that he will be able to tell us what regulations will be introduced.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We spent some time trying to work out the purpose of the amendment and I hoped that the hon. Gentleman might speak at greater length, as he has done on several occasions, to elaborate what he was driving at.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should have thought that the Financial Secretary would be grateful for small mercies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Perhaps I should be, but I remain a little mystified. However, I shall do my best.

<P>
The clause and schedule 38 make provision for incentives to encourage the use of electronic services for communicating with the tax authorities or making payments. The Finance Act 1999 enabled the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to develop new electronic services for taxpayers as an alternative to traditional paper-based communication. Over the next 12 months the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise will introduce services that will allow taxpayers to send their income tax self-assessment, PAYE and VAT returns to the tax authorities over the internet. They are planning to introduce further electronic services later. The clause will enable the tax authorities to offer incentives in the form of discounts to encourage people to take up the new services.

<P>
As a first step, one-off discounts will be offered to people who use the internet for income tax self-assessment, PAYE and VAT returns. We have announced a £10 discount for people who complete their income tax self-assessment return in that way, with £50 discount for PAYE, £50 for VAT and a further £50 for those who submit tax credit returns using the internet.

<P>
I thought that the intention of the amendment might be to expand the applicability of those discounts to other electronic return mechanisms such as the electronic lodgement service. If that had been its intention, I would have resisted it, on the grounds that we want to keep a tight focus on encouraging use of the internet. We particularly want small businesses to get connected and start engaging in electronic commerce. The discounts that we propose provide a modest incentive for them to do so, and we want to keep a tight focus on that objective. I hope that I have provided the information that the hon. Gentleman sought.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the regulations will provide, on a continuing basis, for incentives at least equal to those that he mentioned?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The proposals that we have announced relate to the next two years. We have not announced what we intend to do beyond that, but we shall look carefully at what happens as a result of the incentives that we have announced and decide what to do in the light of our experience of them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We now enter what my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) would call complex territory. We are dealing with a matter of the first importance. I am again hard pressed to know what my interest might be, but there might be one that I should declare. [
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is in order for right hon. and hon. Members to communicate inside and outside the Committee. It is not in order for them to communicate from inside to outside or from outside to inside the Room.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As I was looking in the wrong direction, that remark was obscure to me, Mr. Cook.

<P>
We are dealing with a series of measures that relate to the enormously important question of the withholding tax and its sequel, the exchange of information provisions. The background to the clause is the claiming of an enormous victory by the Chancellor of the Exechequer in persuading his colleagues in the EU not to adopt the withholding tax. Is that a real or a hollow victory? The amendment seeks to nail down that point.

<P>
If the exchange of information is agreed multilaterally, so that there is a set of agreements not only between the members of the EU but, critically, with Switzerland and the United States and, more generally, with other jurisdictions that have actual or potential Eurobond and other issuing markets, we shall have a real victory on our hands. That business will not transfer from London-for instance, to Zurich-if we can ensure that the new provisions are genuinely multilateral.

<P>
If, on the other hand, the intention-not of the Chancellor but of others in the EU-is to construct the appearance of moving forward only when the Swiss and US authorities and others come in on the act and agree to a multilateral provision, but in reality is a desire for the EU only to move forward, and if they then discover that the Swiss and the American authorities are not willing to make a multilateral agreement, we shall have a hollow victory. There is no point in having won the battle to prevent a withholding tax that would have shifted business from London if the result was to have conceded an exchange of information provision that, to a lesser but nevertheless considerable extent, would impose the same result and switch business from here to Zurich. That would be the result if the exchange of information were not multilateral, because investors and issuers would prefer to deal with major issuing markets in countries that do not impose those necessarily onerous conditions.

<P>
In short, we are discussing whether the Government mean to stick by their guns and allow the EU to implement the provisions for exchange of information only if a multilateral agreement is in place. Amendment No. 457 makes it clear that the Board of Inland Revenue would not be allowed to designate a territory under the regulations as one with which information could be exchanged unless that territory had entered into arrangements for the exchange of equivalent information. For example, it would not be possible to designate Switzerland unless that country was included in the arrangements.

<P>

<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, but is not he assuming that all those arrangements are reciprocal? For example, the new Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo might well wish to receive information on attempts by ex-President Mobutu to evade taxation. Although we would wish to help, the flaw in proposed subsection (1A)(b) is that it would forbid us from assisting unless there was substantial British investment in that country-and I dare say that there is not. The link is too automatic.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman may well have a point, but the amendment is not aimed at the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nor at Congo Brazzaville. It is not a Congo amendment; it is a Switzerland amendment. If it requires redrafting to ensure that it deals more specifically with the cases that we are trying to deal with in other major markets, so be it. I would not want to spend time weakly debating in favour of a ludicrous proposition; we need to concern ourselves with the exchange of information with content.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I would go further. I am not sure that our amendment is sufficient or necessary. I am unsure whether it catches the point enough to solve the problem, which is why it is not sufficient. I am not sure that it is necessary because, if the Government ensure that the agreements have been reached multilaterally before letting the EU proceed, what is in domestic legislation does not matter. I am not making a strong argument for the amendment but am seeking to raise the extremely serious issue of whether the Government are absolutely committed to the principle and will not allow the EU's exchange of information provisions to go forward unless there has been a multilateral agreement. If we can get from the Paymaster General a categorical assurance that diplomatic pressure and, if necessary, the veto will be used to ensure that those measures will not be signed up to unless agreements have been reached, at least with Switzerland, the United States and other major issuing jurisdictions, we would then rest content and not seek to argue the toss on the wording of amendments Nos. 457, 458 and 460.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman fully appreciates the importance, sensitivity and precision with which I should reply to the amendments. I hope that he will be sufficiently reassured by my response and will not press the amendment at the end of the debate. Both the amendments and the way in which the Government respond are important to those who study our record.

<P>
On the wider question of the withholding tax and what was agreed at the European Council at Feira, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has had time to study the conclusions and has noted the sequence of events that must occur with regard to further discussion of a draft directive on exchange of information.

<P>
Clause 140 is part of a package of measures intended to improve the effectiveness of exchange of information arrangements to help to prevent individuals evading tax while promoting the UK as a competitive environment for business. The Government are sensitive and responsive to the concerns of the City of London and to the operation of the international capital markets. That is why we went to such great lengths-with considerable success-to persuade our European colleagues against the use of a withholding tax. Had we followed the Conservative's course, refusing to negotiate and leaving the room, we would still have the withholding tax over us.

<P>
We are sensitive and responsive to concerns and so have consulted City representative bodies on the detailed implementation of the new reporting arrangements. Government and Opposition members of the Committee joined me in welcoming the constructive involvement of those bodies in the consultations when we discussed clause 110. I announced in the debate on that clause one important area in which we have agreed that information reporting from April 2001 should be limited. That shows that the consultations are going well and that an understanding exists between our officials and the City. We will take decisions in the light of the consultations that we are having with the City about other areas. The principle underlying our approach will be to ensure that the new requirements are effective against cross-border tax evasion while preserving the competitive position of the financial markets. We have no intention, having seen off a withholding tax on a European-wide basis, of introducing unnecessary burdens on the City in the form of complex information reporting rules. We are continuing to discuss that matter.

<P>
The amendments would introduce limitations on the new information reporting arrangements that go beyond the measures that I announced to the Committee in respect of beneficial ownership details. Amendment No. 457 would exclude information about residents of countries with which the United Kingdom cannot yet exchange information. Amendment No. 458 would allow for information returns for bank and building society interests earned by non-resident investors to be limited in some cases to aggregate returns made by an intermediary acting on behalf of several investors, so that the identity of the original investor is not disclosed. Amendment No. 460 would require routine information exchanges relating to interest income to be carried out only with other EU member states, or with other countries, on a reciprocal basis.

<P>
I come to the principles raised in each of those amendments. As regards amendment No. 457, I recognise that investors are wary of information reporting to the Revenue and concerned that the confidentiality of the information should be respected, especially when it is clear that the Revenue has no use for that information for the purposes of information exchange. In the debate under clause 110, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said that there were different sensitivities that applied to investors from different parts of the world, depending on their tax regimes. That is why we must be careful about what we say in public on that issue, as I hope that the hon. Member for West Dorset will agree.

<P>
There are several reasons, including those unrelated to tax, why investors require confidentiality in their financial affairs. Investors' concerns in that respect will be an important element in their choice of investment location. I assure the members of the Committee, and all those who follow our proceedings, that the information obtained by the Revenue as a result of the clause will, like all taxpayer information held by that body, be held subject to strict confidentiality safeguards. In no case would information be passed on unless we can be satisfied that the other country respects the confidentiality of taxpayer information, as we do. That information will only be released on the condition that it is used for tax purposes.

<P>
I recognise the banks' concerns-apart from those about confidentiality-to keep information reporting obligations to manageable proportions. That is why I have asked the Inland Revenue whether an administrative solution might be found to the problem; it will hold discussions with City representatives and report back to me. That was one of the main strands to the comments made by Opposition Members; we must ensure that the burdens, in their new form, do not become as onerous as before.

<P>
The principle underlying any administrative arrangements would be that unnecessary routine reporting to the Inland Revenue-for example, where the Inland Revenue is not yet in a position to exchange information-would be cut out, while preserving the principle that financial institutions should gather information on all non-resident investors and be ready to make routine information returns when needed. The results of the Inland Revenue's preliminary discussions on that issue with the City suggest that such arrangements are more likely to be workable and to meet our twin objectives of effectively tackling tax evasion while preserving the competitive position of the City than an approach that excludes investors from some parts of the world from reporting arrangements altogether.

<P>
The alternative approach put forward in the amendment would be less effective and unworkable. I am also advised that the amendment is technically flawed. However, I shall not deal with those points because the hon. Gentleman's concluding remarks showed that he was more interested in the surrounding principles than in the precise wording.

<P>
As I said earlier, we have no intention of introducing new and unnecessary burdens on the City in the form of needlessly complex information reporting rules. The Inland Revenue is working closely with City representative bodies to consider how we can reduce information reporting in a way that maintains the Government's exchange of information strategy and, at the same time, deals with the concerns of the City. In the light of those comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that amendment No. 457 should be withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment No. 458 appears to allow for information returns in respect of bank and building society interest earned by non-resident investors to be limited in some cases to aggregate returns made by intermediaries acting on behalf of a number of investors so that the identity of the individual investor is not disclosed. I shall explain why I believe that the amendment would not achieve its intended effect if the hon. Gentleman wishes, but I first want to comment on aggregate reporting in general.

<P>
Information reporting, which simply gives aggregated details of amounts of interest received by or on behalf of a number of non-resident investors is of no real value to any tax authority in tackling cross-border tax evasion. Therefore, the approach adopted in the amendment would defeat the entire purpose of routine information reporting, which is to tackle evasion and avoidance, which I am sure the Committee would not wish to encourage. At the same time, it would introduce unnecessary burdens on business by requiring intermediaries to produce aggregate returns to the Inland Revenue, which would be of no value. The principle behind amendment No. 458 relates to burdens and to when it is appropriate to exchange information.

<P>
Amendment No. 460 appears to require that routine information exchanges relating to interest should be carried out only with other EU member states or with other countries on a reciprocal basis. In other words, the Inland Revenue should not provide information to tax authorities of non-EU countries unless they are able to provide us with information on a similar basis. As we made clear in our Budget announcement, information obtained under the clause will not be exchanged with other countries other than on a reciprocal basis. No amendment is necessary to achieve that result.

<P>
The principle of reciprocity is firmly established in all the UK's current exchange of information arrangements, both under double taxation agreements and under the EU mutual assistance directive. That is the norm internationally. It will also be an important ingredient of the new tax information exchange agreements provided for under clauses 141 and 142. We insist on two-way exchange of information because that helps to ensure that the UK receives the information that it needs. As our double-taxation treaty has shown, the wider the net, the better the reinforcement. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman on the principal points that we are discussing with the City of London and that he will be content to withdraw the amendment.
