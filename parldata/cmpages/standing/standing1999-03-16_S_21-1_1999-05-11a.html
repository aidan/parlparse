<H4><center>Clause 78</center></H4>
<H4><center>Secretary of State's scheme</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> In our clause stand part debate, I have tried to refer to general concerns raised by the Minister's response to certain amendments. Concerns remain in two critical areas. The first is the level of assets with which an individual will be left before the provisions kick in, and the second is the level of support that the Government can reasonably expect from outside organisations, such as churches and support groups.
<P>
The Minister's responses did not satisfy our queries, and only added to the concerns of Opposition Members. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) pointed out, we may expect further debate on such matters. That is especially true of the other place, where many people are involved in faith groups, churches and support organisations. However, at this stage, that is all that I need say on clause 78.
<P>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien): It is plain nonsense to suggest that we are going to raid the coffers of churches, voluntary organisations and charities&#151;no doubt, even the coffers of charities for widows and orphans&#151;to avoid paying for support. I condemn the hon. Gentleman's attempt to stir up alarm for blatantly political and short-term ends.
<P>
We are setting up a national system of support to replace the haphazard local authority, voluntary and charitable schemes that are currently in place. Charities such as the Refugee Council and others receive state funding to provide some services for asylum seekers. We will continue to support such services. As charities provide support as agents acting on the Government's behalf, it is quite right that they should be funded by the state. Clause 78 deals with that.
<P>
However, we do not expect charities to step into the state's shoes. I am not aware, for example, of any charity providing the long-term full support proposed by the Government for the 14-day period needed to take people outside the public support system that we are implementing. Therefore, charities, church groups and others should be reassured and should not listen to the rather alarmist nonsense that has been trotted out.
<P>
The Secretary of State will establish the scheme set out in clause 74, and clause 78 provides for the detail of how it will be put in place. Subsection (3) provoked a lively, if ill-focused debate this morning, but it does not set out matters in the way that some have suggested.
<P>
Let me explain what subsection (3) is intended to do. In setting out the new support scheme in regulations, we want to be able to take into account support and assets that are otherwise available to a person or might reasonably be expected to be available. The provision is directed, first and foremost, at a person's own resources, but may extend to support from friends and relatives already in the country and, in principle, to support from certain organisations, should those organisations be willing and able to provide such support.
<P>
Contrary to the impression that may have been given this morning, the Department of Social Security generally disregards &#163;3,000 of assets in assessing eligibility for income support. However, when assessing asylum seekers' eligibility, the Department takes into account a person's total assets. That reflects the fact that asylum seekers are assumed to be here in the short term and are being helped in an emergency, which is reflected in the fact that they receive 90 per cent. of normal income support. We want to establish our own rules and protocols for how to treat the assets of someone on income support. They will cover how much cash to disregard and consider items of jewellery and other personal possessions.
<P>
All manner of interesting quesitons will be considered. For example, we shall have to consider how we deal with someone who owns a car. Will we regard an old banger in the same way that we regard a Rolls-Royce? What will happen if someone has a mobile phone, and what will be our position towards credit cards? Such issues will produce much discussion in the consultation process. However, they are not a matter for the Committee. They will be covered in regulations and interesting discussions will form part of the draft.
<P>
I am not writing the regulations now; they will be set out at the appropriate time. However, I wish to deal with the issue of jewellery. Personal jewellery, watches of a reasonable value and wedding rings are not relevant. Let me reassure everyone that they will not be considered. We intend to consider people who deliberately secrete away large sums of money in the form of gold and jewellery. Sometimes the assets are worth thousands of pounds. As I said earlier, a woman told me quite openly why she had such assets.
<P>
If someone makes a deliberate attempt to hoodwink the taxpayer, the regulations should be able to deal with that. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that there was no distance between us on that. If there is a good reason for not taking account of an asset&#151;the person involved might not own it, or it might be a family heirloom&#151;we shall be able to consider those factors reasonably through the regulations.
<P>
We also need to take a view on the resources available to someone. If an asylum seeker has relatives who are already established in the country and who are willing and able to offer support that partly or wholly alleviates destitution, we shall want him to consider drawing on that support. We might need to top it up if required. However, if relatives decline to offer assistance, we shall not be able to force them to do so and we shall not generally reject an asylum seeker's claim for assistance on the ground that support might be expected to be available. That is an important reassurance.
<P>
We are familiar with the circumstances that might occur at the limits. For example, a sponsorship arrangement might be in place that imposes a legal obligation on a relative from which he cannot walk away. In such cases, we would steer the asylum seeker towards that support, although we would be bound to support him if the relative refused to do so. We would then reclaim the costs from the relative in the way described in clause 89.
<P>
We need to include the concept of support that might be reasonably expected to be available to the asylum seeker in order to cover several situations. First, support may be avialable but an offer is not made. For exmaple, a rich relative is known to exist, but he may not yet have been approached.
<P>
Secondly, someone might deliberately deprive himself of assets to qualify for support. Let us consider the case of someone who arrives at Heathrow with &#163;5,000 in his pockets and who, three days later, claims to be destitute and cannot explain where the money went. However, he might suggest where it went by pointing to new gold jewellery or to a car that he has just bought. We would want to take account of such assets and the money that would arise if he disposed of them. The Department of Social Security arguably adopts a more robust test when someone deliberately deprives himself of cash in order to qualify for benefits.
<P>
Thirdly, there might be other organisations to which the asylum seeker might look for support in certain and particularly limited circumstances. That brings me to the role of charitable and other organisations. I want to reiterate the reassurance that I gave about them. They have a clear role to play in supporting asylum seekers. Among other things, we are in active discussion with several organisations, including the Refugee Council and the Refugee Arrivals Project, about the role that they might play in the initial reception and screening of asylum seekers for which we shall fund them through grant aid.
<P>
State funds will be available if such organisations offer support that is comparable to what we might otherwise offer. If they are able to use state money to support asylum seekers, we will expect them to take advantage of state funding, which may be directed through a charitable or voluntary organisation. That might reasonably be expected to be available, at least for the duration of the period for which the support was on offer. For example, support is on offer for a day or two while people are initially brought into the country and their circumstances are sorted out. There are other circumstances in which support from the voluntary sector might be an alternative to or complement the support that the directorate can offer. As I said earlier, we would not want the double counting of benefits in which state funding were provided through a voluntary organisation and directly through the asylum support directorate. Double counting would not be fair to the taxpayer or to the charitable donor.
<P>
The offer or provision of temporary or limited support from a voluntary body would not place an ongoing liability on that body or disqualify the asylum seeker from entitlement to support under part VI. In formulating the regulations covering the issue, we aim to recognise the limited role of such assistance and to provide a route from that assistance to support under part VI.
<P>
Let us be clear: we would not use the provision or regulations made under it to define a role for voluntary organisations that they were unable or unwilling to take on. It would be neither practical nor defensible to expect support to be available from a voluntary body if that body declined to operate. There is no question of our saying, ``Go away, agency X ought to help people like you and we will not provide any assistance.'' There is no intention whatever to impose an obligation on the voluntary sector that it is unwilling to take on. The subsection will be used to form a partnership with the voluntary sector. I want hon. Members who earlier sought to construe otherwise to be clear that their attempt to do so was misconceived; I hope that they will accept that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 748, in page 49, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and no appeal against the decision is made or any appeal against the decision is decided and refused and a period of grace to be prescribed has expired.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 832, in Clause 84, page 50, line 24, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and temporary support under section 79 shall be provided pending the determination of any such appeal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 833, in Clause 84, page 50, line 27, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and support under section 74 shall continue pending the determination of the appeal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This small group of amendments considers the provision of temporary support, as well as the provision of support in clause 84. The amendments seek to establish that the support provided will be continued while someone is making an appeal against the denial of support. Temporary support is important at that stage because it is vital that a person who is going to appeal is able to exist during the period when the appeal is being considered. There would be major problems in locating an individual if he or she had been put into temporary accommodation but was turned out of it on the first refusal. An appeal is a meaningless facility if someone is not able to stay in the accommodation until the final determination of whether he is eligible for support.
<P>
I hope for the Minister's reassurance on how the relationship between the temporary provision of support in clause 79 and the appeals process in clause 84 will work. I give the example of an individual who has asked the Secretary of State for support. He may or may not have been given temporary support, but in either case his request has been refused and he decides to take up his right to appeal. That person will be without accommodation&#151;that could create further problems in terms of locating the individual&#151;and without any means of supporting himself while his case goes to appeal unless the Minister can reassure us otherwise.
<P>
If the appeals process works effectively and rapidly&#151;that is not always the case in the immigration system&#151;it could be a fairly low-cost option. Keeping people in accommodation while the appeal is on-going may turn out to be a lower cost, particularly for those who subsequently win the right to support on appeal, than shunting them out, having to keep track of them and then having to find another solution if they win an appeal.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> This is the sort of issue that can largely be dealt with in regulations, but the hon. Gentleman is right to raise it at this stage and probe the way in which we will deal with it.
<P>
The amendments would require the Secretary of State to provide continuing support pending the determination of an appeal. The intention is that the asylum seeker should make an application for support if he would otherwise be destitute. The Asylum Support Directorate, using eligibility procedures which are currently being devised and which will in due course be the subject of regulations, will determine whether an asylum seeker is capable of supporting himself. We expect that the overwhelming majority of asylum seekers will not be able to do so, and the number of people who will fall outside the provisions will in practice not be large. It may include those who have large amounts of gold or cash with them or access to large bank accounts.
<P>
We believe that the provision is the best way to keep control of where people are&#151;making sure that they keep IND informed of their address if they are merely on support or remain in the accommodation if they have access to both support and accommodation under the Asylum Support Directorate's mechanism. Therefore, there will be no incentive to declare a person destitute; in many ways the incentive will be to ensure that, wherever possible, we keep in contact, because we would want to be able to process the case quickly.
<P>
Equally, if the directorate concludes that an asylum seeker can provide support for himself, he will be given reasons and will be able to undertake an appeal. If we cease to support someone, it will typically be because it is clear that he has other means of support. It would be unreasonable if the Secretary of State were to conclude that someone who did not have access to the system had support when he did not. We would have to make an assessment based on the eligibility criteria and decide whether the person was otherwise likely to be destitute. We intend that any application to an adjudicator should take place speedily. If the Asylum Support Directorate has concluded that the asylum seeker is not destitute, that will be the basis on which the means to support him are considered.
<P>
How the person supports himself in the intervening period will depend on two things&#151;how much money he has and the detail of the regulations that emerge in due course. We may look at ways in which we can provide some interim support if it is clear that it is a marginal case where there is some doubt. I suspect that most people in that category will not qualify and, therefore, the marginal case to which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) referred will not arise.
<P>
The regulations will be the place to deal with marginal cases, the detail of how we assess them and whether and the extent to which we provide interim support pending an appeal. I accept that it is a straightforward and proper issue for the hon. Gentleman to raise now, in order to probe the way in which we seek to do it. At this stage, because we will look at the detail in the regulations, I can only say that we will look at marginal cases and see whether there is some means of support. For example, we could give charitable or voluntary organisations funding to enable them to provide interim support pending an appeal, in hostel or other accommodation. Various options are open to us. None of us wants people to be without provision. Indeed, our commitment is that they should not be.
<P>
Having given those indications to the hon. Gentleman, I hope that he will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a useful response. We must have had happy pills with our lunch to return to the afternoon sitting in a more constructive frame of mind than at the end of the morning sitting when we had a lively debate about the Government's intentions. The Minister has made it clear that he intends to deal with marginal cases through regulations. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Government Numbers 771, 773 and 774
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Government are commited to working in partnership with local authorities and we hope that those with spare housing will be reasonably used to accommodating asylum seekers and will co-operate. Taking the power to compel reluctant authorities to make available their spare and unused housing is a last resort. It is unlikely that we will need to use it in the foreseeable future. However, we recognise the concerns of local authorities about the use of that power.
<P>
It has always been our intention to provide proper safeguards for local authorities regarding their treatment if faced by a direction under the provision. I regret that those safeguards were not set out in the Bill, but it was difficult to specify exactly what was required, so we left out some of the detail until officials had had further discussions with the various local authority associations. Those discussions have been taken forward&#151;I will not suggest that they are over because there is further work to do. In view of the need to consult, there will be a long-term and continuing dialogue between the Government and local authorities about this matter.
<P>
The Government amendments will provide guarantees to local authorities. Arrangements to use local authority accommodation will be contractual and will cover matters such as the level of rent, when it is paid, who pays other charges, the responsibility for repairs, the conditions of the property at the end of the term, inspection arrangements and a host of other matters. However, if there is a direction, there cannot be a normal contract because one party is entering it as a matter of law rather than as a matter of choice.
<P>
Amendment No. 771 will address that problem by requiring the Secretary of State to set out his policy on those matters in regulations before he can make a direction. We want to take account of all legitimate concerns before making such regulations. The complementary amendments Nos. 773 and 774 will ensure that a proper power exists for the Secretary of State to reimburse the local authority for the cost of complying with the direction.
<P>
Does the hon. Member for Hertsmere wish me to deal with amendment No. 386?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Yes please.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is a valid point in the amendment. The hon. Gentleman seeks some reassurance that we will use the power only if we ever have to acquire suitable accommodation. The term ``suitable'' has two aspects, one of which I dealt with in my response to other questions. In a sense it tracks back to homelessness legislation. I sense that the hon. Gentleman might want it to be used in a wider sense.
<P>
In implementing our proposals for support for asylum seekers we are wholly committed to avoiding anything that smacks of social exclusion and to avoiding putting people into sink estates where they would be isolated from others in the community. That would be a recipe for creating community tension, which is something that we are anxious to avoid. As Minister with responsibility for race equality, I have an obligation to ensure that we maintain good community relations, and, despite recent incidents, there is much evidence that Britain has developed what is increasingly becoming a more successful multiracial society. But we need to work on that so that Britain becomes even more successful multiracially, and we shall not help matters if we put people in isolated conditions of social exclusion.
<P>
As part of the system, we have a key commitment not to disperse into isolated areas and to pay full regard to the community relations aspects of any move, so as to create clusters of asylum seekers and provide support for them. Recently, when Kosovans have come to this country, our policy has been to try to cluster them in certain areas and to provide elements of community support. We intend to do that by talking to local authorities about the ethnic minority groups that are in their areas and by trying to create circumstances in which support mechanisms are already in place. If these mechanisms are not there in sufficient capacity, there will be capacity-building exercises and funding to put people in the areas, with the help of the voluntary sector and community groups, and then provide elements of support.
<P>
I repeat my statement this morning that the Government hope that asylum seekers who are recognised as refugees and given refugee status will decide to remain in the cluster areas in which they are located. To encourage that, we shall try to ensure that they are provided with the support, community contact and other reassurances that they need. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) mentioned safety. I reiterate that we shall also consider that when we decide about the areas for clusters.
<P>
We shall not direct authorities to make available sub-standard accommodation on sink estates: that would be entirely counter productive, nor shall we require them to make over more desirable housing for short-stay accommodation for asylum seekers because that also would be a recipe for unnecessary community tension. In many parts of the country there exists something between the two extremes&#151;sound housing or other accommodation, which may be of various types. Some of it may be provided by social partners in the voluntary sector or through the housing association sector. It may be suitable for asylum seekers: we would like to be able to use it if it is.
<P>
I am sure that in most instances we can attempt to gain access to that housing by agreement. In all our discussions with the local government associations, they have shown a willingness to participate in the exercise. During the Kosovan experience of recent weeks my officials in the Home Office have been deluged with offers of accommodation for Kosovans from all over the country. I repeat my belief that the British people have a warm heart for the genuine refugee who is fleeing from persecution. That has been all too evident recently. Local authorities have responded very well to our request to let us know if they have accommodation available. The British people and the Government want to ensure that that accommodation is adequate and that it is of a certain standard. We want to ensure that it is suitable for asylum seekers. In most cases we will get access by agreement, but we need those residuary rights in case we have to get access in a different way.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is important to have a debate on dispersal as it is a significant part of the Bill. We are not opposed to a policy of dispersal but it must be sensitively managed. There are serious risks inherent in dispersal, especially if it is not properly thought through. We are also mindful of the evidence that the Committee has received from respected bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Housing about the possible ways in which dispersal might be carried out.
<P>
The driving force behind the policy appears to be the availability of accommodation. The Minister qualified that with the amendments today but it is worth bearing in mind the view of the CIH that it is questionable whether surplus or difficult to let housing is always suitable for asylum seekers. It carried out a survey of a number of local authorities and I shall quote two examples it gives which bear that out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Inverclyde Council's surplus housing is in areas which are: involved in wider regeneration initiatives, planned for demolition; or isolated and occupied by `fragile and fragmented communities'. Inverclyde believe that housing asylum seekers and refugees in such areas would simply exacerbate the problems faced by existing communities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The City and County of Swansea felt that it may not be appropriate to house asylum seekers in difficult to let properties. The areas where vacant housing is situated are already plagued by problems of social exclusion. The arrival of significant numbers of asylum seekers would simply make the situation worse. Also, although housing may be available in these areas, other services such as schools are under a lot of pressure. Significant numbers of extra children, possibly with special needs, would put a strain on schools which are already stretched.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister said that he did not want to add to the problems of social exclusion through the Government's policy and I hope that that will turn out to be the case. But he must recognise that there is a serious risk of that inherent in the policy and it needs to be very carefully managed. Thought has to be given to the problems that have been identified by the CIH. Although the Minister told us that he wants to approach this in a balanced way and that he wants to find properties that are not on sink estates but which may not be of the very best quality either&#151;he is pursuing a middle way, or a third way if I dare say that&#151;I am concerned about what it says in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 386 was intended to probe what was meant by suitable accommodation in these circumstances. All we are told in the Government amendment is that housing accommodation is suitable if it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) is unoccupied;
<P>
(b) would be likely to remain unoccupied for the foreseeable future if not made available; and
<P>
(c) is appropriate for the accommodation of persons supported under this Part or capable of being made so with minor work.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those are fairly bald provisions and they do not take it much further. A lot of thought needs to be put into this policy and great care must be exercised. It will not be determined just by the availability of property or by these broad provisions. We will not know whether this will be succesful until we see how it is carried through. There are grave risks involved and it will need to be managed with great care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The clause gives me some general concern although the rewording in the amendment is a slight improvement. In many ways, the clause anticipates a fight between London and the south east and the rest of the country. The Secretary of State clearly feels that he must have powers to force local authorities to take asylum seekers. The motivation for that may be a feeling that a big stick is needed to get agreement on a redistribution from London and the south east to other parts of the country.
<P>
I am glad that the Minister referred to the response of local authorities throughout the country in relation to the Kosovans. That response has been good, but has the downside of possibly complicating matters, certainly for the foreseeable future. God willing, a settlement will be reached in Kosovo. However, in many areas, some of the most appropriate accommodation is likely to be taken up for the period in which it remains unstable.
<P>
Therefore, when the provision comes into force&#151;even in the amended form proposed by the Minister&#151;local authorities will have a strong case for arguing that the accommodation that they would have otherwise have used is being used for the emergency provision.
<P>
In most areas, the amended version of the scheme will reflect the size of the local authority housing estate. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the provision applies only to local authority-owned housing. So whether an area is deemed to be suitable and to have the appropriate accommodation may simply reflect the extent of the local authority housing estate. Years of council house sell-offs mean that that extent varies widely from one authority to the next.
<P>
Other complicating factors need to be taken into account. Many local authorities are transferring housing to housing associations, undergoing large-scale voluntary transfers and entering tenant management schemes. There is a multiplicity of possible arrangements for the management of the council housing stock.
<P>
That will cause complications, as an area may seem to have suitable accommodation, but may have a strong case for saying that its housing is managed in a different way or is no longer under direct local authority control. Such local management arrangements permit people to dictate to their local authority housing areas who they take and when.
<P>
I turn to Government amendment No. 771. The hon. Member for Hertsmere has already raised concerns about proposed subsection (6), which deals with the condition that the accommodation ``is unoccupied'' and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be likely to remain unoccupied for the foreseable future if not made available''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That describes a sink estate. Housing stock that is unoccupied and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future is housing that no one else wants.
<P>
Reasonable housing will not come under the provision. We all have constituents who want local authority housing in the preferred areas, and there are huge waiting lists for such housing. People come to see us every week saying that they do not have enough points. Such as person might say: ``I have lost only one leg and have been told I must lose the other before I can get enough points to get into particular housing.''
<P>
People are desperate for housing. The only areas where that does not apply are those where no wants to live. I have already said that, should I wish to live in certain parts of Sheffield, I can go to the local authority housing office, where I will be given keys so that I can take up residence in four hours. However, I do not want to do that, and neither does any reasonable person. I regret to say that proposed subsections (6)(a) and (b) cover such properties, as opposed to the more attractive properties described by the Minister.
<P>
The burden on local authorities to sell off all their accommodation may also make the policy exceptionally difficult. Local authority accommodation may not be the only accommodation to come into place. For example, in my Sheffield constituency, a reception centre is opening at Folkwood school. That former residential school has been converted to take Kosovan refugees temporarily and would be an appropriate, salubrious place in a nice neighbourhood for the proposed scheme. However, the local authority wants capital receipts, so it is selling the school as soon as the Kosovans have gone; indeed, a sale is already under way.
<P>
Local authorities are under enormous pressure to sell accommodation. They have declining housing stocks, which are moving out of direct local authority control, and they are under huge pressure to sell off other properties and premises. All those factors might militate against their being able to offer anything other than the sink-estate accommodation that we and the Government do not want to use. Several practical problems must be resolved.
<P>
We have heard an interesting variety of ways to describe the housing into which asylum seekers will be put. The word ``suitable'' has been refined by the proposed subsection 6 (c) in amendment No. 771, which states that the accommodation will be ``appropriate'' for asylum seekers. Elsewhere the word ``adequate'' has been used. We have fenced around the definitions, but the Government run the risk of numerous challenges to the way in which they allocate housing. None of the definitions is particularly helpful to the people put in the accommodation.
<P>
The terms ``unoccupied'' and ``likely to remain unoccupied'' are fairly straightforward. However, amendment No. 771 uses the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is appropriate for the accommodation of persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That brings me back to all the other issues that I and the hon. Member for Hertsmere have raised about ``appropriate'', ``suitable'' and ``adequate'' accommodation. We are left without a definition of the word ``appropriate''; we heard only half a definition of the word ``adequate''; and the word ``suitable'' as used in other housing legislation has been rejected.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> This has been a good debate. I agree with much of what has been said. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the proposal should be implemented in a sensitive and careful way, and I agree with him entirely. If we are to make it work, we must ensure that the right accommodation is available and that the system that we use to identify clusters works well.
<P>
There are 80,000 units of unoccupied local authority housing in England alone. It is hard to believe that they are all on sink estates. However, we shall not just access local authority accommodation. Although the clause, as the hon. Member for Hallam rightly said, deals with the obligations on local authorities, we will look to contract for accommodation with local authorities, social providers, the private sector and agencies. We intend that our contracts with them will ensure that the accommodation is adequate, suitable and, in the wording of subsection (6)(c) of the amendment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is appropriate for the accommodation of persons supported under this Part''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to subsection (6)(a) and (b), but paragraph (c) will provide us with the ability to ensure that we meet the tests of suitability, adequacy or whatever definition is appropriate to the needs of asylum seekers.
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that we consider the accommodation that is available. Some parts of the private sector might tell us that good quality hostel accommodation is available for single young people, and all sorts of temporary provisions will need to be considered. However, our aim is to ensure that the accommodation is in cluster areas, that it is appropriate and that it will not cause problems of social exclusion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): Will one of the tests of appropriateness be the number of units available together? After a family have gone through an ordeal and when they face language problems in this country, an important factor is that, wherever the accommodation is located, they have the psychological support of other families who can speak the same language and who have been through a similar ordeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is getting a reputation as a strong liberal on these issues. No doubt, he will be joining the Liberal Democrats soon.
<P>
The aim is to consider what is appropriate for the circumstances of the asylum seekers making applications. A cluster area may have only a few homes, but it may be in an area where there are other people from that ethnic minority, so it might be quite suitable. However, if we want to move a large number of asylum seekers into an area, we shall want to ensure that the accommodation is close enough to others who can provide support, so that we can create a cluster area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It strikes me from what the Minister was saying about local authority accommodation that local authorities that do not have large housing stocks and are therefore not likely to have much suitable accommodation, although there may be housing association, private or other accommodation in the area, will avoid being designated reception zones.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is likely to be the case, because clearly they will not have local authority accommodation available. In those areas asylum seekers are more likely to be accommodated in the private sector. In a sense the objective is to share the burden. It is a national burden. Although we intend to honour our international commitments by complying with the provisions of the 1951 convention on the protection of refugees, it is not a burden that London and the south-east should predominantly have to bear. The hon. Member for Hallam will agree that Sheffield, my part of the west midlands and areas represented by other hon. Members would no doubt be appropriate places to share the burden. We want to ensure that we locate and support genuine refugees in those areas, so that they become integrated and successful members of our local communities, thus creating long-term benefits for this country. Where asylum seekers are not granted refugee status, we shall want to be able to intervene quickly and remove them, so that the problems that we discussed on earlier clauses do not arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley (Worthing, West):</B> The clause does not necessarily apply to Kosovan Albanians, who may be dealt with differently. However, given the change of control in some councils last week and the fact that some new council leaders will want to instruct their councils to co-operate with the Home Office in providing homes for refugees, it would be useful if the Minister could ensure that all local authorities with housing responsibilities were told who the contact person is, so that, if they wanted to offer help, they could make contact.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): The amendments relate to dispersal. As a London Member of Parliament I am happy that other parts of the country should help London meet the challenge of finding accommodation for asylum seekers. I refer to meeting the challenge rather than shouldering the burden, as it has a more positive connotation.
<P>
However, while in principle we may be in favour of the policy of dispersal, the Bill presents us with a policy of forced dispersal, which is slightly different. The only thing worse than sending people who do not want to go to areas that they do not want to go to is to send people who do not want to go to areas that they do not want to go to and that do not want to receive them. Therefore, there must be a question mark over the powers that the Minister is taking in the clause.
<P>
I am glad that amendment No. 771 helps to make the powers more acceptable. In particular, I am pleased that subsection (8)(d) will provide powers of inspection. I was very concerned about asylum seekers being sent to accommodation where there was no statutory right of inspection.
<P>
However, we are faced here with a policy of forced dispersal. I remind the Committee that history does not show that policies of forced dispersal of immigrants and asylum seekers have worked. For example, the east African Asians and the Vietnamese filtered back to areas where there were large numbers of people of the same ethnic and religious background.
<P>
The Minister assures us that his policy of dispersal and the model communities to which people will be sent will be so rosy and wonderful that the filtering back of every immigrant group that previous governments have tried to disperse will not happen in this case. That remains to be seen.
<P>
I was pleased that the Minister assured us that he wanted the policy of dispersal to be handled sensitively and carefully; he did not want people to be sent to sink estates or to encourage social exclusion. However, there is little in the Bill to ensure that such things will not happen. There are proposals in the Bill, especially the lack of specificity about standards and the emphasis on cost and cheap available housing, which suggest otherwise. The wishes that the Minister expressed are not reflected in the Bill. Some proposals are not in other housing legislation with which I am familiar; they will tend to encourage precisely what the Minister wants to prevent. I am glad that he takes the point that to force asylum seekers into social exclusion would be contrary to the Governments social and economic aims, and the government amendments will improve the clause a little.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) tried to say that we should ensure that all new council leaders are made aware of the contact person. I shall ask my officials to ensure that that is done where it is appropriate. We have so many offers at present from warm-hearted councillors and individuals who have contacted the Home Office that I suspect that we shall be able to keep going for some time without seeking more offers.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington is right to say that we are not in the business of creating social exclusion, which would be contrary to the Governments other policies. She calls it a policy of forced dispersal only in the sense that there is one offer of accommodation. I suspect that many asylum seekers will choose to remain in London and to take the support option without the accommodation provision. London authorities tell us that accommodation in London is severely overstretched; as my hon. Friend will be aware from her constitutency surgeries, there is severe pressure on council house waiting lists in London. There is a real need to address such concerns in London so that the long-term task of ensuring that those who are already there, and those who choose to stay there on the proposed support system, are successfully integrated into the community. I hope that their contribution and that of many refugees to this country will be accepted and appreciated.
<P>
I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington that we shall will both the principle and the means to disperse people and to create the circumstances in which local authorities are encouraged to co-operate. The proposal wills the means to do so. I suspect that we shall not have to use the provisions but if they did not exist some authorities who were considering whether to co-operate voluntarily might decide to do so later rather than sooner. Giving local authorities a little encouragement may be helpful. We hope that we do not have to use the provisions, but they are in the Bill just in case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I was pleased to hear that the Minister hopes that the provisions will never have to be used. I have already said that I am generally unhappy about the clause, which has the potential for a genuine community relations disaster. Local authorities that are unwilling to accept asylum seekers will, under the clause, be required to do so by order of the Secretary of State. That could result in difficult community relations.
<P>
An unco-operative local authority&#151;as opposed to the happy, smiling local authority that has been more common lately&#151;might let its local residents know that it did not want to take asylum seekers, but was forced to do so by the Secretary of State. I hope that that never happens, but if it did it would be serious. Local authorities in my area are trying to work as a consortium to ensure that they co-operate with the directorate as and when the provision comes into force. As I said, I hope that the potential nightmare situation never arises, but we need to be aware that it could.
<P>
Under Government amendment No. 771, regulations will be made about the calculation of rent or other charges payable for the accommodation. If somewhere has been designated a reception zone, the local authority's reimbursement will be governed by regulation. That is helpful, as the Minister said, but does he intend to do the same for local authority accommodation that has not been designated as a reception zone?
<P>
It would be helpful for regulations to govern the Asylum Support Directorate's use of local authority accommodation more generally. Local authorities could then be clear, when the Asylum Support Directorate asked for accommodation, that they were receiving a consistent deal that had been approved by Parliament. When local authorities have reached a common agreement on rent and other matters, similar regulations should apply to reception zones and non-reception zones alike.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> If the power in the clause were ever used, it would not be used in the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, as that would be counter-productive. It might be contemplated not when an authority is reluctant to accept an asylum-seeker, but when it believes that there is some unreasonableness or it has some disagreement about the terms of the contract. That would not lead to a community relations problem: if it did, we would have serious doubts about putting asylum seekers in such a position. In circumstances where an authority believed that the contract had made an unreasonable request, the clause would provide us with the requisite bargaining power. The hon. Gentleman has no need to fear the circumstances that he described.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also asked whether the terms of non-designated authorities would be set out in regulations. We anticipate setting out a standard form of contract, which could be negotiated in the light of the particular circumstances of a local authority. Negotiations could take into account variations in costing or other relevant matters.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Eighth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We have already skirted around the issue of the ability to appeal against a decision made by the Secretary of State. Asylum support adjudicators will be important, because they will be required to interpret words such as ``suitable'' and ``adequate'' and they will define living needs. They will make the case law based on the regulations that will be introduced later.
<P>
What type of people will the adjudicators be? The schedule gives a broad description of them, but will the Minister tell us where he expects to find the adjudicators and how many there are likely to be? He said that he would appoint as many as he considers necessary, but has he a working assumption of numbers and the qualifications that they will need?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I can reply in broad terms. We envisage that the adjudicators will be appointed by the Home Secretary, although, once appointed, they will carry out their functions independently according to the provisions of the Bill. The adjudication function is probably best carried out as a part-time activity by people whose other roles can inform and enrich their expertise in dealing with such cases.
<P>
We shall certainly be looking for people with, perhaps, legal experience or of dealing with social security issues in an appeal context. At this stage, I do not want to make any legal qualification mandatory, but it would be helpful. We estimate that there are about 2,000 appeals per annum, so the numbers involved may not need to be large. Adjudicators will be part time and they will have to be able to hear appeals in different parts of the country.
<P>
I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman some broad guidance. Ajudicators will be from a broad cross section of people and from backgrounds that I have described. Perhaps they will be from ethnic minorities and have dealt with appeals in social security or in education. We do not want people without the relevant background who simply decide that they want to be adjudicators. We shall look for people with appropriate qualifications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Immigration Law Practitioners Association has again expressed concern that the schedule is yet another provision by which the Secretary of State may be a party to the proceedings while appointing the person who presides over the tribunal hearing the issue in question. It wonders whether that is appropriate.
<P>
The Minister will say that it is all above board and that my point is irrelevant. However, how it appears to people subject to the system needs to be borne in mind. The appointment of the adjudicator is not the only issue, because paragraph 2 states that he will be eligible for reappointment when his term of office ends. Is it healthy to have one of the parties to the proceedings, being responsible for the reappointment of an adjudicator? What will happen if an adjudicator gets a reputation for being particulary generous and for allowing many appeals?
<P>
Appearances matter, and I cannot see what harm there would be in making the Lord Chancellor, rather than the Secretary of State, responsible for the appointments. It would take the Secretary of State one step away from these matters and that would look much better.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> the responsibility for appointing the adjudicators lies with the Secretary of State. Although he will appoint them, they will exercise their functions independently by virtue of the Bill when enacted. They will not be open to influence from the Secretary of State any more than people on other bodies are likely to be open to influence because they were appointed by the Secretary of State. My right hon. Friend appoints a great many people to organisations which deal with the Home Office including the Police Complaints Authority. My right hon. Friend is the police authority for the Metropolitan area, at present, anyway.
<P>
There are all kinds of circumstances in which our constitution allows appointments to be made by the Secretary of State, but there is no history of people so appointed deciding suddenly that they must do improperly the Secretary of State's will nor of Secretaries of State intervening in individual decisions. There need be no concern on that point. The Lord Chancellor is of the same opinion: he does not need to appoint adjudicators. Adjudicators will not, after all, be required to make decisions about asylum claims; they will explicitly not deal with questions such as whether someone has a right to be in this country or a right to remain, or to inquire how they arrived. They will handle the one simple issue: whether a person is entitled to the support being provided. That will be subject to definition, and holders of the appointments will have to justify their decisions When appointed, they will form their own independent body that will exercise authority separate from Home Office influence. They will make thier own decisions and put them into effect.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 834, in page 50, line 27, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) If the Secretary of State provides or offers to provide support which the applicant contends is not adequate or suitable for his needs and/or the needs of his dependants if any, the applicant may appeal to an adjudicator.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment offers the Government a quality control mechanism for the support offered under the Secretary of State's scheme in clause 74. In earlier debates about the scheme generally there was much discussion about what would constitute an appropriate amount of support. The Minister told us that he had clear ideas about what would be appropriate, and might come forward in regulations, but that he did not want to put them in the Bill. The amendment would allow a claimant who has been offered the opportunity to go to adjudicators to question whether the support package offered to him is appropriate. The adjudicators would hear not only from people who had been refused support altogether&#151;at which time they would test issues such as the criteria for defining destitution&#151;but would potentially hear appeals from people offered accommodation that they considered totally unsuitable on the sort of grounds that we discussed earlier. The amendment would be an important safeguard. We believe that adjudicators could have a valuable role. The Secretary of State will, of course, have gone to the trouble and expense of setting the adjudication system. Nevertheless, adjudicators could play a useful role in addition to simply considering refusals. The system would gain extra credibility if people had a right to take the extra test of the quality of a package offered to them. From the Government's viewpoint, it would potentially avoid other courts deciding on some of the issues.
<P>
We raised valid concerns that various aspects of a support package could, for example, be said to breach the article in the European convention on human rights relating to family life if a person was put into a wrong or inappropriate place. We think that there could be judicial reviews on decisions about support packages. We have been presented with a host of other complicating factors about which a judgment would have to be made, including, for example, how racial hostility in an area could be defined, whether hostility was sufficiently strong to make the accommodation unsuitable, and how one defined such terms as ``adequate'' and ``suitability'' and so on in relation to overcrowding. We have had a considerable amount of debate on all those points but have not reached conclusions. The amendment would be a sensible means by which to set up a system, if one goes ahead, in which adjudicators would effectively build up case law in deciding degrees of adequacy and suitability&#151;I have given the Minister the choice of either term&#151;and a good way of giving individuals greater confidence in the system. It would also allow the Secretary of State to administer a system that was not constantly being challenged by other legal means.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman has put this forward. On the face of it, it appears reasonable, but in practice we estimate that it would result in a tenfold increase in the number of appeals. Rather than 2,000 per annum, we would probably have 20,000. It would clog up the system and cause considerable delays. The point he raises, however, is valid in many ways. The appropriate way to deal with this is not so much to create an appeal mechanism but to establish a formal internal mechanism of review and advice for asylum seekers. If there is something wrong with a decision and allocation of accommodation they can go back to the ASD and ask for a review.
<P>
That system of internal review will not be an appeal, but if there are genuine reasons why the allocation of accommodation is inappropriate and the circumstances of the individual have not been taken properly into account, bearing in mind our discussion about preferences and circumstances, those issues might well be looked at. The aim would be to create the sort of circumstances in which people would want to stay in that area on the long term. There is therefore some incentive in ensuring that the system of internal review would work.
<P>
I am not convinced by the hon. Gentleman's amendment because it would be a recipe for spurious and vexatious appeals that would drag out the whole appeals system and create problems. The hon. Gentleman describes judicial review as an alternative option. I suspect that in the first instance we will have a number of judicial reviews that will establish some of the detail of the way this will work, once we have the regulations in place.
<P>
Judicial review can perform an important function in the asylum system. One of the reasons why we did not go for the difficult option of abolishing the ability to go to judicial review in some cases is that it performs a useful function of clarifying what the law means and defining the obligations of the state and others. Having a small number of judicial reviews which do that is beneficial but having a large number of unnecessary, vexatious and useless judicial reviews as we have had in the asylum system simply creates delay, expense and is counter productive. We have the balance right. The hon. Gentleman's point is a good one, but I hope that we can deal with it by way of a formal internal mechanism rather than a system of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am glad that I tabled the amendment as it has teased out an important detail about the way the system will work within the ASD. It is useful to know that there will be a formal internal process whereby the individual can raise the issues that the Opposition have raised such as the suitability of accommodation and have them looked at seriously. I hope that that will include written reasons why the review comments have not been accepted.
<P>
I also understand the Minister's proviso that it must not be framed in a preferential way. The individual must not say, ``I want to live in Bedford'', but will have to say, ``My family are in Bedford. My accommodation is not in Bedford.'' That will be considered as circumstances. As long as the wording is right and we set up a set of circumstances which can be considered objectively rather than talking about wanting, wishing and any of that nasty preferential stuff the review may work. That is important. I will not seek to press the amendment as the internal review could be a useful process. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

	(2) The Secretary of State shall ensure that support arrangements are also made for the dependants of those who appeal under section 84.'.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This brings us back to an issue that we visited earlier. We welcome the appeals system introduced in the clause; it is useful to see it there. New clause 23 returns to the issue that, if the appeals system is to be effective, the individual must be supported while it is taking place. Our earlier stabs at it have sought to amend clauses relating to the temporary support that can be provided. the new clause attempts to build in a duty on the Secretary of State to provide support. We are perhaps being a little bold, as we are talking about the Secretary of State's duty rather than a discretion, as in the rest of the support system.
<P>
I hope that, in response, the Minister will be able to give us similar assurances to those that he gave us earlier&#151;I know that he was referring to marginal cases&#151;and say that there is no intention to make those who are going to appeal utterly destitute if that can be avoided and that he recognises that those going to appeal may need support in that critical period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have dealt with the issue of those going to appeal, but the amendment refers to an appeal before the wrong adjudicator: special adjudicators hear substantive asylum appeals and will not hear appeals against a decision to refuse or withdraw support under the Secretary of State's scheme. However, it is not for that reason alone that I cannot accept the new clause.
<P>
The new clause requires the Secretary of State to continue to provide support pending the determination of an appeal against a decision not to support an asylum seeker. To reach that position, the asylum seeker would have to have made an application for support, saying that he would otherwise be destitute. The Asylum Support Directorate, having considered the application, would have concluded that he could provide for himself or at least would have access to support. In those circumstances it would have had to reject the application.
<P>
As I have said to the hon. Member for Hallam, we shall look at the issues raised. There may be marginal cases in which we consider giving support, but we do not propose to provide broad-based support. One way to do it may be to provide an element of grant or support to a charity or voluntary organisation to assist people in marginal cases, but we do not need to create a new mechanism whereby we provide resources for those who decide to enter into appeals. People who were rightly refused might then decide that they wanted to access that means of support for some time. Therefore, the question of quality control on the level of support for those having appeals must be thought through carefully. I am not closing my mind to the issue, as I have said, but it will need to be with sufficient care to prevent abuse.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Hallam will not disagree with that approach and I hope that, as we have given him a slightly positive response, he will not press the new clause to a vote. Otherwise, I ask the Committee to support the clause as part of the broad provisions that we are setting up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall not seek a vote on new clause 23.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman would not get a vote on new clause 23 at this point anyway. It was a new clause, not an amendment and the Question will not be put at this point.

Question accordingly agreed to.

<H4><center>False representations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 403, in page 51, line 24, at beginning insert `knowingly'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 404, in page 51, line 24, after `a', insert `material'.
<P>
No. 405, in page 51, leave out lines 27 to 30.
<P>
No. 406, in clause 87, page 51, line 42, after `a', insert `material'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Briefly, this is a clause that we support and I shall not speak to amendment No. 406. I say that it is a clause that we support, but I wonder whether the offence that it creates of making false representations to obtain benefit is not a duplication of the criminal law. In a bad case&#151;not in every case&#151;it may be appropriate to prosecute somebody under criminal law rather than under these provisions, which carry a maximum sentence of only three months' imprisonment. The offence of obtaining support by making false representations can arise in the ways listed in paragraphs (a) to (d). The clause may require the addition of the word ``or'' at the end of subsection (1)(c), although I may be wrong about that.
<P>
The amendments are concerned with paragraph (c), which states that a person will commit an offence if he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``fails, without reasonable excuse, to notify a change of circumstances when required to do so in accordance with any provision made under this Part''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may be casting the net a little wide. ILPA certainly has strong views on paragraph (c). There is no requirement for the offender to have knowledge; paragraph (c) does not refer to someone who knowingly fails. However,``knowingly'' is used in other paragraphs, which assume that some knowledge is required.
<P>
How far does the failure to notify a change of circumstances go? The word ``material'' is not used, so there is no reference to circumstances which would make a difference. Any change of circumstances would bring someone within the ambit of the offence.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify those matters and deal with the concerns that have been expressed?

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Along with my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham, I added my name to the amendments. That is because I share many of the concerns of the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere has already asked why existing laws on fraudulent and deceptive claims are not deemed suitable to be applied in circumstances covered by the provision. Why are we creating a new offence rather than use provisions in the existing legal code? We are creating a separate legal framework for people in the category covered by the clause, rather than use the normal provisions that apply to anyone who perpetrates fraud against a Government agency or who seeks to defraud the Government of money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I back my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere in his support for clause 86 and for the way in which he spoke up for his amendment.
<P>
Housing benefit law contained a clear gap, enabling landlords to continue receiving money for tenants whom they knew to have left. The Government are rightly tackling such matters in clause 86 and other clauses, and that attempt deserves full support.
<P>
My hon. Friend made a technical point about the omission of the word ``or'' at the end of subsection (1)(c). That word is included at the end of clause 87(1)(c), so its omission from clause 86(1)(c) may be regarded as a typographical slip. That slip could be corrected without an amendment being tabled. However, if such an amendment were required, I would be happy to move a manuscript amendment for the convenience of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not prepared to accept a manuscript amendment. Howver, if the hon. Gentleman is so inclined, he can table an amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Worthing, West for his suggested manuscript amendment. I will exaime the clause to see whether it is necessary to insert the word ``or''.
<P>
We must tackle robustly attempts to defraud the Government, and we hope that clause 86 will enable us to do that. The offences listed in clause 86 are modelled on social security provisions in the Social Security Administration Act 1992.
<P>
Amendment No. 403 would require the prosecution to show that the person concerned knew that a change of circumstances had to be notified before that person could be convicted. However, we believe that supported people should ensure that they keep the Secretary of State informed.
<P>
We are dealing with people who are making claims for asylum and support, and who therefore ought to keep the Secretary of State informed of their whereabouts. That is a fairly straightforward requirement. The amendment, however, proposes to tackle the problem by providing something in writing. Sometimes people say, ``Well, we didn't read the Act,'' or ``We couldn't read it because it wasn't written in a dialect or language that we understand, so we weren't informed.'' What should be notified is straightforward: anyone in such circumstances should keep in contact with the Secretary of State. The amendment is therefore not desirable. Ample information will be provided; it is only failure to notify without reasonable excuse that is an offence.
<P>
Amendment No. 404 would mean that only a failure to notify a material change in circumstances would be an offence. There is no reason for such a change because it is inconceivable that immaterial chages in circumstances could be an offence. If we are talking about a criminal provision, the person would have to have obtained a benefit and, in order to do so, have made a material statement. It is inconceivable that changes in circumstances that were not material would have to be notified. On that basis, I hope that the amendment will not be pressed.
<P>
Amendment No. 405 would remove a category of offence that has been framed to protect the asylum support scheme from wrongful claims. It is essential when an asylum seeker is being given support under the proposed scheme that changes of circumstances are notified to the Secretary of State. Subsection (1)(d), which the amendment would expunge, covers circumstances in which an asylum seeker has not notified a change of circumstances because he was advised that he need not do so. It places a burden on those who advise asylum seekers to be full, frank and forthright. The clause as drafted does not endanger those who are foolish; the offence is knowingly to cause an asylum seeker to withhold information. Subsection (1)(c) affords the asylum seeker the offence of reasonable excuse, which might protect him if he followed what is, apparently, bona fide advice. The paragraph catches the unscrupulous or incompetent adviser, but primarily the unscrupulous adviser, whose advice not to disclose a matter was given knowing that it must be disclosed and that it is necessary. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is not pressing the amendment&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> In his consideration of the ``or'' issue, would the Minister also give some thought to whether the word ``obtaining'' is sufficient, or whether, in the first line of the clause after ``obtaining'', the words ``accepting or receiving'' should be added? A person may have used someone else's application and received money or received money to provide services to someone else.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is an interesting point and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising it. He may be right; I shall look into the matter. What he proposes would broaden the scope of the offence to include people who are not directly obtaining the provision but who are receiving it in a way that complies with the offence. Before making a commitment, I want to consider whether it is right to broaden the clause in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. I am grateful to him for his suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 408, in page 52, line 13, after `a', insert `material'.
<P>
No. 409, in page 52, line 13, after `any', insert `material'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say that I am not moving amendments Nos. 408 to 410.
<P>
Amendment No. 407 covers similar ground. Clause 88 deals with someone who commits an offence by obstructing a person&#151;obviously an official&#151;exercising functions under the Act. The purpose of the amendment is to probe the meaning of ``neglect'' in subsection (1)(b), which specifies that someone is guilty of an offence when he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``refuses or neglects to answer a question, give any information or produce a document when required to do so''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
ILPA is also interested to know what ``neglect'' means in that context.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is an important amendment. We should remember that the clause refers to delay or obstruction; deception or dishonest representation has already been dealt with in clause 87. Someone who had neglected to fill in answers to questions could be alleged, if it were done deliberately, to have committed deception and I assume that such a person would be caught by clause 87.
<P>
Delay or obstruction is quite different from failing to fill in a form. If someone sends off a form for income support without having answered all the questions&#151;not deliberately or dishonestly, but because they forgot or misunderstood the form&#151;we do not threaten them with punishment, but send the form back to be completed. That can cause delay, but it is understandable.
<P>
I understand why the Government want to act against someone who deliberately refuses to fill in the form appropriately, but I do not understand why we cannot be more patient with someone who has simply failed to respond properly to a question. If it has not been done dishonestly&#151;and so is not covered by other provisions&#151;why do we need to take action, under clause 88, soley for neglect? I know about the ``without reasonable excuse'' provision, but I fail to understand the need to test neglect, when there is no suggestion of dishonesty, against there being a reasonable excuse. It would be more effective if subsection (1)(b) dealt only with refusing to answer a question and did not bring in the concept of neglect at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Someone who has won a large amount of money on the lottery may decide not to inform anyone of the fact. This provision covers those who fail to answer knowing that they should, but who do not refuse to provide the information. A particular item of information may not have been requested, but it is material information relating to a change of circumstances. Information that needs to be supplied may be put away somewhere, perhaps with the vague intention of getting round to doing some day. Knowing its importance and knowing that it should be provided, a person might deliberately choose to get round to sending information when it is convenient for them rather than when it is necessary to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I hope that the Minister will clarify for the record that the person who won the lottery would be prosecuted, either under clause 87(1)(c) or clause 86(1)(c), for failing to notify a change of circumstances without reasonable excuse when required to do so. If there is a breach of conditions that state, ``If you win the lottery, you must come back and tell us'', we do not require prosecution for deliberate neglect, which is a strange concept.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> When a person is required to give information or produce a document and is obviously able to do so, neglect to do so is an important consideration. They may decide not to do something without saying that they have no future intention of doing it. They might say, ``I was going to get round to it in a month's time'' although the information was needed there and then. That is the type of circumstance to which the clause applies. It covers those who do not actually refuse, but fail to answer knowing that they should. I hope that that clarifies the position. No one will be prosecuted if he has genuinely not properly understood and has acted for straightforward reasons that he can explain. There would be no public interest in dealing with such an offence through prosecution.
<P>
The model for the offence works appropriately as far as I know in section 111 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The clause follows the wording of that provision, including the reference to the word ``neglect'', which has not produced the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman suggested. A decision would have to be made about whether a person came within the provision in the sense that there might be a public interest in implementing it. It worked quite adequately and without much controversy in the social security provisions and I suspect that it will do the same in this one.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> For those of us who are not aficionados of section 111 of the Social Security Administration Act, the debate has been useful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 88 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 89</center></H4>
<H4><center>Failure of sponsor to maintain</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have to put on record my unhappiness about clause 89. I know that this is becoming somewhat repetitive. The numbers change, but the general attitude remains similarly sceptical.
<P>
The clause brings in a provision to take action against a person who has failed to maintain someone for whom they acted as a sponsor. It is effectively a criminal action and in extreme cases a person can be imprisoned for such an offence. As I understand it, the clause introduces a new concept to immigration law, with action being taken against a sponsor. In a sense, the provision goes far beyond that applying to financial bonds, which at one level allow someone voluntarily to say, ``I am prepared financially to stake some money.'' At the other extreme, this provision says that an individual who has given his support can be prosecuted in the courts and have money taken from him by way of a fine, or he can be imprisoned. That seems out of proportion to the offence committed.
<P>
The offence that an individual sponsor has committed will have been to say, probably for humane reasons, that he would look after a friend, a relative or an associate who came to this country. He may have failed to do that in a reprehensible way that deserves to be condemned, but it seems to me that in such circumstances it would be appropriate to take civil action to try to recoup the state's expenses rather than threaten the person with a criminal sanction. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate wants sponsorship to support people who apply to come here and thus protect the taxpayer, and we all agree with that. If someone who has effectively made a financial contract with the immigration service has broken that contract, the appropriate measure to take would be to seek recovery via a civil mechanism to try to extract from the sponsor the additional cost caused to the taxpayer. It would be dangerous, it seems to me, to contemplate criminal action which threatened imprisonment. That is a wholly different matter which is disproportionate to the offence. I hope that the Minister will not suggest that I condone sponsors acting in that way because I do not. I would expect people who act as sponsors to act responsibly, but I am uneasy about bringing in a criminal penalty to be used against someone in such circumstances, and I want to register my unease.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh </B>(Bradford, West): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that sponsors may be totally genuine in sponsoring an applicant to visit or stay with them, but their circumstances may change? They may lose their job, their house may be repossessed, they may have an accident, and such circumstances are not covered by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. We come back to the word ``neglect''. Somebody can be deemed under subsection (1)(a) to be persistently refusing to maintain a person. That is one thing. That is back to the ``can't pay, won't pay'' argument. Persistent refusal could be a ``won't pay'' individual, who simply refuses to honour the contract to which he has agreed, but in a case of persistent neglect, the neglect could be the result of the change of circumstance described by the hon. Gentleman. There could also be a ``can't pay'' individual, who undertook the contract honourably, but has subsequently had to break it because of circumstances largely beyond his control. As I read the clause, that could come under the provision in subsection (1)(a), that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he persistently . . . neglects to maintain that person in accordance with the undertaking''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, perhaps we are being overly burdensome on the individual. While quite properly trying to defend the taxpayers' interests, we may be creating a situation in which the sponsoring act carries too severe penalties for the possible offence caused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): I was a little reluctant to speak in the Committee today, having been described in The Observer last Sunday as a prominent new Labour loyalist. I did not want to lose that label too quickly. However, there are a couple of points on the clause that concern me.
<P>
Under clause 94 there are provisions for recovery of expenditure, whereby money spent on support can be recovered from the sponsor. I found that phraseology in this clause odd. Subsection (3) provides a get-out. A sponsor might not be pursued if he failed to maintain another person as a result of something done in furtherance of a trade dispute. I thought it rather odd that that one issue should be highlighted. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) said, a sponsor could sign the form in good faith with every intention of fulfilling the sponsorship, and then lose his job&#151;something beyond his control. My hon. Friend the Minister may tell us that the word ``neglect'' would cover that situation. If so, it would be useful to have it on record, so that we are all clear what the clause will mean in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not know whether this will assist the hon. Gentleman or hinder him in his attempt to be described as a new Labour loyalist, but the same thought about trade disputes crossed my mind when I read the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I do not think that I need any assistance in my attempts to fulfil what The Observer said. It is probably a story planted by the Minister's office.
<P>
As I said, it seems peculiar that that one issue has been picked out. The Minister may tell us that the word ``neglect'' covers a situation in which somebody, because of circumstances completely outside his control, cannot fulfil his sponsorship. If a person enters into sponsorship and then, knowingly and deliberately, refuses to keep his commitment, there must be a sanction against him, but we must be assured that the clause will not be used against people who, through no fault of their own, end up in difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Knowing the background, the speeches and the politics of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), I sympathise with the description of him in The Observer. I have sometimes been subjected to similarly derogatory invective by that venerable institution.
<P>
I suspect that the background to the clause is known to many hon. Members. Indeed, an irate hon. Member approached me in the Lobby last Thursday. Some constituents had gone to his surgery the previous weekend&#151;I shall not say who the hon. Member is, because his constituents will not thank me&#151;and had told him that they had taken in an elderly relative, and had given undertakings to act as a sponsor and not allow him to fall on the state. They had now decided to send their children to private school and they did not want, and could not afford, in those circumstances to fund the person any more. Therefore, they wished to transfer the responsibility to the state. That hon. Member was concerned, as I was, about those circumstances.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, it is not our intention to catch people who might become ill, or be unable to support the person for a genuine reason. This is a criminal offence, so it requires an intention&#151;a mens rea. There must be an intention persistently to refuse or neglect to do something. If a person is unable to do something for good reason, he is not negligent. If a person intends to do something or could have done something and fails to do it, he may come within the provisions of the clause.
<P>
I hope that I can assure hon. Members who are concerned about this issue that those who have a good excuse for not fulfilling the requirements of sponsorship would be able to explain the circumstances and would not then be subject to prosecution. However, we want to ensure that, if some funding can be provided, we can pursue the matter by civil remedy. Therefore, the option of a civil remedy exists. There is also the option of a criminal penalty for the most serious cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> I accept the assurances of my hon. Friend the Minister. As some of these provisions are being introduced into immigration control for the first time, would it be helpful if there were a standard sponsorship form which had clearly written down in it what the person was liable for, so nobody could say in ignorance ``I got a sponsorship form from the local community relations council and it didn't say anything like that''? I can see that problem arising. Would it be helpful to have a sponsorship form with that wording in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is a very good suggestion. I shall look into it and write to my hon. Friend. That may well be a way to ensure that the obligations on people are spelt out clearly when they become sponsors.
<P>
I described the occasion when the hon. Member spoke to me the other day. There are many circumstances in which people change their mind. For example, they may have an argument with the person they have sponsored. However, we must ensure that the taxpayer does not take on burdens that others have undertaken.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will feel able to support the clause, with the assurances that I have given.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The clause gives the Secretary of State power to pay grants to local authorities. Amendment No. 413 follows a suggestion from the Immigration Law Practitioners Association that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``specific provision for asylum-seeking and refugee children in schools would be welcome.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Save the Children has also expressed interest in the amendment. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``our experience of working with asylum children is that the chance to study is one of the most important aids to self-esteem, a sense of purpose and eventual self-reliance. Such children often see study as an important step toward repaying the help they have been given.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would welcome the Minister's constructive response to those sentiments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 835, which covers the important subject of services and support to unaccompanied asylum-seeking childern.
<P>
Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are one of the most vulnerable groups with which we have to deal. That fact is generally recognised, although sometimes there are disputes about who is, or is not, a child. Significant numbers of vulnerable children have come into this country, and many of them have suffered traumatic experiences that must have an impact on 12, 13, 14, or 15-year-old children.
<P>
The part VI support mechanism will leave unaccompanied asylum-seeking children without its provisions and still within the care of local authorities. My amendment would ensure that local authorities would be able to receive full reimbursement for any costs that they incurred. I am aware that under the current hotchpotch system, which the Minister rightly condemned, specific grants have been given to local authorities to try to cover their expenditure on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. In the past year, those grants have attempted to meet the full costs incurred.
<P>
It would be helpful to make that commitment explicit in the Bill. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have particular costs associated with them. They clearly have special needs in respect of social services, and one of the most unfortunate consequences of the failure of the 1996 Act was that it left social services budgets for children under enormous strain. We hope that we shall not see a repeat of that under this Government, and that they will be prepared to make a full commitment to meeting the costs.
<P>
The provisions of the Children Act 1989 are significant in that they place legal responsibilities upon local authorities. The Childrens Society has drawn my attention to the fact that the 1989 Act presumes the appointment of a guardian ad litem for individual children. I assume that asylum-seeking children, who may face removal from the United Kingdom, fall within that category.
<P>
Local authorities will incur significant legal expenditure in respect of the duties that they properly owe to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children under the 1989 Act. They may also want extra support to facilitate the claims of those children. They are frequently placed in local authority care and many of the issues that are resolved for other asylum seekers are left unresolved for children. There is not necessarily the same urgency because the issues of financial support, access to benefits and access to work do not apply to children. We want the status of such children to be resolved as quickly as possible, so that their long-term status is sorted out and they are not left to be minded in local authority care.
<P>
I hope that the Government will join us in wishing to see the status of such children regularised swiftly and that they recognise that that might incur significant local authority expenditure. The issues of access to legal services and of travel to interviews will apply to such children.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will make the Government's intentions on funding clear and that his reply will show that they recognise the peculiar vulnerability of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 413 would make explicit what the clause already provides for. The clause makes it clear that the Secretary of State may pay such sums as he considers appropriate in respect of expenditure incurred by a local authority in connection, inter alia, with the education of dependants of asylum seekers.
<P>
The general power extends to the sort of expenditure to which the amendment refers. But there are other powers too and other funding routes such as the DFEE ethnic minority achievement grant. We are going to have further discussions with the DFEE about how we improve the circumstances in which asylum-seeking children are integrated into schools in our communities. Those discussions will be on-going. I suspect that they will not have any particular implications for the Bill.
<P>
One thing that came out of my meeting yesterday with some of the children's charities and organisations was the need to make sure that within our state school system we provide adequate and proper support for the asylum-seeker children, particularly on language issues. We will be discussing with our colleagues in other Departments how that might be carried forward. I do not want to prejudge it now by inserting new provisions in the Bill. We all share concerns about this issue. Many hon. Ministers will have in their constituencies circumstances that cause them concern. It is a matter that we need to deal with through the appropriate education authorities rather than through the Home Office.
<P>
Shortly after coming into office we transferred some of the funding on education under section 11 to the DFEE. It was certainly my strong view that that was where it ought to be. Much of that provisions was being dealt with in the schools and it was better that the DFEE ensured that the provisions was maintained rather than having disparate Departments dealing with financial provisions. We retained some of the section 11 grants for other purposes to do with race equality.
<P>
Amendment No. 835 seeks to establish a new funding route for the support of local authority duties towards unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Again, this is not the right Bill and the Home Office is not the right Department. The Department of Health currently has responsibility, and that ought to continue. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are the responsibility of local authority social services departments in the same way as they are responsible for any children in need.
<P>
In recognition of the burden that falls on some local authorities, the Department of Health has introduced a special grant to help contribute to the cost of caring for unaccompanied children. Because of the significant increase in the number of such children last year and the additional pressures that they are creating for many local authorities, the Department of Health made some generous grant arrangements in 1998-99. It reimbursed local authorities on the basis of &#163;400 a week for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who are under 16 and &#163;200 a week for 16 and 17-year-olds. The Department of Health is continuing to keep under careful review the funding position of local authorities and the amount that it gives to ensure that the provision is adequate and that it maintains the safeguards that we all want to see for unaccompanied children.
<P>
This is not the appropriate amendment and neither is the Home Office the appropriate Department to be given this responsibility. Just as I took the view that the Home Office, which previously had responsibility for the education part of the section 11 funding, was not the appropriate Department, we are not the appropriate Department to take on this responsibility. It should be held by Government, but in another Department. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
These are issues about which I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns. We need to ensure that we get this right. We do not propose to have unaccompanied children as part of the dispersal system that we are creating in the Bill, although he will be aware that the Department of Health has its own way of dealing with unaccompanied children who come into this country and of ensuring that the burden is shared. However, it is not intended that these provisions should apply to unaccompanied children.
<P>
My final point concerns the general local government finance issues. The standard spending assessment largely follows population. Therefore, as more asylum seekers come to an area, boosting the population, resources under the annual Government financial settlement will increase, albeit with a time lag, as we are all too well aware. However, resources will catch up with the dispersal.
<P>
On that basis, I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Having listened to the Minister's response, a couple of questions have occurred to me. Having been a member of the Committee that debated the delegated legislation dealing with Department of Health funding, I can confirm that the Minister's figures are correct, except in relation to Scotland, which has a lower figure for juniors than England.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that the education provision may be a crunch issue in the dispersal system? The Minister said that the Government are looking for local authorities with an established ethnic-minority population. However, the chances are that many authorities accepting asylum seekers will have lower ethnic minority and English-as-a-second-language populations than London.
<P>
One of the most expensive tasks for local authorities is setting up school facilities for English as a second language. That may cause a high level of concern at a time when many authorities feel pushed on school budgets.
<P>
Does the Minister recognise that the money required to support children in schools is a crunch area of expenditure that may grow exponentially as people are dispersed out of London? What is the Government's policy direction on short-stay children? The Government's stated aim is to clear people in six months. If people are to be here for that period, to what extent are children to be kept out of education or educated separately? If the Government assume that a number of them will be leaving in six months, will they have to go into mainstream schooling?
<P>
Do the Government have a policy view on the stage at which children arriving as a result of the crisis in Kosovo will be required to go to school? The Government are working on the assumption of a temporary arrangement and are hoping to repatriate the Kosovan children very soon.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am anxious about the matters raised by the hon. Gentleman, especially the last one, which I have discussed with various local authorities. Those authorities are concerned about children placed in mainstream schools who are often traumatised and have little English or understanding of the local community.
<P>
It can be difficult for schools to deal with such children. Matters become especially difficult when they are not granted refugee status&#151;perhaps because they do not come under the convention or because there are no compassionate circumstances&#151;necessitating their removal.
<P>
That causes problems for the children themselves who, in many cases, are the innocent victims of the behaviour of adults in the family or others, and for other children in the class. Dealing with such matters can be complex and difficult for local schools and education authorities. Our current policy is that asylum-seeker children are best dealt with in mainstream schools. However, we are examining whether we can set up a system of language support in schools which goes beyond the current system.
<P>
We need to discuss with other Departments how best to develop the schooling of children who may need special support until they have learned English and acclimatised to the circumstances in which they go to school.
<P>
The Kosovans will go to school, but the immediate need is to ensure that they are accommodated and able to adjust. In due course, and if necessary, we shall provide temporary longer-term accommodation for a year or so and we shall have to consider schooling. Given that most of the children are in reception centres, it is probably not appropriate at this stage to insist that they all go to school. Their parents will have an element of choice. However, in the longer term, we shall encourage the parents to send their children to mainstream schools where there may be some extra language support.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam raised some real issues. Much policy work needs to be developed, and I am not entirely sure that we have got it right yet. The dispersal system for the Kosovans will need to ensure that not only refugee children, but those already in school, receive a satisfactory education. We must take care and talk to refugee groups and to parents about how best to develop a strategy.
<P>
Some local authorities have suggested that refugee children should go to a special school for a time where they will be taught English and be provided with a package of integration lessons so they they learn about Britain. Other educationists take the strong view that that should not happen and that the children should go to mainstream schools and be given a package of support there. Both educationists and those who deal with refugees are engaged in considerable discussions, which are necessary before we reach a conclusion as to how best to deal with the issue in the long term.
<P>
The issues are important, and I agree with many of the points that have been made. The amendment is not the best way of pursuing the matter. I recognise many of the concerns that have been expressed and the Government share many of them. Therefore, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister said that he would speak to the important children's charities. I hope that he will do so and that he has a constructive dialogue with them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The Minister referred to a meeting that he had with voluntary organisations. Now is not the time to go into that detail, especially as the Committee does not know what the outcome has been. If issues are unresolved and children's charities are not happy with the Government's approach, I hope that it will be possible for a further meeting to take place to discuss the major issues involving children. The clause gives us a useful opportunity to discuss the issues, even though we cannot go into them in great depth.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is talking about clause 92 rather than clause 91.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> No, I was referring to clause 91. Although you are right, Mr. Maxton, to refer to clause 92, the error in it will be corrected by a Government amendment. I shall not refer to that, but the Minister can.
<P>
On clause 91, funds from local authorities will be involved and the Government will provide the money. I am uncertain that it will do all that is required unless other powers are available to the Government. The clause is confined to the use of funds to support those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who are, or have been, asylum-seekers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Clause 74 also covers asylum seekers but support ends when the application for asylum has been determined. They may still be subject to immigration control, but asylum seeker status&#151;as defined in this part of the Bill&#151;is precise.
<P>
I wonder whether the Government have enough power to provide money to local authorities, perhaps for a group who are obviously refugees&#151;not asylum seekers&#151;because they have been accepted even before they arrive in this country as people with leave to remain here. I do not want to open up the Kosovo Albanian issue again, but refugees from Kosovo will not be asylum seekers: they will be accepted into the country with leave to remain.
<P>
If the Government have sufficient powers, that is fine. If not, they might want to redraft clause 91 more broadly.
<P>
<B>Mr O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the meeting with children's organisations, but it would probably be better to deal with that when we debate clause 99. Briefly, however, I would be happy to meet reputable children's organisations to discuss their concerns about the future and I have proposed that on one issue we set up a working party.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to refugees: they fall outside part VI of the Bill and are eligible for social security benefits. The Local Government Finance Act has powers to pay special grants to local authorities when refugees in the area require special funding. Payment of resources in respect of Kosovans, for example, will be achieved by other provisions, not by the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr Bottomley:</B> The amendment opens up the issue of what happens to students who, for whatever reason, cannot continue to support themselves because of interruption to their funds. It does not go into the matter of students whose change of circumstances&#151;whether personal or because of what is happening in their country&#151;is such that there is no prospect of their supporting themselves. It is a separate, major issue, if, for exampe, there is a coup or turmoil and their country's money becomes internationally worthless. I shall stick to the narrow issue of a student who has a reasonable expectation of being able to continue to receive support after that. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on the matter; if it is an open issue and if, for example, the student's Government will not necessarily authorise social support, is the Minister prepared to consider discussing with the reputable educational institutions some means by which they could provide some support, with Government funding in recognition of what they are doing? It is a big issue, not necessarily one that could easily be dealt with by a Back Bencher's amendment, but it would be interesting to know how the Government propose to approach the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> There is an existing provision in the income support regulations that goes wider than the amendment. I was surprised by the amendment; people from abroad&#151;not just students who have limited leave&#151;with no recourse to public funds whose funds from overseas are temporarily disrupted can claim urgent cash payments. In such circumstances, the adjudication authorities must be satisfied that the funds from overseas will resume. People in that position are paid income support at the reduced 90 per cent. rate in respect of urgent cash payments. There is similar provision in the housing benefit and council tax benefit schemes in which entitlement is limited to 42 days during any one period of leave. Payment under these schemes will be at the normal rate.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the Department of Social Security will continue that policy and will make regulations using the powers in clause 95(3) in conjunction with powers under social security legislation to provide for such payments to continue to be made. It is the sort of detailed issue that is better dealt with in regulations than in primary legislation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 do not attract my sympathy. Such matters are not dealt with in the Bill; part of the premise of allowing people to come to the United Kingdom to study is that while they are here they will not have recourse to public funds. The amendment would allow students who claim to have been deserted or to have been subjected to domestic violence to receive publicly funded benefits, a concession that we are not prepared to allow at this stage. In the light of my comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I shall do as the Minister asks. At this stage of the Bill, the other issues are better dealt with in another place where there may be more time to consider them. My amendment is ambiguous as to whether people are suffering after arrival in this country, or before they arrive. I should have dealt with that ambiguity earlier.
<P>
I am glad that the Minister pointed out that the exclusion in subsection (1) can be overruled by subsection (3) and support can be given for up to 42 days. We have the Minister's assurance that that is the case, but it might be useful if he could make it clear to UKCOSA and others how that is established. I am not sure that many people who read the Bill when it becomes an Act would necessarily know that, without the words that the Minister has used in responding to my amendment.
<P>
If the Minister is relying purely on subsection (3) to give effect to what he told the Committee, that should be made plain. If subsection (1) does not overrule the social security provisions, that again should be made plain. However, I am not suggesting that this is necessarily the right evening for it to be gone into in depth.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Perhaps I can write to the hon. Gentleman on the detail of the points that he has made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This, in many senses, is the crunch clause. It is at the heart of part VI in terms of taking people out of the benefits system and excluding them from it. It is something to which the Minister has already referred.
<P>
I and my hon. Friends find it unacceptable that we are creating a class of people who are excluded from the ordinary benefits and support mechanisms, which we believe define an essential minimum set of social welfare benefits that should apply to all people residing in the United Kingdom, whether they have temporary or more permanent status. The fact that asylum seekers have only temporary status should not disqualify them from the minimum level of provision; yet under these clauses the floor that exists to prevent such people from falling into poverty and social exclusion is removed and replaced by a system of which we have been critical throughout our debates.
<P>
The Minister has tried to assure us that the system will not represent a step backwards for many people, but will be a step forward from the odd, shambolic system following the 1996 Act. The latter assertion is possibly demonstrable, because the outfall from that Act has been so appalling. However, the Minister's primary assertion that this will be an acceptable, reasonable and humane level of support for asylum seekers in general is one that we cannot accept.
<P>
Therefore, we believe that it is right to oppose the clause, as it will be to oppose the remaining clauses, because we believe that the basic floor benefit system, which defines a level of poverty, a set of essential living needs and the level of support that any UK citizen requires, should be applied universally to those resident in this country, as long as they are not breaking the law, and to those who are here genuinely and are pursuing a proper, legal entitlement to claim asylum. We believe that, by removing the floor, the Government are going further than the 1996 Act. Our fear is that we will end up with a larger class of socially excluded people than were produced by the 1996 Act. We do not accept that this exclusion from benefits will act as a sufficient deterrent, that only bogus asylum seekers will be deterred, that only the genuine ones will still come here and so on. Those assertions, with the supporting evidence and the impact of the 1996 Act, do not outweigh the damage that will be caused to the interests of asylum seekers in general and asylum seeking families in particular&#151;a group of people who require special care.
<P>
We intend to oppose the clause. We hope that even at this late stage the Government will change their mind about treating asylum seekers in this way and instead will follow the example of their treatment of the recently arrived Kosovan refugees who, quite properly, have not had this kind of exclusion applied to them when they have been granted exceptional leave to remain status in the UK.
<P>
<B>Mrs Abbott:</B> In a sense, the clause goes to the heart of the Government's new support arrangements. It replaces a series of clear, statutory entitlements to minimum levels of provision with an unclear system of support that will be at the discretion of the Secretary of State or Home Office officials acting on his behalf. Moreover, this support will kick in only if they are not getting support from elsewhere and will be to completely unspecified standards. One of the problems with the support arrangements has been the lack of precision about issues, suitability, standards of housing and what constitutes essential living needs.
<P>
I draw the Committee's particular attention to the withdrawal of severe disablement allowance and disability living allowance. The House has long acknowledged that disabled people need higher levels of support simply to have a basic standard of living. There is nothing in the support arrangements that will allow the disabled asylum seeker to get the high levels of support that he needs. It is very regrettable that the Government have gone down this road. These rates of support are not just wrong in principle but will prove unworkable in practice.
