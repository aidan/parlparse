<H4><center>Transfer of property, rights and liabilities to the Agency</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.
--(1) The Secretary of State may make one or more schemes for the transfer to the Agency of such property, rights and liabilities of a Minister of the Crown (in this section referred to as ``the, transferor'') as appear to him appropriate having regard to the functions conferred on the Agency by provision made by or under this Act, the 1990 Act or the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause is a technical measure for dealing with the transfer of property, rights and liabilities to the agency, particularly the transfer of research and development contracts for intellectual property rights associated with R and D. It is important in relation to research contracts and, as we have made clear throughout our proceedings, uncompleted contracts for food safety research will be transferred to the agency. The provision will enable us to effect that transfer by way of a simple scheme rather than having to negotiate changes to each contract individually. I commend the new clause to the Committee.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.

<H4><center>New clause 1</center></H4>

<H4><center>Duties regarding availability of food</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`In providing advice under sections 6 and 7 the Agency must take into account the overriding importance of not restricting the availability of food to the consumer and that restriction of the availability of food should only take place when it remains the only solution.'.
--[Mrs. Spelman.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The purpose of the new clause is stop the unnecessary restriction of food availability to the consumer. Given that we are in Committee the day after the beef ban was lifted, it is right to place on the record the fact that we very much welcome that announcement. It is excellent news for industry. In the spirit of constructive opposition, we seek earnestly the recovery of the lost market to our livestock industry. I am sure that that is in everyone's best interests, and we hope that the Government will be ambitious for the industry in terms of its targets for restoring that market. That will be vital to many small and large producers who suffered immensely from the ban.

<P>
The lifting of the beef ban is an interesting backdrop to the new clause. The legacy of several food scares that have dogged the food industry over several decades has resulted in almost hysterical media reaction each time the safety of a food product is put into question. It is unrealistic to suppose that no such cases will arise in future, and the new clause is concerned with how the agency will cope with such instances. We want to encourage it to think of alternative options before resorting to the last solution of restricting the availability of food.

<P>
It is, however, right and proper that the agency should have the power to restrict food, because circumstances may arise when that is necessary. It is possible to imagine a scenario in which the science is unclear. That was true in the early stages of the BSE crisis; the science was not certain at the outset and, to this day, it remains unclear. Non-scientists sometimes place an unfair burden on Government scientists by asking them to give black-and-white, clear and certain answers. We know from the handling of previous food scares that that is not always easy. The agency will have to cope with scientific uncertainty when taking such decisions. However, the risk to public health may sometimes be considered insufficient to warrant restricting the availability of food.

<P>
It was instructive, during the most recent scare caused by Belgian food products that might have been contaminated with dioxins, that the Government should have issued a food hazard warning before taking the ultimate step of banning poultry, eggs and other food products from Belgium. The agency could consider issuing food hazard warnings before going the whole hog of limiting the availability of a food. In practical terms, however, as soon as official warnings are given, food retailers usually take swift action to remove products from the shelves in the interests of customer confidence.

<P>
It is important for the agency to consider carefully the practicalities of restricting the availability of foods. If the agency is over-cautious, public confidence in it will be undermined; if it is over-casual, however, it will be criticised for failing to protect public health. We understand the agency's dilemma, but it is important to get that balance right.

<P>
If the agency is urged to consider alternatives before reducing the availability of foods, it is more likely to carry out its prescribed general function under clause 7 of providing information and advice to the public on matters that could affect their capacity to make informed decisions about food. If the onus is placed on the agency to inform consumers and allow them to decide
--if that becomes a strong pattern in its method of operating
--it will be less likely to restrict the availability of food prematurely. That would be a grown-up way of treating consumers, who have had to live through a series of food scares about fats, eggs, poultry, cheese and meat
--to name but a few.

<P>
British consumers have an almost stoic attitude; they believe that if they took much notice of the food scares that often circulate in the media, they would not eat anything. They have learned to live with those scares and to use their judgment about the risk to which they are exposed. Their ability to do that would be greatly enhanced by the provision of good, clear guidance and information by the agency on the relative risks involved. If the agency gains a reputation for giving sound, readily intelligible advice rather than for over-zealous decision-making on behalf of consumers, it will be more respected.

<P>
There are, of course, commercial reasons for taking a rather conservative approach to restricting the availability of food. Although I do not imply that commercial considerations should be anything other than a secondary reason
--or even a third or fourth reason
--for restricting food only as a last resort, restricting food prematurely can cause food businesses to lose large sums of money, as perishable stock is wasted and doubts about the safety of the product linger long after the Government have given the all-clear. Recent history has many examples of large sums of money being lost
--for example, in the egg and meat industries
--through a disproportionate fear of the risk attached to such foods.

<P>
The coupling of the provision of advice with a simple risk assessment would help the consumer to trust information given and decisions made by the agency. We debated risk assessment in considerable detail, and I do not intend to repeat any of that. We made several suggestions about how risk assessment might be made transparent and attached to the agency's decisions.

<P>
Risk assessment is integral if we are to find other solutions to the simple banning of foods. For that reason, we urge the Government to consider the new clause. The ethos of the agency should primarily be to inform and aid the consumer to make well-informed decisions about the risks attached to eating different foods, rather than to nanny consumers by making decisions for them or making decisions to restrict foods prematurely, unwisely, or in a way that might undermine public confidence in the agency.

<P>

<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I am delighted that constructive opposition now means congratulation for the Government, especially in relation to the successful negotiation of the lifting of the beef ban.

<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Lady's remarks. I would like to respond to several perfectly sensible and probing questions that she posed, although we cannot accept the new clause because we already state in the Bill the clear, overriding objectives of the agency, which are:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to protect public health from risks which may arise in connection with the consumption of food (including risks caused by the way in which it is produced or supplied) and otherwise to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The hon. Lady remarked on the nature of scientific uncertainty, which is an important subject. We dealt fully with issues in relation to risk and the associated status of scientific uncertainty when we debated that heated subject. The Committee heard arguments about the importance of creating a public climate in which people are able to understand and accept that not all advice can be certain. Advice is information based on the best available research at the time.

<P>
There are important ways in which the agency will contribute to improving the present position. One practical way will be to create a greater and better public awareness about the status of scientific research projects, some of which are better than others and some of which are better reported than others. I hope that we will introduce guidance for the public on how to interpret scientific research and see through some of the more inflammatory headlines.

<P>
The agency will operate in a climate in which public faith, confidence and certainty is extremely fragile. There is an important job to do in beginning to rebuild confidence in food safety, and improved public information will be an important step in that process.

<P>
It is absolutely key that the agency should act systematically and proportionately, paying due attention to the risks of taking or not taking action to protect the public, and leaving the public free to make their own decisions. As we have often said in our detailed scrutiny of the Bill, the agency's approach to such areas will be absolutely key to its reputation for reasonable and proportionate action and in building a consensus about the new approach to improving food safety in practice and engaging the public in judgments about food safety.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The new framework of risk, which we have discussed at some length and which is set out in some detail in relation to public health in the White Paper ``Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation'', is a practical way forward in which the public will be engaged. We all accept that the agency will operate in a climate in which it will have to steer a steady course between the faddists at one extreme and those who would advocate minimal or no intervention at the other. The test of its capacity to deliver on its objectives and guiding principles will be whether it succeeds in doing that.

<P>
I have reiterated to the Committee the mission statement under which the agency will operate, but in safeguarding the public, due consideration of proportionate means and risk may sometimes mean that foods must be made temporarily or permanently unavailable. However, that will be a decision of last resort. If and when such a decision is made, the public and all those involved will understand why.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Meriden will accept that our brief debate on the new clause has provided an opportunity to probe some of the perfectly reasonable points that it raises, but will understand why we cannot accept it and will agree to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's reply, but I cannot understand how the agency's primary function
--to protect public health
--is incompatible with the purpose of the new clause. There is no conflict, so it does not cancel out our desire to shape the agency's culture so that it does not resort to banning foods too readily.

<P>
We want the Bill to state that that should be a last solution and we want the agency to consider all options before resorting to such a draconian measure. The new clause is based on a desire to prevent the agency from becoming too dictatorial. We shall therefore have to press it to a vote.

<H4><center>New clause 2</center></H4>

<H4><center>Duties regarding imported food</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.
--(1) The Agency has the same functions and must exercise the same degree of scrutiny in relation to imported food as to domestically produced food.

<P>
(2) The Agency must not allow the sale of any imported food that does not meet the same standards as domestically produced food in the methods by, and standards to which, it is produced.'. 
--[Mr. Paice.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
This new clause, as is clear from reading it, is designed to ensure that the agency applies the same controls to food that is imported as to that which is produced in the United Kingdom. It will come as no surprise to hon. Members, especially the Minister, to know that we are anxious about that, not least because it features strongly as a principle in the Conservative party's ``fair deal for farming'' campaign.

<P>
We believe that the agency should have the power to enforce the very high British food safety standards on all imports. It is not right that food should be allowed into the United Kingdom if it has been produced to standards below those expected of our domestic food producers. Such foreign food may cause problems for consumers and it would deliberately undercut British food producers, whose businesses are constrained by our domestic legislation and more strict production standards.

<P>
<B>Dr. Desmond Turner </B>(Brighton, Kemptown): What would happen under the new clause to, for example, French cheese made with unpasteurised milk?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> To the best of my knowledge, there would be no problem at all if the agency decided that the cheese was produced to British standards and was comparative to that produced in England. I know that the regulations on unpasteurised products in Scotland are different from those in England. The critical point is the overall standard and safety of the food. We should not be telling British consumers that they cannot have access to overseas food, whether it be a soft cheese from France or whatever, but the safety standards applied should be the same as those in this country. Later we shall debate an amendment on food labelling that could sit alongside that requirement, so that consumers had the right to have the information on which they could make a choice.

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I should be interested to hear whether the new clause includes not only safety but animal welfare standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue. My sympathy is that animal welfare should be included. However, it would be wrong to expect the agency to be involved in animal welfare issues, unless they were linked to food standards. I cannot think of an example off the top of my head, but certain animal welfare issues could relate to food standards. If there are welfare constraints on British farmers, it is unfair to expect them to compete with overseas livestock producers, who are not so constrained.

<P>
A couple of weeks ago, the decision was taken to phase out battery cages for perfectly understandable welfare reasons, but that will simply mean that more of the eggs eaten in Britain and used to produce the egg powder used by the food processing industry will come from hens kept in overseas battery cages. That is the simple corollary to phasing out battery cages here.

<P>
New clause 2 is to do with food standards and food safety. The agency should be able to operate on imports just as much as on domestic food, but not only for competitiveness. I hope that the Minister will not say that we are being protectionist. Protectionism is about giving an unfair advantage to domestic producers, but
--to use that dreadful cliche´
--we seek a level playing field. It is a competitive rather than protectionist proposal. It would also help improve public confidence in the general safety of food if imports were included in the agency's remit. It would boost the credibility of its policies; omitting imports would make a mockery of them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): I have much sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument, but can he say how the new clause might comply with our existing obligations within the European Union?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am coming to that. I do not know what I have done wrong this morning, Mr. Gale, but I have taken more interventions this morning than during all the preceding sittings of the Committee
--but I shall plough on.

<P>
We should bear in mind the Agriculture select Committee's report of 1997--98,  the first year of this Parliament. That report stated:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consideration should be given, consistent with EU legislation, to charging importers of food for the actual cost of food safety checks carried out at ports of entry''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Before anyone accuses us of adding extra costs, if that was applied as the committee suggested
--the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) is a member of the Select Committee and he is nodding in agreement
--it would make our proposal cost-neutral. If maintaining the competitiveness of the UK food industry was a factor in the Government's having decided against the levy
--I hope that it was
--the Government could make a real improvement by agreeing to the new clause.

<P>
In previous sittings, I cited the Food and Drug Administration of the United States. I do not suggest that the new clause would create a replica, but we can nevertheless consider American methods and learn from them. With the exception of most meat and poultry imports, which are regulated by the Department of Agriculture, all foods, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices and electronic products that emit radiation are subject to examination by the FDA when they arrive in the United States. By law, those products must meet the same standards as domestic goods; for instance, imported food must be pure, wholesome, safe to eat and produced under sanitary conditions. The inspectors check each consignment for signs of filth, spoilage, contamination or mislabelling, and about 30,000 import shipments each year are detained at the port of entry because the goods appear to be unacceptable. That is my answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire about consistency with EU legislation.

<P>
I am sure that the Minister of State will be flattered to learn that I have scoured his answers to a raft of parliamentary questions. In a couple of answers, the Minister clearly describes the current legislative position; however, I believe that he has also exposed the weaknesses in the system and what we could do to address them. In December 1998, in answer to a question about the inspection of food production establishments for third countries not within the EU, the Minister said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``These missions involve audits of the bodies responsible for consumer health protection and include inspections of some''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
some, I hasten to stress

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``individual processing premises. In addition, some member states who traditionally have carried out their own audits of third countries' procedures and establishments may continue to do so ... MAFF staff are hoping to visit Brazil and Thailand early in the near year''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
it should read ``new year'', I think--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to carry out audits of the public health controls on poultry meat and poultry meat products.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Perhaps the Minister could report on that visit, which I assume has now taken place.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The written answer continues:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission are in the process of expanding the FVO''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Food and Veterinary Office--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so that it can carry out inspections in all third countries to verify that their establishments comply with Community provisions, As an interim measure, it has been agreed by the Council of Ministers that, for products of animal origin other than fresh meat, guarantees of conformity with Community provisions for the protection of public and animal health may, until 1 January 2001, be given by the competent authority of the third country concerned.''
--[Official Report, 14 December 1998; Vol. 322, c.409.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That exposes a huge weakness in the system. I am not being a little Englander when I say that there are serious doubts about the level of competence of the competent authorities in some of the countries from which we import food and food products. Given the stringent level of regulation that exists for our domestic producers, that is wrong. The Commission, with its powers, should be playing a greater role, but in the absence of that, the caveat that member states that have traditionally carried out their own audits may continue to do so, is something that Britain should be doing.

<P>
A second written answer, which is very illustrative, was again given by the Minister of State. It states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Meat imported from non-EU countries must enter the Community at approved Border Inspection Posts (BIPs), most of which are operated by local authorities. HM Customs and Excise have a statutory responsibility to withhold clearance of this meat until they have been notified by the Official Veterinary Surgeon at BIP that relevant veterinary checks have been completed satisfactorily.''
--[Official Report, 6 July 1998; Vol.315, c.414.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is fine as far as it goes, but we inspect British meat products not as a consignment but as the live beast before slaughter. I shall not invite the Minister to repeat his illustrative comments on Tuesday on the issue of meat inspection, but we inspect the animals before they are slaughtered, while they are being slaughtered and while they are being cut up. A high level of veterinary supervision is required in this country all the way through the process. Yet, for meat imported from non-EU countries, we simply inspect the consignment at the point of entry.

<P>
A subsequent written answer, which was given on 11 February 1998, refers to consignments from outside, and repeats the point that I have already made. It also refers to animal products imported from within the EU. It includes products from third countries that have stopped off at some point in the EU on the way here. That is another great weakness in the system. I am not criticising the Minister, but am using his words as an official description of the current state of play. His written answer states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Single Market rules permit only random spot-checks at destination on animal products traded within the Community. Consistent with those rules, a daily sample of randomly selected consignments from EU member states are subject to documentary checks.''
--[Official Report, 11 February 1998; Vol.307, c.276.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Again, is that anywhere near adequate, compared with what is being imposed on our producers? Being ``subject to documentary checks'' is inadequate. The Minister will tell me that that is the European law and that we are stuck with it, and, an extent, I accept that. However, a system in which documentary checks are the only safeguards is inadequate.

<P>
I am not accusing every meat or food importer of twisting the law in some way, but I would bet most of the little money that I have that examples of unsafe consignments being accompanied by correct documentation can be found. We know, from the fraud investigations in the EU, how clever various businesses in the food industry are at creating what appear to be perfectly valid documents for consignments to which they do not actually apply. To operate purely on documentary checks is not satisfactory.

<P>

<B>Mr. Todd:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman focus also on the risks involved in imported foodstuffs? We discussed earlier the fundamental issues of risk analysis and proportionality. How would he apply those to imported foodstuffs?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The response to the hon. Gentleman's first point, which I am grateful to him for raising, is that I am concerned that some systems of production, in which I include animal feedstuffs, veterinary products for animals or poultry and some pesticides in the production of food crops, are used abroad but banned in this country, and in some cases, throughout the EU. A good example is recent ban on antibiotic growth promoters, about which there is grave concern because they are not banned in some of the countries from which we import meat, particularly poultry, products. The agency should have the clear remit of assuring itself that meat imported from countries where such products are not banned has not been treated with them. That may mean using powers of inspection at points of production or slaughter, or wherever appropriate, but also the power to make proper residue checks when consignments come into this country. That is an important point. I cannot understand how, if the use of certain antibiotic growth promoters by pig or poultry producers poses a risk to human health, the same risk does not apply to poultry or pigmeat treated with the same product that comes from elsewhere in the world. The issue is not whether there is a genuine risk; it is one of competitiveness.

<P>
The second point raised by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire was on the issue of risk. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), I do not want to rehearse the extremely good, well, considered debate of our previous sitting, but the agency should consider the issue of risk, and whatever level of risk it decides is acceptable for a food product should apply equally to British and imported food products.

<P>
All that the new clause seeks is equivalence: a simple statement that the agency should have the same responsibilities for imported food as for domestically produced food, so that we ensure that food standards and food safety, in terms of residues and methods of production
--and all the other factors that go into the production of food to make it ready for retail sale
--are dealt with equally. I have concentrated on products such as meat from abattoirs, but the same applies to all sorts of food processing factories. We now import increasing amounts of ethnic food from countries that supply those markets for natural cultural reasons. I have never visited a food production factory in such a country, so I do not know, but I think that it is essential for all the hygiene regulations that apply to British factories to apply to factories that process such food, wherever they may be. The agency should have the power to ensure that the regulations apply in those circumstances. It would be fine if the Minister of State were to say that the agency would have those powers, but I do not believe that it will. We want to insert the new clause to emphasise the issue of equivalence to which I referred.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Derbyshire made a point in his first intervention about European Union legislation. I reluctantly accept that there is EU legislation that restricts what we can do on our own about food imports. However, I hope that the Government will press the EU hard to alter the legislation so that we can ensure that imports are properly inspected.

<P>
The Minister of State cannot say that we propose that the agency do something illegal as an earlier clause states that the agency should not do anything outside EU legislation. Within the legislative limits that exist, which I believe are too tough, the obligations on the agency for imported food should be the same as they are for food that is produced domestically. We want the new clause added to the Bill to emphasise that fact for the confidence of the consumer and the British producer.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman, and with some forbearance at the attack on the rules of the single market driven through the House on a three-line Whip by Margaret Thatcher when he was a member of the Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I was not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Well, he certainly aspired to be one and later became one, so he obviously supported the legislation. The issue is a serious one, because the idea of a single market has consequences that certain trades find unacceptable, for reasons that we understand.

<P>
All food sold in this country, with no qualification, must be safe according to the Food Safety Act 1990 and the regulations made under it. It does not matter where food comes from or what has been done to it. This legislation does not change that requirement. The Bill contains nothing that could be held up to show any discrimination against British food and British food manufacture. Even if the Bill contained a levy, which it does not, that would be constructed deliberately to catch all food, retailing and catering. Our avowed intention from day one has been not to discriminate against British food and its production through the establishment of the Food Standards Agency.

<P>
Subsection (1) of the new clause would not add anything to the Bill, which already covers imported and home-produced food. There is a problem with subsection (2). It would be in clear breach of the EU single market rules, which forbid the banning of imported food that meets EU standards but may not meet domestic standards. In other words, we are fully entitled in this country, as indeed is any member state, to have higher standards for domestic production than are required elsewhere, on the basis that the population demand it. The market is there for such food and it is at a premium.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We do not have the right to ban imported foods that do not meet higher domestic regulations. I have explained the position honestly and clearly, although it may be said, ``Hang on a minute, doesn't that mean that you put your own production at a price disadvantage?'' That may be so, but the whole point of higher standards, whether in food safety or animal welfare, is that consumers demand them.

<P>
Opinion polls have shown that consumers want higher standards, but the cheque book poll in the supermarket shows that people want to buy at the cheapest price. I fully accept that producers face a dilemma. It is a matter of marketing; industry must deal with it and it is not something that the Government can solve. I wholly approve of and support welfare-friendly produce and, if there is a choice, I buy it. We understand why it carries a premium. More work needs to be done by welfare organisations and producers to encourage and inform the public about the choices that are available.

<P>
It is not a matter of food safety. We do not regard food safety as a competitive advantage in this country, and I hope that we never will. There is a small role in the market for welfare-friendly food and it is up to the industry to expand it. We cannot impose it on others, but we can encourage other countries
--on the evidence of our own consumers' buying choices
--to produce welfare-friendly food and market it as such. We can do that by negotiation and market forces
--which the late Ian Gow once described as ``the magic of the market''. That is a telling phrase and it contains some truth. More work needs to be done by the producers.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I appreciate that the problem has not changed over the years, but will the Minister tackle it by placing controls on the claims that can be made? For example, a producer cannot put on a packet of cornflakes that they are of ``remarkably low fat'' because such a claim needs to be justified. Similar controls must be placed on supermarkets when they advertise welfare-friendly chicken when it makes up only 2 per cent. of the shelves, while the other 98 per cent. of chicken may have been produced cruelly in France. Supermarkets are good at marketing premium, welfare products and, no doubt, innocent consumers assume that all the rest of the stuff on the shelves is of similar quality. I accept that what I have described is not exactly claim-type territory as that of the percentage of fats, low-sugar or cholesterol-free foods, but I hope that the Minister or the FSA will now explore such an approach.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am not saying that the Food Standards Agency will present a fresh start, because the majority of such work has already started. The concept of the agency in the public's mind and in that of producers presents a golden opportunity for its board, chair and members to take into account such points. Such genuine points may lie slightly outwith some of the agency's responsibilities, but they relate to its role of providing education and information to explain such points to the public so that they are clear in consumers' minds when they face choices. That role will be a powerful element, and I should like it to take off, because it would engender an extent of public support for the agency that would not result if the Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, moved in that direction. Indeed, we would not try to do so with the advent of the agency. However, I take on board the point that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) makes, which many people will share.

<P>
As all food sold must comply with the Food Safety Act 1990, importers ultimately bear some responsibility. Big importers such as supermarkets and large chains take important steps to ensure through contracts with suppliers, whether from the EU or outside, of food to be processed in the EU and imported into this country, that the system contains checks on traceability and hygiene standards throughout.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) mentioned ethnic food. I do not know whether he has ever visited the annual ethnic food fair held at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham
--or, to be more accurate, Birmingham's NEC located in the borough of Solihull, which collects the rates. It is a sight to behold. The companies involved, some of which are now very large, insist on ensuring the authenticity of their products. Such companies cannot afford ethnic communities in this country, with their knowledge and background, to attack products, because it would reduce the market overnight for such foods in the more general population, from where growth will come, They therefore take the utmost care, as I know from my constituency experience of a manufacturer of sweets and desserts for Indian restaurants. Staff are trained
--the business has had the occasional row with the Home Office over bringing a cook from Bombay to train new staff
--to ensure that techniques and ingredients are used correctly so that the product is exactly what is required. Massive insistence is placed on ensuring precision in products and the food chain.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire did not concentrate only on meat, but it figures largely in this matter. I do not know the results of the visits that he mentioned, but I know that the EU inspects third-country meat-processing plants and abattoirs in policing on behalf of our constituents. I am unsure of the dates, but I think that Australia received a six-month warning in January or February to tidy up some issues that the EU inspection squad was not happy about in Australia's meat industry, and a further visit will be made. Australia counts as a third country in relation to the EU, and that case is an example of the Community police operating effectively on behalf of our constituents and those in other member states of the EU, inspecting in third countries, finding things that they are not happy about and allowing a period of time
--in this case, six months
--to put them right.

<P>
Such policing goes on all the while, but we do not always hear about it in the media. That fits in with what the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said about the EU Food and Veterinary Office, which checks the original contracts and agreements to import those foods. In some cases, that happens only after EU officials have visited the countries involved to check the audit procedures in the meat industry to ensure that the produce is acceptable to the EU. When they check an import into the EU, they check not only the piece of paper that states that the consignment is 2 tonnes of beef from Argentina, or whatever, but the processes that were part of the original approval to import into the United Kingdom. It is not simply a question of saying, ``This is a consignment'', because of the contractual arrangements and EU approvals under which the produce is imported. The agency's enforcement monitoring powers to audit local authority third-country import controls are an aspect of extra policing.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made the point that the new clause relates not only to meat but to other produce. I have an example in my mind. We import horticultural produce from 60 countries. I have used that figure now for more than a year, so it may no longer be accurate, but it was given to me by one of the big supermarket chains at an exhibition
--probably last year's royal show. I was the first serving MAFF Minister to visit Spitalfields market, which has been open for 10 years, to see the operation at first hand. I saw MAFF inspectors going around the market, checking the visible quality and size and the premium that is allowed for the classes of certain produce.

<P>
Such produce does not hang around very long on the shelves, but the point is that it is also covered by our residue testing programmes. There are no no-go areas for the residue testing programme, whether it be for meat or fruit. If problems are identified, we carry out special surveys. We investigated imported pears last year. The suspicion was that a pesticide which has not been available in this country for years for use on pears
--it can be used on other produce
--was being used on imported pears. I shall not even try to pronounce the name of the pesticide.

<P>
We have taken a decision that that pesticide is not allowed on pears, whether home-grown or imported. No one argues about that ban; it is under no threat. We must ensure that our farmers are not using that pesticide, that there is no spray drift from other produce on which it can be used
--once it gets on to pears, it stays there
--and that it is not on imports.

<P>
About two weeks ago, we published those findings, including the brand names involved and the country of origin. We highlighted the shops and other places where we bought the pears
--well, I think that we took the pears. I do not think that we purchased them, but I do not want to drop myself in it. We obtained them. It was clear that the pesticide had been used on pears imported, I think, from the Netherlands. There had clearly been some spray drift on British produced pears
--the pesticide was found in the pear itself. Appropriate action has been taken by the local authorities, the enforcement authority, where those pears were grown and sold. That is an example of a UK standard being imposed and checked. We take appropriate action if we find that things are not as they should be.

<P>
I sum up by saying that the agency has to operate under international and EU law, as stated in its guiding principles. We do not want customers to be put at risk by lower production standards; far from it.

<P>

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) asked about unpasteurised cheese. I do not want to start a debate on specialist cheese producers. Nevertheless, I invite my hon. Friend
--and anyone else who might follow the headlines rather than the detail
--to ask themselves why our large supermarkets import French cheese made from unpasteurised milk in such quantity when such cheese is made here. To be honest, some of the production procedures and hygiene conditions that prevail here are different to those found in France. On balance, with goodwill and advice, I want our cheese producers to reach the French standards; more specialist British cheese would be bought by British supermarkets because they would have confidence in the production system. Some of our finest regional produce is not purchased by our supermarkets for sale to British customers. It is crucial that such produce does not all go in one direction.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am mystified. The Minister wants British specialist cheese producers to work to the same standard as French producers. I am at a loss to understand that; I thought that regional cheese producers had made incredible strides during the past few years, making cheeses with a variety of taste and quality that was second to none
--but without the snobbish value of some of the better-known French cheeses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That last point underlines the cachet and snob value to the consumer of things foreign and exotic, and we cannot knock that. I was answering the specific point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown of cheese produced from unpasteurised milk. Of course, many speciality cheeses use pasteurised milk, but I was saying that British supermarkets buy an enormous amount of unpasteurised cheeses from France, and not necessarily for snob value, that could have been purchased from British producers. They must ask themselves why. It is an area in which we have to do more.

<P>
I understand the comment of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. We should not worry about the snob value of our country's speciality produce, but some of it is on sale only in the right hon. Gentleman's region of the country. The producers do not want it sold by London supermarkets because expanding production would corrupt the process. They do not want to be subject to the supermarkets' orders for just-in-time production, because it would diminish the quality of the product. That is certainly the case with the absolutely fantastic produce that comes from Cumbria. It works both ways.

<P>
We have to raise our standards
--and standards abroad, when they need to be raised
--just as we want to improve welfare conditions for battery hens or introduce stall-and-tether production for pork. We want to encourage others to do what we are doing. I read some time ago about the vehicles used to transport animals to slaughter. The more comfortable the animals, the better the meat. The slogan was, ``A happy pig is a tasty pig.'' If animals are less stressed, their meat tastes different. That is part of welfare standards. If production-line techniques are used and animals are stressed before slaughter, it is well known that that has an effect on the produce. Let us make no bones about it: there is a premium on ensuring that animals are unstressed. I think that it was Volvo that sold air-conditioned pig lorries. I have not tried the resulting pork myself, but the advice of the tasters was that such transport had indeed affected the taste.

<P>
I do not wish to digress or start a new debate, but those are practical examples. Public health is paramount, as is food safety. We cannot and will not compromise on them, but the agency is in no way being set up to discriminate against British food producers and growers. At the same time, it will have all the powers that we now have for checking what is coming into the country. We send produce back, sometimes based on the paperwork. Since January of last year we have also carried out unilateral specified risk material controls in respect of beef, because the EU flatly refused to do so.  I do not know off the top of my head how many consignments we stopped, but imported beef consignments have been stopped at the port of entry and sent back because they did not meet the requirements on SRMs that we had unilaterally imposed. We are not under threat from that ourselves. Everyone knows
--we have said it for a while, but since yesterday they certainly know it
--that our beef is the safest in Europe because of the checks that we undertake throughout the food chain. No one can contradict us on that. People can come to the abattoirs and check out the operation of what will be the onerous conditions of the date-based export scheme, which is a model that we can sell to others.

<P>
The importing of food is an important issue. We now import much more exotic food. That may have some snob value, but we cannot legislate on that. We need to legislate to ensure the protection of our fellow citizens' public health, and the FSA should operate on that basis. I am considering producing a note for hon. Members, which I might send to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, setting out some of the issues relating to food imports which are outwith the Bill. I have seen an interesting background note that set out the current rules, and it would be useful to share those with hon. Members. Those rules are a constant theme raised by food producers in my and every other hon. Member's correspondence. I do not want myths to get about that we do not check foreign food, send foreign food back, or ban foreign food, because we do. Where there are good grounds for doing so, we do all those things. We even go to the extent of identifying in our surveys the brand name of products and where we got them from, so that we can raise standards and protect the public.

<P>
I have made those points so that it is clear that the Bill does not discriminate. Proposed subsection (1) of the new clause is covered in the Bill and we could not include proposed subsection (2) because it would be impossible under international law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Having listened to the Minister, I am tempted to say a few words. It was a fascinating discussion and the Minister ranged far and wide in his reminiscences. I assume that that was in order, and that it will also be in order if I touch on similar areas.

<P>
I did not have the pleasure of attending the ethnic food fair in Birmingham. I have attended quite a few others, including the Brighton fast food fair. My only advice to the Minister is that he should try to ensure that he goes round it in the right order. If he does the Haagen-Daz's stand first, then goes onto the anchovy pizzas, the McVities cream desserts and some of the other savouries, it will be a rather delicate morning.

<P>
I want to say a little more about the claims, or representations that supermarkets and other food retailers make about their products. I am not saying that they make false claims. If they make false claims about low fat, no sugar, no tartrazine, or real, pure fruit juice, they can be prosecuted by trading standards officers. No doubt, the Food Standards Agency will bear down hard on that. The Minister will know that large food outlets and supermarkets take great pleasure in pointing out their speciality heritage beef section, for example. They may say, ``This is real Aberdeen Angus. We know where the animal was born and brought up. Here are some photographs of it going to school. It was kept all nice and cuddly.''

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not wish to curtail the right hon. Gentleman's argument too far, but we are discussing imported foods now, and in a few moments, if we get there, we shall be discussing labelling.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was saying how supermarkets point out the special qualities or the unique welfare standards of their domestically produced food. They made genuine claims to me about, for example, their Aberdeen Angus beef, welfare-friendly corn-fed chicken from England or Northern Ireland, or welfare-friendly bacon. I used to say, ``That is very good, excellent, wonderful, but what percentage is on your shelves?'' They would reply, ``About 2 per cent., Minister''. When I asked where the rest came from, they would say Taiwan, France, Cyprus, or wherever. ``What standard is that food produced by?'', I would ask. ``Oh well, that is under different standards. The consumer won't pay the price for the wonderful, welfare-friendly produce that we have. We can sell only a tiny bit of it.''

<P>
I was unable to deal with that problem; I wish that I could have solved it, but I was not successful. I do not think that the present Minister will be successful either. The new clause is an attempt to make that happen. The Minister said that his powers under the EU were limited. Of course, if an improper pesticide is being used, he can deal with it. I seem to remember being responsible for destroying 30,000 tonnes of Cyprus potatoes that had an improper pesticide sprayed on them. The Ministry has always done that sort of work, but it has been unable to deal with the claims or representations made by supermarkets and others about the wonderful quality of some of their food, while staying silent about the rest.

<P>
If we believe the advertising bumph, we will see the wonderful, welfare-friendly beef and wonderful cheeses or chickens. We might then assume that all the rest on the shelves is produced to a similar standard. British producers are being cheated; they are losing out. The Minister knows that in 2012, when battery cages are phased out in the whole of Europe, probably 95 per cent. of eggs, egg products, egg powder and the eggs that are used in cakes, buns, pastries, bread and so on will come from the United States. Switzerland has already banned battery cages, but 98 per cent. of its eggs come from countries that do not use free-range systems and can produce eggs that are infinitely cheaper.

<P>
British producers have a problem. There must be some control or action, which new clause 2 is trying to get at. We may produce the most wonderful premium products in the world
--we can even try to persuade the French or Germans to make welfare-friendly products because there is a British market for them, but why should they? If they can sell 95 per cent. of their products, which are made as cheaply as possible, they will continue to do so. Even if we could persuade the French, Germans and others in Europe that there is merit in welfare-friendly products because British consumers want to buy them
--the rest of eastern Europe, the far east, Taiwan and other countries are admittedly big importers of chicken meat at the moment, but they may soon be big exporters of it
--they will continue to produce goods at the cheapest possible price. Our shops have a right to buy such products and if we do not find pesticides, contaminants, residues or veterinary medicines on them, we are powerless to take any action, even though they are produced in conditions that we banned years ago or will ban in a few years, such as veal crates, sow stalls and tethers and factories for egg production.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We are not on a level playing field, which could destroy our industry. The consumer may end up with less choice. Two or three little producers will be left in the country, making wonderfully nice welfare-friendly products, but most members of the Committee would not like the thought of the vast bulk of material in shops if they knew how they were produced.

<P>
The Minister dug himself out of the slight hole that he made when he said that he wants speciality British cheese production up to French standards. I shall help him by saying that he did not mean that, as he already knows that it is up to a high standard. Some of it is a damn sight tastier, but that depends on preference. I accept his point that many people would never dream of putting Somerset Brie on the dinner plate but must have French Brie. There may not be any difference in taste, but they want the caché. That is consumer choice. Some people will always want to drink an inferior French wine rather than one of the better new world wines. We respect the fact that people have the right to make such choices. I challenge the Minister about that being a standards issue. We do not need to get our cheese producers up to the same standard as French ones. Quality and food safety controls are of high standards.

<P>
I am always amazed when I read articles by trendy food writers who used to attack the Ministry in the old days
--they may not do so now
--and go on and on about British food safety standards not being high enough. They wax lyrical about their wonderful holidays in France
--perhaps even Tuscany
--and how they can wander down the street and have a cup of milk from churns on the side of the road with flies all over them. They ask, ``Why can't British food producers market their products like that?'' If they did, they would have been arrested 20 years ago. We do not tolerate such sloppy, filthy standards.

<P>
Nevertheless, that is a wonderful, trendy thing to do on holiday. I do not have to apologise to any foreign Government when I say that there is no way in 100 years that British environmental health officers would tolerate the open presentation of food on shelves or streets that we often regard as a wonderful part of sampling food in some foreign food markets.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> So that the help is not all one-sided, I shall share with the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee an example of what he mentioned. My right hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) was on holiday in France with friends and went to a bakery or boulangerie in which there was a cat and cigarette smoke. When he mentioned them to his friend, his friend said, ``Yes, but the bread tastes great, Jack.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> We tend to expect and demand higher standards here. It is part of the British thinking of, ``If we are doing it, it can't be right, foreigners do it so much better.'' There is an incredible amount of snobbishness among British food writers about how wonderful foreign food is. In my time, 10 years ago, the attack was always on British bread. All the articles in trendy magazines would say that British bread with its white rubbery dough was disgusting and French bread was wonderful. French bread is wonderful for the first two hours after it is baked, but when one tries to make a sandwich with it later it is as hard as a brick. British bread may not be as wonderfully exciting as a ciabatta that has come straight from the oven, but it lasts longer and serves its purpose. It is amazing that Marks and Spencer's standard British white loaf is a speciality food in France, and that the French love the bread that so many of us now condemn as dull, boring and traditional.

<P>
As long as food is fit for its purpose, is safe and does not contain any contaminants, we should not make judgments on its appropriateness. The Minister defended the speciality British cheese makers. Stocking their wonderful  cheeses in our supermarkets has always been a problem. That is partly because the supermarkets are national chains and, if they were persuaded to stock cheese in one of their shops, they would say, ``We want 200 tonnes for all our 200 supermarkets.'' Although they have tried, they are not good at setting up local sections in their shops. I like soda scones
--what the Irish call ``farls''
--but I can buy them only if I make a special trip to Carlisle, Inverness or Belfast. Marks and Spencer stocks them only in certain shops because it does not think that there is a market for them in Birmingham or Knightsbridge.

<P>
Supermarkets target their food supplies on prospective audiences. British cheese manufacturers are now some of the finest in Europe. They are not as big or well-organised as French co-operatives; perhaps they could be if the Government or Milk Marque made the right decision. The new clause has considerable merit. I accept the Minister's response about the difficulties that it would present but, if he will not accept it, the FSA must grasp the problem of supermarkets and other big retailers misleading the public and giving the impression that everything in the shops is of the same standard as the small amount of wonderful, ethically produced meat that they also sell.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border for bringing to our debate his own wide knowledge of the food industry.

<P>
The new clause refers to an important issue. I did not at any stage say what the Minister implied, which was that the Bill went against British food production. I just wanted to ensure that the Bill applies equally to all food, and I am grateful to him for explaining that subsection (1) of the new clause was not necessary, because the FSA will apply equally.

<P>
The Minister said that all food was subject to the 1990 Act. We understand that, but he then said that we cannot apply higher standards on imported food other than those decided by the EU. The hon. Gentleman did not use the words ``minimum standards'', but talked about a common standard. That we are at liberty to set higher standards, but not for imported food, implies a difference between the standards applied to domestic production and those for imported production. Are we free to apply higher standards for domestically produced food, but not for imported food because of the EU situation? The Minister nods. I have interpreted his remarks correctly. One can only deduce from that that an unfairness is built into the system between British producers and overseas producers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> To use the word ``unfair'' is unfair in itself. If the European Union has set standards for a particular product, they must be met throughout the EU. It is always open to an individual member state to set higher standards for itself but, because of the single market rules, it cannot impose those standards on other member states. The hon. Gentleman is saying that, by our having allowed higher standards, we would be imposing those higher standards on other member states.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, we would. We would be saying that we were not prepared to accept their imports, when those imports meet Europe-wide standards. There has to be a degree of choice. Once the minimum standards are met, the single market can work. It must be open to any country to have different domestic rules, but one cannot impose those rules unilaterally on other member states.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> There is a difference between suggesting that we should impose our standards on other member states, which I do not, and proposing that our standards should apply to producers in other member states who wish to gain access to our market. It is a clear distinction. The Minister has confirmed that producers in France
--I choose France because it is the nearest member state
--may be able to produce a product more cheaply because they have to meet only the minimum EU standards; our producers may incur extra costs to meet our higher standards, yet they will be competing with those cheaper French imports on the supermarket shelf. The Minister is kindly nodding in acknowledgement.

<P>
That situation is clearly unfair to our producers. As the Minister said earlier, they will have to try using those higher standards as a marketing tool to persuade the consumer to buy. Nevertheless, a fundamental unfairness is built into the system. It is a slight contradiction to say that the Bill and the 1990 Act apply to all imported food, and that something cannot be done because of European regulations.

<P>
The Minister said that he was the first Minister to visit Spitalfields market on its new site.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is what they told me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> He may be right
--I shall not argue with him
--but my impression was that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) spent most of his time as Food Minister at such places; perhaps he was closer to the consumption end than the marketing end. However, I assure the Minister that I have visited Spitalfields during the past two years; my right hon. Friend the shadow Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and food has also been there.

<P>
The Minister referred to inspections of overseas plants and told us what happened in Australia. I readily admit that I was not aware of that, and I am reassured. It is comforting to know that that is happening, but there is a difference between the EU Food and Veterinary Office sending an inspector to look at what happens there, produce a report and do the sort of inspection that applies to domestic abattoirs. As I said, the Meat Hygiene Service has inspectors on site at domestic abattoirs all the time; the whole process is permanently inspected
--to the extent that, strictly speaking, if the inspector needs to go the bathroom the production line should stop. That is a high level of inspection; the one-off inspections done by the EU may show that, on that day, things were in place and the system seemed right, but one cannot construe from that one visit that it is necessarily like that all the time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is not what I said. I said that the conditions found on inspection at slaughterhouses for third-country imports would form part of the agreement that allowed those imports into the country. It is not just a one-off inspection; there is a chain of rules and regulations to be followed. When we allow those other countries to import into the EU, we check their procedures, their slaughter conditions and other processes. It is not a one-off inspection, simply saying that a place was okay on the day.

<P>
When we audit the arrangement, we need to know the conditions that were agreed when the import of a new product or meat from a new slaughterhouse was first allowed. The paperwork trail must show that they are being maintained. It is not a one-off inspection, or a snapshot; the original contract must be checked and tested and be shown to be working.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister is doing what Ministers, including those of other Governments, always do. He is relying on theory rather than experience and practice. I would be the first to accept that that may be the theory, but in some ways the Minister destroyed his own argument with his anecdote about the Minister for the Cabinet Office, the right hon. Member for Copeland.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The examples that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border cited, and those with which I could, although I shall not, regale the Committee, demonstrate that, regardless of the theory of the relevant legislation and hygiene regulation, such legislation is not always applied as diligently in France as it is in this country. If the French get away with a lower level of inspection and a generality in practice, that is not fair on our producers. When my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a case cropped up that involved turkey meat imported from France. The local inspector turned up at the abattoir only when he knew he was going to be inspected by the EU. Many such examples could be cited, and I am worried about the matter.

<P>
Article 36 of the treaty of Rome gives national Governments the power to ban specific food imports on the grounds of public or, indeed, animal health. If there is a case for banning a food in British production for British public health reasons, I cannot understand how that cannot fit the power under article 36 to ban imports on public health grounds. It must apply across the board. Perhaps the Minister would like to respond to that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The relevant provision is now article 30, but it used to be article 36. Under the treaty of Rome, member states are prohibited from imposing measures that would have an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports. That rule applies even if the same rules would apply to both imported and domestic products.

<P>
Article 36 provides an exception. Restrictions on imports may be justified for the protection of the health and life of humans, animals or plants. However, the exception is more limited than it may appear at first sight. It does not apply if Community rules already deal with the matter involved. Many types of food, such as meat and meat products, are covered by harmonised Community rules. Member states may take unilateral action to limit imports only to the extent that detailed Community rules permit such action. In general, the rules contain safeguard provisions that allow member states to act in the event of serious threats to health. Measures that member states take under such provisions must generally be either rapidly repealed or replaced with Community decisions. In some ways, our SRM unilateral action could have grounds for being covered by that.

<P>
Even when no harmonised rules exist, any action taken under article 30 must be proportionate. It cannot be taken for the protection of trade or of an industry. We are essentially dealing with the protection of public health in relation to food, not with protection of the food industry. That distinction must be made clear. Protection of the food industry is not the agency's role. That explanation forms part of a longer note on imports, and, as I said, it would be useful for hon. Members to have access to a note based on that information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I omitted to mention earlier that I am pleased that the Minister is obviously heeding the widespread anxiety about imports, as evidenced by the fact that the Government intend to produce a circular letter for colleagues. There is great concern about what is happening, and the problem is exacerbated by the dire straits that British agriculture is in. That makes people look more carefully at what they are competing against, which is perfectly understandable. I want to put it on record that the purpose of new clause 2 is not protectionism, whether of the industry or individual farmers. It relates simply to competitiveness.

<P>
We agree with the Government that it is the protection of public health that matters
--that is the protectionist aspect of the Bill. I want our producers, whether the primary producer or the processor, to compete on a basis that is reasonably considered to be fair. That is why there must be a provision in the Bill that the responsibility of the agency is to apply the same standards. As I said in my opening remarks, I accept that the agency will be constrained by current legislation. I wish that it was not, but there must be greater efforts to change that. I am not convinced that for third country imports the powers are applied anything like as rigorously as they should be. I maintain that it is highly likely that food coming from some other countries is not produced to our standards. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence, although I cannot produce it here.

<P>
I hope that the Committee feels that raising this issue has been a useful exercise. I have tried to do it constructively, and I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I remain of the view that the Bill should be changed and we shall raise that matter again on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>New clause 3</center></H4>

<H4><center>Duties regarding labelling of food products</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` .
--The Agency has a duty to ensure that all food products are accurately labelled with a complete list of ingredients, whether they are genetically modified, the country of origin of each major ingredient and the system of production where appropriate.'.
--[Mrs. Spelman.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brouqht up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The purpose of the new clause is to make the agency's powers on labelling explicit. It is only in the explanatory note to clause 7 that labelling is mentioned. Even then, the position remains unclear. The fourth indent on page 8 of the explanatory note states that the agency will be able to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``produce leaflets on food hygiene, labelling etc''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If it is producing only literature for advice, will the agency have any real power to address that area of weakness in the protection of public health? Our new clause makes the issue clearer by placing a duty on the agency

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to ensure that all food products are accurately labelled''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There are two new requirements that address public concerns about the failure of present labelling arrangements. The first is for an accurate statement about any genetically modified element in the food product, and the second is for accurate information about the country of origin and the production system. That relates to imports, which we have just been discussing.

<P>
British consumers have become far more aware of the significance of these aspects of the food that they eat. For example, they know that by buying grass-reared British beef, they will be better able to minimise any risk of contracting CJD. It is marketed as such by butchers. The consumer is currently misled by labels stating that a product is made in this country, when the raw materials have been imported and it has been merely assembled here.

<P>
The labelling of national origin of food is a vexed matter. There are specific laws at European level relating to food labelling requirements that are designed to prevent protectionism. I reiterate that our purpose in tabling the new clause is not one of protectionism, but one that has as its primary motivation the protection of public health.

<P>
The consumer wants to know the country of origin to minimise any perceived risk to food safety from imported food items, which may not be produced to the standards required in this country. We have heard that prophylactic antibiotics or growth promoters which are not permitted here are used in meat production elsewhere. Consumers are well aware of that distinction, and rightly want to protect themselves from eating products that contain those banned substances. Unless the country of origin is shown on the label, consumers cannot rely on the necessary information being available so that they can have a choice and protect themselves from imported products not produced to our standards.

<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): The new clause refers to ``each major ingredient''. An ingredient that is only 10 per cent. of the product could contain pesticides or other substances to which people would object. What percentage of a food product would a substance need to be to qualify as being a major ingredient?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We are making a distinction between the principal ingredients of the food. For example, chicken is obviously the principal ingredient in chicken kiev, but the breadcrumbs that usually surround it are an important ingredient. However, the label need not mention the salt, flavouring or other additives that the product contains.

<P>
Some geographical designations are permitted under European food labelling rules, subject to the requirements that local and traditional methods and practices are used, that the characteristics of the geographical area differ from neighbouring areas, or that the products characteristics are different from those of similar products. The terms ``Scotch beef'' and ``Scotch lamb'' are protected under those rules. Scotch beef is defined as that from cattle finished for a minimum of three months, slaughtered and dressed in Scotland. It is surprising that Welsh or English lamb or Northern Ireland beef cannot be protected in the same way. When beef is cooked and on the plate, it is difficult to detect a significant difference between those products, which are all produced to a high standard.

<P>
There is little real variation in the local and traditional methods used to produce Welsh or English lamb, or Scottish or English beef. That geographical designation is allowed under European rules, but some parts of the United Kingdom cannot benefit from that interpretation of the regulation. That is a grey area. Labelling all products in that way would make a significant difference to the livestock industry, given all the difficulties that it has experienced in the past with BSE. There may be scope for the new clause to become practically possible through such an interpretation of European legislation.

<P>
Another key element of the new clause relates to genetic modification. The requirement to label GM products accurately was established at European level by Environment Ministers on 25 June, but the precise method of labelling has not yet been determined. We want to ensure that the new agency is completely up to speed with those changes in European law. We recognise the difficulty of achieving the accurate labelling of GM ingredients.

<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I think that to be labelled GM-free, a product can contain no more than either 2 per cent. or 5 per cent. GM ingredients. I return to the point about the percentage of a product that constitutes a major ingredient. In an era of great emphasis on value-added foodstuffs, how would the hon. Lady's system of labelling match the one for GM products that the Labour Government have successfully pioneered for Europe?

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I would think that our new clause would sit close to the aspiration that the hon. Lady described as having been achieved. We are simply giving expression to the public's desire to have confidence when they see GM ingredients labelled. At present, the labelling is inaccurate and in order to protect themselves from accusations of failing sufficiently to protect the consumer, retailers have tended to use a catch-all phrase that the product ``may contain genetically modified ingredients''.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> That has caused confusion for the consumer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Before this hare gets running again, I wish to say that that is illegal; if it is happening, will the hon. Lady give me an example of it?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> It certainly did happen at the outset of concerns about genetic modification. However, the Government have made clear the importance of precision on the GM content of food products and retailers have moved on in their understanding of how they should interpret the rules.

<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> Can the hon. Lady also specify whether she means GM ingredients or products that contain items produced through a process that involves genetic modification, such as the use of enzymes?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I was coming on to discuss the distinction between a GM food product, novel food, and quite complicated products that may contain GM ingredients or which have involved genetic modification somewhere in the production process. As the hon. Gentleman says, the GM content may be in the form of an enzyme that is required at an early stage, before the finished product stage, to refine a product. There is obviously a distinction between the two
--a distinction to which the hon. Gentleman has in previous debates drawn the attention of the House.

<P>
The European regulation on novel foods and novel food ingredients, which came into effect in May 1997, does not provide an adequate solution to the public's present concerns about genetic modification. Novel food is required to be labelled if it gives rise to health or ethical concerns or where, on the basis of scientific assessment, it is judged not equivalent to existing foods. To take the example of GM tomato paste, it is virtually indistinguishable from conventional tomato paste and could not therefore be said, on the basis of scientific assessment, to be distinctly different from the conventional product. On that basis, it might well slip through the net.

<P>
Public opinion is not satisfied by the present position on the labelling of GM ingredients and the Bill gives an opportunity for the FSA, as the new regulatory authority for GM food, to implement good practice on the accurate, clear labelling of GM food
--whether distinct novel foods, foods that contain GM ingredients as a principal component or as a significant additional component of a composite food, or foods in which genetic modification has occurred as part of the production process. The Bill gives us a wonderful opportunity to allow the FSA to fill the gap in public confidence about the use and consumption of such foods, and we should not waste it. We tabled the new clause for that reason. It would give the FSA the duty to ensure that labelling was clear and accurate.

<P>
If the new clause is not agreed to
--obviously, we hope that it will be
--a loss of logic would be involved. The Government will place a duty on the FSA to provide the public with information and advice, which will allow them to make choices about the consumption of food, but if the products that they purchase are inaccurately labelled, how can they follow such information and advice? They would be placed in a difficult position. In the Belgian dioxin scare, which we discussed earlier, the Government considered whether products from Belgium that might have been contaminated with dioxins should be banned from sale in this country. Under the labelling system that then prevailed, it was hard for consumers to know which products originated in Belgium. That weakness in the system must be redressed. The new clause would plug that gap and, for that reason, I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall try to be brief because we have already discussed some of the relevant issues. It is not nit picking
--on second thoughts, I suppose that it is
--to say that the new clause could be construed as being anti-local authority enforcement, and it should not be accepted for that reason. It would give the agency ``a duty to ensure''. However, local authorities currently have that duty
--they enforce this country's labelling rules and regulations
--and we want them to retain it. Several companies already know  that local authorities have that duty because they have been caught and fined. It is wrong to place that duty on the FSA.

<P>
The FSA has a general duty to develop policy on all food matters. The Government are responsible for the enforcement of labelling provisions and they have the appropriate expertise through a section in the joint food safety and standards group. Such tasks will pass to the FSA. It is wrong to suggest that central Government currently do no work in this regard
--a considerable amount of work is done. The powers to regulate food labelling already exist under the Food Safety Act 1990. The FSA will advise the Secretary of State about whether further regulation is needed.

<P>
I am sorry to return to this matter again but, by and large, we have harmonised EU regulations on labelling. To suggest amending such provisions unilaterally is simply not a runner. At Question Time a couple of weeks ago, I pointed out that there was nothing to stop a supermarket or retailer from putting the country of origin on products so long as that was done in a way that did not mislead the consumer. I am surprised that the big food retailers in this country have not gone out of their way to use that voluntary power. The supermarkets, which are much-unloved organisations and which control 50 per cent. of food, have no excuse whatever for not ensuring that the country of origin is marked on all their products, as long as it is not done in a way that confuses the consumer. It could be argued that we do not need a raft of new laws to achieve that.

<P>
So far as beef is concerned, a European Union beef labelling scheme currently operates on a voluntary basis. Indeed, I launched the first aspect of the scheme at Planet Organic. That shop was first to be accredited under the beef labelling scheme on the grounds that it had obtained all the necessary information to enable it to conform to the scheme, including displaying the ear tag number of the former beast on the meat on the counter, ensuring full traceability. The scheme currently operates on a voluntary basis, but it will become compulsory in due course. That scheme applies only to beef, not to other meat, but there is nothing to prevent a supplier from including on the labels the country of origin of pork, lamb and other meats, as long as it does not mislead the public. I wish that more suppliers would do that. I say to consumers in this country, ``If it is not labelled as British, do not assume that it is British''. Suppliers will soon get the message if consumers ask. If consumers say that they want British meat to be labelled as such, and if suppliers cannot label it as British because it is imported, the market will prevail.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I have recently received information that a large slaughterhouse in Suffolk imports live French pigs and processes them, but the bacon on the supermarket shelves is labelled as British. If that is happening, does the Minister not agree that it is misleading the public?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is the other side of the coin of why the French want to import live sheep from this country. They want to get the sheep into France and slaughter them so that they can sell them to the French as French lamb. However, in respect of bacon, I suppose the argument is that bacon is processed in some way and might have become bacon in the UK. However, that is one of the issues that we have discussed with producers. We will follow up such examples in any event, especially in relation to pork, because of the new rules that were introduced in January, so that the British public are not misled.

<P>
The British public are entitled to know if ``British bacon'' came from pigs that were not reared in Britain. It would not be misleading for them to know that, and they would understand that the processing of the pork into bacon took place in this country. The hon. Gentleman raised a very valid point because the public should not be misled. Any normal, reasonable person who saw that bacon labelled as British bacon, without any other information, would assume that those pigs had been born, reared and fattened in this country.

<P>
I was going to raise the issue of the export of sheep from this country live
--as opposed to on the hook
--because it is a controversial issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am extremely grateful for the Minister's response, but I want to press him a little further to ask what can be done so that the public do not continue to be misled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will provide me with details of the evidence that he quoted, we will follow up the matter, as we have done in other cases. The National Farmers Union and others gave us a series of labels that had been displayed on supermarket pork in recent months, such as ``heritage pork''
--a strange phrase
--and we took up the issue of where that pork came from. It might have had a heritage, but it was not a British heritage.

<P>
We are determined to deal with that sort of labelling because, last November, suppliers, supermarkets and the British Retail Consortium, freely and willingly, gave us commitments in that respect. Those commitments were entered into honourably and we shall follow up such cases on the public's behalf.

<P>
Labelling is a contentious issue. The ingredient listing label will be debated in due course. The labelling directive introduces a 25 per cent. rule, whereby ingredients that constitute less than 25 per cent. of a product need not be labelled. We do not agree with that rule and it should be abandoned. It would be in the interests of consumers if the percentage were much lower. However, not all member states agree, and we cannot impose our view unilaterally.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Quid system
--the quantitative ingredient declaration
--will establish a requirement for better labelling. In September or October 1997, we set guidelines to ensure that people are not misled. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), we cannot criticise someone for not putting cream in cream crackers. No doubt hon. Members can think of similar instances. For example, what is the main ingredient in a spring roll? Such examples must be dealt with very carefully.

<P>
Given that the beef labelling scheme is currently voluntary, a menu of factors, which are audited not by the Government but by independent auditors, can be included on the label. A related issue is the method of slaughter. People do not appreciate that some supermarket foods are the by-products of religious slaughter methods, through which particular, unwanted parts of animals end up in the food chain. People have the right to know whether they are buying food
--beef, lamb or anything else
--that was produced through religious slaughter methods, but at the moment they do not have that right.

<P>
One may have a particular view about such methods, but they are legal, and we must conform to certain rules. Nevertheless, those who do not want to buy products which are the result of religious slaughter should have the right not to do so. It is wrong for such by-products to appear on our supermarket shelves unlabelled.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am conscious that this is a sensitive subject. The Minister speaks of by-products, but is it not the case that as much as 80 per cent. of an animal may be discarded when it is religiously slaughtered?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes. In referring to such products as by-products, I used a sloppy term. Sometimes, half an animal
--for example, the forequarters
--is not wanted. Clearly, such by-products are substantial and should be labelled. Increasing interest will be shown in that issue.

<P>
When Conservative Members lecture me on the labelling of GM foods, I try to remain cool, calm and collected. I am not referring to the hon. Member for Meriden, although I wonder whether she raised such issues as a former council member of Food From Britain. It is illegal to label a product with the phrase, ``May contain GM material'', although that may have happened in the past. I hope that, despite the vagaries of the Post Office, which is much criticised these days, that hon. Members received two documents on novel food regulations, which were published last week. They deal with the subject in general, but one deals in particular with rules that will come into force in September in respect of soya and catering. Those documents will help hon. Members to understand an issue that has generated a lot of rumour, myth and propaganda. In terms of labelling, there is more than one way to describe GM ingredients. However, the documents make it clear that those ways are specific, and do not include the phrase, ``May contain GM material''.

<P>
European regulations sometimes take months and years to pass. The novel food regulations, which came into force on 15 May 1997, were passed by the previous Government, and we claim no credit for them. They did not cover foods such as soya, maize and tomato paste, which were already in the supply chain. Soya and maize must be dealt with separately, because we inherited a policy of not labelling them. That policy, which is to label foods that are nutritionally or technically different, is the American policy, although Americans are slowly waking up to the difficulties that it causes. We took the view that such foods should be labelled, and we announced the policy change on 7 June 1997, a few weeks after the Government took office. It took time for Europe to agree, but the regulations came into force on 1 September 1998. In respect of foods, sanctions for breaching those regulations came into force on 19 March 1999. In respect of loose foods and catering, they will come into force on 19 September.

<P>
That matter is now tied up, but the question of tomato paste is not. Tomato paste is not covered by the novel food regulations or the soya and maize regulations. However, there has never been any doubt that tomato paste was genetically modified. The lettering was between a quarter of an inch and half an inch high on the front of the cans, when they were on the shelves I checked them personally, because I wanted to check the prices following allegations that it was being sold cheaply as a loss leader against non-GM paste. ``Genetically modified'', or ``Made from genetically modified tomatoes'', has always been clearly labelled on the front of the tin, not on the back. It was not listed in the ingredients list; it was clearly labelled. There is not, therefore, a requirement to deal with that matter.

<P>
Any other novel foods
--by which I mean GM and non-GM novel foods
--will be covered by the European Union regulations that came into force on 15 May 1997, and it is implicit in that measure that they will have to be labelled. There is no get-out from that. Zeneca may make an application to produce chopped or whole tomatoes, of the same type as those used in the paste. If those tomatoes, rather than tomato paste, go on sale, they will still be caught by the novel food regulations, and will have to be labelled. Those regulations deal with that issue as far I am concerned. There are still items, such as additives, flavourings, and animal feed that are not being labelled at present. We are pressing the European Union urgently for the proposals concerning those items that it is about to introduce.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire mentioned enzymes, and the hon. Member for Meriden did not quite address that issue, because the question is a little more complicated than merely one of production techniques. When a product has been refined out
--in the case of oils, for example
--that product may have started out as GM, but the final product could contain no protein, no DNA, or any other material that is genetically modified.

<P>
It is strange that, although 90 per cent. of hard cheese made in this country uses GM enzymes, there have been no campaigns, myths, scares or demands for labelling surrounding that issue. It seems to be accepted that there is nothing wrong with it, and that it is a useful form of technology that does not require labelling. It is a paradox that that industry has been left alone. Long may it continue to be, because there is nothing wrong or unethical in using those enzymes to produce hard cheese.

<P>
The issue is complex and involves more than merely discussing refining, flavouring and additives. It is a question of how far people want to go in creating myths borne out of little fact about the use of GM produce. The bottom line is that GM products will not be put on sale unless they are safe, and that the consumer is entitled to know what the ingredients are
--and, as far as possible, what the manufacturing processes are
--so that he has a choice. Products that are perfectly safe and clearly labelled should not be taken off the shelves. The consumer should have a choice; he should not be denied a choice.

<P>
The FSA will deal with all of those issues, as it will be the UK regulatory authority for GM produce and labelling. The agency will recommend changes to the labelling rules and regulations to Ministers and the House, which, along with the devolved Parliaments, will legislate accordingly. The democratic process will therefore continue. Initially, I was seduced by the argument for unilateral action, but EU regulations will be necessary for the single market and for the establishment of harmonised rules. When the European Union backslides on a key issue, we will pursue a firm voluntary approach. That will apply in animal feeding stuffs unless the European Union pulls its socks up. Our announcement earlier this week of the appointment of members of the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs means that we will have an independent scientific advisory committee to examine the issue.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but the Minister is moving away from the terms of new clause 3.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I touch on animal feed only because it is covered by the Food Standards Agency in the same way as human food, as the Committee knows from an earlier clause. The labelling of animal feed is therefore just as important as the labelling of food for human consumption. I want to put on the record the fact that if the European Union does not take the necessary action, we shall take action in this country to ensure that farmers and others know the ingredients of animal feed.

<P>
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for Meriden that it would be wrong to accept the new clause. First, it would constitute a fundamental attack on local government, which we do not want. Secondly, although all her points are legitimate and I welcome the debates on the new clauses, those points are genuinely covered by the Bill and by the operational system of the joint food safety and standards group, which will transfer to the agency.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister has almost made the point that I was going to make. There is all the difference in the world between statutory requirements for labelling and a voluntary system. The Co-operative Wholesale Society, for example, has a good voluntary labelling system. Does the Minister agree that food labelling should provide as much consumer-friendly and understandable advice as possible?

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have to use the word ``voluntary'' because the words that we use are recorded, and we are regularly watched over by our European police officers. I cannot talk about unilaterally forcing British people to label animal feeding stuffs, as we do not have the authority to do that. Nevertheless, steps can be taken, with the help of the industry.

<P>
This is an important area, and I can only applaud the action of the Co-operative Wholesale Society. We must avoid labelling that cannot be understood
--we do not want to sell a booklet with each product. Sufficient information must be provided so that reasonable people know exactly what the ingredients are, whether the food is for human or animal consumption.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank the Minister for his detailed response on an important question. We were especially pleased to hear that he would be in favour of labelling that provides more information about the production system that is used. That would be desirable for the educational aspect of the agency's work. We can extrapolate from that the fact that many of the difficulties concerning genetic modification have arisen because it is a new technology that is not well understood by the public and has attracted a mythology, as the Minister said. The Opposition have no wish to give oxygen to any myths surrounding the technology. We believe strongly that clear and accurate information on genetic modification will help consumers to understand its role in the future production of food and to choose whether to use products of genetic modification or products involving genetic modification techniques.

On the country of origin, the present position is that there is nothing to stop supermarkets making clear the country of origin, particularly of meat products on display. One problem is that, although supermarkets may label shelves with country or origin, when the packet is removed from the shelf and taken home, there is nothing to advise the consumer on the country of origin. That remains a significant gap. If there is agreement in Europe that beef can be labelled with its country of origin, why cannot pigmeat, sheepmeat and poultry meat be similarly labelled? That is important, not for commercial protectionism, but for public health considerations and restoration of public confidence. We have a residual worry about gaps in the provisions covering labelling that will not be plugged by the Bill. There is little in the Bill on labelling.

<P>
I want to correct any impression given by the drafting of the new clause that we want the agency to take over from the enforcement authority. There may be some misunderstanding about the verb ``to ensure''. We were thinking more of the power conferred upon the agency in previous clauses to monitor existing authorities in carrying out that role. For that reason, we shall seek leave to withdraw the new clause, but we shall want to return to the matter on Report and to correct the impression that we had any intention of the agency's taking over the role of democratically elected local authorities in the matter.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
During my contribution to the Second Reading debate, I referred to performance criteria and it will be no surprise to the Minister that I have moved the new clause. The Bill contains many obligations on the agency, including its annual report and statement of objectives. The British taxpayers are footing the bill for whatever the final sum was
--it seemed to vary every few minutes during our debate on Tuesday night, but it is a large sum in excess of £100 million
--and it is important that taxpayers know that they are receiving value for money. As many of the functions are now carried out by the Ministery of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, it can be argued that there is no way of knowing whether value for money is being obtained at present. It is important that the agency's performance be measurable.

<P>
We are trying to achieve the protection of human health. However, I also said on Second Reading that anyone who pretends that absolute protection can be achieved lives in another world. I have no doubt that food poisoning tragedies will still occur. We must not fool ourselves, as politicians sometimes do, that we can eliminate all risks to life. We cannot. It would be absurd to suggest that a food poisoning incident means that the agency has failed. If one occurred, it would be investigated, but it would be wrong to make a bald statement about the agency's not giving value for money and failing in its obligations simply because of another outbreak.

<P>
That does not negate the need for some measurable criteria against which performance can be established. I do not pretend to have the wisdom to define precisely what those criteria should be. Any measurement of the incidence of food poisoning would be simplistic, although it might be part of an overall blend of criteria that could be added to the Bill.

<P>
The tendency in so much legislation introduced by this and the previous Government has been to try to define more clearly what we expect from public agencies. In responsibilities outside MAFF, the Government have taken initiatives that we introduced considerably further, especially in relation to education and health. On those subjects, performance criteria play ever larger parts in efforts to improve the service to the public. The agency should not be excluded from that basic policy approach.

<P>
The annual report will be the key measure of the agency's accountability, but many annual reports are bland and meaningless, with statements from chairmen and chief executives on the first two pages, financial figures at the back and lots of wonderful glossy photographs. There is little meat
--perhaps that is the wrong word to use.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> A vegetarian report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Yes. There is often little substance as to what has been done to fulfil obligations. That is why the report should contain criteria and build on the accountability that its existence provides.

<P>
It is important that the Government do not allow public suspicion to develop about the agency's activities and whether it is trying to improve food safety. We do not want the public to believe that the agency is working simply towards an ideal diet, which would imply a reduction of choice, or that it solely tells people what they can and cannot eat. I do not suggest that it should not have the dietary responsibility over which there has already been some dispute, and I do not want to re-open that debate. I am anxious to ensure that the public can see from criteria published in the annual report what the agency does and what benefit they receive for their expenditure of more than £100 million through taxation.

<P>
The agency must declare its aims in quantifiable form, and listing the reduction of food poisoning incidents, perhaps mentioning principal causes such as salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli, may be an important part of that. We propose that the agency publish the quantifiable criteria of its performance so that the public know its aims and can assess annually whether it is achieving them. When Members of Parliament are asked to defend the agency or approve of its continuation and Ministers undertake quinquennial reviews of such bodies, they will then have something objective rather than purely subjective on which to base their decisions.

<P>
My final point relates to the information and publicity campaigns that the agency will undertake in accordance with earlier clauses. If it is spending large sums of money on a particular campaign to warn people of a food hazard, there must be quantifiable criteria by which it can assess whether the campaign provided value for money and whether the public took on board its message. Whether the campaign is carried out by media advertising or leaflets, there is a need for a quantifiable objective assessment of what is being achieved.

<P>
We are putting to the Government a constructive proposition. Although we are not proposing the detail of how it should be done, the agency should come up with its own criteria, which should be published in the annual report. I hope that the Government will take the proposition seriously and respond to it constructively.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend. The lack of any suggestion in the Bill that the agency will have objective criteria by which to assess its effectiveness is a glaring lacuna. Let us consider the agency's activities under clauses 6 and 22. The danger is that the annual report could show that the agency was doing hundreds of things and that it was beavering away, but it may not have been effective. It is the easiest thing in the world for individuals or organisations to show that they are highly active, while not necessarily achieving anything quantifiable, measurable or worth while.

<P>
I hope that the agency will set and achieve worthwhile aims, but there must be clear criteria by which to measure its success. I accept that the reduction of food poisoning, be it salmonella, campylobacter or E. coli, are dangerous criteria to accept. I can understand why the Labour party was highly critical of the previous Government when the incidence of food poisoning rose and I suspect that the Government will not accept a measurable criteria such as reduction in salmonella poisoning because they know dashed fine that it is not within their control to bring that about.

<P>
Whether in relation to information campaigns or to the incidence of food poisoning, it is important that systems are in place to measure whether the message has got through and the agency is achieving its general aims. Otherwise, there is no point in it. The agency may be successful in allaying public fear about food poisoning by using clever propaganda, yet food poisoning may still be rising. We must know by what measures and on what basis the Government will view the Food Standards Agency as a success or failure.

<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> This matter has rightly been the subject of continuing debate throughout various stages of the Bill. Members of the Committee will be aware that the Special Select Committee paid specific attention to the issue when it scrutinised the Bill in its draft form. It was in response to its comments that the relevant clause that referred to the annual report was amended to include a specific reference to the agency preparing a

I agree entirely with the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border about rigour and the capacity for self-criticism.

Adjourned till this day at half-past One o'clock.
