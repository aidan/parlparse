<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during the proceedings on the Competition Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee will agree that it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I told my father that you were to be Chairman and asked him for some tips. He chaired several Standing Committees when you were on the Front Bench, Mr. Maxton, and when you were an awkward Back Bencher to use my father's words considering matters such as the poll tax and the original devolution proposals. In response to whether there was anything that I should watch out for, my father said, "Not really, but don't get on the wrong side of him"	. I think that that was good advice.
<P>
That advice also applies to the hon. member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), the co-Chairman. When the National Minimum Wage Bill was in Committee, he chaired a 29.5 -hour sitting. I do not say that to frighten or threaten member of the Committee, as I hope that our proceedings will be leisurely and more organised than that. This week, the Committee will sit only in the mornings but after Whitsun we shall meet in the mornings and the afternoons. I am sure that that is the best way to ensure that the Bill receives careful consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham):</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton, for giving me the opportunity to speak. I welcome the two Ministers to their duties in Committee and I look forward to having interesting debates on such a radical and wide-ranging measure. Being a traditionalist, I have no objection to Committees sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays, nor would I usually object to their sitting at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm to deal with the business. I take issue with the Minister, however, over the wisdom of the Committee sitting this coming Thursday morning, given the Government's complete lack of preparation to ensure that the Bill is discussed properly.
<P>
The Minister of State is laughing, but he knows that he and his colleagues will be presiding over a complete shambles. They have introduced a Bill that is radical and vague in its general shape and, so far, they have been unable to answer any of our persistent questions on the impact that it will have on industries and practices. I shall illustrate my argument by referring to the newspaper industry, which will be at the forefront of our deliberations. There was great excitement in the other place over the so-called Murdoch amendment. It is one of many industries on which the Bill could have a fundamental and radical impact. The Government are unable to tell us whether they wish that industry to change, what changes they would like to see and whether such changes will be delivered by the Bill. Until they can answer such questions, there is not much point in the Committee sitting as regularly as the Minister proposes.
<P>
The newspaper industry was previously investigated by the competition authorities in 1993. It was found that there were several complex monopolies in the industry. For example, News International has a scale monopoly and W. H. Smith and Son has a wholesale scale monopoly. The competition authorities found that both monopolies were in the public interest. The then Conservative Government agreed with that at the time, and the Conservative Opposition still agree with it. Ministers are not in a position to tell us how they think the Bill will affect those findings.



<P>
We were told by the President of the Board of Trade on Second Reading that the Bill is designed to be tougher than the outgoing legislation. However, she was unable to say whether that would mean that the News International scale monopoly or the W.H. Smith scale monopoly would be tipped over and be found to be against the public interest, despite the fact that the Conservative Government felt that it was in the public interest. I shall happily give way to the Minister of State if he wants to clarify that point; I might then be persuaded that we did need to meet quickly and frequently. I see that he is not prepared to answer such questions. That illustrates the problems that the Committee will face when trying to make progress.
<P>
The next finding that the 1993 report [Interruption.] Does the Minister of State wish for a private conversation, or does he wish to involve himself in the Committee's debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> While the Minister of State is considering what he might say and far be it from me to dissent at such an early stage from what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) is saying has it occurred to my right hon. Friend that a case can be made for the Committee meeting even more frequently, even though my right hon. Friend and I would find that somewhat difficult? If we were to meet more frequently, by constant repetition and by niggling away with the necessary unanswered questions, we might at last succeed in winkling out of the Minister of State exactly what his intentions are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is very virtuous and hard working, but a rather good cricket game is being played on Thursday. Nevertheless, were the Committee able to do serious business on Thursday, I should be the first to cross-examine the Minister.
<P>
The second important group of findings of the 1993 report was that the cover price system and the retail margins in the newspaper industry represented a complex monopoly. The Minister may remember those findings;
I trust that he is up to speed with them. The publishers recommend price, that price is reflected in a wholesaler agreement and that is then reflected by newsagents throughout the land in a uniform price for each newspaper. Although that price is only recommended, those recommendations have considerable force, so newspapers are therefore always sold at the recommended price.
<P>
That system was found to be a complex monopoly, but in 1993 it was not found to be against the public interest. To deal with the early clauses of the Bill, let alone subsequent clauses, we need to know whether the Government are happy with that finding. Can they guarantee that the new competition authority will not find that that complex monopoly operates against the public interest?
<P>
Perhaps the Minister of State wishes to see deeply discounted newspapers being sold by large supermarket chains that had taken advantage of the buying power that they could bring to bear if the rules were changed and
the existing arrangements were disrupted. Perhaps the Minister of State is more traditional and wants to defend the existing system of doorstep delivery of newspapers. If so, he needs to amend the Bill before the Committee considers it, to make absolutely sure that existing practices are not disrupted.
<P>
I see that the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), is shaking his head. Perhaps he will explain to the Committee how the newspaper pricing system will stand up under the Bill. Would he like me to give way? No, he has now decided that that, too, is a difficult problem. By not debating those matters today, he is demonstrating that the Government are not in a position to tackle the issues raised by the Bill.
<P>
Another finding of the 1993 report was that the wholesale arrangement represented a complex monopoly. The Minister of State may recall that the report found that the wholesaler's restriction on the supply of newspapers to some potential retail newsagents was against the public interest, and a modest attempt was made to remedy what the competition authorities saw as a drawback.
<P>
The Minister of State is sufficient of a politician to know that 25,000 independent retail newsagents are interested in what the Bill will do to their industry. They are worried about the future conduct of their industry under this general, radical but vague legislation, which is presided over by Ministers who have no wish to say anything about the industrial changes that they will unleash if the proposals go through.



<P>
I have had several meetings with newsagents and their representatives, to alert them to the dangers. Initially, they told me that the Bill was an excellent device for breaking the power of newspaper publishers and of wholesalers, a power that newsagents do not enjoy. I pointed out that, based on the evidence of the previous competition report, the Bill also threatens newsagents. According to the President of the Board of Trade, the new competition authority will be tougher than its predecessor. It may, therefore, insist on more retailers having supply of newspapers or that trading arrangements for the supply of newspapers should be changed, leading to bulk discounts for larger and more successful outlets.
<P>
The Bill would therefore do to retail newsagents what many hon. Members, both Labour and Conservative, fear that it will do to retail pharmacies. It could sound the death knell for many such small businesses, which not only provide important services but constitute centres in the local community. The village pharmacy and newsagent are important in the village community.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> I am closely following the logic of my right hon. Friend's argument. Since 1 May last year, has he received any letters from constituents in Wokingham complaining about the uncompetitive character of newspaper publishing, retailing or distribution, and arguing for a law to strengthen the industry's competitiveness?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I assure the Committee that we have not concerted before these exchanges. I have not received such a letter from a constituent. I receive many letters from all around the country in connection with my Department of Trade and Industry duties, but I have not received any letters that complain about anti-competitive practices in the newspaper industry, other than from the industry itself. There is a battle among different elements and interest groups of the industry, which are trying to see whether the Bill could nudge the industry in the direction that they would like, but fear that it might nudge it in a direction that few or none of them like, while plunging them into enormous uncertainty.
<P>
We know that several Labour Members feel uncertain and uneasy about the Bill. The Government Whip was bold to place on the Committee seven Labour Members who signed the early-day motion about retail pharmacies. That is further proof, if that were needed, that the Government do not know what to do about the vexed problem of retail pharmacies, as will be apparent after only a few sittings. In a later motion, the Government hope to defer consideration of clause 1, because it raises that issue. Presumably, the Government hope that Labour Back Benchers will acquiesce in the destruction of local pharmacies, undermining the principles in which they believed when they signed the EDM. Or perhaps the Government hope to conceive a new amendment that will provide some relief for retail pharmacies. [Interruption.] Again, I note that Ministers are too preoccupied to be involved in that crucial debate. Many retail pharmacies are waiting to discover what the Government intend, why the Government want to do so much damage to them and whether the Government have anything to offer by way of compensation to offset the damage that the legislation may cause.
<P>
The Bill is, therefore, a mess and a muddle in its impact on businesses such as retail pharmacies and newsagents. It is also a mess and muddle when it comes to fulfilling its stated aims of clarifying the relationship between British and European law and of ensuring that European law reigns supreme in these islands. Given that that aim was one of the primary purposes of the legislation, I should have thought that Ministers would have supervised that properly at least, thereby producing a Bill that got rid of all the British competition law, and replacing it with a new European-based law, firmly rooted in the principles of the old articles 85 and 86 soon to be renumbered in the much-loved on the Government Benches treaty of European Union.



<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
My worry, if anything like this Bill is passed, is that we shall end up with a complete mess, with people not knowing whether European or British jurisdiction reigns supreme. There will be an enormous overlap between what remains of British law the part of it not being repealed and that being imported through European jurisprudence.
<P>
I trust that the Minister of State will tell us why he wants to persevere with a complicated dual system. There will be some law from Brussels and some from the United Kingdom. Why, for example, keep the provisions on monopolies from the old legislation when there is clear anti-monopoly provision in one of the two new central treaty powers being incorporated directly into the Bill?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a curious structure to the Bill that applies directly to the question retaining the opportunity to investigate and act against scale monopoly powers, even though a prohibition has been introduced? If the Government genuinely believe that such a prohibition will be effective as a deterrent against the abuse of a dominant position, companies seeking guidance and which act appropriately under the prohibition should not face subsequent threat of divestment, and so on, by virtue of the scale monopoly investigation powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend immediately put his finger on one of the central problems of the proposed legislation, which Ministers still do not seem to have grasped; or, if they have done so, they are keeping quiet about it and are giving us no hint of a solution. The more I read the Bill, the more I think that the Government have stumbled into it unwittingly. They decided that it sounded radical and interesting to remodel competition law and felt that incorporating a lot more European law into British law was part of the Prime Minister's policy, placing Britain at the centre of a series of surrenders of our powers to make out own decisions in this Parliament. They thought that it went along with the social chapter decision that we should import our social and employment law from Brussels and they now wish to import a chunk of our competition law from Brussels.
<P>
Ministers then met with some sturdy and sensible resistance from competition officials in their own Department who realised that there were differences in British practice and that much of Britain's competition law had been developed, tried and tested, and had evolved, over many decades, which they felt it would be a pity to lose. Ministers were unable to insist that their first decision was the right one that the whole matter should be subcontracted to Brussels and to the superquango that they wish to set up, so we are left with this double jeopardy. Business will be the losers while Ministers collect their salaries and watch the mess that they have created.



<P>
One of the most objectionable features of the proposed legislation is the establishment of a superquango and Ministers refusal to answer any of the usual questions they would be expected to answer on the Floor of the House on Second Reading and in Committee. That is an argument in favour of giving Ministers more time to read through what they have come up with and to think through all the difficulties that are leaping up to hit them as they review the Bill's progress. Why are Ministers blundering on with a piece of legislation when all the interesting questions I am told in correspondence will be delegated to the Director General of Fair Trading? My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who led a marvellous team effort during the Committee stage of
the National Minimum Wage Bill, had to explain to the Committee and the House that it was most unusual to legislate on something as fundamental as the minium wage without the Government confiding in the House of Commons what the minimum wage should be, or who would benefit or be damaged by it. We were not even told the full scope of the national minimum wage-whether it applied to all young people, all trainees and so on.
<P>
We are now about to debate exactly the same style of legislation. What the national minimum wage did for wage demand and wage fixing in the industry, the Competition Bill will do for practically every other business practice. In introducing the Bill, the Government are saying to business people, "You must take this legislation seriously; you must review every business practice, every agreement, everything you have been doing and everything which the old competition authorities thought was perfectly reasonable. You are responsible for deciding whether you can carry on with your business or not. If you get it wrong, retrospectively, a super-powerful quango will come along, jemmy open your doors, raid your filing cabinets, take or xerox your documents, take you to court and, if it is successful, fine you 10 per cent. of your turnover, wiping out profits in a good year and taking you into loss in a bad one."	
<P>
Those are terrifying powers to give to anyone, but especially to a quango, which the President of the Board of Trade delights in telling us will be independent in much of its activity. That is a further sign that Ministers need to slow down, go back to the drawing board and think again about what are reasonable powers in a democracy. How much power should be given to quangos and how much should rest with accountable Ministers who can explain their actions and be cross-examined in the House of Commons?
<P>
The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs
is smiling he may well do so, because we know that he is much more interested in writing the questions than in writing the answers. That is his style and he is good at it. In government, some of his questions have attempted to close down proper scrutiny of the Government. I see that Government Back Benchers are now becoming interested in the Committee. I welcome that interest because they have an important job to do. It is their constituents and the businesses in their constituencies that will be equally damaged by the Bill. We look forward to hearing them, in their own way not siding with us putting their points to Ministers on matters about which we know businesses in their constituencies are very worried.
<P>
It would be foolish to press the issue of sitting on Thursday especially if the weather is fine and the cricket is good unless Ministers can promise us that they will answer our points. To summarise my brief intervention, if we relent over sitting this Thursday, will the Minister of State promise that by then he will be able to answer the problem of the collapse of the retail pharmacy under the impact of the proposed legislation? Will the Bill ban or change the practices of the newspaper industry in the way that many people fear it will? Will he tell us how he intends to avoid double jeopardy for businesses facing both a European and a British legal intervention?
<P>
Those are three simple questions. I could raise many more issues, but I do not wish to detain the Committee and we raised some of them on Second Reading. However, some of my hon. Friends may also have worries about Thursday.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> Good morning, Mr. Maxton, and what a pleasant morning it is. I hope not to delay the Committee too long with a few brief opening remarks.
<P>
This is an important Bill there can be no mistake about that. It gives us an opportunity to reform fundamentally competition policy in the United Kingdom probably for the first time in more than 20 years. We should keep that in mind as we deliberate on the Bill's finer detail because it is a major step in how we view competition in this country. It is an opportunity brought about by a requirement on us to incorporate European Union law into United Kingdom legislation under articles 85 and 86 of the treaty of Rome, as mentioned by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood).



<P>
That is a key aspect because we need to examine in detail the implications of incorporating in our legislation variations from European legislation and our intention to rely on European jurisprudence for many issues a matter of concern on Second Reading. I hope that we shall examine closely how we are expected to apply European jurisprudence to what happens in this country.
<P>
I welcome the concept of the Bill. The prohibition approach has much going for it when dealing with anti-competitive agreements, especially in multinational and European-wide trading. Such an approach must be considered when dealing with dominance, something that I hope the Bill will cover. There is a case for strengthening the investigative powers under the Bill, but we must consider how that will sit with the protection and preservation of the civil rights of individuals and companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Liberal Democrats support the idea of a power for a junior employee's household to be broken into by a competition official and for a filing cabinet to be raided, or does he think that that is going too far?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for mentioning that matter. We shall tease out the detail of that as it raises worries about our going far beyond the existing powers of authorities and what effect that will have on individuals. Do the Government think that that is an appropriate way forward? How will such activity be curtailed so that it preserves people's liberties? I am not satisfied that the Bill, as drafted, will do that.
<P>
The Bill has given us the first opportunity to examine competitive legislation for 20 years. It is likely that it will be in place for a further 20 years, so it is important to get it right. We must not end up with a measure that causes more problems than those that it solves. Specific issues must be addressed in detail.
<P>
I shall not repeat our debate on Second Reading, but it is important to bring to the forefront of our minds those issues that many hon. Members from all parties raised. As the Minister of State wound up the debate on Second Reading, he said that most, if not all, of the 23 speeches in the debate were of a high standard and contributed to the concept of how to examine competition policy. We must carry forward that body of expertise through the Committee stage, especially when discussing vertical agreements and how the Government intend to interpret exemptions in terms of block agreements.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham referred to retail price maintenance on over-the-counter medicines. Many Members of Parliament are deeply concerned about the impact of that measure not only on rural pharmacies, but on those that serve suburban communities. I do not want them to have to close because of the competition in the high street. It is not feasible for people living in the suburbs to travel to high-street chemists for their medicine. What is the Government's thinking about the future of local pharmacies?
<P>
We shall also have to consider in detail the way in which the Bill deals with exclusions of professional organisations. There is tremendous confusion in the Bill about the description of various associations, that for engineers being but one example. Many other professional organisations are worried about the way in which their activities have been described. I want the Bill to relate to the way in which professions carry on their practices in the United Kingdom. I do not want to rely on archaic legislation that does not deal with how professions operate today.



<P>
Genuine concerns have been expressed about the concurrent powers of the various regulatory bodies. Such matters will dictate competition in the essential services, on which we and all our constituents rely. It is not clear how those concurrent powers will work, or how the Director General of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission will operate once they are brought within the new organisation. The Minister of State and his team will have to provide details on that, so that the Committee can properly debate them.
<P>
<H5></H5>
</P>
11 am

<P>
Hon. Members will know, because they will have read the Bill in detail, about the great debate on the dominance of the newsprint industry, particularly of News International, but the matter goes far beyond that. We should be debating whether any organisation should be able to dominate the opinions put before the public over their breakfast tables. there is no control over the dominance of that position, which affects not only the commercial market but the availability of information to the public at large.
<P>
In a few short moments, I have set out our major concerns. As our debate proceeds, we shall raise others.
I hope that the Minister of State and his team will take our amendments seriously, but only time will tell. Through our amendments, we shall raise matters of genuine concern, probe and pave the way for new concepts. We want to improve the Bill, not destroy it.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I rise on this particularly pleasant morning to suggest that the Committee is debating an extremely important matter, and that we shall be sitting for a considerable time. I speak not only for the members of the Committee and for the officials and attendants who have to work with us, but for those listening to our proceedings. Although I am unable to see beyond the Bar of the Committee, it occurs to me that there may be considerable public interest in the Bill and that a number of people may want to gain access to the Room. I wonder whether you, Mr. Maxton, through your good offices, could arrange for the Committee to meet in a slightly larger Room?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Clerk and other officials have heard that point of order. My first comment to the Clerk when he arrived this morning was that this Room seems slightly small for such a Committee. Unfortunately, the Committee considering the Finance Bill is sitting next door in Room 10, the only larger Room. However, the point has been taken and I shall see what can be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to the sittings motion debate. I am still a relative novice in such matters, but I had the privilege of serving under your Chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, as a member of the Committee considering the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1998. I look forward to being under your chairmanship again, and that of your co-Chairman, Mr. Atkinson, who guided our deliberations of the National Minimum Wage Bill.
<P>
I recall that the Committee considering the National Minimum Wage Bill had some difficulty; it quickly became evident that the Government had not adequately thought through what they wanted to achieve. In one instance it was to do with the armed forces the Minister of State was embarrassed at having to bring forward new clauses to entirely reverse what the Government were setting out to do. The Government will probably change tack several times on the Competition Bill.
<P>
The Government nevertheless want to leap ahead the Bill, despite the fact that Ministers admitted on Second Reading that some substantial technical issues remained to be resolved, such as the full extent of exemptions for vertical agreements. The Minister made it clear on Second Reading that that remans a subject of discussion with the Confederation of British Industry and other interested partners. The extent of exemptions for vertical agreements will be important in our consideration of the Bill's impact and of chapter I prohibition. It would be a retrograde step for us to proceed through those clauses before we know what agreement had been reached.



<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Has my hon. Friend received any intimation from Ministers of thinking about vertical agreements? Unless we solve the problem soon, it will be difficult to progress, because so many industrial issues are characterised by vertical agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On Second Reading, I argued that some block exemptions for vertical agreements were necessary for chapter I prohibition to work effectively. Ministers have made it clear that they believe that vertical agreements will not necessarily be anti-competitive and will be largely beneficial. The structure of the Bill shows that block exemptions that apply under European law will apply under United Kingdom law, meaning parallel exemptions. Nevertheless, an anti-competitive prohibition would apply to a range of vertical agreements unless they were the subject of exemptions. We do not yet know what those exemptions will be. If we are to proceed with such wide-ranging competitive legislation, we need to understand at the outset how it will affect industry. Such understanding was missing on Second Reading. Ministers pointed to the Committee, as though such matters would suddenly and magically become clear. Ministers argue that the Bill will somehow make competition tougher. Whom will it bite? In what circumstances? In relation to what mischief? What mischief will be remedied by such Government activity?
<P>
I am worried about the speed with which the Government propose to start consideration. My right hon. Friend mentioned Thursday morning's sitting; by extension, we can assume that the Government propose that we meet immediately after the Whitsum recess on Tuesdays and Thursdays, without an assurance that Ministers will resolve the drafting problems.
<P>
I am reminded of a survey conducted in late March, when the current draft of the Bill was available, and published in the latest issue of Global Competition Review, which canvassed 95 top competition lawyers and economists. Of those competition lawyers, 58 per cent. were not satisfied that the Bill as drafted will achieve sufficient clarity and legal certainty. That is exactly what we are here to achieve. I intend not to analyse the Bill's principles as we did on Second Reading, but to try to improve the Bill's drafting and legal certainty.
<P>
Competition lawyers anticipated many problems. For example, we do not know to what extend the Office of Fair Trading will have the necessary resources to deal with industry's requests for precautionary notifications. We do not know to what extend and in what circumstances the OFT proposes to use the onerous powers to which my right hon. Friend referred. We have insufficient information about how concurrent powers will be used by utility regulators and about the mechanisms proposed if the Government proceed in that regrettable way to try to ensure consistency in the concurrent exercise of powers by separate competition authorities.



<P>
We have not seen the extent to which the Director General of Fair Trading, in his master guide I understand that it was produced on 20 March will ensure legal certainty at a relatively early point by accepting the opportunity to make early decisions rather than offering comfort letters, which is the mechanism he appears to prefer. I realise that that mechanism is simple and leaves greater flexibility for the director general, but it might be counterproductive for industry to receive comfort rather than certainty from the Office of Fair Trading. Industry will be left uncertain about how subsequent decisions may be made and how investigations might proceed.
<P>
There is a range of problems, the greatest of which relates to the system of financial penalties outlined in the Bill. Companies are at risk of a penalty of up to 10 per cent. of their turnover if they undertake prohibited activities, yet the Bill gives no information on how that penalty is to be applied to any scale of behaviour. The Bill merely says that the director general will issue guidance about penalties and the exercise of the power to impose penalties, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State but with no recourse to Parliament. Therefore, it is all the more encumbent on us to make clear the general principles being proposed by the OFT.
<P>
There are many examples in the Bill of the Government not having done their homework or sorted out the drafting. I have limited knowledge of competition matters as I am not a competition lawyer, but if competitions lawyers are not satisfied
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that Ministers have even read the OFT draft on how it intends to treat matters? The OFT makes it clear that there will be double jeopardy. It says that companies cannot be guaranteed that a comfort letter from one authority will suffice to meet the requirements of the other authority. It even says that in certain cases there would need to be dual notification to both Brussels and the British authorities. I thought that Ministers had stated clearly in their consultation documents and in their statements in the House that getting rid of double jeopardy and harmonising the procedure were important. Does my hon. Friend think that Ministers have not read all the relevant material, which shows that the quango is already doing the opposite of what they intended?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> When I was a private secretary in the Department of Trade and Industry, my Ministers always read everything. Now, it is the fashion for Ministers to, as they put it, look at the big picture but not get too fussed about the detail.
<P>
As we proceed in Committee we will find that there is a great deal of detail. I shall be charitable and say that in our discussions on the National Minimum Wage Bill, the Minister of State was at least better equipped for the debate than his Back Benchers, whose speeches showed that they had not bothered to read the Bill. I hope that on this Bill Labour Members will not simply say, "We must make progress and get the Bill through. It's all about achieving our manifesto commitment as quickly as we can."	
<P>
We are dealing with a Bill that has been a long time in gestation. Conservative Members well understand that some aspects of the Bill were the subject of consultation by the Conservative Government all the way back to 1989 and up to as recently as August 1996. Draft legislation was the subject of consultation not legislation that conformed to this Bill, but there was a presumption that article 85 prohibition could be introduced into United Kingdom legislation if done in the right way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</b> One reason why the Conservative Government did not go ahead with legislation between 1989 and 1997 was that we were never able to answer satisfactorily all the questions we are now putting to Ministers and it appears that they have not been able to answer them either. We decided that it was best not to put shambolic legislation before the House, but instead to continue to consult to try to find a way to solve the problems. Labour Ministers just blunder on.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an important point. I agree with it not least because I made a brief reference to it on Second Reading.
<P>
I accept that there are some difficult aspects of current legislation, such as that relating to the notification of agreements. Before the election, Ministers took the simple view and said, "We desire to be different."	 Because the Conservative Government did not introduce legislation, and because industry said it was time to update competition legislation and revise some of the difficult aspects of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, the Labour Government said, "We will do it rapidly"	. In their desire to be Europhoric, they said they would bring in article 85 prohibition. They are now finding out why it is extremely difficult to introduce such legislation. Many questions remain unanswered even on chapter I prohibition. Ministers will find that the difficulties that arise from the application of chapter II prohibition will be even greater.
<P>
Ministers should think carefully before they proceed at the proposed pace. They gave themselves a great deal of time between the point at which the Bill came out of the other place and the point at which they felt perhaps inaccurately prepared for Second Reading. They are now trying to push on with the Committee stage while hoping that the director general and his master guidance will see them out of their difficulties, provided that the Bill is essentially enabling rather than detailed.
<P>
With such major competition legislation, the Committee needs clearly to set out Parliament's intentions. That might better inform the director general's guidance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin ((West Dorset):</B> I had not intended to speak in this debate. I had thought that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham would make the strongest possible observations about the Committee's sittings. I had thought that either he or my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) would have illustrated all the possible angles. Instead, I was amazed that my right hon. Friend was almost absurdly timorous and gentle. He seemed to suggest that a delay until after Whitsun would do the trick. I do not think that even the issues raised so far by my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend could be dealt with properly by Ministers in such a short time.
<P>
The appropriate action for the Government would be to delay the Committee stage of the Bill by about two years. That would give time to do the necessary work. I say this in a constructive spirit [Interruption. I do say it in a constructive spirit, because if we do otherwise this Committee's successors, whether under this regime or another, will be burdened for reasons I am about to expose with the dire necessity to repeat the entire performance with a competition reform Bill
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: A new Competition Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes a new Bill to remedy the deficiencies that will have been enacted as a result of this Committee not being able to make proper judgments. I am speaking as much on behalf of the Minister of State as for any other member of the Committee. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's diary is full and his workload heavy. He is known to be extremely conscientious. On some occasions, I have seen him at the end of the day looking as tired as a human being can stand. It is in defence of his interest, those of the Government and good legislation that there should be an adequate delay.



<P>
I draw attention to the compliance cost assessment, something that I am sure members of the Committee have already studied in detail. It is important for us to understand how the Bill will affect men and women conducting ordinary business throughout the United Kingdom and the costs that it will entail for them. That is a matter of direct and practical importance to hundreds of thousands of businesses, especially small businesses. It is difficult for us to judge how to amend the Bill to solve the problem of excessive costs if the compliance cost assessment is not a sufficient basis on which to make that judgment.
<P>
Unless there is a printing error, the report on the compliance cost assessment is only five lines long. It is different from an earlier version, but without any explanation. The estimate ranges between a reduction of £2.2 million and an increase of £4 million in recurring costs. The House was not told on Second Reading, nor has it been told to date, on what basis that was calculated. I cannot imagine that the Committee will take such figures seriously, especially given the absence of any powerful analysis.
<P>
Early in our consideration we will debate a provision for the Director General of Fair Trading possibly to issue guidance to those who want to discover retrospectively whether the agreements that they have signed are legal. We must remember that a penalty for a company that makes a mistake even an honest mistake may be sufficiently great to drive it out of business. Under those circumstances, there will be a need for extensive legal investigation. We are in highly uncharted territory, so we have no precedent on which to rely. The Committee will not be able to look back to previous actions by the director general or other competition authorities to guide their view chapter I prohibitions. it is different from the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976.
<P>
Small companies such as newsagents, pharmacies or those that are struggling to survive, may fail to obtain guidance. The director general may not want to provide it; he does not have to do so. Even, if he does want to do so, he may not be able to because of the flood of requests that we anticipate. After enactment of the Bill, an agreement that was ex post judged to have been improper would be sufficient to lose a business 10 per cent. of its turnover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Up to 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, up to 10 per cent. That will result in a flood of requests for guidance. I doubt whether the director general will be able to produce timely answers. As was said on Second Reading the Committee will doubtless discuss the matter in great detail firms will be driven to seek expert legal guidance.
<P>
The laws of supply and demand apply to some degree even in the legal profession. Competition lawyers will have a field day when they realise that, so I fear that charges for expert advice will tend to rise. More to the point, even without their rising one iota they are extreme. I doubt whether the average local conveyancing solicitor in Dorchester in my constituency, however excellent he may be in the normal domain that he traverses, would wish to offer advice on competition. Certainly his professional negligence insurance rates would rise significantly if he were to offer such advice without asking counsel's opinion.



<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Characteristically, I am being very moderate. I find my hon. Friend's argument for a two-year delay quite attractive, but he must remember that the House has already voted in principle for this legislation. That is why we urge Ministers to come up with something a little more effective and timely.
<P>
My hon. Friend is particularly persuasive on the matter of costs. He will, I am sure, have noticed that the Government believe that the one-off costs of the Bill will be between £2.6 million and £4.4 million. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has any recent experience of lawyers' bills, but I wonder how many lawyers he thinks could be hired for that sum by the whole of British industry. Is he aware of the huge number of agreements and contracts that a complicated multinational business in Britain would have to put to its lawyers for examination before it could be sure that its business was operating legally under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is right that when one considers the costs that will be entailed by the larger complex business, those figures, which are already highly dubious, become risible. Unless some profound analysis, not yet disclosed, has been made of how to reduce the costs of the existing system, it is the only possible avenue that I can think of.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to my right hon. Friend's comment, has my hon. Friend considered the implications of the director general giving a ruling in a definitive case? That might surprise some of the lawyers who had previously given advice, because it would then be necessary to reappraise existing agreements in the light of that ruling, which would give rise to a further round of costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I shall not bore the Committee by doing so, but if we were to rehearse the full panoply of difficulties that firms large and small are likely to encounter in trying to clarify their position vis-a¡-vis a web often a tangled and complex web of agreements, let alone the chapter II prohibitions, we would discover that the figures were not even the beginning of the story. I am not referring to a 50 per cent. or 100 per cent. difference; that would not worry the Committee and I cannot imagine that it would change our judgment on the Bill. However, if the figures were orders of magnitude wrong, which may be the case, it would have a profound impact on our clause-by-clause analysis of the Bill.
<P>
We need to understand the costs and benefits. That is the very purpose of a compliance cost assessment. The Cabinet Office rule is that compliance cost assessments should be as wide as possible, so that Committees can properly consider the costs and the benefits. We expect the Government to argue for the benefits on particular clauses; we need to know about the costs. The costs are not explained honestly and dispassionately, in a way that an ordinary layman could conceivably understand; nor have we been provided with an analysis.
<P>
It is impossible for the Committee to consider such a large number of questions in a constructive and sensible manner. I fear that it could force us into using amendments as a sledgehammer to crack a nut, when nutcrackers could be used if only we knew the size of the nut to be cracked. That is just one example of the Government having brought forward the Bill with insufficient preparation, which is likely to lead the Committee into error. That is why I said earlier that
I speak in a genuinely constructive mode.
<P>
I take the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham that Second Reading gave the Government authority to proceed with the Bill. I shall not argue against that because there is no point in doing so.
<P>
A Second Reading does not prevent the Government from subsequently having to amend wholesale legislation that has not been properly considered in Committee.
I refer not only to the matter of compliance cost assessment, to which I drew attention, but to the detailed guidance that we seek from the OFT. They are strong reasons why the Committee should not proceed with its examination of the Bill clause by clause until we have the means with which to resolve whether an amendment is required.



<P>
<H5></H5>
</P>
11.30 am

<P>
This is a quite exceptional circumstance. My previous experience in Committee extends only to the Social Security Bill. From time to time there was a lack of specific regulations, about which we complained, but by and large the Bill has been properly prepared. Perhaps it benefited from the fact that it had been heavily prepared by the previous Administration and only modified somewhat by the new Government. We could identify changes that were necessary, and Ministers were helpful in enabling us to do so.
<P>
With this Bill, my right hon. and hon. Friends have exposed a number of issues, including compliance cost assessment, where we have not been given the tools to do the job. I suppose that the Minister of State thinks that this is merely an amusing diversion, but he would be wise to break with precedent and to take if not the two-year break I recommended, at least a longer one than that suggested by my right hon. Friend, to ensure that the Committee has everything that it needs.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief, but it is clear that however we frame it, we shall need a lot of time to consider these complex matters. I am perhaps a little more relaxed than some of my colleagues as to how we proceed, but I share their concern that we should find time during our deliberations to debate fully and to get to the bottom of these matters.
<P>
It will be in the memory of a number of familiar faces in the Committee that we met previously when considering the National Minimum Wage Bill, often at some length and even, on occasion, at some inconvenience. I am pleased to welcome back the Minister of State and the other familiar suspects from that Bill, including some of my hon. Friends. The nature of the work of the Committee of Selection is that there are always accessions and retirements on these occasions.
I am delighted to welcome you to our proceedings,
Mr. Maxton, to join Mr. Atkinson, with whom we are familiar. On my own Benches, I welcome my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster
(Mr. Brooke) and my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), who has already made such a lapidary contribution. We shall benefit greatly from their consideration of these matters and their acuity.
<P>
It might be convenient if I were to draw some thoughts together on similarities with our consideration of the National Minium Wage Bill and, possibly one or two points of difference. The way in which the Government are dealing with this matter, which is one of their be setting sins, is similar to the way in which the National Minimum Wage Bill was debated, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham has already said. There is the same systematic lack of clarity of their intentions, which can be described only as a deliberate opacity or reluctance to level with their thinking until it is too late to amend their thinking or even to test what is happening.
<P>
Those of us with experience in government know that it is a complicated business. Amendments are tabled and second and third thoughts are discussed between Ministers and officials. It is still a little difficult to see that Ministers have even reached first base in answering some of the basic questions that anyone who has engaged himself in competition law could have posed. It is very far from clear that we shall have the answer to such questions by the end of our consideration unless it is reasonably protracted, which was par for the course for the National Minimum Wage Bill. Since we considered the Bill, matters have been hanging fire for two months in another place. We will not know for a further week or two even the basic building blocks from which the national minimum wage will be constructed through, for example, the work and recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. The same, almost deliberate, reluctance to engage with legislative detail is now apparent. There seems to be a belief that it is somehow possible to have Hamlet without the prince, and that it is not necessary to know how the legislation will work.



<P>
The second similarity is the Government's belief, which has perhaps been tempered by long periods in opposition, that the right way to legislate is to produce an overall framework. I like the word in German, because it sounds well Gesamptkonzept. An overall construct is created, which is chipped away to create exceptions. That did not really happen with the national minimum wage because the Government set their face against a generous programme of exemptions, even when we exposed the difficulties. Except in the case of the armed forces, on which the Minister was forced to wave the white flag and concede defeat, the Government stuck to the principle of universal application. We do not know whether they will do so in this case. They have shown some sympathy with vertical agreements in some cases and a readiness to consider block exemptions, apart from those read across from European legislation. However, we do not know to what extent, or on what basis, those will be applied. We must try to tease that out. If we do not succeed, it will nevertheless emerge from subsequent statements or guidance from the OFT or case work, which is not as good as consideration in Committee.
<P>

<P>
<P>
A third similarity is the question of penalties. The Government's at least superficial conversion to a business philosophy is a political requirement. They need to show the zeal of the convert and that they really do believe in competition, so they set out the proposal in an especially rigorous way and provide a schedule of terrifying penalties. It is freely admitted that some of those are ad terrorem rather than necessarily the ones that will be applied. We will not know until the event to whom and to what extent they will be applied. If they are applied up to the hilt, they will destroy some businesses. We are worried about the nature of the new penalties for actions that were previously regarded as relatively innocuous and about how information can be obtained by officers in order to pursue inquiries.
<P>
Those concepts are very much of a piece with what the Government proposed in their National Minimum Wage Bill. However, when they are applied to competition, the Government encounter realities. Conservative Members believe in examining the stage that we have reached, trying to make the best of what we have and considering whether an obvious ill needs to be remedied.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons (Rochdale):</B> We have previously served together on a Committee. You talked about highlighting the differences. I note that two Conservative Front Benchers are present. Knowing well your Europhile views, I wonder whether you are here to represent the two camps of the Conservative party, highlighting the differences between the Eurosceptic and the Europhile view of competition policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Leaving aside the minor infelicity of I was about to say my hon. Friend's that intervention in attempting to destabilise me, the hon. Lady accidentally referred to the Chairman. I share the views of the Conservative party on Europe, as I am sure does my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. We may at some stage have to discuss the retail tobacco industry, and there is not a fag paper between him and me on Europe or on the Bill.



<P>
All industries are different. They have various problems and may need a different solution or approach to deal with them. That does not need the Minister of State in his size 10s, or the President of the Board of Trade in her smaller size of boots, to make decisions, nor does it mean that the Director General of Fair Trading must clump in and try to find one solution for each industry. The matter is complicated. I refer to two cases of vertical agreements that are different from each other, one of which is petroleum retailing. The OFT produced a report yesterday. I shall not give an instant, definitive response to each item in that report, except to say that its production was delayed because the matter is so complicated.
<P>

<P>
<P>
The position of major petrol retailers, their sites and the people who buy from them and the purchases of petrol by supermarkets, is different from that of the brewing industry, where licensing is for sale and which has a different structure and different strengths. To put industries into a single framework and to set the rules retrospectively is difficult. It may end in tears and it is the job of the Committee to ensure that it does not.
<P>
I am sure that Labour Back Benchers are interested in retail pharmacies, the structure of which provides a service. Community pharmacies, both suburban and rural, are available widely throughout the country. That is not likely to continue if the present arrangements for retail price maintenance are lifted. That has caused concern on both sides of the Committee and it is proper that we should ask, "Where are we? Is the arrangement satisfactory? If we alter it, will it continue to be satisfactory?"	 That is a commonsense approach and one that could be applied to the newspaper industry. Whatever view one may take of allegations of predatory pricing, there are many high-quality newspapers under the present structure. I do not necessarily read them all, but such availability and liveliness is welcome. Other countries do not have the same choice or penetration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The United kingdom is unique in that it has so many high-quality newspapers covering a breadth of opinion? Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that, through a dominance in the market, there could be centralised administration, management and distribution of those newspapers? In future years, we shall be denying the wide range of opinion that is so important to our democratic process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is exactly what should be discussed properly in Committee. We must study it coolly and dispassionately. We must examine what the ill is, or what it might be and how sensible it would be to deal with it. That would not be better done by a prior judgment, but it would be proper to examine the industry. The Government might think that it has a new balance. Given what the President of the Board of Trade said on Second Reading, the Government do not believe that there is a problem in the newspaper industry. However, we should debate the matter further.
<P>
I emphasise the importance of careful consideration, whatever the sittings of the Committee. The difference between this Bill and the National Minimum Wage Bill is that the Government and Labour Back Benchers strongly agreed on the politics of the latter. It was a central manifesto pledge, which we had to respect even if we disagreed with it, and that may have given it a certain political imperative.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>





<P>
I suggested that the Government have a political need to deliver on competition, to show how business-minded and competition-minded they are. However, in a whole mass of real-world situations, the business community will be telling the Government that things must be got right. It would be easy to move from stability and relative success to a situation where problems could be created. That might happen in the newspaper industry, and it could happen for retail pharmacies. It will certainly happen ex poste for a variety of arrangements that the Committee has not yet considered, but which may be of concern to particular industries.
<P>
Labour Back Benchers have a duty. We are not tempting them into ways that will lead only to disillusionment and the wilderness. if they want to make great speeches, explain to Ministers the errors of their ways, we shall be delighted. I give them one piece of advice: there is nothing wrong with having a quiet word in the right ears. They could tell Government Whips or Ministers that certain matters need a little more consideration, that they do not want viable industries to be destroyed on the back of a piece of ideology and that the Government should be sensitive to the concerns expressed in Committee. They do not have to tell us. Unless they feel brave, they do not even have to express their views in pubic.
<P>
My experience as a Minister was that what goes on in Committee was done according to what I call the iceberg theory a little bit happening on the surface and a great deal beneath. I give the Minister of State one piece of advice; he should think long and hard about what is put to him when we come to the substance of the Bill. He should tease information from his officials and ask them the questions that he may be reluctant to answer in Committee.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, we come back to a common understanding, at least on paper. We are all interested in competition, and competition is part of competitiveness, but the Bill has to be sensibly framed and put together. Above all, we do not want negative, unanticipated consequences resulting form something that was set out with the best of intentions.
<P>
It is on that point that the Competition Bill is radically different from the National Minimum Wage Bill, because the Committee needs both a political commitment to competition and the readiness to worry away at the details and get them right. Some of the issues involve the future of whole industries. It is, therefore, particularly important that we give the Bill our full consideration and that we do not rush our fences.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham has already mentioned the propensity of Ministers to say that they do not need to read their boxes, only to look at the big picture. I do not wish to malign anyone or to be invidious, but I strongly suspect that the Minister of State reads his boxes in full. I hope that he does. In considering the Bill, I hope that all members of the Committee
will bear in mind the big picture the Bill affects every business in the country and therefore every employee and the need to get the detail right, so that we avoid stumbling from good intentions into bad execution and later recrimination.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> It is a greater pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. I suspect that, more properly, I should have preceded him, but as it is now almost 20 years since I last served as a Opposition Back Bencher on a Standing Committee, I apologise to him if I am a little rusty on questions of rank.
<P>
I have never before been under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton. I have often told my children that they should try to participate in every experience that life has to offer. For that reason, I am delighted to be in Committee under your chairmanship and I look forward to our proceedings.



<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham referred earlier to cricket. This morning's proceedings are much like the opening overs in a county match. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor),
I cannot see beyond the Bar but I sense that the size of the crowd that has gathered to watch us is about the same as the crowd at a minor county match in mid-May. I concur with my right hon. and hon. Friends that we should delay the Committee stage but, given the Government's majority, I support the sittings motion and am content to sit in Committee at 10.30 in the morning and at 4.30 in the afternoon. I would be content if we were to sit at 4.30 in the morning as well as at 10.30 in the evening because of what we have to discuss.
<P>
On Second Reading, the President of the Board of Trade and the hon. Members for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) and for Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East (Dr. Kumar) teased the Opposition and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham about the fact that we had not legislated on competition during the past 10 years. I think that we have too much legislation and, during the previous Administration, I thought that I was the only person who took that view. However, I am sorry that the Government, in absorbing the whole of the Conservative party's philosophy, its policies and programme, should have become infected by the desire for massive legislation.
<P>
If we must discuss the Bill, I fellow my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and hope that we shall receive many contribution from the Government Benches.
I served as the Government Whip in the proceedings on the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It had exactly the same pedigree as the Bill that we are discussing today in that the previous Government had chosen not to legislated on such matters and we had to pick up on a subject that had not been previously discussed. A pleasure of that legislation's proceedings was that all the Back Benchers, Ministers and the Opposition Members, except the Whip who fortunately did not have to contribute to the debate, where experts on the subject. The Act benefited enormously from the fact that everyone joined in the deliberations to ensure that it was improved. I hope that that will be the case with this Bill.
<P>
My enthusiasm for a wall-to-wall sitting is because that will provide adequate opportunity for Labour Members to contribute to the debate. I heard the speeches that were made on Second Reading and I have read the biographies of members of the Committee. I note that the hon. Members for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush
(Mr. Soley), for North Durham (Mr. Radice) and for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), who supported Lord McNally's amendment, are not members of the Committee. They focused on a narrow issue and we are benefiting enormously in Committee from a range of expert opinion on the Government's Benches.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who is a member of the Committee, spoke on Lord McNally's amendment on Second Reading and said that he was on the Government's side. I have a further reason to be glad that he is a member of the Committee which is why, like my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, I hope that there will be many contributions from the Labour party. In its wisdom, the Boundary Commission gave me an employed population in my constituency to look after of 750,000. The average employed population in the average-sized constituency is 37,500. I have the privilege of looking after 20 times as many employed people as my average colleague on either side of the House. That is one and a half times the total number of people employed in Northern Ireland, and I suspect that it may be larger than the employed population of all the constituencies that are represented on the Government side of the Committee. I have doubled-checked my figures with the experience in London. I look after 22 per cent. of the employed population of Greater London, and my 73 parliamentary colleagues in Greater London are good enough to look after the other 78 per cent., which gives them a little over one per cent. each.



<P>
The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford is the only other London Member who serves on the Committee, and I am extremely glad that he is here. I hope that all members of the Opposition, given the burden of legal costs which the legislation will throw on to employers in their constituencies I remind them that I will represent more than most will contribute to make sure that those costs are reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Will my right hon. Friend remind the Committee, drawing on his enormous experience in opposition and in government over the years, whether in the pre-pager era Government Back Benchers represented their constituents and put their points to Ministers? Some Opposition Members are rather hazy about what used to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My right hon. Friend forgets how old I am, and I am not completely familiar with the new technology. I did not realise that it enabled people to adopt a universal view. I hope that we can continue to be individuals.
<P>
Given what the Bill will do to employers I do not argue for the vices of competition policy, as expressed in the Bill and the legal costs that will be imposed, I hope that Opposition members will defend the interests of their constituents, in the way that we shall be seeking to defend the interests of the nation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I say first to hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition Benches it is a male-only domain that it is the Government's intention to have full and frank exchanges on all the clauses and schedules. It has been made clear from the outset, by the public consultation that took place, as well as the specific consultation with a range of stakeholders, including those involved in consumer issues, the law, and those representing interests in different sectors of the economy, that the whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that modern arrangements will be in place to end anti-competitive behaviour and give people who suffer from it the opportunity to have remedies.
<P>
We also made it clear, as the Bill passed through another place, that we would be prepared to and did on occasions accept amendments that would improve the Bill. We have also resisted amendments that did not improve the Bill; and we will deal in this Committee with the matters where our resistance was unsuccessful. As a matter of principle, we will, if hon. Members table proposals which do not damage the concept of the Bill, consider those proposals. That is how we intend to run the Committee. The raison d'e√tre of the Committee stage of the Bill will be to ensure that, at the end, we have an even more effective piece of legislation.
<P>
I hope that representatives of British industry were not listening to this morning's debate. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) said that he and his colleagues approach the Bill positively, and he indicated clearly some of the areas that are of concern. That was the correct approach. It ill-behoves the shadow Secretary of State, on Second Reading and since, to criticise the Government for taking too much time over the Bill. He has written to the President of the Board of Trade on numerous occasions trying to force her hand, to come forward with effective proposals and not to dilly-dally.
<P>
Between 11 May and today, the right hon. Member for Wokingham has made another U-turn. We put forward a timetable for consideration of the Bill in consultation with the hon. Member for Solihull. The Government did not wish to pressurise the Committee: they consulted the Opposition on the best way forward. As I understand it, the hon. Member for Solihull, on behalf of the official Opposition, agreed with the timetable. Obviously, there is a split in the Opposition: the right hon. Member suddenly wants to go to the cricket on Thursday. This man wants to be taken seriously by British industry and by consumer organisations, and he whinges about having to sit here on Thursday and do his job. I remember another Conservative Member the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) who thought that England was all about warm beer and cricket. The right hon. Gentleman obviously agrees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Minister is being unfair and silly. If the Minister can answer my questions on Thursday, I would far rather be in this Committee than watching a great cricket match, but if he cannot, there is no point in any of us being here.
<P>
I am delighted by the Minister's offer. He says that there may be areas in which the Bill can be improved, and that he will welcome contributions from both sides of the Committee. Which does he think are the weakest areas of the Bill, so that we can help him to find the right amendments to improve the legislation?



<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney: </b>One makes an offer to the right hon. Gentleman and he gets even sillier. It is interesting to note why the right hon. Gentleman does not want to come here on Thursday: he has failed abysmally in his job. Where are the amendments from Conservative Members? The hon. member for Eastleigh, with even fewer resources than the right hon. Gentleman has tabled a range of amendments across the spectrum of the Bill, and will no doubt table others. The right hon. Gentleman huffs and puffs, but he has not done his homework. He does not want to return here on Thursday because he has not tabled any amendments to the clauses that we are likely to reach on Thursday. That is why he and his right hon. and hon. Friends are desperate for the Committee not to consider the Bill.</B><P>
<P>
I could help the right hon. Gentleman out of this hole by saying that we will sit all through the night and all Wednesday and clock off at about lunchtime on Thursday. Will that help him with his cricket match? It may be better if, instead of whingeing about my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade, the right hon. Gentleman came here to do some hard graft and table some proposals that the Committee can consider.

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Ministers is not entering into this in the right spirit. If he looks at the blue amendment paper, he will see 19 amendments tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends, and three amendments tabled in the names of Liberal Democrat Members. We have worked hard on the Bill, and we are ready to deliver for British industry. It is the Minister who is not ready to deliver, because he has been unable to answer one of the questions that I have posed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let the Minister respond first.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I am rather popular at the moment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham is squirming again. He came to Committee this morning with an argument against the sittings motion: his clear premise was that he and his colleagues did not want to discuss the Bill on Thursday, or to see progress on the Bill. Indeed, some Conservative members have suggested that the Bill should be postponed for some time one even suggested a couple of years to give the right hon. Gentleman the opportunity to do his job properly. The right hon. Gentleman has been sussed out: he is doing a part-time job, and not doing it very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I apologise for my enthusiasm in speaking before the Minister had a chance to reply to the right hon. Member for Wokingham. I thank him for his earlier remarks, but his praise for my efforts may spell the end of my parliamentary career rather earlier than I had hoped. Does the Minister agree that, like most other things in life, it is not the number of amendments but the quality that counts? Has he examined the amendments that have been tabled and made an assessment of which are in the category of probing, which are paving and which are destructive amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that his career will not fail if he sticks close to me.



<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right: I use the red box regularly. All amendments reach my desk as soon as possible. Some amendments are clearly probing; some may be wrecking amendments. I make no complaint about that. Hon. Members can put their case and play their game. As a matter of principle, we will give proper consideration to amendments from any quarter. That is a genuine offer to hon. Members, as they will appreciate from their experience of me when considering the National Minimum Wage Bill. I shall behave in the same way on this Bill.
<P>
<B> <p5>Mr. Redwood rose</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is trying hard to finish this matter before Thursday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's new spirit; he keeps changing his mind about whether he wants to be decent. He has studied the 22 amendments that we have tabled. Which does he like?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The right hon. Gentleman will have to wait until we reach those amendments. Perhaps he could even turn up on Thursday for a short period. We could then discuss some of them, depending on how we proceed. I want to make it absolutely clear that throughout the course of the Bill there will be an open dialogue between my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and me. I cannot make it any clearer or fairer.
<P>
During his rather lengthy excuse for not being able to attend the Committee on Thursday, the right hon. Gentleman asked a question that did not relate to any clauses in or amendments to the Bill it was about figures for business closures among retail newsagents. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents said that there was a total of 2,931 business closures among its members during the period 1992-96 when the right hon. Gentleman was in government, representing its interests. The right hon. Gentleman skated over the fact that the federation has lost so many members.
<P>
The Government are trying to do something that the previous Government did not do, and refused to do construct a legislative framework to provide effective opportunities for people who believe that they are treated unfairly through anti-competitive activities, including the practices of cartels. the National Federation of Retail Newsagents broadly supports the Bill as a unique opportunity to end the unfairness of Britain's current legalistic approach, in which the letter of the law impedes its fair application. The right hon. Gentleman tries to use that organisation to argue his case against the Bill. He is clearly not au fait with the organisation's general view: it supports the Bill. It does not oppose the Bill because the Government are offering its members an opportunity to deal with their serious complaints, which the right hon. Gentleman failed to do when he was in the Cabinet. It is nonsense for the right hon. Gentleman to argue that the Government are failing in their responsibilities towards small and medium enterprises. We must proceed with the Bill now with undue haste, but at a good pace, to ensure that we place the new arrangements on the statute book.
<P>
Despite what the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said, the broad concept of the Bill has the overwhelming support of the legal profession, of industry and industrial and consumer organisations. That is clear from the DTI's relationship with those organisations, from responses that we have received to the public consultation and from letters since the consultation's to hon. Members and those in another place, that show support for the concept and principles of the Bill. Even organisations that do not wholeheartedly support all the proposals favour the concept and principles presented in the Bill and offer positive ideas for improving it. The Government have responded to many of those organisations. It is pointless for Opposition Members to attempt to suggest that the process is ineffective. It is a long overdue process, and the Government intend to make sure that by the end of the parliamentary Session we shall have in place laws that are less bureaucratic and cumbersome and more effective. There will be penalties and redress for the companies that suffer from anti-competitive behaviour and the activities of some cartels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If the Minister has moved on to the train of efficiency and ease of application, will he comment on our questions about compliance cost assessment and assure the Committee that he will either expose the analysis that has led the Government to those figures or substantially revise the estimate in line with some agreed figures?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have no doubt that when we get to that issue we shall debate it. The Government have been open and honest in the assessment, which is based on criteria. It was fully debated in another place, and we shall no doubt debate it here. The purpose of the process is to safeguard British industry and commerce from the adverse costs of anti-competitive behaviour. The savings in costs from dealing effectively with Cartels or anti-competitive activity will safeguard British industry by saving it huge sums of money. However, not only money is at issue. Enterprises will be saved from being driven out of business, as has happened in the past few years when we did not have the power to deal effectively with the activities of such companies. Legitimate businesses, such as transport companies, were made ineffective and forced out. The powers in the Bill will allow the Director General of Fair Trading to deal with such matters.



<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am doubly grateful to the Minister for his courtesy in giving way again. I think that he may have offered the Committee something of great value. Has he offered to produce not merely an analysis of how the Government arrived at the compliance cost assessment, but an analysis of the economic gain that he believes will be derived from the Bill industry by industry? If so, that would be of great help to the Committee. If such a document exists, I should be inclined to withdraw my earlier remarks about the timing.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for being kind. The point that I was making is quite clear. The Bill will ensure that there are powers against anti-competitive activities, which are designed to force businesses out, so we can save the companies and huge costs. By having a clearer system of alignment between European and UK legislation, there will be less burdensome and bureaucratic costs in dealing with issues with which they must comply. The Government's proposals will protect companies from anti-competitive activity and make the legislation more effective; as currently happens in some instances burdensome and bureaucratic activities that cost business money need not apply. That seems a reasonable assessment. When we come to the issue in Committee, let us see what the hon. Member for West Dorset has to say, but the Government's proposals are a fair and effective analysis of the cost compliance arrangements in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I had thought that we were making progress, but perhaps the Minister is now telling us something different. Is he saying that he will not be producing an analysis of the economic gain or benefit clause by clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, I am not saying that at all. I shall send a copy of the appraisal to every member of the Committee. I cannot be fairer than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> And a compliance cost assessment?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Yes, in relation to the appraisal of the benefits analysis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am very grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is one each, but do not get too over-enthusiastic.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall not.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise, Mr. Maxton. My father was right.
<P>

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham shows an almost Messianic opposition to anything European in his attack on the sittings motion. He tried to scaremonger about our approach to including European legislation, which is somewhat confusing. Agreements that are exempt under EC law will be automatically exempted under UK law. The right hon. Gentleman completely misrepresented competition law because EC competition law has applied to the UK for 25 years or so and has done so from the time when a previous Conservative Administration signed the treaty. Therefore, it is not something extraordinary or something that has been suddenly pulled out of a hat. The Bill aligns our laws with EC competition rules and provides benefits to business, which will finally have consistent rules. I cannot understand why the Opposition Front Bench oppose that concept. In another place, they supported the concept of EC jurisprudence. Not only is the right hon. Gentleman on his own terms of his concept of the legislation, he is in direct conflict with what was said in another place by his own Front Bench team. What a shambles.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am delighted that the Minister likes the word I have used about this Bill; it is a shambles. The Minister has just suggested to the Committee that if something is exempt under European jurisdiction it will automatically be exempt under the British jurisdiction that he wants to establish. Yet the OFT makes it clear in its draft guidelines that there are circumstances in which something could be deemed to be anti-competitive in the UK but not by the European Commission, so double jeopardy remains.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The position is clear. Agreements that are exempt under EC law will automatically be exempt under UK law. The right hon. Gentleman's point related to aspects of competition in the UK marketplace, which the Director General of Fair Trading will consider because complaints will be made to him in the first instance. He will then have to consider whether the complaint warrants an investigation. That is not inconsistent.



<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham referred to over-the-counter medicines, which we shall discuss at the appropriate time. He said that the Government's strategy is to close down community pharmacies, but he overlooked the fact that the work under consideration at present takes place under current legislation. It would be wrong to preclude before 2004 an investigation by the competition administrators, especially when the complaint was submitted under the previous Administration. It was submitted in 1995-96 when the right hon. Gentleman was a member of the then Government. [Interruption.] It was rumoured that the right hon. Gentleman was a supporter and became a member of that Government. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to make an effective point in favour of community pharmacies, he can do it, but he should not mix the case up by accusing this Government of trying to close down community pharmacies, which is a complete untruth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed (South-East Cornwall):</B> Is the Minister saying that the Bill will improve the protection for community pharmacists and make them more secure in the future?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The Bill is a legislative framework for competition law. Over-the-counter medicines are being considered under current legislation because a complaint has been received. Even if everyone here took the view that the complaint was ill-founded, the matter would still be considered by our European colleagues because a complaint has been made there too. We must not circumvent the current investigation. That cannot be right, particularly as community pharmacy organisations have said that they have an overwhelming case to put. If that is supported by evidence, the current legislation will be followed when it comes to making a decision. However, we cannot use the Bill to circumvent that investigation, and we do not intend to do so.
<P>
The Government support fully the development of community pharmacies. Our proposals for the national health service make that absolutely clear. Our underlying commitment for community pharmacies is part of our development of and investment in the health budget.
I therefore reject out of hand what the right hon. Member for Wokingham said, particularly because of the views expressed by the vice-chairman of the Tory party, the hon. member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman).
<P>
It is interesting that the right hon. Member for Wokingham did not invite the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells to serve on the Committee. Seven of my hon. Friends serving as members of the Committee have strong views on the matter; but the right hon. Gentleman was not prepared to trust the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells, because he takes a completely different view. Indeed, he is one of those responsible for the current investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in Europe, Lord Simon of Highbury, said in another place that if the Bill abolished resale price maintenance for pharmacies, hundreds of them would close? That will be a direct result of the Government's actions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The Bill will not abolish it. The right hon. Gentleman completely misrepresents the position another example of him not doing his homework. I make the right hon. Gentleman an offer: I shall give him one of my spare red boxes, which may encourage him to read and digest the Bill and to come up with sensible comments.
<P>
I look forward to the Committee's close scrutiny of the Bill. The Government are totally committed to it being placed on the statute book, because people are sick and tired of being undermined by British industry's anti-competitive activities and of having no opportunity for proper redress. The Committee will assist that process by ensuring that the Bill is enacted.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during the proceedings on the Competition Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there are financial resolutions in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I should also like to remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
The Committee has just had a wide ranging debate it went slightly wider than the sittings motion. Hon. Members cannot expect the same laxity throughout the remaining proceedings.



<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 2 and 3; Clauses 17 to 20; Schedules 1 to 4; Clauses 4 to 16; Schedule 5, Clauses 21 to 25; Schedule 6; Clauses 26 to 46; Schedule 7; Clauses 47 to 50; Schedule 8; Clauses 51; Schedule 9; Clauses 52 to 54; Schedule 10; Clause 55; Schedule 11; Clauses 56 to 73; Clause 1; Schedules 12 to 14; Clauses 74 and 75; new Clauses; new Schedules.
<P>
It is important to set out our reasons for such an order. To bring a sound and logical order to our discussions, I propose three departures from considering the Bill as printed. First, the schedules should be considered following the clauses or groups of clauses to which they relate. The order of consideration achieves that and I believe that that is a well established principle which makes good sense.
<P>
Secondly, we should bring forward consideration of clauses 17 to 20; which introduce the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position. It makes sense to take those clauses immediately after clauses 2 and 3, which introduce the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, and then to turn to schedules 1 to 4. Some of those schedules contain exclusions from chapter II prohibition as well as from chapter I prohibition. It makes sense to consider those clauses and schedules in quick succession because they are so interrelated. It would not be sensible to consider the schedules in advance of clauses 17 to 20. It would be a pity to break up consideration of this group of clauses and schedules by interspersing consideration of procedural clauses 4 to 16.
<P>
Thirdly, clause 1 should be taken after clause 73, as it, like clause 73, is a clause that introduces schedule 13. The insertion of subsection (2) through an amendment in another place changed the nature of clause 1, so it is now a clause relating to transitional matters. It would be silly to invite the Committee to consider transitional provisions before deciding on the content of the Bill. The only point at which the Committee can sensibly be invited to turn its attention to transition is when it has finished consideration of the substantive clause and schedules.
<P>
Any amendments to schedule 13 could potentially be grouped with amendments to clause 1. The clause and the schedule cover the same ground in introducing transitional arrangements. If clause 1 was considered at the start of our proceedings, transitional provisions may fall to be considered then, which would be quite wrong.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members recognise that I am genuinely trying to ensure that the Committee's activities are dealt with effectively.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I want formally to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. Indeed, I praise your chairmanship already this morning. You were wise to allow us to raise important issues when we considered the sittings motion. I am grateful to you for that as it allowed us to try to clear some of the ground with Ministers. Unfortunately, we were not successful as the Minister still does not seem to have thought through many crucial issues. We will now have to highlight them amendment by amendment, clause by clause.
<P>
I remind the Committee that I have declared to the Registrar of Members' Interests the fact that I write a monthly column for the Financial Mail on Sunday and the fact that my wife is an executive of British Airways. I have no intention of pursuing those interests in the Committee, but it is wise to remind the Committee that I have made the due declaration. I am also in the process of negotiating a non-executive directorship of a new financial business. Again, I have no intention of pursuing its interests in this Committee.
<P>
I think that I can help the Minister in two of his three proposals for the order of consideration. I and my hon. Friends are relaxed about his proposal that the schedules should follow the clauses to which they refer. That is normal practice and it will help the Committee's deliberations. I am also prepared to accept the suggestion that clauses 17 to 20 should be considered early in our deliberations, so that we can debate the two main prohibitions towards the beginning of the Committee stage. Subject to anything that my hon. Friends may say, the Opposition are happy about that.
<P>
Where I feel the Minister is being a little disingenuous is in his third suggestion, namely, that clause 1 and schedule 13 deal entirely with transitional matters and should therefore be debated at the end of our consideration. We have a suspicion that it is an attempt to delay the debate on the very sensitive issue of the retail pharmacies until the end of the proceedings. I presume it relates to some ministerial discomfort about the presence of seven early-day motion signatories on the Government Benches hon. Members rightly standing up for businesses in their constituencies. They are worried about their future under the Bill's transitional provisions. that is matched by the considerable concern felt by the Conservative party and, I guess, the Liberal Democrat party about the future of retail pharmacies throughout the country.



<P>
When the Minister responded to my intervention, he implied that the resale price maintenance system would be abolished for pharmacists under the old legislation, and that the new legislation had nothing to do with it. We must take issue with that supposition. When the RPM system was investigated previously under the existing legal system, it was found to be reasonable in the case of the retail pharmacy, although it was abolished in most other cases under previous legislation. There will now be an inquiry against the background of the introduction of new competition law, which most people consider would make resale price maintenance impossible if it went through unamended. Whether or not the existing competition authorities reach different judgment, the new legislation will make the position difficult for the maintenance of the proposals.
<P>
For once, the Minister said that he wants more competition and that he realises the merits of that for customers as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry so wisely said earlier. There is no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition about the general point that competition is good for customers. During the 1980s, I spent much time trying to persuade Labour spokesmen of that and applying competition to the monopolies in the nationalised sector. When he did so, it invariable produced better answers, lower prices, and broader range and more choice.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is incumbent on us to make a special case as we did when we were in government for the maintenance of RPM in the retail pharmacy area when we have not supported it elsewhere and helped to remove it in other cases. There is substantial competition in the market for over-the-counter medicines through multiples and supermarkets that offer own-brand products. If people are motivated primarily by price when choosing their medicines, they can buy heavily discounted products from larger stores, compared with the price of branded products. I am told that the quality of those products is good; obviously they meet the requirements of the stringent provisions of medicinal regulation. There is price choice in the market for those who want it.
<P>
Industries put forward the case for the maintenance of brands and for brand support through the RPM in the over-the-counter medicine sector. After all, the Government run a price scheme for medicines that are operated by prescription only, with the intention of guaranteeing high returns and margins to the pharmaceutical industry so that enough research and development work can be undertaken. That policy, which could be construed as anti-competitive, has been extremely successful in creating important businesses in the country that have added to the variety, choice and competitive strength of the marketplace because they have been able to plough back their profits and develop new profits and support their brands.
<P>
That happens with over-the-counter medicines, too, through the system of RPM. Some money is ploughed back for research purposes, so that the British industry can offer a bigger and better range of products here and abroad. My worry is that we are witnessing a Minister who is reluctant to accept that the Bill could result in the closure of additional pharmacies that would not otherwise have closed because of the abolition of RPM. The hon. Gentleman should check the script from the other place because the Minister for Trade was honest and clear. He made it clear that, if RPM went, many pharmacies would close that would not otherwise have closed.



<P>
The President of the Board of Trade implied the same on Second Reading, when she said that there would be a substantial reduction in revenues and in profits in the industry as a whole and that, when RPM went, prices would clearly fall. Some of that would relate to a reduction in profits in large supermarket chains that would obviously cut the prices of products, the prices of which are currently maintained. However, many smaller pharmacies would suffer a loss of revenue and profit, which could make all the difference between their survival and their removal from the trading position in villages and towns.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will appreciate the importance of the retail pharmacy to village and suburban life. Such outlets are often small stores that do not make large profits or an extremely good living. They provide an important service and employment. It is not just a matter of providing a good service to customers, but providing a part of community life. The newsagent and the retail pharmacy are often the two most importance shops in the village high street. People congregate in them, meet each other and discuss the news, as well as taking advantage of the services that they provide. Community life in villages and suburbs would suffer a substantial loss if the retail pharmacy and the newsagent were removed as a result of the Bill, and in areas where pressures have also been put on post offices, the third outlet that provides such support to the community.
<P>
The Minister will be interested to know what the Opposition would do in such a situation. RPM in pharmacies can be subject to renewed investigation under old legislation.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is beginning to stray into matters that will be the subject of future debates rather than discussing the motion.



<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton, for that guidance. I shall withhold our positive proposals on what could be done to tackle the retail pharmacy problem until we reach the appropriate debate. You must forgive my impatience, but I fear that the reason for the order of business by which the first clause is taken towards the end of our proceedings is related to the Government's potential embarrassment over the most sensitive of issues. I have not come across a Bill when the first clause was not debated at the beginning of proceedings in Committee. It is most unusual to defer it, but stranger still to defer it until the end of our proceedings.
<P>
Clause 1 is important. it will repeal several important enactments and refers to the schedule, which is at issue between the Minister and myself. It is most important at the beginning of our deliberations to discuss clause 1. We are surprised that the Government are introducing a Bill that is meant to offer a sweeping reform of competition law and provide harmony with European jurisdiction. Yet, it will not repeal all the existing competition legislation, something that must be debated early in our proceedings to find out why the Government have fallen down in that crucial respect.
<P>
The Government promise us and the business community harmony between European and British jurisdiction with the dominance of European jurisdiction as the treaty requires in many respects. Given that clause 1 provides only for partial repeal, they are delivering a complicated system, which involves dual jeopardy, different jurisdictions and the possible conflict of laws that will arise. It would be more helpful to the Committee if we could debate the repeal section at the beginning of our proceedings. We could then hear why Ministers think that European law is so imperfect that some elements of the preceding British law must remain in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is unusual for the repeals provision to be in clause 1? The only reasonable reason for that is that substantive issues of coverage will be enacted by clause 1, whereas the normal repeals procedure is tacked on to the Bill at the end to tidy up matters. That is why we must decide the rationale behind the Government's partial repeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood: </b>My hon. Friend puts his finger on the main point. The essence of the Bill is to sweep away existing British law and replace it with European law. The Minister might reflect on the fact that the original idea of European competition law was to deal not with British domestic competition problems, but with cross-border issues, especially those affecting the larger corporations trading in more than one country.</B><P>






<P>
We now see a sleight of hand from Ministers. They are saying that because Europe rightly deals with the cross-broader issues for large companies, it should deal with all the domestic issues as well to avoid conflict. However, they do not have the courage of their own convictions because they have failed to remove all the corpus of British competition law, which they must do if they wish to replicate European law for all British issues, not just the cross-border issues for which it is designed.
<P>
One matter that we will need to discuss when we get around to the important issue of possible conflict of law in different jurisprudences is whether it is realistic to apply two treaty articles which were framed to capture large companies trading across frontiers as the perfect competition law in a single nation state or a single marketplace united by a single currency and a single set of laws made for other purposes. Does it make sense to harmonise competition law to the fullest extent but not to harmonise company law? There should be a clear relationship between company law and competition law in any one country.
<P>
The Committee might remember that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and the Resale Prices Act 1976 are clearly mentioned in clause 1. It would be for the benefit of the Committee if, at the beginning, we could draw out some of the points about resale prices and resale price maintenance and the overlap between the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and the new legislation. The Minister is not attempting to correct me; I think that he agrees that Ministers had, as one of their main aims, the modernisation of competition law in the spirit of trying to apply a cross-border European law to a domestic marketplace. If that is the position, it is important that that fundamental principle is debated through suitable amendments, which I and my hon. Friends have and will propose. We need to consider the number of appeals that might arise before considering the substance of the new legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is at his least persuasive this morning. First, I want to deal with the technicalities. It is not the Government's intention to stop debating the issue; indeed, we have already tabled an amendment to clause 1. We made our intentions clear on Second Reading. In dealing with this technical motion, we have taken advice on how best to manage the consideration of the Bill in Committee. Our proposals will assist the Committee to consider the Bill effectively.
<P>
I want to deal with some of the right hon. Gentleman's politicking. I believe that he has objected to the motion simply to get out a press release that he did not get out during the previous debate. Clause 1(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Paragraphs 5 to 9 of Schedule 13 make particular transitional provision in relation to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and the Resale Prices Act 1976."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman then moved to clause 73. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The transitional provisions and savings set out in Schedule 13 are to have effect."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a direct link between the amendment passes in the other place and clause 73.
<P>
The Government's proposal is not political it is a straightforward administrative proposal to deal effectively with the Bill in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister has demolished his own argument. He said that clause 1 should be taken at the end of our proceedings because it relates to transitional provisions. He also made it clear that the Government intend to delete lines 15 to 17 of clause 1. Why do not the Government proceed quickly with clause 1 and try to remove lines 15 to 17? The clause would then no longer refer directly to transitional provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The clause deals with transitional matters and we want to deal with all transitional matters together. The hon. Gentleman is trying to be clever, but he is not clever enough. We have considered the matter openly and set out our proposals.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham thinks that the motion is highly political, but his case falls by the wayside because in all other aspects he accepted that I paraphrase the Government were acting in good faith. The reason for his rejection of the order of consideration proposed by the Government is his unwillingness, his lack of desire, to serve regularly on the Committee. His argument is spurious.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman does not have a good record in defending pharmacies. When he was a member of the previous Cabinet there were 178 pharmacy closures. He did not defend pharmacies then. The Government are spending £700 million this year on pharmacy arrangements within the NHS. No one can challenge the Government's commitment to pharmacies and our desire to work effectively with pharmacists. The issue has been around since 1995-96. The Administration of which the right hon. Gentleman was member said that it would deal with the matter in the way in which we are doing so.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman has made another spectacular U-turn, and not in the interests of the pharmacies but for simple short-term personal political gain. What the right hon. Gentleman wants is impossible. To say the least, he has been disingenuous. Even if the Government did what the right hon. Gentleman asks us to do, he could not tell pharmacy organisations that there would not be an investigation under the previous complaint in relation to Europe. That is not the case. The right hon. Gentleman should be honest enough to say that. He should not put forward a position which he knows is unsustainable. Therefore, I ask the Committee to support the motion so that we may consider the amendments and give due consideration to the Bill in the order that the Government propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Minister should get his facts straight. I am not putting out any press release today on retail pharmacies. I make the point because the Government are up to no good trying to delay consideration of an issue which matters to many members of the Committee and to hon. Members generally.
<P>
The Minister seems unable to make the distinction between pharmacies which close in the usual course of business, which has happened under Governments of all persuasions, and the additional large number of pharmacies that will be forced out of business if the legislation comes into effect in the way that the Government wish. That is an important distinction with which the Minister has not dealt.
<P>
If it is the Minister's view that we need to take into account the convenience of the Committee, would he not, on this occasion, agree with the Opposition's view that it would be for the convenience of the Committee for the convenience of all hon. Members, bar one, who have spoken today, apart from the Minister if we took the clause in its usual place at the beginning?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As that was an intervention, this would be an opportune moment to say that I expect interventions to be brief. Hon. Members may speak for a second time in Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am trying my best to pick some reasoned argument from the comments of the right hon. Member for Wokingham. The only person whom I know who is on record as wanting to close local pharmacies is the current vice chairman of the Conservative party, the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman), who initiated the original complaint which is rightly under consideration. We should get our facts right and our history straight. Only the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells has complained. No one on this side of the House, before the election or since, has been anything other than positive about pharmacies, whether local, suburban rural or urban. The Government are firmly committed to maintaining pharmacy services.



<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham has us going round in circles. In the debate on the sittings motion, his core argument was that the Government were moving far too quickly. He wanted to delay our debates; indeed, it seemed that he did not want us to debate the Bill next Thursday. Our proposal would ensure debate on clauses 1 and 73 and schedule 13, but the right hon. Gentleman now complains that we are not debating them today. He should go into a dark room, lie down and consider what he is supposed to be doing here.
<P>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman takes a more active, pro-active and positive approach. The contribution of the majority of Opposition Members to Second Reading leads me to assume that they want to be far more positive and to debate the issues, rather than make the spurious debating points that the right hon. Gentleman has made this morning. I ask my right hon. Friends to support the order of consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I had not intended to speak, but the Minister of State's reply to my right hon. Friend the cMember for Wokingham prompts me to do so. The Minister not only failed to answer my right hon. Friend's questions about the Government's motivation for such an order of consideration, which were properly put; he demolished his own argument. I do not want to repeat what I said earlier, but although the central proposition for debating clause 1 later is that it deals with transitional provisions, it is perfectly possible to debate it first. I share my right hon. Friend's view that it is unusual, if not without precedent, for clause 1 to deal with repeals, but it makes good sense. Indeed, one could argue that all repeals, including those listed in schedule 14, should come first.
<P>
We need to know the extent of repeals, particularly of those parts of the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the Competition Act 1980 that deal with the interrelationship between scale and complex monopoly investigations under the Fair Trading Act before moving on. It is rather a significant factor, which we need to know about before we examine the manner in which the prohibitions are to work.
<P>
Repeals are often a consequence of the extent to which Governments have to legislate to achieve certain objectives. However, as my right hon. Friend said, repeals are of the essence in the Bill. The Government must demonstrate that existing legislation is not achieving its objectives in relation to industry's anti-competitive or uncompetitive activity. Only in so far as the Government demonstrate the extent to which the present competition legislation does not meet its objectives can one see how prohibition should be introduced.
<P>
In the case of articles 85 or 86 of the treaty of Rome, prohibition is probably rendered unnecessary, and it would be better to proceed by amending existing legislation to strengthen the director general's powers, as was originally proposed by the Conservative Government in their consultation draft of August 1996. A logical structure for the Bill would be repeals. prohibitions, consequential changes and transition arrangements, but the Government have shifted the repeals and their justification for the Bill to a later stage, which rather undermines its logic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have only two brief things to say. I am of advanced age; it will be possible for the Committee to calculate it if I say that while my father was an undergraduate a Mr. P. G. Wodehouse was still writing novels and was at the height of his form. My father was a member of a college at which there was a club called the husteron, proteron club, the members of which used, one day a term, to live their day backwards. On rising, the first thing that they did was drink a whisky and soda, and they ate cold porridge late at night. In view of the Government's decision to consider clause 1 in the penultimate selection, I am delighted that the spirit of the husteron, proteron club is still alive. As a man of a Conservative disposition, that gives me pleasure.
<P>
A further observation is prompted by my being of a Conservative disposition. When referring to Conservative Members, will the Minister change this habit of relating all periods to periods when my right hon. Friend was in government or in the Cabinet? He did so as recently as in his previous intervention, when he referred to the closure of 178 community pharmacies. I have an old-fashioned preference for following technology by referring to the birth of Our Lord, rather than to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. It is a profound compliment on the Minister's part to my right hon. Friend, but it would be easier for us to follow if we could revert to conventional chronology.
