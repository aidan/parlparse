                           </strong> Order. Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements to make. I realise that many Committee members have not
sat on a Public Bill Committee before. Until the Panel of Chairs
decides that things should change, I had better continue with the
established procedure: it has always been the case that the Government
sit on the right-hand side of the room, and the Opposition on the
left.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000007">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members may,
if they wish, remove their jackets during Committee sittings. Please
will all Members ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned
off or switched to silent mode during Committee sittings? I am not
going to be pompous and humiliate anyone if their mobile phone starts
singing things, but if that happens, please locate the phone and switch
it off, because it does get
embarrassing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000008">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
a general rule, my fellow Chairman—Hugh Bayley—and I do
not intend to call starred amendments. I realise that some colleagues
may not be entirely au fait with starred amendments, but if they want
to see me privately with the Clerk, who basically tells me what to do,
I should be more than happy to assist them. The required notice period
for amendments in Public Bill Committee is three working days.
Therefore amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on
Monday for consideration on Thursday, and by the rise of the House on
Thursday for Tuesday. The deadline for the Tuesday meeting immediately
following the February recess will be named nearer the time. There is a
money resolution in connection with this Bill, and copies are available
in this room.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000009">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I say, not
everyone on this Committee is familiar with the process of taking oral
evidence. We introduced these procedures about three or four years
ago—I cannot remember exactly when. We never used to have these
evidence sessions. The reason they were introduced was that it was felt
that it gave members of the Committee an opportunity to gather
information from informed witnesses, and the end result would be that
our Committee deliberations would be more informed. That was the
theory.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion on the
amendment paper, debate  on which is limited to half an hour.
We will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and a
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private before the oral
evidence session; I hope that we can take those two motions formally. I
must say to the Government Members that the Government Whip is normally
here—that is Bill Wiggin—but I do not see him. We have
the Opposition Whip here, but normally the Whips get together behind
the scenes to decide how these things are done.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000011">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Assuming that
the motion to sit in private is agreed to, the Committee will move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room, and our oral
evidence session will begin. If the Committee agrees to the programme
motion, it will hear oral evidence this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000012">&#160;</a>

Sawford:</strong>
                           </em> The first thing I should say is that we are
optimistic that the process that you will undertake in this Committee,
as well as in the Lords and through Parliament, can move us towards the
realisation of the Government’s vision. As it stands, I think
there are a couple of big concerns. One is the environment into which
this Bill is being introduced, in terms of both the legal
environment—the way in which the courts may interpret the
law—and the way in which central Government and Whitehall
operate. In that sense, there are 142 powers for central
Government to make regulations and issue guidance in the Bill, so we
want to hear what the Government intend by those and how extensively,
or not, they might be used in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
we get to critical elements of these powers, such as the general power
of competence, we as localists absolutely support the principle. The
Government should be congratulated on moving on from the fairly timid
revisions that were proposed to the old general power of well-being.
However, it would have been better if the general power of competence
had stopped at the first line of the first clause, which is that local
government 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                           </div>should have the power to do anything—I forget the exact
wording—that any ordinary person can do, or anything that
individuals generally may do. The clause does not need all the
limitations and qualifications.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We can take
this approach to various parts of the legislation. Why is there a
different approach and a different standard around local democracy, and
how it should be conducted, when we consider the question of
referendums and plebiscitary democracy relative to the way in which
central Government operate? What is the intention of that? How will
minority interests be represented in communities? One of the real
ambitions of localists—I am sure you will hear it time and time
again today—is the financial freedom of local government. What
will the provisions in this Bill around local referendums and council
tax really mean? That is not to say that we oppose the idea of
referendums per se, but these are referendums with conditions that will
be prescribed by the Secretary of State. In that sense, is this
something that really empowers local government around their financial
freedoms, or actually disempowers
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000044">&#160;</a>

Sawford:</strong>
                           </em> Part of our view of freedom is financial
freedom. It is absolutely fundamental to our freedom, and if that is
constrained by central Government or any other mechanism, we are
clearly not free to act in the way in which we judge is in the best
interests of our communities. It is a fundamental principle. Obviously
there is then a point of how responsible local government may be with
that freedom and the relative powers of central and local government in
the whole equation. We are not fundamentalists about this; we recognise
that central Government will be concerned with the whole burden of
taxation on individuals in society and the whole picture of public
service provision, and they may want to retain some ability to
influence the taxation that somebody may have to pay. However, this is
too limiting in our
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000051">&#160;</a>

government finance system is going to be looked at in a positive light,
as far as we have been able to pick up from conversations at the
moment. We have seen some moves already: the proposed freedoms around
setting planning fees. Lots of local tweaks to finance can be made, and
I think that most of our members have realised that the world is going
to be a lot tighter in terms of central Government grant. I do not

                           </div>really see that, from an LGA perspective, as being the big stumbling
block. We can see that that is work in progress and that something will
come forward in the future, so that is not the issue for us at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000052">&#160;</a>

real issues around finance are the ones that concern the housing
revenue account review. Obviously, the positive statements that
Ministers have made have not been reflected in the work that the
accountants have been doing over at the Treasury. They are issues that
we would like to see you guys getting to grips with over the next
couple of months, as well as bits about EU fines. It has to be somebody
in a room with no knowledge of how the world works who decides that it
is feasible to pass EU fines on to councils for things over which we
have no control. I cannot see how a council with a motorway or an
airport on its patch can ever be considered to be responsible for this
country failing to reach its carbon reduction
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000053">&#160;</a>

fines if we do not have complete freedom with the levers that could
reduce landfill? Clearly there is a tension between what Ministers and
parliamentarians say that they believe should be in the Bill, and what
the accountants and bureaucrats have put in it afterwards. I am
convinced, as is the LGA, that the reason why we have 406 pages is that
people who are not accountable to the electorate, even on a national
basis, have been the final architects of
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000054">&#160;</a>

financially autonomous. We at Localis will be hoping to feed into that
with a paper on business rates and how they can be localised, which
will come out in a couple of months.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000057">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think, generally speaking, I am saying
that when there are radical changes of such a scale as those proposed
in the Bill, all such policy has things of which you cannot quite
decipher the consequences. It is 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>like the Popperian notion—Karl Popper—of unintended
consequences, and it is much better to do policy in incremental levels.
There is a whole range of stuff across all the different aspects of the
Bill where there is the potential for something odd, perverse or
unintended to occur. One example of that could be the right to
challenge. There is a right for the community to challenge the
procurement process and how services are delivered, but once that
challenge is made, it might not be the community that enjoys the
transfer of services or more involvement with them, because the door
might be opened to other types of service provision—big business
or non-local provision. A range of elements in the Bill needs to be
looked at carefully and thought through by asking, “What could
be the worst case scenario of that thing happening? What might the
knock-on effects
be?”<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000060">&#160;</a>

in the Bill could help to address the key challenge that many of us
have experienced in our time in local government of attracting more
strong community leaders to serve as councillors? Perhaps  Mr

Porter:</strong>
                           </em> I am not sure whether the Bill will encourage
strong community leaders to become councillors, but it should attract
those councillors who are already strong community leaders to reinforce
how they believe their districts should be shaped. There is more to
becoming a local councillor than can possibly be put in one Bill.
Admittedly, if we are given greater freedoms and powers, it will bring
more people
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
frustration at the moment is that no matter what you try to change at a
local level, someone higher up the food chain will stop, change or
reverse it. I do not believe that that is the case everywhere. A number
of us have sometimes thought that it feels like pushing water uphill,
but you can achieve quite a lot. The Bill will help those of us who are
ambitious enough to do that, but I am not sure whether it will bring in
a higher calibre of candidates just in itself. That is down to the
political parties to manage locally. We need to engage much more in
getting those strong community leaders out and active. Greater freedoms
and flexibilities in how we can work will achieve some of that, but it
will not be the only piece of work that needs to be done in
itself—political parties will have to engage more heavily at
local level.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000063">&#160;</a>

that, I absolutely agree that the Government’s plan of
decentralising power and promoting localisation will, in itself, be a
key driver in encouraging more new people into the local government
fold. There is broad acceptance that the end of the Standards Board,
which the Bill heralds, is probably a good thing in that regard. I am
slightly unsure as to the effect of the introduction of a criminal
offence of not registering members’ interests. I have spoken to
various people who have said that they think that might work the other
way by putting people off even thinking about becoming a councillor. I
am not sure why the provision is in there; it is perhaps a bit of an
overreaction.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000064">&#160;</a>

much welcomed by councillors, such as scrapping the pre-determination
rules and abolishing the Standards Board for England. I think those are
things about which councillors around the country will say,
“Great, we welcome that.” However, the big
question—the

			Column number: 9<a class="bkMark" name="Column9">&#160;</a>
                           </div>particular thing that we will be looking to hear from Ministers over the
course of the debate is their vision for local government’s
place within the localism.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We would say
localism is about communities being much more self-determining—a
presumption that communities should be self-determining—but that
that is enshrined in the role of the elected local councillors. I think
there is potential here for people to see referendums, community
planning and so on, as a way of, frankly, not seeking elected office,
but rather seeking to change their communities in a different way. Or
there is potential for councillors to become frustrated that, for
example, in the use of 142 reserved powers of the Secretary of State,
the council is overruled relative to parts of the
community.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The key roles
for the council are balancing all the interests of the communities;
having an oversight of public services and local spending; its
convening power to bring partnerships together; and representing all
interests, including minority interests. If councillors feel frustrated
in their ability to do that by the direct democracy in the Bill, I
think that could become a problem. So we are optimistic, but that is
what we want to hear during this
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000067">&#160;</a>

geek, but when I read the Bill I was very intrigued to find the
balance—what is the vision here for the balance between
representative and participative democracy? I think there is a tension
in the Bill that is never resolved, and it does not say exactly what
the role of the elected member and representative democracy is. What is
the role of the elected member, now and in perpetuity? For instance,
the divesting of services to the community—a good
thing—but what would be the elected member’s role in
that? Would they be a manager of contracts or would they have some
broader representative function? I think some tensions are there which
link to my previous point about unintended consequences, which
seriously need to be resolved because they are to do with the
philosophy of the Bill and the drive behind the Bill, and I think that
is weakened if it is not fully
explained.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000068">&#160;</a>

the London Authorities Mutual Limited case is probably the most recent
public example of what this Bill should allow us to do that we have
been unable to

challenged in court, as in the very high-profile case that Mr Porter
described, but they were as much about

is that the general power of competence moves us on from that, which is
why it is disappointing to see express limitations on what councils can
do, including existing legislation. We were hoping this would be a kind
of year zero. Let’s start from here—have a review of
existing powers and say what it is appropriate for councils to do or
not do, have that discussion prior to the publication of the Bill or at
least during the course of its passage, and certainly have some
elucidation of that by Ministers during the course of its
passage.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000083">&#160;</a>

of State reserves the powers to make orders preventing specific
activities using the power, and orders making use of the general power
subject to conditions. What is the intention behind that? What will
that be? In a sense, if you turn the answer the other way around, what
we would like to see is the ambition of local government unleashed over
the coming years—its innovation and creativity—as it
faces unprecedented challenges. We might not be able to imagine what
councils could do if they were fully given the powers to do it. In that
sense, what they want to know, and what is important, is what is
envisaged around the restrictions on this. That is why it is very
important that there is some constitutional statement about the role of
local government, because otherwise, the courts will interpret this in
a fairly minimalist way in terms of how permissive they
are of local government. That
is our
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000084">&#160;</a>

worked with the Minister, Andrew Stunell, some years ago on a local

European Charter of Local Self-Government that said local authorities
are self-determining. If we had that kind of statement in here, that
really would help us to see the philosophy of the Government and the
coalition parties in bringing forward this Bill, driven through the
Bill and then on into the courts’ interpretation and in how
local councils
act.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000085">&#160;</a>

up the points about this power of general competence, which I would
like to delve into a bit further? I was struck, Mr. Sawford,
by your rather Maoist language about year zero. Is not the most
important thing about the general power of competence that it sends
precisely the signal you are looking for in signalling that change in
central-local relations, which I know you have been advocating for some
time? I hear the argument about the order-making powers, but in some
ways, don’t you think that is a bit of a red herring? Clearly,
there needs to be a legislative framework. It would be unsurprising if
there were not order-making powers in the Bill, given that one can
never predict all the circumstances that may accrue around the general
power of competence. I am surprised that you seem to be saying,
“Yes, I broadly agree with this,” when there are so many
different caveats. Is it not a bit of a red herring that you are
pursuing this line and saying, “Well actually, I don’t
quite welcome it because we’ve got this order-making
power”? Is it not pretty unsurprising that the Bill should have
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000086">&#160;</a>

Localis and the LGIU would have agreed around over many years is to
substantially shift power from central to local government, and in that
sense, a constitutional statement would be much better—something
that says, “This is our meaning around the scope of local
government in relation to the general power of competence,”
rather than a whole set of reserve powers and limitations on local
government. There are some very specific ones,
including charging and trading, which Councillor Porter mentioned, that
we would want to see removed during the passage of the

represented in this room would agree, that we have had 50 years of
increasing centralisation of the system, and we now have a Localism
Bill. However, Mr McInroy, you seem to be arguing that we should be
taking a much more incremental approach—that we should be
cautious and not take these initiatives that communities are demanding.
Is that not a rather surprising position for you to take given the
opportunity that the Bill presents? You are kind of arguing that we
should pilot this and do that, whereas the policy environment demands a
radical Bill that opens up the possibility for community rights of

health association chief executives and permanent civil servants get

determine its own executive arrangements has got to be a good move. I
am not sure how many councils will actually take it up, though. When
the changes to the executive leader cabinet model were first brought
in, there was quite a bit of resistance from people who had

now, and I think the majority of members have grown to accept that
quicker, generally better, decisions can be made through executive
arrangements than through committee arrangements. There will almost
certainly be some councils who will welcome the opportunity to go back
to committee system, if that is what they choose to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000104">&#160;</a>

                           </em> May I pick that one up? I think the
absolutely fundamental point, as a localist, is whether councils and
communities can decide their own arrangements for themselves. That is
the absolutely critical point. It is not that there is one model that
will work best. The idea that that should relate to the size or type of
authority—I think that is a red herring. If there were a single
model of corporate governance, for example, that worked best, then I am
sure that we would be able to make a lot of money out of promoting it.
Companies have all sorts of different structures, and local authorities
should be able to explore different structures over time.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This speaks
to our concern about the Bill, which is that some things go in very
much the right direction—for example, letting local authorities
determine their own government structures; that, broadly, is going in
the right direction. Telling 12 cities that they must have a referendum
for an elected mayor, and central Government giving that a little bit
of oomph by creating the shadow mayors, in order to get the right
outcome—that goes in the wrong direction. Local authorities can
already seek to have an elected mayor if they wish, and there is no
reason to change the legislation in that regard. We would even extend
that to other issues, such as the issues around pay transparency. It is
perfectly understandable, of course, that central Government Ministers
will have a view about these issues, but in the end it should be for
local councils to determine how best to operate, and the main check on
that should be local accountability in their communities and local
people. If local people want to demand pay transparency, they should do
so in a robust system of democracy, rather than those things being
prescribed in a Bill. That does not seem very localist to us. Things
that give councils and local communities more powers are going in the
right direction, and things that tell them what they must do are going
in the wrong direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000106">&#160;</a>

Unfortunately, in the Bill, it looks more like a community right to

then Opposition allowed for a first refusal for the community, so that
if a property of community value—a community asset—came
up for sale, the community would have the first chance to buy it. That
does not appear to be in the Bill, and therefore I am not sure how much
community right to buy there will

should work really well. If the district or upper-tier development plan
is the locally supreme document and sub-district plans have to fit in
with that, then this will work really well. What we should be doing is
turning that slightly on its head, as some of my colleagues do already,
and use the neighbourhood plans to build a district-wide plan. That
way, we will end up with development that communities actually buy in
to and support, and hopefully we can reverse the situation that has
gone on for the last 35 or 40 years, where this country has singularly
failed to develop the amount of new homes it needs for the people we
have living here. The greatest challenge for us is that this is going
to be a brave new world for planning, and one that is kind of untested.
One thing we know for certain is that the previous system has failed,
so it is time to change, and local government really welcomes that. It
is the end of the regional spatial strategies—top-down targets
that failed, year on year, to deliver the homes we needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000115">&#160;</a>

perverse situations in some councils, where we were prevented from
building homes because the regional spatial target was too low.
Hopefully, a planning system built from the bottom up will deliver the
development that communities do need—and want, despite the fact
that some of the popular press would have everyone being a nimby. That
is not really the case out on the ground. What people want is the right
development in the right place. What they do not want is the wrong
development in the right place, if that makes

every word of that. One small thing I am not entirely sure about under
the neighbourhood planning provisions is which bodies can develop a
neighbourhood plan or development order. If I have this right, they are
parish councils or neighbourhood forums. The description of a
neighbourhood forum, if I have read the Bill correctly, is still to
come in secondary legislation, giving it more shape and scope. That
will be

and there is the Russian doll idea in terms of scale of planning.
However, one word of caution is that we do not want to get to a stage
where planning becomes atomised, and there are individual elements of
planning with a lack of strategic steer. There needs to be an element
of understanding of the scale of functions around planning and of how
certain planning decisions have a particular scale. We would not have
to have the neighbourhood plans, which makes it
difficult for a series of small plans and makes a more confused picture
when large-scale strategic planning decisions need to be

in the future document that details the neighbourhood plans and the
relationship between different scales and powers of planning. That is
unclear at the moment. We have got rid of the regional spatial and
economic strategies, and that is probably a good thing. However, we
need to see where that scale of planning will take place in the future
and how we would build up the blocks of all these individualised
neighbourhood plans that people have put a lot of work and effort into.
We need to see that a big scale does not ride over the top of them, but

with, and there is nothing in here that we do not welcome in
principle—the idea that you turn the planning system quite
significantly on its head. We want the Bill to be radical. Instead of
the planning system starting at the top and filtering down, with the
real power in the system being the national framework and then various
spatial levels going down to the community, it would start at the other
end. We think that has to be the right approach in principle, but there
are some practical issues that need to be worked through. One is that
this will work only if it is a partnership between councillors and
communities, because people will need to be supported to bring forward
neighbourhood plans; they will need to be resourced by councils in
terms of independent examinations and the potential for local
referendums. There are also issues about how you ensure that they
represent all of the community’s interests. I think that Mr
McInroy’s point about how we define neighbourhood and community
is really important. Thinking back over time, they are much more
complex things to define in this day and age than they have perhaps
ever been, and we must ensure that people feel involved and

there are things about the role of local councils and

substantial parts of the Bill about the housing and planning system.
Our vision of localism is one in which the local community and councils
have a great deal more power in the criminal justice system, the
welfare system, the stewardship of local natural resources and so on.

stewardship role, particularly of local government and how it needs to
be seen as first among equals when it comes to stewardship of place.
The legitimate and correct representative democratic role of local
government needs to be stated much more strongly. I also think the
Bill, while about localism, is slightly spatially blind. It does not
recognise that there is special disequilibrium—inequalities
across the country—and different levels by which areas
recommended in the Bill would or would not gain traction, depending on
a whole range of different cultural, economic and social
factors.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000127">&#160;</a>

danger—going back to my earlier point about unintended
consequences—that there are areas where we would pick up the
freedoms, flexibilities and localism in the Bill and run with them, and
other areas where we would not. We must look at how that would be
solved or worked through. The Bill talks to a particular type of place
which many places are not like, for instance in terms of what you would
expect the community to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000128">&#160;</a>

consequences and in particular relate it to the abolition of the
pre-determination rule, which I think all of you welcomed? I am sure
you would recognise that there must be limitations on what can be said
by people who find themselves taking decisions in a quasi-judicial
role. The Government have recently relieved the Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills of his responsibilities for apparently
predetermining his view in respect of News International, and clearly
that was with a view to the risk of judicial review. Will one of the

this is enormous, and I am no legal expert. However, we would have to
look at any rule that prevents somebody expressing a view on an
important local issue and stops them being clear to the electorate
about where they stand for fear of facing serious limitations on their
ability to effect change if elected. In that sense we welcome the
Government, and there are many people well placed to advise the
Government on how they can frame this legally in such a way that
councillors are able to make decisions without recourse to the legal
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000131">&#160;</a>

bigger point, which goes back to what I said about where the planning

of guidance from Government, you end up with very significant legal
constraints on an individual elected in a local area and their ability
to act. If it starts in a community in a different way, and our view of
the planning system is more empowering of local people and their
decisions, then I would have thought that begins to tackle some of the
legal problems that you

or community organisations come forward with bids, it is really
important that the local authority is then able to make what it
considers, along with local politicians, to be the best judgment for
their area. That is why we are concerned about the reserve powers of
the Secretary of State—effectively we play the dinner monitor.
If you think about the big challenges that councils face right now,
they are thinking in two directions. One is about scaling up, in a
sense, with joint procurement, shared services, and big long-term
contracts, because it is going to be more difficult for private sector
contractors, for example, to see shareholder value unless they are able
to look at long-term contracts. So there is a direction there that is
about things getting bigger in terms of units of
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also a lot of opportunity to devolve services at local level to
achieve efficiencies in that way and to have more diversity of service
provision in local communities. Councils need to get that judgment
right and not be second-guessed by the Secretary of State. When someone
comes forward and says, “We want to bid to run this
service,” the local authority says, “We made a judgment
about procurement in that area over a period of time. This is the way
we are working with neighbouring authorities, and therefore we are not
going to be able to do that through community associations, but over
here there are opportunities for communities to come forward.” I
think it is really important they are able to make those judgments
locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000144">&#160;</a>

an individual local authority wants to do something different, it
should not have the opportunity to do so, just because there is a
general view about a way of working? Frankly, local authorities tend to
work like that only because they were told they had to move away from a
particular system. The way in which they could organise at local level
was prescribed. The committee system could be retained only if there
was a small inner population. They have not necessarily chosen this
path themselves—it is the status quo. I doubt that it is a big
concern for councils right now. They have got many bigger fish to fry
than the structure of the organisation, or their type of allowances and
the way they are paid.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000150">&#160;</a>

different debate. It seems to me—personally speaking rather than
organisationally speaking—that the Bill is about broadening and
deepening democracy, and spreading it out, whereas elected mayors
narrow democracy, so this does not really add up. It seems to me that
localism is about actually getting communities and a range of other
stakeholders involved in deciding the destiny of a locality. It seems
odd to narrow that by forcing elected mayors, so the tone of the Bill
is a bit surprising.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000153">&#160;</a>

about the general power of competence and expressing concern about the
limitations

                           </div>based either on pre or post-commencement of limitations—you used
the phrase “year zero”—I thought that you were
arguing that there should not be statutory limitations on what local
authorities can do. Are you really arguing that there should not be any
at all? To give you an example, let us imagine the nightmare scenario
that the BNP took control of a particular local council. Should there
not be limitations at a national level on the kind of decisions that it
could take regarding people’s rights to equal access to
services? Are there circumstances in which the Government should limit
what local authorities can
do?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000156">&#160;</a>

Sawford:</strong>
                           </em> Speaking personally, and certainly not for
my organisation, the argument was made some years ago that London
should not be allowed to parish areas because the BNP might take over,
but I always thought that that argument was weak. If you believe in
democracy, you must accept that sometimes people are elected who
national politicians will not like or who are not mainstream. So that
is not a strong enough argument for me, although I understand that
many people would have the concern that you
express.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the year zero point, what we would rather see is a general
review of the current legal framework under which councils operate. In
a sense, it says, “If it is there in statute, you cannot do it
now or in the future.” We would like to look at what the
limitations are. When a Government come in and say in a radical way,
“We are committed to localism, localism, localism,” I
think it is important to say that we are going to look back—I
know that that is difficult through legislation—and see what
those limitations are. Otherwise, the scope of the general power of
competence is clearly more limited than it might be when we look at the
language in the “Control Shift” green paper and the real
ambition to free up councils.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000158">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Very quickly, I would like to pick up a point
made by Mr McInroy. You said that you felt that the Bill was directed
at certain kinds of communities that might take the agenda forward and
that it was not relevant everywhere. In my own constituency, which is
very diverse, my experience has been that there is an even greater
desire in the deprived bits for the community to take control of its
own destiny. What kind of places do you think would not be able to take
up what the Government are offering through the localism
agenda?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000162">&#160;</a>

McInroy:</strong>
                           </em> I think that factors such as socio-economic
class will play a role, but it is difficult to decide exactly what type
of communities they are and to sketch them out. There are different
cultural factors at play here, and I think that a community that is
more deprived would perhaps have a tendency to rely more on the state
and to have less desire to take on board responsibilities for a
community centre or an asset. I am not explaining this very well, but
it seems to me that it would vary by place. There is a range of factors
to be looked at in individual localities. The Bill presumes that there
is a general state where everybody would wish to take up some of these
powers and opportunities, but I do not think that that state is
universal. I think it varies by place, and many factors play a role in
that, one of which is
deprivation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000163">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is quite a lot of concern about the role of
elected representatives—local councillors. The Bill offers the
potential for changes in governance arrangements—be that going
back to the committee system or going on to elected mayors—and
new delivery mechanisms. What do you feel should be in the Bill? Is
there a role for an enhanced scrutiny function? Even a council with a
committee system form of governance could, as a way of beefing up the
role of elected councillors, have a strong scrutiny
function—perhaps stronger than in the past. So is there scope
for that and, in particular, for new delivery mechanisms? I think the
Bill is quite silent on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000164">&#160;</a>

McInroy:</strong>
                           </em> I agree with you that the Bill is quite
silent on delivery—understandably so, because it is focusing on
empowering and unleashing all those forces of localism. We might
remember things such as local strategic partnerships, which are rapidly
being disbanded. That partnership was a vehicle through which the
public, and the commercial and social sectors, could discuss and
produce a stable community strategy. These things are useful vehicles
in terms of place stewardship. If you have different ways of delivering
services, and a flourishing of different ways in which a place is
governed, one needs to have some glue—some coagulant—that
brings all that together to shape the future destiny of the place
strategically. I think delivery vehicles such as local strategic
partnerships potentially could have a role, and the Bill generally
needs to say more about delivery mechanisms that steward
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000165">&#160;</a>

                           </em> May I pick that one up? Part of the point is
that there is a difference between the starting point that we would
have as localists, and the approach of central Government and the view
of some parliamentarians. The defining thing about whether local
political structures work tends to be the people, the place and the
things that they do. The idea that a place would be more effective if
it had a mayor rather than a leader, or that a council would be more
effective if it had a prescribed scrutiny structure rather than the one
that originated locally that was found to strong and something that
worked for the area, is something we would reject. We would say that it
is up to the councils to determine those things. You can really help
from the centre by talking about the scope of powers. That is why, for
example, we supported the extension of scrutiny to utilities. That is
why, when you look at increased commissioning of the private sector,
the role of local authority committees in scrutinising major contracts
is

biggest bits for housing are, first, incentivising the planning
system—we believe that there is more chance of homes,
particularly affordable homes, being built on the basis that
communities will be rewarded for taking them, rather than penalised as
at present. The second point is the review of, and change to, the
housing revenue account system. Please make sure that the accountants
and anyone who works for the Treasury are not allowed anywhere near the
final solution for that. They will take all the money and spend it on
things that have nothing to do with houses. We can come up with a truly
self-financing housing system if you guys are strong enough
to deliver what you know is the right
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000175">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>We have had a fascinating session,
and the questions have got to the heart of how radical this needs to
be. Three of the witnesses have clearly said that we need to have a big
change. Mr McInroy says that we should have a quantum leap, but through
incremental change. It seems to me that if you are leaping a chasm, it
is probably best not to do it in two steps. But really, this does go to
the heart of it, because in the general power of competence, we are
meaning to effect the constitutional change that Andy Sawford
recommended. Changing the default from local government existing to do
the things that the Government tell it to do, to the other way
around—that local government can do anything unless the
Government tell it not to—is the shift that I think Mr Sawford
was recommending, so the question, as was picked up by Gavin Barwell,
is: do you put no further safeguards or provisions in place at all? I
see that a perfectly defensible and rigorous approach is to say that
you completely change the defaults, and that local government can do
everything and you just rely on the ballot box to vote out councils
that do disgraceful things with their
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a concern. As much as I am attracted to extreme localism, there
may be circumstances in which minorities in communities might be
oppressed in ways that it is difficult to think of. Our thought, in
drafting the Bill, was to provide some prospective protection—I
am thinking particularly about minorities in these circumstances. The
question then is, if you think it necessary to have some protection, do
you set out in a schedule to the Bill what types of thing Parliament
should be able to intervene on? I stress that it is Parliament, because
these provisions would be enacted through statutory instruments that
would come before Parliament, so it would have the chance to say what
they should be. The judgment we came to—I am interested in the
witnesses’ reaction to this—was that if we start to think
about everything that could possibly need to be included, we would end
up with such an exhaustive schedule that it would be very long,
confusing and legalistic, and probably would not capture everything
that needed to be addressed. Therefore, we are left with the status
quo, which is continuing with the current—unsatisfactory in my
view—constitutional settlement in which local government can
only do what central Government
dictate.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have thought very hard about the question, and, advisedly, have come
down on the side of having some residual protection, particularly for
minority communities. However, it is better to allow Parliament to
decide what

                           </div>the protections should be and make them explicit when it invokes them,
rather than seek to anticipate a world perhaps decades from now. I am
interested in the witnesses’ comments: if they think we should
not have those protections, why are they confident that there will not
be abuse, or, if they think that we should have an exhaustive list of
areas where Parliament has the right to intervene, what should be on
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000183">&#160;</a>

fair to put the Bill in the historical context of a state that many
academic commentators have described as one of the most centralised in
its attitude towards local government? Some of you might be broadly
saying that you want to go further towards localism to give a general
power of competence—albeit circumscribed to some
degree—but with a power in clause 5(1) to remove restrictions by
parliamentary order, or, equally, to move from capping by the Secretary
of State to a referendum of the inhabitants of an area, surely that has
to be a step change in moving away from the centralist
inheritance.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000186">&#160;</a>

better. Some clear intentions and broad principles are what we look
for, but we would determine local guidance for ourselves. In answer to
the Minister: yes, I think we fully appreciate that there is no way
central Government will completely take all the chains off, and there
will need to be some mechanism. There are 142 places where that has
been reserved in the Bill. If the most needed ones are retained, and
the Secretary of State is asked to speak about them in the House to
give a flavour of the circumstances in which they might be used, it
would give the sector more confidence that future Administrations might
not abuse what the current Administration put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000188">&#160;</a>

The creative chaos and radical decentralisation will create a situation

place stewardship role and a representative democratic role at a local

can bring through their knowledge and local expertise, which are so
often not tapped into in the way that they need to be. Although there

support being made available to enable communities

Shropshire council, and broadly I think the Bill is an excellent idea.
I have actually spent 30 years in local government, on and off, largely
doing unpopular things that central Government told us to, so it is
quite nice to have power devolved downwards. We are equally keen to
devolve powers down to our communities. There are some things within
the Bill that I think could do with refining, and which I might have
disagreement with. Broadly speaking I think it is a welcome advance,
giving power to us, which we can then devolve downwards to local
communities and people. It is an excellent
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000199">&#160;</a>

and Chester council, one of the new councils formed on 1 April 2009.
Since our inception we have tried to do things somewhat differently,
devolving decision making and resources down to as low a level as we
possibly can. We have some quite interesting examples. We allocated
each of our local members £5,000 to invest in their community
per year. Some of them have found it incredibly difficult to make
decisions based on what their community is asking them for. That is
quite an interesting issue to deal with. Others have taken that forward
and made some real things happen in their communities, avoiding huge
amounts of bureaucracy associated with some of the simple decisions
that councils
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000200">&#160;</a>

are looking to see how we can devolve services further. We are a pilot
for the local integrated services—one of the Government
pilots—in Ellesmere Port. It is an area where there are
substantial areas of deprivation and disadvantage. One example is that
one community alone—a small community, the Westminster
estate—has 90% of its children in child poverty. That is 392
children on just one small estate in child poverty. We are looking at
how we can work with those communities to start to get them to talk to
each other within the community, let alone talk to people in authority
like ourselves, and the police, who they normally associate with
getting their door bust down, and so on. We are trying to work with
those communities to see how we can get them to engage with each other
and us, and enable them to start looking at how they can develop and
improve their communities. These are fairly good pioneering initiatives
and we are hoping that we will see some significant advances, in the
coming years, on those.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000201">&#160;</a>

would act as cabinet members for their wards, and take on the

for community challenge and ownership and are working with community
groups to see how the huge level of assets that councils own can be
used for the benefit of their communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000202">&#160;</a>

Councillor Jones talk about a very disadvantaged community and it might
be that some disadvantaged communities do not have the capacity to
develop neighbourhood plans; there is a sense that they will be left
out. Could you talk to us about those two aspects of changes you wanted

Burton:</strong>
                           </em> The community right to buy is very welcome in
that it provides a breathing space in which a community can pull
together an argument or business case for the long-term management of
the asset, but at the end of the day the decision is simply being
delayed to the point where the judgment is still, as we understand it,
going to be on no different grounds from those which exist at the
moment. It does not matter how good a community case is, if the social
value—or environmental value, as it could be in some cases, if
land is involved—of the asset is not fully recognised in the
decision-making process. If it is simply on best
consideration—simply a straight financial judgment—in
some ways you may find communities frustrated, because they put a huge
amount of commitment, effort, passion into building their case and they
still lose out at the end of the day. They feel they have been led up
the hill and then let go, and it is an even worse situation than they
were in originally. We think that that is an issue that needs to be
addressed, alongside the opportunity for a wider group of organisations
to put forward those assets that should be subject to the provisions of
the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For us,
support for neighbourhood planning is at the heart of the legislation.
It is not something that we would expect to see in the legislation, and
the provisions of the Bill only go so far. What really matters is
whether anyone does anything different as a result of the legislation.
That is very challenging, because it requires an approach to the
communication of the legislation that encourages communities to see
this as a massive opportunity. At the moment there is a risk of viewing
it either very cynically or as a set of bureaucratic hurdles that
people have to go through. The processes are quite complex: we think
they need to be no more complex, and ideally simpler.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000207">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What will
really make this Bill fly is whether the network of support is
available to help communities through the process on their own terms.
That will help a whole range of different communities across the
country. Our worry is that at the moment the Bill will be picked up
much more quickly in areas of high social capital, in rural areas, and
in those areas where developers or landowners will essentially fund the
neighbourhood planning process—in other words in areas of
development change. We would like to see a much more universal
approach, and that does require a more savvy and a better resourced
mechanism of support from Government and elsewhere than we are seeing
at the moment. The  £3 million for community support
that is being transferred from planning aid is extremely welcome, but
we are not

Barrow:</strong>
                           </em> To take up the last point, I think the role
of the councillor within the community is going to change
fundamentally, and we are doing a lot of work to develop the new model
for councillors, as proper leaders rather than as people who go into
shire hall and attend lots of meetings. So I think that is a
fundamental change. Like Cheshire West and Chester, our new unitary, we
set up 28 local joint committees around the county, which is a
partnership between us, town and parish councils and the public. They
are works in progress but they have been quite successful. We also have
a network of what we call regeneration officers, who are really
community enablers, to help people in the
community—particularly the urban ones. I take your point about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000209">&#160;</a>

undertaking an innovative process in developing our local development
framework and our site allocation management. Instead of drawing a
boundary round communities and saying that that is the extent of
development, we are saying, how many houses does that community want?
What is the need there for affordable and other types of housing? We
are establishing a number, and that number dictates the amount of
planning that will be allowed to take place. We are putting a larger
amount of land in the process, so that people can pick and choose. It
has the effect of giving people more control over what development
takes place, but it is also an opportunity. To take up Tony
Burton’s point, people are very reticent, because they are not
quite sure whether they can believe what they are hearing. I think that
is another thing we have to do: we have to sell it to the public
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000210">&#160;</a>

a question about some of the cost implications for local authorities of
the provisions contained within the Bill—whether it is the
conducting of referendums, or the cost of putting together
neighbourhood plans. Even in community asset transfer, there is a
certain enabling role that may have financial implications for local
authorities. How satisfactory do you find the provisions in the Bill on
finance and the cost that you might incur, especially as we are in very
difficult economic times? I am fully aware of the pressures your
authorities will be under.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000214">&#160;</a>

first, you may want to sell an asset for a capital receipt, but if the
community choose to use it, it effectively has nil value for a
period—perhaps 25 or 30 years. Secondly,

council elections normally cost £1 to £1.50 per person,
so this is not a cheap way of doing things. Let us be honest about it,
democracy has never been known to be cheap, and we have to live with
that. The fact is that if you want to engage with communities, have
their views on local planning issues, and get them to accept
developments though financial incentives, which are outlined in the
Bill, that may be a way of making it work. It certainly is not working
at the moment, so we have to do something. This gives us an opportunity

point that this is our job as local councillors. All my councillors are

be a certain wry smile in some parts of the country where there is a
very antagonistic relationship between neighbouring authorities, but,
equally, it is difficult to prescribe solutions to that in legislation.
We are looking forward to clarity on sustainable development. The duty
is to embrace and deliver it, which hangs behind all the legislation on
the planning side. What policy framework will all this take place in?

defined, it might not be a very helpful force. There is a lot riding on

have an important role to play in bringing the provisions of the Bill

deploying different skills from those that some of the ward councillors

stimulate, encourage and support creativity and ideas; and they have to
build their community’s confidence to express its views, and
then help it through the process. Of course, they will have views as
part of that process—no one is suggesting otherwise—but
the days when people just followed their elected representatives are
way behind us, and that is not what communities are looking

the interests of the wider community and the interests of a particular

unpopular facility—an incinerator or a hostel for a particularly

the right mechanism for resolving the inevitable hostility of the
locality or neighbourhood when a proposal is made to locate such a
facility in that area, and the responsibilities of the local authority
to make provision for the needs of its area? How should that be
resolved, particularly if the neighbourhood does not have a

You certainly thought that one of the potential weaknesses was that the
community right to challenge would only be applicable or be more
attractive in areas of high social capital or rural areas. Is it not
the case that the Bill might facilitate the building of civic capacity
in areas of higher social deprivation? I am thinking of part of an area
that I represent in Sandwell in the west midlands, which has relatively
high levels of deprivation. Will the provision in the Bill encourage
capacity building in precisely those areas that require the building of
new social capital? Do you see that as potentially a positive aspect of
the
provisions?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000237">&#160;</a>

Burton:</strong>
                           </em> Absolutely. There is no question about it. In
going beyond planning decisions about where developments go, that will
stimulate—in all sorts of unexpected ways, which is one of the
strengths of the Bill—that coming together of people to think
about the future of their area, which will have many other spin-offs.
What I am saying is that that will not just happen; it will require
support, and in different ways. That support will need to be tailored
to the needs of a Sandwell community, which will be different from the
needs of an east London community or of a Hull community. They will all
have their particular needs, and there needs to be a recognition that
people do not just instantly fill the vacuum. The social capital does
not arrive, and people do not come together or facilitate those ideas;
they need support alongside
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000238">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Democracy is not a simple business, and there
will be conflict. No one is suggesting that this legislation suddenly
answers all those conflicts. I would emphasis two things: first, there
is still a really important role for the strategic policies within the
local plan, and any neighbourhood plan needs to ensure that it conforms
with that. Certainly, some development examples that Mr Raynsford gave,
such as an incinerator, would fall within that framework just as the
housing numbers do. So, there is that mechanism for resolving things at
a more-than-local, or more-than-neighbourhood level.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
Bill is relatively quiet, as are the Government more generally, about
the role of the public’s involvement in that local planning
process. There is a lot of focus on the neighbourhood planning process,
but the local planning process will actually still be fundamental. We
have evidence that where people are involved in the right way, they can
make mature judgments and have mature input into hard, knotty problems
in a local area. If they are brought into some of those strategic
choices in the right way—on the front foot, feeling that they
are genuinely being listened to, embraced and engaged, as opposed to
just being consulted—there is a greater chance of resolving more
of the conflict. That does not suggest that we will be able to, as it
were, ensure that this is an entirely smooth
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000244">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The evidence is that it is not axiomatic that a
deprived community has no capacity to innovate. In Castle Vale in my
constituency, there is the remarkable Castle Vale community housing
association, which is, arguably, the best of its kind in Britain.
However, the evidence is also that deprived communities, by definition,
find it more difficult to innovate without capacity, support and

question in the previous session was whether rights, such as the right

are democratically elected—and that could include parish and
town councils, many of which are not elected, because there are no
processes, and they are relatively moribund—that would exclude a
large part of the country. We believe that there is a role for
communities, be they civic societies or other means in which
communities come together, and they have an awful lot to offer. They
also feel a bit done unto by local authorities and others, and they
need more rights to shape their areas. We do not think that the only
route for doing that is to make everywhere parished, for example. We
would love to see more parish councils and town councils, but we do not
think that that is the only route to effective community involvement in
shaping the future of someone’s area and building pride in the
place they

government 50 years ago, when  I began my doctorate on how my

government with John Stewart for nearly 30 years. We have pretty
similar views. The Bill should not be called a Localism Bill, and the
Government know that. It is a centralism Bill, because it confers many
powers on the Secretary of State to issue regulations and orders to
interfere in local affairs. My second and final point about the Bill is
that it is terribly confused and ambiguous, because it is trying to do
two things: decentralise to local government, and decentralise to
sub-local government entities. They have not sorted out how to
reconcile those two
approaches.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000261">&#160;</a>

Birmingham university and the Institute of Local Government Studies,
where I have been for 40 years. Obviously, I agree with a lot of what
George says on that issue—it is just the odd matter that we do
not agree on. I would just add two things. First, on the presentation
of the Bill, it is still a bit obscure to me what localism is, from the
Government’s point of view. That is one reason why the
Government have not apparently tackled the real obstacle to localism,
which is the attitude and practices of central Government
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A lot of
Governments have, in fact, said that they will decentralise, build up
local government and abolish controls, but they always seem to creep
back again. Michael Heseltine abolished 300 controls, and it was not
too long before there were 300 controls again. Talking about localism,
and even legislating on it, will make little difference unless central
Government review their whole system of working. We have put forward
suggestions to assist that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
point I want to make is on the other neglected subject. The Government
speak of decentralising to communities, and I think that everyone
welcomes that. The Government also speak about decentralisation to
local authorities. However, what has not really been faced up to is the
relationship between them—the Government and local
authorities—or in so far as it has been faced up to, it is
resolved by drawing up another regulation. In other words, it has been
resolved centrally rather than, as we believe it should be resolved, by
putting the onus on local authorities to have a duty to develop
community empowerment and community involvement. It should be left to
local authorities, working in partnership with local communities,
because I believe that there are many problems about community groups
that still need to be faced. Are they representative of their areas?
Are they accountable to their areas? Will they really be accountable,
as public bodies are supposed to be accountable? Allegedly, that last
issue has been raised by the head of the civil service, Gus
O’Donnell.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000264">&#160;</a>

previously held within DCLG, rather than across the rest of Whitehall.

correctly, you say that there is a problem with community groups and
whether they are accountable. Is not one of the advantages of what the
Bill proposes that we will trust people to use their own responsibility
in exercising their own power in their own community? Through the local
authorities, we are re-empowering people through local elections;
councillors will be that bit more responsible with the power that they
get, and will have to be very aware of what the public think, because
that might empower them at elections to exert that power in a way that,
at the moment, has probably dissipated due to central
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000270">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Obviously, I would favour community groups
that are close to their communities, involved in them, and really speak
for them. However, I am not certain how the Bill provides for that.
There are certain mechanisms by which people secure their
representative. There is one marvellous bit of the Bill that says that
a neighbourhood forum must have at least three people living in the
area, which hardly makes it representative. However, even if that body
has a large number of members, there still remains the issue of how we
actually secure the fact that it is being representative and
accountable to local people, and that the financial controls are
adequate in that situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If community
groups—representative, accountable, and carrying out proper
financial and legal controls—are operating and flourish, that
situation is to be welcomed, but realism tells us that things could go
badly wrong. A small elite, which could be out of touch with people,
might dominate the community group. The group might depend on a few
people who then leave the area, and the thing might collapse. There
might be financial scandals and controls.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Realism means
that we must face up to these things, but I do not believe that can be
done nationally. I want responsibility at local level, because that can
be done adequately, as you said, only by local councillors who 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 37<a class="bkMark" name="Column37">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are concerned about their communities and their areas. It will only work
if local authorities are enthusiastic about community development, and

problems could suddenly arise, such as conflict between local
authorities and community groups, so we must also work on the problem
of how much attention groups must pay to authorities’ policies.
Some of that has been worked out, to a degree, in the planning parts,
but not in other cases, which illustrates my general point that the
relationship between the two forms of decentralisation is not
adequately dealt with in the

questions. I worry very much about the proposals on shadow mayors. Such
proposals mean that the Secretary of State will take powers to appoint
an individual to a political position in an authority, which sets a
very dangerous precedent. In addition, I am not clear what happens if
control changes in an authority in the period in which the shadow mayor
is in office. Would the Secretary of State appoint a new shadow mayor
in such circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000278">&#160;</a>

about the imposition of referendums in 12 authorities—or is it
11, because I believe that Leicester has decided to have an elected
mayor? I worry about that, because if the local council wanted a
referendum, it could hold one. If the public wanted one, they could
hold one—if 5% of the electorate sign a petition, they can have
a referendum. In other words, far from exercising localism in this
instance, the Secretary of State is exercising centralism when there is
a mechanism for both the citizens and the local authority to call a
referendum if they want.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000279">&#160;</a>

We think that this ought to be an opportunity to encourage more
entrepreneurial councils, so that the tax relationship becomes only one
way in which money is raised for local purposes. We think that the
powers to charge and to trade ought to be supervised by external
auditors, rather than circumscribed in the way that they are in the

operate with the consent of its local people, selling to willing
customers, and supervised by the external auditor to ensure that it

advocates of this for many years. The issues, as they stand at the
moment, are that the restrictions, in terms of the Secretary of State
retaining the power to impose an order on an authority or authorities,
actually undermine, in our view, the philosophy underpinning the
change. What it will mean is that, ultimately, from a position where,
locally, legal advice is often very risk-averse, we would hope to open
people’s minds to innovation. But actually, what this will do is
introduce a slight nagging doubt that the Secretary of State might
think that a certain action is a bad idea. My suggestion would simply
be to delete subsections (3) to (5) of clause
5.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000283">&#160;</a>

duty of the elected local authority to empower community groups. I
think that decisions should be taken by people who have been elected.
Bodies that are not elected should not be taking decisions on matters
that affect the whole community. I am all in favour of community groups
doing as much as possible, actively bringing pressure to influence and
being involved, but decisions should be left to elected members. I am
in favour of parish councils and having their equivalents in urban
areas too. They would be proper elected bodies. I am worried if we give

their voice is often limited to a short meeting to gather their views
on the annual budget, which is a statutory requirement of local

meeting you spoke about was a farce in many areas—the meeting at
which the private sector commented on the budget. However, I believe
that the development of local strategic partnerships, where the private
sector has been encouraged to come in and work with the local
authority, has created a different atmosphere. I don’t see the
Bill in its present form making a contribution either way to the issue

about community groups’ voluntary bodies and that such bodies
might quite rightly hide the fact that they perhaps have a tendency to
get out of touch with the wider community and to be dominated by one or
two over-powerful people and so on, am I being unfair in saying that
some community groups make exactly the same criticisms of some local
authorities? I will not be invidious by naming any, but we have had
examples of authorities dominated by one or two powerful personalities
who are perhaps not as in touch with their local communities as they
ought to be. Rather than putting the two in conflict, can any member of
the panel suggest ways in which we could overcome such difficulties? If
I might be a little provocative, election alone does not seem to be the
answer, because such problems have arisen even in elected

                           </em> If I may start, ultimately the issue is
relevant to the community right to challenge and issues around
communities taking over assets and neighbourhood planning. If you have
a transfer of responsibilities, how will you ensure methods of recourse
and that public money is used properly, and to what extent, when public
money changes hands or if decisions are made affecting other citizens
in the area? That is, essentially, the main issue in my
mind—that the decisions reflect the stakeholders with an
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000310">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the community right to challenge, for instance, on public
services, that mainly seems to be a commissioning or contracting
arrangement. The voluntary body or other part of the public sector
would come forward and take on the service, and therefore, through that
method, you would have means of accountability, as you would if you
contracted with a private organisation. In fact, we think that is
sufficient, such that you could start opening it up across government,
so it is not simply local councils, but Whitehall services as well. Why
is that right to challenge not open to Jobcentre Plus services or
health services and so
on?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
is a public services issue which can probably be managed, because it is
more of a contractual and commissioning arrangement. When you get over
to the planning side of things, it gets much more complex. In our view,
the issue is about what localism means. Localism recognises that,
ultimately, you try and devolve as far as you sensibly can, but you
have to allow decisions to be made in a practical way as well. A lot of
these decisions, if we are talking about planning, are about things on
which communities will disagree, perhaps between generations or with
people sitting outside the specific community who want some type of
infrastructure. So, on that issue, it is an issue of the scale of
devolution. Should we be devolving such things right down to the local
level, potentially undermining the strategic
approaches?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000312">&#160;</a>

both representative democracy based on elections and the participation

particularly important between elections. But there has to be a point
at which you realise that decisions taken for the benefit of the whole
community should be a matter for elected representatives. The other

look at the leadership of local authorities, or even at the leadership
of central Government, there are two types of leadership that you need:
political leadership looking out to the world of politics and handling
the politics of public policy making; and administrative leadership
looking into the worlds of bureaucracy and

two leadership roles. When you look at different systems around the
world, you find that there is always a duality of leadership—one
person who deals with the politics and one person who deals with the
administration. Whether a local authority or a central Government is a
success or not depends on the interaction and the partnership between
the political leader and the administrative leader. Trying to fuse them
in one person seems to me to be dangerous
nonsense.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000325">&#160;</a>

Jones said at the beginning? You referred to sub-local government
entities, which I think was a disparaging remark. In my patch, a lot of
people would regard sub-local government entities as the neighbourhood
where they live, possibly where they send their children to school,
although possibly not where they work. That is what they would define
it as, but it does not always match the existing ward structure, or the
town hall, which could be a long way away. For a lot of people in those
neighbourhoods, the existing structures have not worked, which has been
shown by the turnout in local elections. Perhaps this Bill does

of people who are operating beneath the level of the elected local
authority. I could call them sub-local organisations or associations.
To me, the word “entity” is not a disparaging word. You
have put your finger on a very important point. If you look at
different wards and communities, there are all sorts of bodies who
would claim to speak out for different parts of the ward. Who is to be

would comment on my view that the Treasury is reluctant to let go of
the levers of control through central Government finance. The ghost of
Derek Hatton is still with us, in that the Government will not trust

view behind the centralism Bill we are looking

                           </em> It is one of the reasons often put forward
for it. If you draft all your legislation with the assumption that
there are going to be bad councils, you will end up with a very
centralist solution. Derek Hatton was dealt with in the end—by
his own party. Situations will often correct themselves without
detailed
intervention.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000335">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
relation to that, I emphasise that our objection regarding the 142
regulations is the assumption that detailed prescription is necessary.
Even when we might agree with what is recommended in a bit of
regulation, those 142 regulations sum up the relationship between
central and local government. We recognise that central Government must
operate where there is a national interest, and where there is a
national interest, you can see duties imposed upon local authorities.
However, we do not want a situation in which central Government specify
not merely the duty, but the procedures, the criteria, the nature of
decisions and so on in great detail, which is what seems to be implied
by the plethora of regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000336">&#160;</a>

important that we have a Localism Bill with more freedoms. I was a bit
puzzled by the evidence that we heard from the two professors. On the
one hand, they want fewer prescriptions from Ministers but, on the
other hand, they think that a duty to work with community groups should
be imposed on local authorities. What we thought we had established was
a right for community groups to insist on their role in their
neighbourhoods and communities. I am interested to see exactly what you
think the balance of that relationship should

treatment. It is proper for a local authority to be in close touch with
its locality. Indeed, I would have thought that it was in elected
councillors’ interests to be really representative of their
areas and to welcome community involvement and the opportunity to hear
what their localities are saying. It is right to put a duty on local
authorities to engage and empower localities, but it would not be

dichotomy between two sets of witnesses. One set has a glass-half-full
view of the Bill, as Mr Myers and Dr Keohane think that it is broadly
going the right way, although there are bits with which they disagree.
The professors have a view that the glass is very much half empty,
however, because they say it is all terribly centralistic and that it
will end in grief and woe. If we are saying that a decision on the
neighbourhood plan is ultimately taken by a vote of the community in
that area, that is hardly giving powers to any old group, is it,

Pipe:</strong>
                           </em> My name is Mayor Jules Pipe. I am the directly
elected mayor of Hackney, but I am here in my capacity as the chair of
London Councils, which has particular concerns about four areas of the
Bill. The first is the limitations on the general power of competence
and how that perhaps relates to the codification of the relationship
between central and local government. The second is the issue of
councils’ contributions to EU fines. The third relates to
planning issues, because clarity is needed on how some of the
provisions will operate, and that also connects with the issue of
referendums and how they will be used to engage with the community on
adopting local plans. Fourthly and finally is the issue about mayoral
development corporations. While there is a great deal of consensus on a
number of issues between the Mayor of London and London Councils, even
particularly about MDCs, the Mayor does not seek to have more than one.
I think that there is an issue about London mayors going forward, and
about there being no checks and balances enabling local authorities to
have some say about whether MDCs should be set up in their
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000355">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Unison’s
concerns about the Bill are threefold. The first, and probably the most
major, is about the community right to challenge, which we believe does
not live up to the title that it puts forward. It does not necessarily
mean that a local community will gain more control or influence, and
the whole approach to how the local community can be involved in
improving and developing local services is not reflected in the
sections covering it.

                           </div>We have concerns about the centralisation provisions, some of which are
included in the community right to challenge, with more powers being

aspect about which we have concerns is the part around council tax
referendums, which we believe is so complex that it effectively gives
the Secretary of State the ability to cap council tax increases. At a
time of cuts, that is obviously quite significant
for local authorities and for the amount of money that they 
can spend on their services, and therefore the quality of those

                           </strong> I would like to ask Simon Watson—although,
obviously, other witnesses can comment—about the concerns that
you have just expressed about the possible impact of the community
right to challenge on service quality. You talk about having a vision
of empowering service users and people living locally to work alongside
front-line staff, but you clearly have concerns about the community
right to challenge. Will you tell us more about that?<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000359">&#160;</a>

                              <strong>Simon
Watson:</strong>
                           </em> The first thing I would like to say is that
we recognise that local communities and local community groups have a
huge role to play in developing services and making sure that they are
locally accountable. Many small community groups develop services in
their own right and have innovated where necessary. They are important
groups with which local authorities should be working.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The way in
which the Bill puts the community right to challenge into practice is
somewhat different from what I would have imagined. It gives voluntary
groups the right to require a council to look at its services and to
decide, on the Secretary of State’s guidance, whether they
should be put out to procurement or not. It does not say that they have
to be local groups; it says that they should be non-profit-making
groups. Very large housing associations, for example, or health
providers that might want to expand into an area can put in a request
and compel the council to look at effectively privatising that part of
its services. In addition, in terms of localism, there is no
requirement in the Bill for consultation with local people about that,
and the local authority is not given the option to accept or decline on
its own volition, as regulations will control that. That does not seem
to fit with the localist claims for the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
top of that, before I come to the direct effect on quality, we do not
know who is going to win the procurement exercise. Under European law,
a procurement exercise would be required for any service that is
challenged by a part of the local community. Just because a community
group says, “We feel we could run your drugs rehabilitation
project in a better way, and we would like to bid for that,” the
service will go out to procurement. A wide range of organisations might
like to bid for it, including large private sector organisations, which
would be the complete antithesis of localism.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
our concerns about quality, the mechanism that is being put in place
could lead to the asset stripping of the public sector. The Secretary
of State has the right to allow other organisations, by future
regulation, to invoke the community right to request. In the future, if
the Secretary of State gave the power, we could therefore see large
private sector corporations bidding for such services. That is not
localism.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000363">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The kind of
fragmentation that might occur because of that process is likely to
lead to services getting worse. How will a local authority ensure that
it can provide joined-up services if it can be requested under the Bill
that small parts of those services should be privatised? How do you
make sure that there is a seamless service that the public can access?
Is it clear how the public will influence what those services are?
There are a whole range of issues in the Bill that
relate to ensuring that services are of a high
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000364">&#160;</a>

everything that Mr Watson said, but that is not the capacity in which I
am here. I would think, however, that there would probably be broad
consensus among all the political groups on London Councils on Mr
Watson’s point about the perverse outcome of a large private
sector provider from perhaps another country—let alone somewhere
else in the country—being the outcome, when the local choice
would have been either the local authority or a local third sector
provider. Local people could end up with what might be their least

challenge a contract—they do not currently have that
right—whereas the perverse outcome that you are talking about
involving procurement exercises could still happen at the moment? The
Bill actually gives communities something that they do not have. Of
course, under procurement rules, there is the potential for the outcome
you have outlined, but that is no different from the status quo

authorities design their contracts so that small, local providers will

This is allowing what I would describe as asset stripping, because it
will allow small numbers of people employed by the council to say that
they want to run a specific bit of a service, or it might allow an
external organisation to come in and say, “We want to run that
bit of a service.” That is no way to provide the comprehensive,
joined-up services that exist at the moment. If small contracts are put
out, the community can work with the council to bid for them and get
them, but that is quite different. That is  a planned way for
the council to look at how it can provide its services, rather than
this ad hoc fragmentation.

about a referendum, particularly in a London context. I know you

to conduct? If you have, do you think that is a good and appropriate

Simon Milton:</strong>
                           </em> We have made a calculation. Because the
GLA is a panel and an authority, it would be required to hold a
referendum panel. The cost of doing that, if it were to be combined
with our quadrennial elections, would be around £5 million. If
it were to be taken outside that period, and you would basically have
to run a referendum with nothing else going on, that would cost
£11 million. The GLA’s annual budget is 
£70 million, so you can see that that would be quite a
disproportionate burden for the GLA to have to carry. One of the things
we would urge this Committee and, indeed, the Government to consider is
injecting some kind of requirement relating to proportionality or value
for money. That would mean we would not be faced with having to hold
such a referendum for small issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000375">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another angle
to this that is of concern is that under the GLA Act, the Mayor is the
person responsible for setting public transport fares. A great deal has
to be done by way of consultation, scrutiny and so on before that can
take place. It is a very transparent process and fares have to be set
bearing in mind the needs of the transport service over a long period
of time—investment plans and so on. It would be incredibly
disruptive to business planning if that power were in some way to be
undermined or jeopardised by the referendum provision that, under our
reading, would be applied. Fare setting is one of the most political
things any Mayor can do and they will be held accountable by the
electorate for whether they have got it right or not at the ballot box.
It would be very destabilising to inject a referendum into that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000376">&#160;</a>

Bill’s provisions allow the Secretary of State to effectively
set a limit beyond which they deem council tax increases to be
excessive. If a local authority wants to increase council tax beyond
that, they have to hold a local referendum. At the moment, councils do
their planning using medium-term financial plans, so that they can plan
for their income and expenditure over a number of years. The Secretary
of State may decide the limit for excessive council tax increases quite
close to when that decision has to be made by local authorities. That
means that first of all, on a year-by-year basis, financial plans may
have to be quite radically changed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000379">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Also, if a
local authority wanted to have a council tax increase in excess of what
the Secretary of State had laid down, they would have to make some very
rapid changes to their plans. They would potentially have to go out to
a referendum. If they lost that referendum, they would have to make
very short-term changes to their financial plans, resulting in quite
chaotic arrangements for the provision of their services for the coming
year. In addition to the cost of the documentation that would have to
be sent out to local people to give them the full details and to try to
make it understandable, that is sufficient to deter the vast majority
of local authorities from ever thinking about challenging the excessive
limit that the Secretary of State puts in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000380">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On the mayoral development
corporations, before the last general election the Mayor of London
published his wish list for issues concerning London and devolution.
One of those was that the Olympic park zone should become a development
corporation, so that there would be a single place to go in order to
ensure that the regeneration of east London, which remains the biggest
single regeneration challenge in London, could be dealt with
effectively. That argument was supported by the Government and
therefore we are happy with what is provided for in the Bill. But it is
the only development corporation that Mayor Johnson would wish to set
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000383">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We were
advised that it probably was not going to be possible just to refer to
that development corporation in the Bill because that would risk making
it hybrid, hence the general power that is being created. I do
understand that there will be concern among London’s boroughs

                           </div>about what might happen in the future. We would have no objection to
discussing ways in which safeguards could be put in place to prevent
that from happening, or to prevent a rogue Mayor putting in place loads
of these things all over London. For one thing, it wouldn’t
actually be necessary for a Mayor to do that in order to exercise the
right amount of influence in a strategic sense across London.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000384">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">But if you
are going to put in a safeguard, it has to be one that allows for a
development corporation to be set up, if thought necessary. A borough
veto power would, I suspect, mean that another such body would never be
set up. It might be a more appropriate safeguard to have a vote with a
threshold in the London assembly, which is there to scrutinise the
Mayor, in order to move on from the one that is
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000385">&#160;</a>

                           </em> As one of the local boroughs, I can certainly
allay any fears that the London Councils issues are anything to do with
the Olympic park MDC. There are key areas of principle of establishment
of an MDC: representation, local representation and the area that it
encompasses. All these are key areas of argument that are pretty much
sorted out in east London, so it is not about that one. But having seen
how we have come close to an agreement in east London and accepted it
among the four boroughs that are affected by the MDC, I can see that it
could be very fraught elsewhere. There have to be some safeguards
against its being simply imposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000386">&#160;</a>

there might not be any plans at the moment for the London mayoralty to
be able to access NNDR—business rates—if there were a
move to widen TIFs or the access to TIFs through future legislation,
when we are moving to a situation where local boroughs could be faced
with being heavily reliant on their NNDR if there is a re-localisation
of business rates, it will make it even more important that on a whim a
body could be established that could not only have great planning
powers over an area, but an ability to remove significant amounts of,
if not current NNDR, certainly growth in NNDR, which could be siphoned
away from the borough and spent elsewhere. There are great concerns now
but also potential concerns for the

Simon Milton:</strong>
                           </em> We object in principle to the concept
of delegating fines without also delegating the funds, resources and
powers to take the steps necessary to avoid the fines. The EU is
currently taking action against both the UK and Italy for air quality
measures. A number of other European countries—Austria, Spain,
Germany—were all able to negotiate an extension to their
obligation. We were not in the UK. Instead, I think the attitude of the
previous and present Government has been, “We’ll see what
we can do to get through this, but it is not a problem because we will
just delegate the fine down to the London level.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000389">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think that
if the Government are to proceed with this, some very important
safeguards need to be put in place. I would stress two things in
particular. The first is that the fines should not simply be levied
until Government had exhausted all their other powers—powers of
direction, policy powers and so on—that could have a mitigating 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 52<a class="bkMark" name="Column52">&#160;</a>
                           </div>effect. In other words, fines should not be the first resort; the
delegation of the fine should be the last resort. Secondly, it should
not be for Ministers to delegate the fine; there should be a judicial
process, so that the fine can be apportioned in the right way. There
are many aspects of air quality in London and other cities that are
simply beyond the powers of those cities to take action against,
because it requires changes in national policy or strategies. It would
be quite wrong for the whole fine to be levied at the local level. For
example, in London there are three waste sites that contribute to our
exceeding air quality levels. Those waste sites are operated by
boroughs, they are regulated by the Environment Agency and yet it is
the Mayor of London who will face a fine if those sites continue to
exceed air quality levels. So this issue really needs to be thought
through very carefully and the idea that it can simply be passed down
without further calibration would be a huge mistake and quite
unfair.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000390">&#160;</a>

                           </em>There is the same issue for local
authorities. Ultimately with air pollution, although we share
responsibility for it with the Mayor of London, short of barricading my
borough to commuters and erecting giant fans that blow the pollution
beyond our borders—obviously, that would be complete nonsense.
So we would have to pay our fair share, or a determined share, and yet
we have one of the lowest rates of car ownership—probably the
lowest rate of car ownership—in the capital. So it would seem
particularly iniquitous that some sort of blanket apportionment could
be put in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000391">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously,
another good example is waste. Again, I will use my own borough as an
example. We have a hugely extensive system of recycling collection,
down to food waste on a weekly basis, as well as weekly bin
collections—I say that, just before we get into that area. And
yet 50% of the properties in my borough are flats and therefore it is
very difficult to get participation in recycling to the high levels of
areas where people have long drives that can have five wheely-bins at
the end, all with the different types of recyclable materials in them.
So how one would go about apportioning a failure to achieve a
particularly high recycling rate would have  to be very
carefully thought through if it is to be seen as acceptable by local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000392">&#160;</a>

moment, it is the responsibility of the UK Government to negotiate with
the EU either about getting the ability to extend the deadline or
indeed to be excused the fine. So we are wholly reliant on the
Government’s negotiating determination. Currently the Mayor has
an air quality strategy that includes a number of measures that we
believe would bring London’s air quality well below the levels
that the EU has stipulated and yet several of those measures have not
been included in the Government’s submission to the EU because
they do not believe that it is necessary to include them. So we are not
even being allowed to make our best case in order to avoid the
fines.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000393">&#160;</a>

responded to. There is a lack of clarity about how these community
plans and neighbourhood forums would work and how anything drawn up by
such a body would operate, or even something drawn up by competing
bodies because it is not clear, if more than one organisation came
forward to propose neighbourhood plans, how those competing plans would
be seen by the authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000394">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Also, what is
an “area” or “neighbourhood”? I think that
is an issue for every local authority up and down the country,
particularly urban areas that are not parished. How would that be
determined? Yes, there are wards, but why should the randomness of the
electoral divvying-up of votes determine what actually is a
neighbourhood or not? Many wards can go right through a town centre, so
again wards are not necessarily the best basis on which to determine
neighbourhoods. So there is that uncertainty. Also, how will these
plans dovetail with the local development framework or the unitary
development plan, if that is what the borough is still relying on?

at the moment, and will retain the power, to look at how they will
deliver their services. Unison’s view is that directly provided
services provide the best value and the best quality in most
circumstances, but local authorities have that power. If they want to
put a service out to tender, they already have the power to do so. If
they want to talk to local groups about how a service is being
provided, and work with them to use their ideas and provide that
service in the best way, they have the power to do that at the moment
as well. The legislation effectively gives external organisations the
right to require small, medium or large parts of council services to be
put out to procurement. That is not a way to provide quality,

issue with standards is technical; we were not consulted on it, and if
we had been, hopefully, it would have been picked up. The Bill says
that the existing standards regime is being abolished, but it is up to
local authorities to have their own home development regime. As far as
the GLA is concerned, the power to develop the local regime was given
to the assembly rather than to the Mayor and the assembly, and yet the
Mayor has to be subject to it. The assembly agrees with the Mayor on
this. It would be appropriate for it to be amended so that the Mayor
and assembly together construct the new standards regime in

                           </em> Personally, I do. I have long been
supportive of elected mayors. There is a difference between an elected
mayor for London and my colleague, Jules Pipe, who is the elected mayor
of a borough, because those bodies perform very different functions.
The GLA is a strategic body; it is not a direct service provider in the
way that the London borough of Hackney is. Under the Act constructed so
expertly by Ministers in the past, the Mayor of London has the power to
appoint up to 12 people to form an administration with him or her when
he or she comes in. They have a cadre of people who will help them run
the place, but I think the Bill proposes that the new mayors will
operate more as local councils, in that cabinets will have to be formed
from other elected members. Those mayors will have less ability than
there is in London to bring in experts to work for them directly. The
Government may wish to think about that as this goes
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000404">&#160;</a>

all its functional bodies pay the living wage. We are doing our best to

                           </em> Yes. Incidentally, I am probably different from
Simon inasmuch as I would be happy obviously for a London living wage
to be in force for all local authorities. Local authorities desperately
need clarity about our ability to apply a living wage clause. It is a
matter of debate. I have been on a number of forums where it is heavily
contested on either side as to whether local authorities have the
ability to introduce a London living wage clause. Whatever the
situation between our laws, such as the best value legislation or EU
laws, which I believe are for debate yet again because some action has
happened in Europe recently, there lies a problem. Procurement officers
and legal officers throughout the country regard it as impossible to
dictate that there should be a living wage payable in any contracts.
That is very relevant if we are moving into another series of
outsourcings through the mechanism that we discussed
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000414">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
best that anyone has been able to do when they claim that they adopt a
London living wage for letting contracts—this applies to the GLA
or has done—is that we will ask for a tender price both with the
London living wage and without, if their normal wage grades are below,
and we can only let a contract on the higher rate if the company is
explicit about what we are getting for it, and that there is added
value. Otherwise, legal officers and procurement officers will say that
we cannot let that contract and that we must take the lower tender.
There have been many instances when members would like to adopt a
contract with the London living wage, but are prevented from doing so.
That lack of clarity goes through local government and regional
government
equally.<a class="bkMark" name="11012571000415">&#160;</a>

would question how often the local community would be able to come
together to buy it and keep it open as a pub. In reality, it is far
more likely to allow time for perhaps a local faith group to organise

itself on how services are provided. However, is that challenge best
served by giving the service to a different service provider or by the
local authority interacting with a community group and saying,
“How can we change the way we provide our service best?”
so that the eye is kept on what is happening to how the service is
provided, rather than the local authority looking at who is providing
the
