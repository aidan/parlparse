</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. When we debated Government amendments to give effect to the European Court of Human Rights Gaskin judgment on 12 May, I promised to make available a paper to explain the purpose of the amendments, which were rather technical because of that judgment. I have arranged for a copy of the paper to be put in the Library. I thought, however, that it would be for the Committee's convenience to make copies available this morning, with your permission. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who asked for the paper, will find it helpful; indeed, I have given him and you an advance copy. For those who want copies, they are on the Table next to the copies of Hansard.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I am most grateful to the Minister for the paper, which I will add to my recess reading in preparation for the Committee's return in June.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the Minister for his efficiency and courtesy.
<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Crime and taxation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North-East):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 17, line 31, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(za) (i) the protection of the freedoms of members of the public, or
<P>
(ii) public security,
<P>
where such data re proposed by a public body or organisation controlled or regulated under statutory provisions,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 195, in page 17, line 32, leave out from `(a)' to the' in line 34 insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, or (b).'.
<P></UL></FONT>
No. 196, in page 17, line 32, at end insert
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
"whether or not a crime has been committed"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<B>Mr. White:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to seek clarification because consideration of the Crime and Disorder Bill is taking place in parallel to consideration of this Bill, and I have concerns about the interaction of the two Bills.<P>
<P>
Clause 28 refers to the disclosure of information for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the prevention and detection of crime"	.</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the Crime and Disorder Bill, the police and local authorities could meet and information could be disclosed that resulted in them going to court to get an anti-social behaviour order. That is perfectly fine under both Bills. The same people could, however, talk about the same information, and the result could be that a possession order was sought. It is not clear whether that would be covered under the Bill.
<P>
There should be a clear statement in the Bill that that kind of disclosure is within its ambit, and the commissioner should issue guidance along those lines. My concern is that court cases could result in it not being possible to pursue what everybody agrees is the right course of action. The spirit of the Crime and Disorder Bill would then be broken. The amendment would ensure that clause 102 of the Crime and Disorder Bill and clause 28 of this Bill were in harmony on criminal and civil actions.
<P>
To make an analogy with the Data Protection Act 1984, everyone knows that political parties get the electoral register from local authorities. Recently, however, the registrar has told certain local authorities that that was not the purpose for which the act was designed and that they should not give political parties the electoral register on tape. That view has been challenged, and I suspect that the registrar will lose the argument if she pursues it. The purpose of the amendment is to make sure that such uncertainty is not replicated in civil proceedings under the Crime and Disorder Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Amendments Nos. 195 and 196 touch on an issue that, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge, is thus far unresolved. We have tabled them in a constructive spirit because we believe that at least one small improvement could be made to clause 18.
<P>
We discussed during previous sittings the concerns of a number of commercial organisations regarding the prevention and detection of fraud. They believe that the Bill's enhanced data subject access provisions, which go beyond those of the 1984 Act, will create serious difficulties for them in their anti-fraud and risk assessment work. The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters and the Association of British Insurers are worried that insurance frauds are becoming increasingly difficult to prevent, detect and investigate. The Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System, to which I have referred on behalf of the credit card companies, believes that its work in countering credit card fraud should be covered by the exemptions in clause 28.
<P>
The British Bankers Association has pointed out that the police rely on the banks to collect evidence for fraud and other cases and that the public rely on banks to ensure that the banking system is safe and crime-free. Customers must be protected from people with criminal intentions.I stress the word "intentions"	 because the narrowest reading of the definition in clause 28(1) refers not to the intention to commit crime, but to crime. That is a subtle difference.
<P>
We are all customers of the types of commercial organisations that we are discussing, and in the long run the cost of fraud falls on our pockets. The exemptions in subsections (a) and (b) are not sufficient for the purposes of such commercial organisations, because much of the personal data that they process relates to suspicion of fraud, or to the investigation of a possible fraud or crime for which the evidence is not yet convincing. A policy holder may make a claim on their policy that appears to be dubious, but there may be insufficient proof either to establish fraud or to repudiate the contract. In the absence of absolute proof, any reported opinion of a loss adjuster or a member of the financial institution's anti-avoidance team is bound to be based on subjective comment, which needs to be expressed with complete freedom and candour. That type of comment could not be made, given the limitation of the exemptions, if the policy holder or credit card customer exercised his subject access right under clause 7. In many anti-avoidance cases of that kind, proof that a crime has taken place is not established for a long time, or is never established. It is worrying, therefore, that the exemptions in clause 28(1)(a) and (b) would not apply and that the data subject's consent would be needed.
<P>
I shall not delay the Committee by quoting further examples, as I think that the Minister and his officials are aware of the concerns that I have outlined.
<P>
The wording proposed by amendment No. 195 for the data exemption in relation to the crime and prosecution of offenders is contained in article 13 of the directive.I do not propose that wording for its own sake, or to delay the Committee. The amendment would significantly improve the exemption in clause 28(1)(a). At the very least, the word "investigation"	 should be added. It is contained in article 13, but not in the exemptions in paragraphs (a) or (b) of subsection (1).
<P>
The process of investigating crimes or criminal offences often occurs before it is possible to conclude that a crime was committed. That is important. The police or in Scotland the procurator fiscal would investigate a suspicious death. It might be by no means certain whether murder was involved. Loss adjusters investigating a suspicious fire would have to ask whether it was caused by arson. Such investigations are carried out to confirm whether a crime has been committed. A property loss could be caused by theft or by a fraudulent claim. I hope that the proposed addition of the word "investigation"	 will commend itself to the Minister.
<P>
The directive refers to criminal offences. The Bill uses the word "crime"	. I think that I understand why the clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the prevention or detection of crime"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase is frequently used. In my judgment, however, it markedly narrows the scope of the exemption.
<P>
Amendment No. 196 is designed to add further comfort. It proposes the insertion of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether or not a crime has been committed"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is common in criminal law. I remember learning all of that many years ago. For obvious reasons, police powers especially of arrest extend to suspicion of crime, whether or not a crime has been committed. In many instances, citizens' powers of arrest also do so. The proposed phrase would protect well-intentioned actions that are clearly in the public interest.
<P>
Much investigatory work under the commercial anti-fraud measures about which I have spoken is exploratory. Clause 28(1)(a) includes the words "prevention of crime"	. Preventive measures seek to discourage criminal activity. I am not clear about whether the type of anti-fraud work that the relevant organisations undertake could be said to be preventive. Unless it were widely known that such investigative work was commonplace, to discourage fraud or fraudulent and dishonest claims, it would not actually prevent crime. Similarly, the phrase "detection of crime"	 implies work undertaken to establish who committed crime or crimes that have been confirmed or reported and which are known to have occurred.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that the anti-fraud work in question is often done to establish whether fraud and crime have occurred. In many instances, inquiries cannot confirm that.
<P>
I shall briefly refer to a letter sent by Lord Williams of Mostyn, who piloted the Bill through another place, to my noble Friend Viscount Astor. It deals with the Government's proposals for what would have been clause 28(4), which are now to be replaced by Government amendment No. 242.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not intend to speak about amendment No. 242 at this juncture, but I wish to note that the letter distinguishes between what the Minister in the other place calls high-risk scores in risk assessment and medium and low-risk scores. The Minister's contention is that subsections (a) and (b) of clause 28 and subsection (c), where it relates to the collection of taxes are covered if the risk assessment or the anti-avoidance work achieves what he calls a "high-risk score"	 and there are grounds to suspect that an offence has been committed.
<P>
The letter goes on to say that the advice received taking account of case law under the Data Protection Act 1984 and the interpretation given by the Data Protection Act Registrar is that medium and low-risk scores inrisk assessments would not qualify. As a result, it is clear that the Government's amendment is intended to ensure that such scores are covered.
<P>
The letter confirms our anxieties about the clause in cases where it may be suspected that criminal offences have been committed. That may be impossible to establish through low-risk assessment work, but such work is important and would be undermined if the data subject had to give consent.
<P>
It is clear that the Government accept that medium and low-risk assessment work is not covered by the general definition in clause 28(1) the interpretation reached by the anti-fraud industry in the commercial sector. We can discuss later whether an amendment to one of the schedules might also give that industry added comfort, but the addition of the word "investigation"	 to the general definition would also be useful.
<P>
The Government accept that something needs to be done about the problem as it affects the public sector, and the amendment would ensure that something is done for the commercial sector. I acknowledge that Ministers of the Crown have a duty to protect public funds that carries greater weight than the need to protect commercial organisations. However, swindling taxpayer's money is the same as swindling money out of banks, insurance companies or credit companies the practical effect is that the money comes out of our pockets. The requirement to tackle the problem in the commercial sector is therefore just as compelling.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall deal first with amendment No. 219. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) for tabling the amendment. It allows us to clarify a matter that has caused some misunderstanding, which I hopeI can go some way towards clearing up.
<P>
The amendment takes a rather broad-brush approach. It uses wording from the directive about public security that is, national security and about individual freedoms. As a result, its proposals are very wide. In practice, it would be necessary to be more focused about what purposes to cover, what mechanisms to exempt from and in what circumstances.
<P>
However, I know that the amendment's wording comes from the local government associations, from which much of the concern emanates. I understand that they want to enable the police to disclose information to social landlords, such as housing associations, so that they can secure the eviction of tenants who cause trouble for neighbours. That is the so-called noisy neighbour problem, although we are often talking about much more serious difficulties. There is a fear that the Bill will prevent the police from doing that, but I believe that is misplaced. It may be helpful to explain the position asI see it.
<P>
Public organisations and others operating under statutory powers may carry out only those activities that they are empowered to do. That is a fundamental point. If such organisations do not have the necessary power, they may not carry on the activity in question. So when it comes to sharing information, any public bodies or persons operating on the basis of statute need to ensure that they have the power to do so. That is not a data protection issue; it is a matter of general law. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East mentioned the Crime and Disorder Bill, to which I shall come in a moment.
<P>
The first matter to be considered is whether data controllers have the power to share information for the purpose in question. Certainly the police have the power under common law to disclose information in order to prevent and detect crime a clear body of law puts that beyond doubt. Like all powers, of course, they must be exercised properly. Account must be taken of either common or statute law, whichever applies in the circumstances. In matters of defamation, confidentiality and data protection, for example, the police must be clear that they have the relevant power.
<P>
In the case of housing authorities and social landlords, the police can provide information to assist action against crime, including eviction proceedings. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East rightly said that there is a new provision clause 102 in the Crime and Disorder Bill, which is being considered in parallel with this Bill. That clause will enable anyone to provide the police, local authorities, the probation service or health authorities with information for the purposes of that Bill in the context of crime reduction partnerships, for example, which form an important part of that legislation.
<P>
That settles the basic issue of powers as far as the Crime and Disorder Bill is concerned. Like all data controllers, those bodies will have to ensure that their data sharing practices are consistent with data protection principles they need to ask themselves whether sharing information will be fair, whether data subjects' rights will be respected, and so on. The basic power, however, is there. If the disclosures in question are compatible with the data protection principles the Data Protection Registrar assures us that she does not see a problem in principle they may be made. The Data Protection Bill incorporates the same principles as the 1984 Act, so I do not believe that it presents an obstacle.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I understood that the Data Protection Registrar said that in regard to policing purposes, but that she viewed civil orders differently. Is my understanding wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I think it is. We are discussing whether information can be shared between various bodies, although the most common example is between a social housing landlord and the police. As I understand it, the principle behind that is not a problem for the Data Protection Registrar. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East has some concerns about that and I am sure that they will be noted. I am sure also that the registrar will let us all know ifI have misinterpreted her views.
<P>
It is irrelevant whether the exercise of the power ends up with proceedings being taken in the criminal courts. The purpose is to prevent crime. Whether a court case develops out of that is not at issue; the point is whether sharing information leads or could lead to the prevention of a crime. That relates to some of the principles that the hon. Member for Ryedale discussed under his amendments.
<P>
The best way of ensuring that disclosure is properly dealt with is to operate within protocols between the police and the agencies to whom they disclose. A good example of that is the Metropolitan police, who issued a protocol on 1 May. Another example is the Plymouth fast-track drug project, which shares information about people who are referred from the criminal justice system to the health service. The project has developed a series of protocols to enable health professionals to share information up to a point with the police and vice versa. Similarly, the protocols enable it to share information with the courts.
<P>
The protocol that the Metropolitan police issued on1 May deals with tackling crime on housing estates. It concerns the exchange of information with social landlords, including charitable housing trusts, housing associations, housing action trusts and registered social landlords. The guidance covers requests for conviction data from and disclosure of convictions to such landlords, juvenile convictions, the disclosure of other information in the public interest, confidentiality and the exchange of depersonalised information. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that such a protocol is a sensible way of dealing with the issue because it can be more explicit and poses no difficulty under the Bill.
<P>
As one would expect, while data protection law governs the way in which disclosures are made, the main determinant of whether disclosure can take place is the powers of the public bodies concerned, as I said some moments ago.
<P>
The development of carefully worked-out protocols is the proper and most effective way to handle the issue. My hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Home Office has undertaken for the Home Office to issue general guidance on the issue, which will help public bodies, the police and others. That is the way forward.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East for raising the problem. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment in the light of my explanation and of the way in which we think it would be better to take the matter forward.
<P>
I want to deal now with amendments Nos. 195 and 196. The hon. Member for Ryedale prayed in aid of my hon. and noble Friend Lord Williams of Mostyn who piloted the Bill through another place. The hon. Gentleman's argument hinged on an interpretation of risk that is probably more relevant to later Government amendments to the clause. He got into an apples-and-pears type of debate by using that argument in the context of his amendments. The same principles do not apply, but we shall come to that later and the hon. Gentleman will no doubt reflect on the matter a little more.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments would make small adjustments to references to law enforcement activities in clause 28(1)(a) and (b). Amendment No. 195 would substitute words drawn directly from article 13 of the data protection directive. There would be no advantage in doing so. The wording of paragraphs (a) and (b) is drawn directly from corresponding provision in the Data Protection Act 1984. I accept that the wording proposed by amendment No. 195 is slightly different from that of the directive. The amendment would add a reference to the investigation of offences and omit the reference to the apprehension of offenders. That would not make a great deal of difference. The Government believe that the formula in the Bill covers everything that the directive allows to be covered, and that it does not go beyond what the directive permits.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We could have used wording identical to that in the directive, but we chose to stay with the tried and tested wording of the 1984 Act. I hope that the considerable experience of dealing with circumstances arising from 1984 Act will to some extent convince the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment No. 196 would add words to make it clear that the references to criminal offences proposed by amendment No. 195 would allow the exemption to apply even if it turns out that no offence has been committed. The hon. Member for Ryedale clearly explained his concerns and his reasons for wanting such an exemption to be set in principle. I understand his point and I know that he has personal experience of relevant problems from his earlier career. I do not think, however, that the amendment is necessary.
<P>
The Government believe that the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has in mind are already covered. For example, the exemption would apply when a person suspected of having committed an offence was being investigated, even though the offence might later be discontinued by the police or by the Crown Prosecution Service, or the suspect acquitted by a court of law. The Bill covers all of the circumstances about which the hon. Gentleman spoke.
<P>
For benefit from the exemption, it would be necessary to show at the time in question that an alleged criminal offence was being investigated. It would be wholly illogical otherwise to construe the provision. As I understand it, no challenge has ever been sustained with regard to the interpretation of the wording which, as I said, is drawn from the 1984 Act. The body of experience shows that it works in practice and that there is no problem.
<P>
The Government are basically proposing legislation that will operate in exactly the same way as the 1984 Act has done successfully. Given that success and given that experience shows that the law as it stands has worked reasonably well, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that change is unnecessary, and that it might lead to complications into which neither the police nor anybody else would want to stray.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response, although I am not entirely convinced. We can reflect again on the matter. The Bill would benefit from the addition of the word "investigation"	 and the Opposition may seek to add it on Report.
<P>
I hear what the Minister says about the 1984 Act definition, which is replicated in the Bill, having proved to be satisfactory. The Committee must, however, bear a key point in mind. The data subject access and consent provisions in the Bill go further than those of the 1984 Act. The outstanding feature of representations made by commercial organisations concerned about the matter is that they have concentrated not so much on the wording but on their concern that the Bill will not allow them to continue the work that they are doing. The inclusion of the word "investigation"	 would be beneficial and would provide extra comfort. I implore the Minister to consider the matter again.
<P>
As I said, we will try to provide comfort through another mechanism later. Perhaps we ought to leave it there for today. We have stated our case and raised the Committee's concern. We will not, therefore, press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I thank the Minister for his comments.I am sure that the development of protocols will be welcomed by local authorities that are developing safer estate initiatives. Naturally cynical, I tend to consider worst-case scenarios, but the Minister has reassured me.I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 17, line 39, leave out `likely' and insert `reasonably considered materially'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 188, in page 18, line 6, leave out `likely' and insert `reasonably considered materially'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We seek to explore the nature of the exemptions that are being provided. I hope that we agree that the Bill's thrust is in one direction: to give individual citizens the ability to find out about data that is being processed about themselves and to have it corrected if it is not being lawfully or fairly processed. Clearly, the exemptions work in the opposite direction they provide a way out for particular organisations for various reasons.
<P>
We recognise the requirement for the organisations to which the clause refers to have exemptions under certain circumstances, but we feel that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"likely to prejudice any of the matters mentioned in this subsection"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are weak in the context of the wholesale exemption from the first data protection principle and from the data subject's access provisions. Our proposed words "reasonably considered materially"	 would provide a better test when these issues are debated in a legal context, as I am sure they will be. Individual citizens will try to take tax collection or crime prevention organisations to court to test their use of material and whether the exemptions are being applied fairly. In that context, we believe that our phrasing is a more appropriate test for widespread exemption than the word "likely"	.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is well aware that the amendments are identical to those moved in another place by his noble Friend Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne. He will not, therefore, be surprised if much of what I say is similar to the response given on that occasion.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wants reassurances about the strength of the test for the application of exemptions in clause 28. We think that the Bill's test for exemptions is pitched at the right level. It follows closely the corresponding provision in the Data Protection Act 1984 and is based as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, on the likelihood of law enforcement, tax assessment or tax collection being prejudiced by the granting of subject access or not making disclosure that is the key area about which he is concerned.
<P>
The need to show likelihood of prejudice is one safeguard against abuse, but it is accompanied by a second, which I hope will give the hon. Gentleman reassurance. Subsections (1) and (3) contain the words "in any case"	. Exemptions are therefore available only where there may, in a particular case, be prejudice to the processing of personal data for those purposes. We do not believe that the provision will lead to unreasonable claims for exemptions. By having to consider each case separately from the next, data controllers are obliged to examine the specific circumstances. They must have regard to the significance of any possible prejudice and must judge whether they can justify using the exemptions when carrying out such processing. Although that leaves something to judgment, it also provides a reasonable framework in which such a judgment can be made.
<P>
Therefore, we do not believe that the amendments would bring anything new to the clause. Indeed, they might, by changing a long-established form of words, lead to confusion, and I know that that is not the intention. We are not aware of unease that the 1984 Act is drawn too loosely if anything, the opposite is true, so I see no justification for the changes proposed in amendments, as the existing provision already works well.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I thank the Minister for his courteous reply. I am grateful for the clarification that he has given about the strength of the tests and about the relationship with the Data Protection Act 1984.
<P>
It has been useful to discuss the tests again in this Committee, as the wording used by my noble Friend Baroness Nicholson was so good that I felt that it also merited our different but equally expert opinion.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendmentNo. 242, in page 18, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Personal data in respect of which the data controller is a relevant authority and which

(c) any other authority administering housing benefit or council tax benefit.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment also deals with an issue that was debated at some length in another place. It introduces a narrower exemption, specifically to protect the public purse and hence taxpayers, in place of the former clause 28(4), which was removed on Third Reading in the House of Lords. I believe that the amendment takes full account of the concerns expressed about the previous version. [Interruption.] Is the hon. Member for Ryedale alright? I was worried that he was having a seizure I often have that effect on people.
<P>
Clause 28 provides exemptions from several of the Bill's requirements when data are processed for the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of taxes, duties, and so on. As it stands, the clause broadly replicates section 28 of the Data Protection Act 1984. The exemptions apply to part of the "fairness and lawfulness"first data protection principle, the subject information provisions that is, the subject access provision in clause 7 and the requirement in paragraph (2) of part II of Schedule 1 to provide certain information when data are first obtained and the non-disclosure provisions of the data protection principles.
<P>
These exemption are confined to any case in which allowing subject access or complying with one of the other requirements would be likely to prejudice any of the matters in clause 28(1) that is, broadly, dealing with crime, offenders or taxation. The use of the exemption must be justified by reference to what is already known about the particular data subject.
<P>
The version of subsection (4) removed in another place would have enabled the Secretary of State, by order subject to the affirmative resolution, to exempt personal data of a specified description a class of data from the subject information and non-disclosure provisions, where this was necessary for the purposes in subsection (1).
<P>
We originally included that version in the Bill in the light of particular needs identified by the Inland Revenue, although we made it clear that orders might also prove to be necessary in other areas, therefore, I accept that the original subsection did not apply to the Inland Revenue exclusively. The first concern was that the Revenue receive information from third parties, typically wholesalers holding details of clients' purchases and methods of payment. Clearly, some business customers who often pay in cash may be tax dodgers, but not all of them will be, so there is no pre-existing suspicion to justify setting aside the non-disclosure rules on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
We must assume that some will be tax dodgers, while on other occasions people will pay in cash legitimately.
<P>
The second concern was the need to avoid revealing to taxpayers or would-be tax dodgers the risk scores that are assigned to them in connection with the new tax self-assessment returns. Only higher risk scores securely qualify for exemption on a case-by-case basis under clause 28(1). I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Since the debate in the House of Lords, the Government have done what they said they would do. First, we have carefully reviewed the particular needs of the Inland Revenue and how they might best be met. Secondly, we have reviewed what similar needs exist elsewhere inthe public sector so that we could give a clearer explanation to Parliament of the practical need for the class exemption and so that we could consider whether the exemption could be set out wholly within the Bill.
<P>
As a result, we have decided not to pursue the non-disclosure exemption further in terms of the Bill. On reflection, we accept that where systematic disclosure of information to Government Departments is appropriate, we should seek specific statutory powers within the relevant departmental legislation. The Inland Revenue is accordingly considering bringing forward a measure in the Finance Bill. Where Parliament has agreed to such proposals, the non-disclosure rule is automatically set aside by virtue of clause 33.
<P>
We have concluded that risk assessment can be dealt with in the Bill in a way that should reassure all hon. Members about our intentions. Accordingly, amendment No. 242 introduces a new, narrowly focused exemption that applies solely to subject access. The amendment applies only to Government Departments, local authorities and other authorities that administer benefits and payments. I shall return to the detail of that in a moment. It applies only when they use risk assessment systems to help collect or protect public funds. Its aim is solely to protect honest taxpayers from fraud and tax evasion. The hon. Member for Ryedale recognised that principle in the allusion that he made during the debate on an earlier amendment.
<P>
Hon. Members may wonder why risk scores are not exempt under clause 28(1). We believe that high-risk scores qualify because, by definition, they reveal something about the individual case that is likely to warrant further investigation. However, it is already necessary to make and record medium-risk and low-risk assessments. Those do not directly reveal suspicion of fraud or tax evasion, but their release through subject access would nevertheless compromise the whole system. Scores so obtained could be compared with each other and with refusals to disclose. The latter would, by definition, create a situation by which it could be revealed that there were high-risk scores in those cases. That would enable people with illegal motives to compare cases and to work out what kinds of returns or declarations attract what kinds of scores, which is a difficult and knotty area to deal with. That, in turn, would enable the system to be manipulated. People could work out how to attract low scores and people with low scores would be more tempted to try to get away with fraud. Those likely to attract higher scores would be alerted to the need to conceal evidence of wrongdoing.
<P>
The need to protect these systems arises in a number of areas. In addition to the Inland Revenue, a range of Departments and bodies use risk assessments in relation to agricultural subsidy claims, including those under the common agricultural policy. Those Departments and bodies include the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department, the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, the Intervention Board, the Forestry Commission and the Countryside Council for Wales. The amendment specifies that the term "public funds"	 includes European Community funds. It is right that we should make that absolutely clear.
<P>
In the area of benefit fraud, the Department of Social Security is developing risk assessment for use by itself and local authorities. The Government's recent Green Paper on welfare reform set out a commitment to tough action on social security fraud. That will apply, for example, to income support, jobseekers' allowance, and housing and council tax benefit. The Government are drawing up a new strategy that emphasises, fraud prevention rather than detection. Risk methodology will be central to that process. It is essential that authorities that administer housing and council tax benefit have the same methods at their disposal as Government Departments.
<P>
Members of the Committee should be aware that the exemption is necessary solely to avoid a serious and adverse impact on Government Departments' work to prevent and detect fraudulent claims for money andto collect sums that are owed to the Exchequer. The actual amounts that the systems protect are extremely difficult to quantify there is no figure for latent fraud. However, to give an example of the scale of what is at stake, the Department of Social Security estimates total social security fraud at several billion pounds. That is rightly, a matter of serious public and Government concern. We must protect honest taxpayers against the depredations of the dishonest. Moreover, we propose to do so through a narrow and clearly targeted amendment. It exempts only risk assessment material, not information on the data subject generally. Subject access to other material will continue.
<P>
Against that background, I hope that the Committee will approve the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is interesting that the Minister can give such an accurate and entirely supportable definition of funds. As we discovered on the Floor of the House last night, his right hon. Friends the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland could not adequately explain what a public authority was, but I shall let that little tease pass.
<P>
In the context of my earlier remarks, I recognise that we cannot have things both ways. Generally speaking, Conservative Members support amendment No. 242, and I want to comment on two aspects of it by way of a welcome.
<P>
First, as the Minister made clear, the Data Protection Registrar's view was that a difficulty in relation to taxation should be dealt with through an amendmentto the Finance Bill. I am grateful to the Minister for his confirmation that that is his intention. We welcome the fact that the amendment deals with an exemption for clause 7 the data subject access provisions and not with the notification provisions, which will be dealt with by other legislation.
<P>
The second concern that Conservative Members expressed in the other place was that the original proposal in clause 28(4) extended the processing of information by the police beyond what the police themselves thought was reasonable. The amendment makes it clear that the prevention or detection of crime, which the Government are concerned to catch in the amendment, relates only to protecting the public purse, not to crime generally. The amendment will probably meet the concerns that were expressed in the other place about clause 28(4); it will certainly meet those expressed by Conservative Members, who suggested that we would be prepared to support a suitable amendment.
<P>
Because of its technical nature, it is difficult to be sure that the amendment means what we hope, but I detect in the spirit of the Minister's remarks the Government's welcome intention to deal with the various anxieties expressed in the other place.
<P>
However, I return briefly to my earlier observation about the need for some mechanism in the Bill offering similar protection for commercial organisations. Government Departments such as the Department of Social Security, in particular, are more often guiltyof simple and honest mistakes than of fraud. That is also true of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as farmers in my constituency would agree, given their present problems with the local MAFF office in Northallerton and I suspect that the hon. member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) would confirm that the same goes for farmers in his area. The Bill will mean that a lot of information will be kept about the agricultural community, and we may have to return to that subject on Report.
<P>
The explanatory letter from Lord Williams of Mostyn shows that the Government recognise the difference between high-score risk assessment and low to medium-score risk assessment. We want the Bill to include a provision covering low to medium-score risk assessments for commercial organisations.
<P>
Although I confirm that Conservative Members will accept the amendment for now, I hope that the Minister will think again about how to meet the needs of the commercial sector. They are the same as those ofthe public sector, which are covered in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We were looking forward to amendmentNo. 242. It replaces the original clause 28(4), which contained a wide range of exemptions that caused grave anxiety in another place. The hon. Member for Ryedale said that the police were involved, although officers did not want the exemption that they were offered. We felt that the original version was a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<P>
We had two criteria for the amendment to be tabled by the Government: that it should be narrow in its focus, and that the Government would not use the type of mechanism in the original version of clause 28(4). We hoped that they would incorporate the provisions into other departmental legislation, and we are pleased that the Minister has confirmed that, for example, the Inland Revenue will seek the relevant powers in finance legislation. That is a better option than including general exemptions in this Bill.
<P>
The specific problem for the Inland Revenue places it apart from the commercial organisations referred to by the hon. Member for Ryedale. The self-assessment system is peculiar in that it allocates a permanent marker to people's files, specifying whether they are low, medium or high risk.
<P>
In normal commercial credit scoring, the score is generated as instantly as possible. Anyone who has telephoned an organisation to get a loan or credit card will have found that that instant response means waiting for a call back some time later. The crucial difference is that such organisations do not generate a permanent score: they instantaneously generate a transitory score that would not enter a person's file permanently, nor ever be disclosable.
<P>
The decision is a snap judgment.
<P>
The Inland Revenue's requirement was a low-risk score, effectively meaning that the files would not be investigated and that it would take the assessment form each year and not bother to look further at the matter. That clearly causes the two problems to which the Minister referred. First, the risk-scoring mechanism can be worked out. Secondly, it is an invitation to people to stretch things as far as possible to know whether the Inland Revenue is dealing with them as low-risk or non-risk individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms (Poole):</B> Or Members of Parliament.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not know how Members of Parliament are categorised perhaps someone should ask the inspector of taxes public department no. 1 in Wales.<P>
<P>
Liberal Democrats hope that the Government will respond to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale. It would be interesting to see the scope to which commercial companies perform an exercise similar to Inland Revenue self assessment. I suspect that assessment is not the problem that it was for the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> May I clarify the point? We are not seeking an extension of the exemption to the commercial sector; we are simply saying that the sector has a concern that the Bill does not cover, and that a mechanism must be found. Such a measure would be much too draconian.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I accept that. I was trying to be supportive by saying that the Committee should consider exemption in relation to risk assessment in the commercial sector.
<P>
Liberal Democrats welcome the fact that the Government have responded to the concerns that were raised. They have come up with a narrow, targeted and focused amendment. We do not see any problem with it, and it will be a huge improvement to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for the clarification that he gave in his intervention on the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. He made it clear that he is not seeking similar arrangements for the private sector I had not been sure whether that was his point.
<P>
It is important that the Government have had no approaches from the commercial sector seeking the arrangements in question. It has not put forward a case for inclusion in the provision. The amendment concentrates on dealing with what the Government know to be strong and known needs. I hope that my impression is correct, and the Committee believes that we have got it about right. The hon. Member for Ryedale reserved his right to return to the matter when he has studied it in more detail. By the sound of it, he will have a rather busy recess. Subject to that proviso, he accepts that the Government have got the balance about right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam made a telling point: self assessment has made a difference. Current procedures must be reassessed in the light of changes. The Government have covered that in a way that makes some sort of sense.
<P>
I am grateful for the Committee's positive response.I hope, with some confidence, that it will support the Government.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 28, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 29</center></H4>
<H4><center>Health and social work</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 18, line 20, leave out `in relation' and insert `of direct benefit'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 199, in page 18, line 20, leave out `other individuals' and insert `members of his family.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The clause provides an exemption in respect of personal data that is not just related to the physical or mental health of the data subject. It also gives some exemption in respect of social work. In the wide definition of exemption, subsection (2)(b) on line 20 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"social work in relation to the data subject or other individuals"	.
<P>
The amendments are slightly more than probing amendments. What is the motivation for using that form of words? Rather than
<P>
"in relation to the data subject"	,
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should not the test be that the processing of relevant data is "of direct benefit to the data subject or members of his family?"	 The words "in relation to"	 are much less specific and might allow processing that could be argued to be prejudicial to the data subject, rather than of direct benefit to him. What is the rationale for having an exemption in respect of social work if that exemption is to the data subject's detriment as opposed to his benefit?
<P>
Amendment No. 199 would omit the words "other individuals"	. Who are those other individuals? How can the data subject information provisions apply to them? Is the provision meant to refer to the data subject's family members, in which case why does the Bill not make that clear? We need to know what
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in relation to the data subject or other individuals"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means. If the Minister agrees that the provision should apply only to social work-related processing that is of direct benefit to the data subject or members of his family, it would be better to say so in more precise terms.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I have listened to my hon. Friend's explanation but I have to say that I prefer the Bill's wording.
<P>
In the context of social work, we are not thinking solely, of the individual, but of the wider community interest. I have served on local authorities and I know that social workers have a responsibility not only to their clients but for what their clients may do to other individuals. If one narrows down the provision by using the words "of direct benefit to a data subject"	, one narrows the scope of information that may be kept. There have been several prominent cases, including the one that gave rise to the Zito trust, where information should have been kept.
<P>
Although it is a sad commentary on our society, it is not unusual to find social work clients who do not have families or people in a close environment; other individuals, however, sometimes relate to them.
<P>
This is a sensitive subject. There have been a number of public scandals, and we should be extremely cautious when considering altering the wording of the clause. Social workers have a very difficult job and a much broader remit beyond that of their clients. They need to be able to keep information for the benefit of society as well as for that of their clients.
<P>
Committee members should not view this as a split in the Conservative party. I am merely stating my honest opinion in an attempt to get the best legislation for our nation.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I suspect that the hon. Member for Ryedale feels that the ground is shifting beneath him the ground, that is, rather than the earth.
<P>
Clause 29(2) provides an order-making power for the Secretary of State to exempt from or modify the subject access provisions for social work data. It closely follows a similar provision in the 1984 Act. An order under the 1984 Act has been in force since 1987. It exempts certain data from the subject access provisions in situations in which giving subject access would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of social work by causing serious harm to the health or emotional condition of the data subject or another person. As the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) rightly said, the cause for concern is not always the subject himself or herself; sometimes it is the effect that they may have on others in their own family or in the wider community.
<P>
The 1987 order also provides for the exemption to apply where the granting of subject access would lead to the identification of other individuals, except individuals who are employed or engaged for reward in social work. We would expect an order under clause 29 to follow the 1987 order very closely, with any modification that developments since 1987 might show to be necessary.I am not currently aware of any such developments.
<P>
The amendments, as the hon. Member for Poole rightly says, would narrow the scope of the exemption. It would be available only where the social work in question was "of direct benefit"	 to the data subject or "members of his family"	. That definition would be too narrow. There are other interests involving the wider community that need to be taken into account, such as concern about how the actions or behaviour of an individual might impact on others. The requirement that the social work in question should be "of direct benefit"	 to the data subject could put the whole issue of exemption at risk. I am sure that that is not the hon. Member for Ryedale's intention.
<P>
I am not an expert on social work, but I have some knowledge of the problems faced by social workers. Other Committee members will doubtless have gained similar knowledge from their experiences as Members of Parliament or from their previous experiences in local government. Social workers often have the unwelcome task of deciding where an individual's best interests lie, and sometimes the individual concerned may not share the same view. Difficult and sensitive balances often have to be struck. The decisions that are made cannot always be to the individual's obvious short-term benefit, although they may in the longer term prove to have been correct. Legal considerations are also involved.
<P>
The role of a social worker is sometimes almost analogous to that of a parent. Those of us who are parents know that sometimes one must take decisions that are for the child's benefit, although the child does not recognise that. I hesitate to give examples about my 18-year-old son, other than to say that curfews certainly do not work and that persuasion or even inducement is often more effective.
<P>
It may sometimes be the case that social work is carried out for the benefit of an individual's family. I recall surgery cases in which I have involved the social services department in work with a family because of the effect on that family of one member's behaviour. That is an important principle.
<P>
Friends, neighbours and other people might also be affected. We debated earlier the effect, for instance, of the behaviour of people in a block of flats. Especially since the introduction of community care, it would be up to neighbours to provide the help that such people may not recognise that they need.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
One example of social work in a non-family background might be where a person wished to do voluntary work with children in care or who were being helped by social workers in some other way. Social workers would wish to check that such a person was suitable for such work. All hon. Members know of the serious problems and worrying cases that inquiries and investigations into child care in this country have brought to light.
<P>
Social workers might initially suspect that the person was not suitable but, following investigations, decide that their fears were groundless. If that person asked to see his file and discovered that social workers had had doubts about his suitability, the good will needed for voluntary work might disappear. That may appear to be a Big Brother approach, but we cannot be too careful where access to children, voluntary or otherwise, is involved.
<P>
Some serious work has to be exempted, therefore, because of the high sensitivity of the issued. What is objectively in a person's interest can sometimes be separated from what that person might subjectively believe to be in his or her interest.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will feel able to withdraw the amendment and accept that the Government do not want added burdens unnecessarily. However, we are convinced that some sensitive work has to be protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The debate has been useful in clarifying the Government's thinking.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulatory activity</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 18, line 29, leave out `section' and insert `subsection'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 250 to 253.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> This group of amendments clarifies the subject information exemption that clause 30 provides for certain regulatory activity in respect of the relevant functions of statutory public sector ombudsmen. The clause already applies in general terms to the functions of ombudsmen, but there is a measure of doubt about whether it covers all of their functions that need to be covered. The amendments will put the matter beyond doubt.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 249 to 252 are simply paving amendments. They make the necessary adjustments to the wording of clause 30 to ensure that the two new subsections, to be added by amendment No. 253 and 254, which we shall come to, fit in properly.
<P>
Amendment No. 253 adds a new subjection setting out the specific statutory functions of the public sector ombudsmen to which the subject information exemption provided by clause 30 will apply.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will note that subsection (2) (a) (iii) already applies to the regulation of maladministration by public bodies. That was intended to cover the functions of the ombudsmen. However, it has been mentioned that the investigation of maladministration is explicitly distinguished in statute from certain other relevant functions of the ombudsmen, which need the benefit of the exemption that clause 30 provides.
<P>
Those other functions relate to the other matters that are mentioned in paragraph (b) of the new subsection in other words, to deficiencies in the provision of services by public bodies. I am sure that the Committee agrees that the scope that ombudsmen already have to carry out such functions should be protected.
<P>
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and his local government ombudsmen colleagues have represented to us very strongly the need to cover those functions, and it is incumbent on us to take notice of what they say.
<P>
They obtain information from a wide range of bodies and individuals. They conduct their investigations in
{**fcprivate. If they were obliged to divulge information to data subjects, they fear this is a valid point that that would inhibit people from giving them the information that they often need successfully to conduct an inquiry. That would be detrimental to their work and might, in particular, undermine their ability to carry out their statutory functions. As a result, the public protection that ombudsmen provide might suffer. I am sure that we would not want to be a party to that. Amendment No. 253 makes it clear that the exemption covers all the ombudsmen's functions that need to be safeguarded.
<p4**}Given that the Government have acted as a result of approaches by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and local government ombudsmen, I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendments make sense. I commend them to the Committee. <P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This seems sensible. I listened with interest to the Minister's remarks. As he rightly said, the use of ombudsmen and various forms of dispute resolution is growing. It would, therefore, be sensible to add the provisions to the Bill.
<P>
I want, however, to tempt the Minister. Why have the Government felt it necessary in clause 30 to go beyond the provisions in the 1984 Act? The Data Protection Registrar has expressed concern about that. At the moment, the 1984 Act provides a subject access exemption. The definition of subject information provisions, however, brings together the subject access provision in clause 7 and the general code for fairly obtaining data in schedule 1, paragraph 2. Under the 1984 Act, only subject access exemption applies in respect of the organisations concerned. The present provisions will add an exemption from the requirement to obtain the data fairly. Why have the Government thought it necessary to do that? That has raised concerns.
<P>
In addition, clause 30 significantly extends the group of organisations that the Government think should be included in this general exemption. I am fairly open minded about the extent of that. I must declare an interest as a financial services regulator. I have been an elected member of the Insurance Brokers' Registration Council for more than six years. We process a lot of data on disciplinary matters, particularly in respect of the council's role as an authorised body under the Financial Services Act 1986, although that is likely to change shortly.
<P>
The fact remains that certain exemptions are clearly in the public interest. But why was it felt necessary to extend the provisions to include the fair obtaining of information code within the exemption on top of the subject access exemption, which already exists under the 1984 Act?

<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Clause 30(1) applies only to the extent to which the exemption is needed. In fact, it goes wider than subject access because it addresses what are in effect newly introduced rights. I think that the hon. Member for Ryedale would agree that we have confined the amendment to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and/or local government ombudsmen.
<P>
In effect, we are confining the amendment to the public sector where, as the hon. Gentleman knows from the regulatory functions with which he is involved elsewhere, there are a different set of considerations. We are not necessarily dealing with public bodies; we are dealing with the behaviour of private organisations and their relations with their customers, rather than the public's relations with public bodies. It requires a different set of considerations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is happy with that clarification.

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is similar to that of amendment No. 253 which, happily, the Committee has just accepted. It will ensure that the relevant functions of the Director General of Fair Trading, for which there needs to be an exemption from the subject information provisions, are covered by clause 30.
<P>
As the Committee knows, the Director General of Fair Trading carried out investigations into trading malpractice and commercial activities under statutory powers to protect consumers and, importantly, to regulate anti-competitive agreements and behaviour. Certain of his functions already benefit from a subject access exemption under an order made under section 30 of the 1984 Act.
<P>
Clause 30 is intended to preserve the existing exemption for the functions of the director. However, it now seems that it does not go far enough to achieve that. Moreover, much of the information gathered by the director in the course of his investigations is kept in paper files. Although it is thus currently outside the scope of the 1984 Act, it is likely to be caught by the Bill. Increasingly, much of the information is being held in computerised form. Some of that information relates to functions that need a subject information exemption but which are currently outside the scope of clause 30.
<P>
It is necessary for all personal data held by the director for his consumer protection and competition functions to benefit from the exemption to an extent necessary to ensure that those functions are not compromised. As with the ombudsmen, the functions are there for the protection of the public. I am sure we all agree that that is necessary. It is important that the director's ability to provide protection should not be put at risk. That is the purpose of this amendment.
<P>
The amendment, brings within the scope of the new subsection all the relevant functions of the director which need to benefit from the exemption. The consumer protection functions are covered in paragraph (b)(i) of the new subsection. This covers the director's range of regulatory functions for the protection of consumers against unfair or illegal business activity in the areas of consumer credit, consumer hire, estate agency, misleading advertising, consumer contracts and unfair trading generally. The Committee will agree on the need for those protections.
<P>

<P>
I hope that the Committee will recognise the importance of protecting those activities of the Director General of Fair Trading and accept that the amendment is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Given the Minister's explanation of the extent to which the application of the subject information provisions could prejudice the proper discharge of the Office of Fair Trading's functions, we are happy to accept the amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is an extremely important clause. I preface my introductory remarks by saying that it is inevitable that the whole House will want to consider on Report some of the matters arising from it as they are of wide interest.
<P>
The content of amendment No. 200 is slightly different from the other amendments, which deal with some of the issues that the Committee debated in its consideration of clause 3. The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) said that all that mattered about the special purposes exemptions was the purpose, not the merit. That was an astonishing comment, given the extent to which the special purposes provision could apply to private individuals' interests.
<P>
Amendment No. 224 is aimed at achieving a greater degree of balance between a person's rights to privacy and the right to freedom of expression. The wording of the directive also seeks to achieve that. I am sure that the matters will be further debated when hon. Members discuss the balance of articles 8 and 10 of the convention on human rights, which will be debated in the coming days during the Committee stage of the Human Rights Bill.
<P>
The Opposition did not table the amendments to ask the Government to respond just to the general issue of merit; they should also deal with what should constitute the test of reasonableness. Amendments Nos. 220 and 221, for example, refer to the judgment of a reasonable person. Amendment No. 220 seeks to add the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which any reasonable person would judge to have significant merit"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Opposition tabled the amendments to seek confirmation regarding the Government's understanding of the legal definition of reasonableness, as it is included in the clause. The clause appears to require only that the data controller, who has decided to process and to store the information with a view to publication, has a reasonable personal belief that the information is especially important and that future publication will be in the public interest.
<P>
The test of reasonableness should not be based on what the controller personally believes to be reasonable any other person should think so too. I am sure that the Minister agrees that not everyone regards material that is thought to involve artistic and literary expression with equal favour, excitement or enthusiasm. I am less concerned about journalism, as I suggested when the Committee discussed clause 3. The history of the artistic and literary world is littered with such cases.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer (Broxtowe):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I want to finish my point, and I do not wish to delay the Committee.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 220, 221 and 223 relate specifically to the test of reasonableness, and ask whether it is based on the judgment of a reasonable person. If it is, the amendments are not required.
<P>
Amendment No. 222 suggests that the public interest must be significant. That will ultimately be for a court to decide. Even if the Minister does not accept the amendment, I hope that he agrees that publication should be significantly in the public interest, and that that should not rest simply on one person's opinion.
<P>
Amendment No. 224 seeks to ensure the proper degree of balance about which I have spoken. With regard to rights of privacy, we have suggested that the relevant provisions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"should apply in respect of any literary or artistic material only in so far as they are necessary to reconcile that right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee has discussed the fact that the directive does not distinguish between journalistic, artistic and literary expression. The Opposition believe that there is a difference, and that amendment No. 224 is one way in which it could be dealt with.
<P>
Amendment No. 200 proposes, not for the first time, the deletion of the word "may"	 and the insertion of the word "shall"	. Subsection (3) requires a data controller to have regard to compliance with a relevant code of practice when deciding whether it is reasonable that publication of data would be in the public interest. That is disproportionately beneficial to the data controller, as opposed to the interests of the data subject. It is odd that the Government are not requiring that the data controller shall, rather than may, have regard to compliance with the code of practice.
<P>
I assume that the types of codes of practice that the Government have in mind are those of the Press Complaints Commission and the Broadcasting StandardsCommission. We are concerned about lack of merit and the need for a balance of interest in the Bill. It seems reasonable to make adherence to codes of practice a positive requirement, rather than place the judgement in the hands of the data controller. I commend that argument to the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Liberal Democrat Members share the deep-seated concerns of Conservative Members about respecting the European convention on human rights, which is being incorporated into British law. We should ensure that all our legislation is responsive to that development.
<P>
I share the hon. Member for Ryedale's opinion that this issue will command the interest of all hon. Members. Futhermore, it affects the media and is therefore bound, in a self-feeding manner, to generate a significant amount of heat, if not light.
<P>
A key element in this debate is the reconciliation of two fundamental rights: privacy and freedom of expression. Amendments Nos. 189 and 190 address the issue of proportionality that is, the proportionality between the public interest involved in the publication of a story, or set of data, and the harm or damage that may be caused to a data subject who, because of the exemption, does not have the normal rights to access that data or to seek its correction.
<P>
A broad spectrum will be covered by the journalistic exemption. A newspaper that seeks, for example, to explore Government connivance in an illegal arms trade should be able to collect data on that topic without let or hindrance. However, the same newspaper should not be allowed to hold inaccurate information on a private citizen's sex life, for example, if that data subject has no access to legal recourse by which he can demonstrate that there is no significant public interest.
<P>
Our amendments seek to maintain a narrower spectrum, whereby data controllers must prove necessity. In cases that involve the activities of Government or of public figures, they would normally be able to prove necessity, but in cases in which the public interest is more dubious, the privacy aspect would be strengthened. Unfortunately, private citizens often lack the legal means to seek any other form of recourse in such circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 191 would add another option in respect of the code of practice: the Minister will have to make a choice along the spectrum described by the words "may"	, "shall"	 or "must. It is very much in the spirit set out by the hon. Member for Ryedale, in that it is not sufficient for the Bill to use the word "may"	 when it comes to a possible code of conduct for the press. The Bill will have to use either "shall"	 or "must"	 "may"	 would make a nonsense of any such code.
<P>
That is not an attack on the media, all of whose members are keen to trumpet their enjoyment of and respect for strong codes of practice. Formal legislation is unnecessary, as there is no need to do more than point the media at effective codes of practice. The public will benefit, and the media will be happy with the pointer contained in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ben Bradshaw </B>(Exeter): I gently suggest to the hon. Member for Ryedale that defining art, literature and journalism is easier than obtaining from reasonable men or women consistent definitions of which art, literature and journalism has merit.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman damaged his argument by admitting that, historically, agreement about which art has merit or even significant merit has been impossible to achieve. The Committee may agree that sheep in formaldehyde or turds in jars lack merit, but how does one define a reasonable person? One such person might consider those works to have artistic merit, but another might not. The hon. Gentleman is opening a can of worms with his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton):</B> I repeat my sedentary observation about whether a can of worms has artistic merit, and hope that the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) will think about that during the rest of our proceedings.
<P>
As has been said, this is an important clause, as it attempts to reconcile privacy and freedom of expression. I do not doubt that we shall return to it on Report.
<P>
We anticipated this discussion when we considered clause 3. I pondered the definition of publication, and other matters arose in the debate, to which the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, responded. I hope that there is no distinction between the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department in any of these matters.
<P>
In another place, Lord Falconer of Thoroton said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is a general sense in which public publication per se is an exercise of freedom of speech in which there is a general public interest."	 [Official Report, House of Lords, 24 March 1998; Vol. 587, c. 1117.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At first sight, that seems reasonable in a country that values freedom of expression. At second sight, however, risks appear. The statement almost amounts to "publish and be damned"	, requiring the subject of the inquiry to get the scales of justice balanced afterwards. To whom does such a person appeal after publication? I am not sure that Matthew Parris got right all his data in the retraction that appeared in this morning's edition of The Times, in which he confessed to confusing one Labour Member of Parliament with another. I am sure that those Labour Members are wondering right now whether to resort to the Press Complaints Commission.
<P>
At the heart of the matter is the proposition that it is right, in an open and free society, to favour freedom of expression and publication. However, personal privacy must be balanced against that. The availability of information, particularly in the electronic format, is global and instant and the individual has few rights and little protection.
<P>
I do not want to get into the issue of literary merit or of whether a reasonable person would regard something as having literary merit, but there is something known as faction. Could the protection be used in that case? I am sure that the President of the United States read a piece of faction called "Primary Colours"	 with mixed feelings. I am not sure how a reasonable man would regard the problems involved in that case.
<P>
There is whole series of problems with the Bill, and I am not sure that we have got to the heart of them. Rather than attempt to redraft the clauses on my feet, however, I will listen to the Minister's comments with great interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that the music rights industry is important to this country and generates much income. British Music Rights wants to know whether it can use the clause to seek exemption from the data protection principle, particularly when seeking royalties in the United States, Australia and other countries. Will the Minister clarify whether the clause provides the security that the industry seeks?
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I should like to develop the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter. Amendments Nos. 221 and 223 have two practical or logical problems, although the first is perhaps rather trivial. The repetition of the word "reasonable"	 is not necessary. I do not know whether it is possible for reasonable people to make unreasonable judgments.
<P>
More importantly, the amendments require that any reasonable person would reach the relevant judgment. We have agreed that it is difficult to judge artistic, journalistic and literary merit and that there will be a wide range of views between reasonable people. The amendments appear to say that the provisions in the clause would not apply if we could find somebody who could reasonably be considered to be reasonable and who considered that something did not have merit. That is rather drastic.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> You will forgive me,Mr. Welsh, if I do not follow the path that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) has set out in front of me. I also have some other health warnings. I do not propose to get drawn into the argument about literary or artistic merit because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) said, it is a matter of opinion. Whether the artistic community thinks something has merit does not matter to us because we will consider whether we like something subject to our own tastes. For example, who is to choose, on the one hand, between Lord Archer's novels 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock </B>(Wyre Forest): Novels?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is being uncharacteristically unkind to Lord Archer his novels sell well and people read them. Others will have to judge whether they have literary merit. On the other hand, there are authors such as Martin Amis, whose work I have read. I recognise that he is critically acclaimed in some quarters and criticised in others. Frankly, it is deeply depressing to read some of Martin Amis's novels. Although I have managed to stick with them until the end, I do not want to be so depressed so regularly by reading all of them. These issues are difficult, and I probably should not have gone as far as I have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Would the Minister like to repeat some of Martin Amis's literary tricks? "Time's Arrow"	 was written back to front perhaps he would like to give his speeches in that way.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I sometimes wonder whether the Committee would notice if I gave my speeches back to front.
<P>
As the hon. Members who have spoken so far made clear, this is an important section of the Bill as it deals directly with issues of privacy and freedom of information. I accept entirely hon. Members' proper and weighted view on the importance of these provisions.
<P>
Special provision for journalistic, artistic and literary expression I shall use the term "journalism"	 for convenience is new to UK data protection law. The issue has not previously been dealt with. The current Act contains no exemptions for such activities, but it is now necessary for several reasons.<P>
Since the 1980s, the advent of desk-top computers has increasingly brought such processing within the scope of the current law. Moreover, the directive explicitly extends the range of data caught to include everything that is automatically processed that includes pictures and sound as well as structured manual data. We cannot therefore avoid discussing these matters in the context of the Bill. The directive also introduces mechanisms and rights that give the data subject greater power of action against the data controller. In that sense, it also has an effect on freedom of expression and privacy.
<P>
With regard to the specific arrangements, on Second Reading in another place Lord Wakeham, who in his role as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission would command the respect of all Committee members, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There are some minor points of detail in the Bill which perhaps need ironing out. That said, I have to say that in my view the Bill steers a sensible path which avoids the perils of a privacy law and achieves the crucial balancing act of privacy and freedom of expression in a clever and constructive way."	 [Official Report, House of Lords, 2 February 1998; Vol. 585, c. 462.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is in a strong position to make a judgement on that, because he has to deal with these issues in his role as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission.
<P>
The directive recognises the need to reconcile data protection privacy rights with freedom of expression. Article 9, to which the hon. Member for Ryedale referred, says that we
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall provide for exemptions or derogations"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from the directive's main provisions for processing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then "only if"	 which means to the extent that "they are necessary"	. We must also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which in practice means article 10 of the European convention on human rights. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned that.
<P>
The directive leaves it to member states to find the best way to do that in their own circumstances the legal background and the way in which the media, art and literature have developed in each country are, of course, different. It was not an easy task for the UK. Those who tried to negotiate a way through the subject did not pretend for a moment that it was an easy undertaking. We had exhaustive discussions with media interests to identify the difficulties. The biggest problem involved the need to avoid injunctions freezing the preparation of a story Such a story ultimately might be in the public interest, but one item of information or piece of data might cause its preparation to be halted. The result is a careful set of checks and balances, which I shall set out in some detail, although I shall simplify the language.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 31(1) provides exemptions from the data protection principles except security, subject access, blocking of processing, rectification and blocking of automated decisions taking. Those apply where there is or was an intention to publish, where there is a public interest justification and where compliance with the Bill mechanism is not compatible with journalism.
<P>
Clause 31(4) provides a stay on court enforcement action where processing is claimed to be solely for journalism with a view to publication of fresh material.
<P>
Clause 43 provides a power for the commissioner to serve a special information notice solely to find out whether those two conditions are actually met.
<P>
Clause 44 provides a power for the commissioner to make a determination, subject to appeal, that those conditions are not, or are no longer, met and hence to lift any stay on court proceedings.
<P>
Clause 45 provides a power for the commissioner to serve a normal information notice only once it has been determined under clause 44 that processing is not or is no longer solely for journalism with a view to publication of fresh materials and only then with leave of the court. Clause 45 also provides a power for the commissioner to serve a normal enforcement notice only retrospectively and only if a court agrees that she can because there is a contravention of substantial public importance.
<P>
Clause 52 provides a power for the commissioner to help an individual bring an action against the media where there is a matter of substantial public importance.
<P>
All the measures are intended, in a nutshell, to protect journalists' right to handle material about people provided that it is for true journalistic purposes and in the public interest. They do not give individuals who have something to hide a lever to stop investigations but they ensure that there are remedies for an individual where the privacy of information about them was in fact invaded.
<P>
As part of the broader package of provisions in the Bill for journalism and its two related purposes, clause 31 plays a key role by exempting personal dat processed for the special purposes from the main Bill mechanisms, provided that three cumulative conditions are met. Those conditions are: that the processing is with a view to publication of journalistic, literary or artistic material; that the data controller reasonably believes that, having regard in particular to the special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression, publication would be in the public interest; and finally, that the data controller reasonably believes that, in all the circumstances, compliance with the particular Bill mechanism is incompatible with the special purposes.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 220, 221 and 223 would add a "reasonable person"	 judgment to each of those three tests. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made some interesting comments in that regard.
<P>
Amendment No. 220 would attach a very arbitrary condition to what would otherwise be the most objective of the three tests that the processing is with a view to publication in the journalistic, artistic or literary sense. It would require the processor whether a journalist or editor and ultimately the court to reach a view on whether the publication would have or would be proved retrospectively to have significant merit. I accept that that is a difficult issue.
<P>
I must advise the Committee in the strongest terms to resist the temptation to build in such a test. Although we might all in our private, and sometimes our public, capacities deprecate what we consider to be shoddy journalism, that is very much a matter of taste and personal judgment. In the interests of freedom of expression we must accept that journalists have a serious job to do. We should not let the fact that we do not like what they do cloud our judgment about the seriousness of their job. Works of art and literature must sometimes challenge as well as soothe our taste. The fact that Martin Amis jars on my sensibilities does not necessarily undermine his literary merit.
<P>
Our job and the purpose of the test is to judge whether the processing legitimately qualifies as journalism, not to assess what kind of journalism it is or whether it has significant merit. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Ryedale to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 is different, because it at least tackles the provision subsection 1(b) that seeks to some extent to consider the merits of the subject matter that is being processed. So I certainly would not argue that it is misdirected. But what would the effect ofthe amendment be, and is an attempt to strengthen the subsection justified?
<P>
These are in fact two quite different points to consider, because the amendment does not achieve the effect that the hon. Gentleman wants. The existing form of words requires the data controller, reasonably to believe that publication would be in the public interest that is, to have regard in particular to the special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression. The term "reasonably"	 already requires the journalist to apply the test of what a reasonable person would believe. That is how the courts apply the test. The amendment would say the same thing, but with a minor variation to the wording. It would not add to the strength of the test, and could even serve only to confuse, although I accept that that is not the purpose behind it.
<P>
I should also like to tackle the underlying issue of whether a way should be found to strengthen the amendment. The Government approach with extreme caution any attempt to deal in statute with the extent to which individual examples of journalism or works of art or literature serve the public interest. We would rather that the law did not have to tackle the matter at all. The Bill does so only out of necessity, because its primary purpose is to protect individuals' privacy, and we must determine how far journalism can or should invade it. That is what the directive requires us to do. Relating the prospective publication to the public interest is the clearest and, in my opinion, the most obviously relevant way of doing that. But where should the presumption lie?
<P>
Given the high importance of freedom of inquiry and expression to our society, we must, on balance, favour publication, subject to reasonable restraint on the journalist's actions. The present test has been designed with some care to do that. Of course journalists might get it wrong that is in the nature of things. But they need to get it significantly wrong before the law should intervene. We do not, therefore, want to tinker with the test.I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment and to reflect carefully on underlying issues before even contemplating returning to the subsection. Important issues are at stake.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 would alter subsection (1)(c). The subsection will ensure that exemptions are not unnecessarily relied upon in a technical sense. For example, if subject access can be given without frustrating journalistic purpose it should be given. The test applies a control that requires the journalist properly to consider the questions. As with the previous amendment, the term "reasonably" already covers what is needed. The court would interpret that as a "reasonable person"	 test. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment for that reason. It could lead to confusion and to duplication in the same way as the previous amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 222 would raise the public interest threshold in subsection (1)(b), by requiring that the data controller must believe publication to be significantly in the public interest. At first sight, it may appear attractive to add a strengthening adverb to the test, but I invite the hon. Gentleman to consider the consequences. A court could conclude that there was a reasonable belief that a public interest is at stake. Given the high level at which the test would be set, however, the court might then feel driven to conclude that the interest fell short of the significance requirement. As a result, processing that was in the public interest, or, more strictly, was reasonably believed to be, could be held to be in breach of the data protection law.
<P>
I am sure that no hon. Member would want to see that happen. It would be a perverse outcome that would not serve the greater public good. We should maintain a proper emphasis on freedom of expression. Journalists already have to meet three tests, and can be challenged on any one of them. This particular one could put on the spike a range of stories that have merit in terms of the public interest, by raising the prospect of argument in court and of the application of penalties because of disagreement about the extent of those stories' service to the public interest. The law should be kept away from such difficult and value-laden judgments.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam agrees that while it may have been right to air the issue in debate, the amendment should not be incorporated into the Bill. As he said, amendments Nos. 189 and 190 revive an argument that was eloquently advanced by Lord Lester of Herne Hill in another place. I read the relevant Hansard with interest. I believe that Lord Falconer, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, properly answered the point, although the Government said that they would reflect further. We have done so, but I am afraid that our answer remains the same.
<P>
I shall deal first with the European provenance of the word "necessary"	. The Government accept that the restrictions that it places on privacy in favour of freedom of expression must meet the European "pressing social need"	 test of necessity, which is set out in articles 8 and 10 of the European convention on human rights. We also accept that the test embodies the European legal principle of proportionality, to which the hon. Member for Hallam referred.
<P>
The Government have also set out, in clause 31, to comply fully with the spirit and intention of the directive's article 9, which requires us to provide only exemptions from the core data protection regime that are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with freedom of expression. But to acknowledge that specific exemptions are necessary does not mean that they must themselves use the language of necessity. They must use language, and embody ideas, which fit the needs of reconciling the interest of privacy with that of freedom of expression. That is certainly an elusive task, but it is also far more subtle than copy out of the word "necessary"	 would achieve. So we must look at the merits and construct exemptions that will protect freedom of expression in the public interest.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having established, therefore, that we have a choice, we must determine what the use of the word "necessary"	 would do. In my submission, it would prevent publication except where it could be held to be necessary in the public interest. As Lord Falconer outlined in another place, it may indeed be difficult to argue that publication of a particular item is necessary in the public interest.
<P>
Yet the process of journalism is undoubtedly necessary, and it is in the public interest that journalists should be able to handle personal information with a view to publication without submitting themselves to the test of whether the public interest can be shown absolutely to require its publication in an individual case. That is much too high a hurdle, too high a burden of proof, to sustain the spirit of inquiry on which free expression relies. It might be satisfied in relatively few cases.
<P>
The test already requires a reasonable belief that publication would be in the public interest. In the interests of investigative journalism, whose importance I am sure that the hon. Member for Hallam recognises as much as do the Government, I invite him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 224 is concerned with two of the three special purposes artistic and literary expression and two of the three exemption conditions in clause 31(1) public interest and incompatibility of data protection compliance with the special purposes. Those exemptions would apply only in so far as is necessary to reconcile privacy with freedom of expression."	
<P>
In so far as it plays in the key reconciliation formula in directive article 9, I would have to argue against the amendment because of its circularity. We must reconcile privacy with freedom of expression. The Bill finds a mechanism to do that, but then the amendment would require part of that mechanism to reconcile privacy with freedom of expression. That would confuse the means of delivery with the objective that it is already manifestly designed to serve. The arrangements in the Bill are better.
<P>
Moreover, amendment No. 224 selects only part of the means of delivery for such treatment. The media provisions in the Bill stand or fall achieve the article 9 objective or not in their entirety: they will not do it just because we assert that particular elements should do it. To see how the arrangements in the Bill work, they must be considered as a whole.
<P>
Subsections 1(b) and (c) have a part to play in the wider package that I outlined earlier in their present forms. If their tests are passed, and condition (a) is also met, the processing should go ahead uninterrupted, without reference back to the original rationale for those and other provisions.
<P>
I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will agree to maintain the distinction between the general and the particular by withdrawing the amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 191 and 200 are similar to amendments proposed in another place, but I am entirely content that we should look again at their effect in this Committee. They would put it beyond doubt that, where a designated media code touches on issues raised by the publication in question, a court must have regard to whether the journalist complied with the code's provisions.
<P>
I can understand the desire to tidy the law by removing apparent uncertainties in its application. Sometimes, however, we must leave choice to the parties concerned, and I believe that this is such a case. If the case can be resolved by direct reference to the public interest, as is suggested in clause 31(1)(b), that is so much the better. Whichever way the case may go, that would be a satisfactory outcome. I do not believe that further measures should be necessary.
<P>
I should add that the codes are not equivalent to primary legislation. They are more flexible than that, which has many advantages, but they are also less authoritative. The codes variously amplify the law and establish non-statutory principles and remedies. They may be appropriate for secondary references in dealing with the difficult issues that we face, but it would be inappropriate always to play them in merely because they touch on an issue that a publication has raised. That would elevate them to the level of primary legislation, which is not our intention.
<P>
In the light of that explanation, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. The arrangements have been carefully worked out I quoted Lord Wakeham to that effect earlier. Having got the balance right, it would be a mistake to play about with the wording to any great extent. That may unintentionally create difficulties and impact on the delicate balance that we have tried to arrange.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As the Minister acknowledges, it was important that we raised the issues. There are some other matters to be considered with regard to clause 31. The Minister has already touched on them, but we shall need to return to them when we discuss amendments Nos. 280 and 281.
<P>
The Minister has conceded that the issue of reasonableness is of key importance. Ultimately it will be for the courts, or for the commissioner and the tribunal, to make a judgment. Having accepted what the Minister has said, we feel that it is best, on balance, to leave the wording as it is.
<P>
I hope that the Minister understands that in seeking to introduce the word "necessary"	, we were not suggesting that something may be necessary in the public interest. We were trying to draw attention to the fact that it is necessary to balance the rights and freedoms of the individual with freedom of expression, and to address the vexed problem of balancing articles 8 and 10 of the convention, using the words of the directive. The Minister said that it is not helpful to move from the general to the particular. Perhaps the Committee and the House should consider whether everything should be in the general and nothing in the particular. Article 9 of the directive states that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear that the clause intends to strike that essential balance.
<P>
I turn to the question of whether we should employ "may"	, "must"	 or "shall"	 with regard to compliance with any code of practice. The Bill suggests that the courts should consider whether the publisher followed any code of practice in trying to interpret what was reasonable. I hear what the Minister says about the impact of putting in primary legislation a provision prescribing that in order to obtain the benefit of the exemption, the publisher would have to have regard to any code of practice, whether that was the code of the Press Complaints Commission or the Broadcasting Standards Commission. That would approach a statutory framework for the press, which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are anxious to avoid.
<P>
We are not saying that the law should require all members of the press or all broadcasters to have regard to their codes of conduct. They say that they voluntarily do so I see the Minister's distinction. But they are being given such a wide ranging special exemption that there is a case for ensuring, in some way or other, that they have regard to the codes. That is subtly different from we have tried to do with our amendment. We may, however, have to accept the position as it is.
<P>
It is an important point because of the wide-ranging exemption that the clause provides for these special purposes. As the Minister admitted, it goes way beyond anything in the 1984 Act. I agree with his sentiment that it is more than likely that neither the previous Government we were not particularly enamoured of the directive in the first place nor the current Government would have sought to do that enthusiastically and positively. The clause endeavours to meet the requirements of article 9 in such a way as to balancethe interests of privacy and freedom of information, as the directive makes clear. The provision should be implemented only in order to achieve that balance.
<P>
Other hon. Members may want to study what the Minister has said; I shall certainly do so and think about whether the form of words in subjections (1), (2) and (3) in particular might be capable of further improvement. For the moment, having had this important and detailed debate, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 280, in page 20, line 5, leave out `either' and insert `one'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 281, in page 20, line 11, at end insert <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or
<P>
(c) that in any proceedings the court or the tribunal has, on the application of any party, made a determination to the like effect to a determination which the Commissioner could have made under section 43, with respect to the data in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I fear that what I need to say will require us to sit again at half-past 4. In his earlier speech in response to amendment No. 220, the Minister anticipated, in respect of any dispute between a data subject and a data controller, the Bill's arrangements for determining whether the data controller was entitled to claim the exemptions set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1) those on the freedom of public interest.
<P>
Under subsection (4) data subjects will, on occasion, seek proceedings against a data controller in order to exercise the data subject rights set out in the Bill in clauses 7, 9, 12 and 13.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
