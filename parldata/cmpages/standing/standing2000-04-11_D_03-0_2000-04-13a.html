<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): At the end of this morning's proceedings, I described my concerns about the impact of the Government's proposal on various aspects of public sector activity. Fears have been expressed, not by people who approach the Bill in an unreasonable spirit, but by those who will have to make it work. They fear that the emergence in this country of a compensation culture along the lines of that in the United States will give rise to unnecessary and vexatious litigation, and that contesting legal action and making compensation payments will involve public sector bodies in unnecessary expense.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that the Government have thought carefully about the implication of their proposal for every Department in Whitehall. I hope, too, that a proper consultation exercise has taken place between other Departments and the Home Office to ensure that the consequences of the amendment have been properly thought through. Every hon. Member is aware that the law sometimes has consequences that legislators did not intend. I hope, therefore, that the Minister can give me the assurances that I seek.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I share the concern of the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) that we should not develop the compensation culture that has emerged in many other countries. We do not expect-indeed, there are no grounds to expect-that the Bill will result in that. There will be people, as there always, are, who make spurious claims under the Bill. However, the Government's approach has involved considerable consultation across Departments. Departments and public authorities will be able to resist spurious claims, and the fears raised about this aspect of the Bill are unlikely to produce any serious problems.

<P>
We understand the concerns that have been expressed. No doubt some lawyers could examine legislation and say that they could make a claim under this or that provision. However, that does not mean that the courts will entertain such a claim in practice. There is a clear onus on the complainant to show that a requirement or condition has been applied to him, that fewer people of his racial group can comply and that it is to his detriment that he cannot comply. Therefore, the onus on the complainant is quite great in the first place, and would prevent claims with no merit from succeeding.

<P>
The House of Lords considered the issue of the justification for indirect discrimination on 17 February in the case of Seymour Smith. The case was Regina v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment. There was an original appellant and cross-respondent. It was ex parte Seymour Smith and Another, but I will call it Seymour Smith.
 
<P>
The text of that judgment is very helpful to the Government and, indeed, to public authorities in considering this issue. It involves similar provisions in the equal treatment directive. The case was about whether a requirement that a person had to be employed for two years before he or she could claim unfair dismissal indirectly discriminated against women, since a smaller percentage of women are employed for two years or more. The case was decided on the grounds that the difference in terms of those that could comply was not statistically considerably smaller.

<P>
Given that that was a House of Lords judgment, it carries considerable weight. Although the case was not decided on the grounds of justification, it has, obiter, an important aspect which assists our consideration of the amendment. In his comments about rejected justification in relation to the case, Lord Nicholls said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The burden placed on the government in this type of case is not as heavy as previously thought. Governments must be able to govern. They adopt general policies, and implement measures to carry out their policies. Governments must be able to take into account a wide range of social, economic and political factors...If their aim is legitimate, governments have discretion when choosing their method to achieve their aim. National courts, acting with the benefit of hindsight, are not to impose an impractical burden on governments which are proceeding in good faith. Generalised assumptions, lacking any factual foundation are not good enough. Governments are to be afforded a broad measure of discretion.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government take some comfort from this recent indication of the courts willingness to address the issue of justification. Bearing in mind our strongly held view that our policies are fully justifiable, even if they have a disproportionate impact on different racial groups, we feel that there is little to fear from this being tested in the courts.

<P>
 Turning to the point made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury regarding the number of claims that might arise, the Government do not expect a surge of vexatious claims, although a theoretical risk can always be identified. If we take claims of indirect discrimination handled by the Commission for Racial Equality under the non-employment provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976 as a guide for claims that may be brought under the proposed new section 19B, I believe that we should be reassured.

<P>
In 1997, only nine out of 456 complaints handled by the CRE were on the grounds of indirect discrimination, and in 1998 only three out of 479 complaints were on those grounds. Such numbers of claims are not large by any stretch of the imagination. That is the case under the existing provisions on indirect discrimination in the Act, which I should stress already applied to public authorities as employers, as providers of goods, facilities and services and in the field of education and training. We see no reason why in the long term the position should be any different in respect of public functions to which the Act is being extended.

<P>
That is not to say that the Act will not have any effect. It will certainly have a very beneficial effect on the way in which public authorities operate. What I am suggesting is that because of the way in which the law is operated, and given the strong indications by the House of Lords in that recent judgment, we do not think it likely that frivolous claims will be entertained seriously by the courts.

<P>
That brings me to the point raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury regarding the defence under section 1(1)(b) of the Act. As his outline of the case law this morning reminds us, indirect discrimination is not a new concept. Both the public and the private sectors have been subject to it for almost a quarter of a century. The only problem, which the Bill should correct, is that some significant public sector functions were not included in the 1976 Act or were excluded by case law.

<P>
As I said in my opening remarks, the case law shows that the courts have given public authorities a fair wind. Recent comments by Lord Nicholls in the Seymour Smith case reaffirm that.

<P>
As for the hon. Gentleman's point about damages for inadvertent, indirect discrimination under section 57(3) of the Act, no damages are payable if a respondent proves that the requirement or condition in question was not applied with the intention of treating the complainant unfairly on racial grounds. The provision will apply to any claims of indirect discrimination that are brought under new section 19B. The provision will operate in such a way that the hon. Gentleman's concern about the compensation culture does apply, but the court could issue guidance or a directive about how the law could be interpreted.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked whether indirect discrimination would prevent the police from using stop and search that is intelligence-led. The Government's view is that nothing in the amendment would give rise to that. Stop and search will not be inhibited, whether intelligence-led or not, by reason of the amendment or the legislation as a whole. Police officers are required under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to have reasonable suspicion that an offence has been, or may be, committed in order to carry out a stop and search.

<P>
Under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, to have reasonable grounds for suspicion or belief will depend upon the circumstances, but there must be an objective basis for it. A police officer who goes beyond his powers and stops someone solely on the grounds of his race or colour or otherwise treats someone unfavourably on such grounds could be challenged within the direct discrimination provisions in the Bill. I hope that I have dealt with some of the legitimate concerns that were raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury.

<P>
A whole series of other cases give rise to our view that fair wind would be accorded public authorities in carrying out their proper duties, provided that there is some justification. I can cite a number of cases-although the strongest is Seymour Smith-including Panesar v. Nestle Co. Ltd [1980], a decision by the employment appeals tribunal, Kingston and Richmond Area Health Authority v. Kaur [1981] and the Board of Governors of St. Matthias Church of England School v. Crizzle [1993], each of which involved a decision of the employment appeals tribunal. In those cases, it was a matter of how the public authority would exercise its view of its policy, and the tribunal decided that the public authority had acted reasonably.

<P>
We do not, therefore, have anything to fear, because the provision will be applied in a reasoned way. It has been applied in many sectors of employment for a long time without serious problems. It is helpful, because it reduces the conditions or requirements that would be discriminatory, and places a burden on public authorities that are brought within the provisions of the race relations legislation by reason of the amendment not to discriminate. I suggest, however, that it will not create the grounds on which any of the fears that the hon. Gentleman has rightly brought to our attention may be justified. We do not expect a compensation culture. We have canvassed the views of other Departments; they, too, are satisfied that they can justify their policies. I hope that on that basis I have reassured the hon. Member for Aylesbury.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I should like briefly to respond to the Minister. It was perfectly proper for the hon. Member for Aylesbury to ask those questions. One valuable aspect of the debate in another place was that it was understood that there were two sides to the argument; everyone was tolerant and wanted to make sure that the balance of argument would be decisive in the end.
 
<P>
Before I ask the Minister a couple of questions, I wish to reinforce one point and make another. I reinforce the Minister's justification on the basis of experience. Since the 1976 Act, we have had 24 years of indirect discrimination being a potential cause of a complaint or action, albeit limited to the aspects covered by that legislation. So we are not in uncharted water. It was limited to the direct activities of employers in the public and private sector. To be honest, even within that limited area, it was relatively wide-ranging.

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We could run through the list of aspects that have been tested-employment, certification and training matters. As the Minister rightly said, the provision of goods, facilities and services is important. It applies across the whole of the public and private sector. It is not as if it were just a small pilot scheme somewhere, making the absence of case law unsurprising.

<P>
There is another positive element in the development of legislation. A growing complaint about discrimination in this country over the past 10 or 20 years has come from ethnic minority members of minority faith groups-Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus. By extending the legislation, such groups would have a potential remedy against discrimination on grounds of religious beliefs.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister indicates not. That was my understanding of how we could offer such groups some of the solace that they sought. If I am wrong, I stand to be corrected.

<P>
I have two linked questions. First, when the Government announced proposals to implement a human rights Bill, which is now the Human Rights Act 1998 and is due to come into effect this autumn, they also announced that they intended to set up a joint committee of both Houses-a human rights committee. I understand that that remains the Government's intention, which I welcome. The Government have never varied from the view that the committee should be in place before the legislation comes into operation in October. Will the Minister clarify how near the Government are to producing a timetable and to consulting the parties about the structure of that committee?

<P>
I raise that matter because if we wish to avoid unnecessary litigation, we need forums in place so that people can be directed to them when they have a cause for complaint. The hon. Member for Aylesbury referred to three sectors-education, policing and health-and there may be others. I share both Front-Bench spokesmen's views that we do not wish to move towards a society in which there is constant litigation to receive remedies and damages. We wish to ensure that public authorities and others comply with the law.

<P>
There are various ways of achieving that. The Minister alluded to one, whereby people can go to the Commission for Racial Equality to seek advice, just as others have gone to the Equal Opportunities Commission. Legal support will be provided so that test cases can develop. One of my constituents is going down that road. If the CRE does not support the final stage, people are entitled to do so.

<P>
We do not have a written constitution or our own native Bill of Rights, so we do not have a culture for sending people in wise directions to seek advice. As this Bill and other provisions on equal opportunities come on to the statute book, and we have the opportunities presented by the Human Rights Act and the planned human rights committee, we should try to offer ordinary citizens the best routes for seeking advice about potential grounds, without cost to themselves or to the taxpayer. The Government have rightly legislated against bad immigration advisers, of whom I have had my full share of experience in constituency immigration work, but people also give badly founded advice on people's rights under administrative law and human rights legislation. The truth is that there are not huge numbers of solicitors, barristers or others who are competent, experienced, knowledgeable about the law and up to date with it.

<P>
I have a bit of an open question, but it ties in with the setting up of the human rights committee. It strikes me that there could be two ways of making progress on ensuring that people who want to test the water or exercise their rights receive decent advice. First, we could ensure that the best, least litigious and most constructive way in which to pursue remedies and establish rights is announced when the Bill comes into force. Secondly, we could require the human rights committee to monitor and report regularly on the working of both the equal opportunities and the race relations legislation, because that could ensure the proper provision of services and advice. Although the experience of the past 25 years suggests that there will not be a great upswing of people rushing into litigation, one never knows what the pattern of issues will be.

<P>
What are the plans for the human rights committee? Are they yet at an appropriate stage for multi-party discussion? If it must be set up for October, we do not have much time. It will have to be ready before Parliament rises for the summer, so we must get on with that. How will we ensure that people receive the best advice about their rights, without forcing them to spend their money on private legal advice?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I was grateful to the Minister for the tone and content of his response. Clearly, I shall want to reflect on what he said, and before the Bill proceeds to the next stage, I shall take advice from people outside the House who are interested in the subject. However, I do not propose to divide the Committee on the Government amendment.

<P>
Like the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), I think that it would be valuable if the Government shared their current thinking about the time scale for establishing the human rights committee. Earlier, I referred to potential difficulties for health authorities in setting priorities. That issue deserves further reflection, because there is not much doubt that the examples that I cited would be discriminatory. Would it be sufficient in law for the health authority to argue that there were intrinsic reasons of good health care practice for adopting such priorities, notwithstanding the fact that their effects were indirectly discriminatory?

<P>
As I said this morning, I tabled questions to the Secretary of State for Health about the impact of the Bill on his Department's work. I was told that the Department was still taking legal advice about the impact on NHS trusts and health authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have not seen those answers, so may I clarify their nature? Do they relate to the duty to promote-an issue not dealt with by the amendment-or to indirect discrimination? Indirect discrimination provisions have applied to such bodies since 1976.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The questions were specifically about the extension to the entire public sector of the duty not to discriminate, either directly or indirectly. One reason why I tabled those questions is that I was uncertain about whether the activities of the national health service were covered by the Race Relations Act 1976, notwithstanding the Amin judgment. The answer was that the Department of Health was taking legal advice on the matter, which told me that Health Ministers must still have some doubt in their minds. I want to pursue that line of inquiry further and I ask the Minister to explore it further with his colleagues at the Department of Health.

<P>
My final request is simple. Will the Minister make available the text of the judgment in the Seymour Smith case to members of the Committee and the Library? That judgment was made earlier this year, so no doubt it has not yet been published in full in law reports. I think that it would help us to have the full text available.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall certainly ensure that copies of the judgment are made available to members of the Committee, and I am more than content to do so. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised concerns about the fire service. It will be subject to the targets set by the Home Secretary on recruitment, retention and progress of members of the ethnic minority community who join the fire service. We anticipate that that will deal with some of the issues about how the fire service operates.

<P>
The Home Office has published a consultation document on a basket of indicators about the provision of Government services to ethnic minorities to enable us to assess the disproportionality of delivery of public services, depending on the needs of people from different ethnic minorities. That will help us to deal with some of those issues.

<P>
The duty to promote will also bear on the fire service. It will need to examine its practices in the context of the recent report by Her Majesty's inspectorate of fire services, which considered the impact of fire service policies on ethnic minorities. The NHS is covered on indirect discrimination under section 20 of the Race Relations Act 1976. This Bill will affect the health service, in so far as a duty to promote is concerned. I have now been handed a copy of the answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. The Department of Health is working with lawyers to assess the impact of the extension to all duties of public authorities of the provisions on indirect discrimination in the Race Relations Act 1976. That includes the implications for the Department, health authorities, national health service trusts and primary care groups. Further answers make similar points about trusts and so on. I will certainly consider those matters. I will also consult my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), and ask him to write to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to religious discrimination. The Race Relations Act 1976 deals to some extent with religious discrimination against Sikhs and Jews, but not discrimination against some other religions, particularly universal religions such as Islam, because of the way in which the provisions were drawn. However, we are conducting a research project into the extent of religious discrimination and how such discrimination, particularly against Muslims, could be tackled in legislation if it later proved to be necessary.

<P>
The Bill is intended primarily to implement the result of the inquiry into the investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence; we have added to it the duty to promote. However, we are examining the recommendations in the third review by the Commission for Racial Equality of the operations of the Race Relations Act 1976. When parliamentary time allows, and with all the usual caveats, we are considering introducing a measure to tackle some of the issues raised in that review. It may be opportune then to consider whether religious discrimination against Muslims and other religions should be addressed, as that is not covered in the 1976 Act.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the Minister's argument, but it may help the Committee and those who read the report of our deliberations if he gives an example of the changes that the measure will introduce in respect of alleged discrimination against people of a particular faith. The Committee will remember past cases involving Sikhs who were told that they could not do certain jobs because they wore a turban; the wider issue of days of religious observance is the other side of the coin. I should like to know how much further the Bill goes into such matters, but I do not want to put the Minister on the spot.

<P>
I understand the argument about the wider review of the law on discrimination on racial or religious grounds. Are the Government contemplating a proposal that provides an overarching remedy for discrimination? Parliament has argued for 20 years about whether there should be separate bodies to test racial and gender discrimination and whether religious discrimination should be included.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Bill will not extend the law on religious discrimination except in so far as current law dictates, where it applies to Jews and Sikhs, for example, whose religions would be covered by reason of their relationship to ethnicity.

<P>
It has been argued that there are gaps in the legislation in respect of Muslims and that is why the research project is being conducted. The duty to promote, however, aims to encourage race equality; some members of ethnic minorities, despite being members of a universal religion, which is not limited by ethnicity, will benefit from that duty, on the grounds of their ethnicity, not their religion. Many people who believe that they are discriminated against on religious grounds could find that that it covered by the Bill, even though its provisions are not specifically aimed at such discrimination. The Bill seeks to prevent discrimination on racial grounds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am interested in what the Minister has just been saying. To take up the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, if my memory is right, there is some case law that gave protection against discrimination to British Muslims, not because they were Muslims but because the court interpreted a particular practice as discriminating indirectly against people from the Pakistani or Bangladeshi community in this country. I cannot remember whether this was a case to do with wearing the hejab or something similar. In practical terms, however, that judgment protected British Muslims on something very important to them, even though the rationale for the judgment was on grounds of racial rather than religious discrimination.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is probably correct. In some cases, direct discrimination against a Muslim, which is not unlawful under the 1976 Act at the moment, could be indirect discrimination against a particular racial group under the 1976 Act-and indeed where this Bill extends it, under this Bill. To a limited extent, the provisions on indirect discrimination may prevent conditions being imposed that might discriminate against Muslims, not because it is targeting a religion but because many Muslims are from a particular ethnic background. A provision that sought to bite on religious holidays might well be a condition that could come under the provisions in this legislation.

<P>
We need to be a little careful, because the law is limited in this area, particularly the law decided by the House of Lords. Therefore, to some extent, the courts will have to interpret the detail of the meaning. I am conscious, as all Ministers are, of Pepper v. Hart and I am trying not to put myself in a position of directing the court in any particular way. It might move us along if I refer to Panasar v. Nestle Co. Ltd., a case from 20 years ago. That was an employment appeal tribunal case about an orthodox Sikh who was refused a job at a chocolate factory because he refused to shave off his beard. That was obviously of some importance in relation to Sikhs and they are covered by the 1976 Act. It could not apply in the same way, therefore, to Muslims. In that case, of course, it was acceptable for the public authorities to have a provision that required moustaches and beards to be removed in particular circumstances. The courts can, therefore, examine these issues with a great deal of care, and I hope that in due course we will be able to get a greater body of law that will assist us. Expanding on it at this point will not take us very far, so I will not seek to do that.

<P>
Discussions about the human rights committee are still going on, both internally in government and with some bodies of the House. If the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will forgive me, I cannot recall exactly the point reached in those discussions, but I can send him a letter on the current state of the issue, which I will copy to the hon. Member for Aylesbury, and other members of the Committee too. [
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asks, ``How long?'' I say, not long. Our aim would be to be ready to set it out by 2 October 2000. Given the obvious importance of the date in the parliamentary calendar, the committee may well not be functioning on 2 October because the House may not be sitting. That remains to be decided. However, we are moving forward on that. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we want the committee to be set up as soon as possible, and I cannot imagine that it will not be-our aim is to set it up this year.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked whether the human rights committee might oversee the operation of the Bill. It will probably have its work cut out with human rights legislation, although I can see the overlap. We shall shortly discuss the monitoring of the Bill when we consider a Liberal Democrat amendment. We have some sympathy in that regard and we have to examine some of the ways in which we might deal with the issue. However, as regards creating a different monitoring facility, it is probably inappropriate to give the human rights committee the job of looking after the Bill. There are different ways in which the House might decide to examine matters, and I do not want to get into negotiations in Committee. Let us see how the discussions go in the usual channels.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also asked about the route by which people get advice. The CRE is there to advise people. The hon. Gentleman is concerned that it might not be a satisfactory route for everyone and that people will incur costs. We must bear it in mind-and we have been cautious about this in relation to the Human Rights Act-that we must not let people transfer their responsibility for briefing themselves on their liability under that legislation to another body, so that they can say, ``Well, that body has advised me, so I am no longer responsible.'' Individuals are responsible for what they do under the Bill and under human rights legislation, and organisations are responsible for what they do. It is right that they should take that responsibility. That might mean that some individuals have to meet the costs of employing lawyers and so on to find out what their responsibilities are under the law.

<P>
We have debated the community legal service, which will assist ordinary citizens and individuals in getting advice. Our aim is to ensure that race relations and human rights provisions are part or the culture of rights that the Government seek to develop. That means that individuals and organisations will have to accept responsibility for themselves.

<P>
My last point relates to the culture of compensation and an issue raised by the hon. Members for Aylesbury and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. We want legislation that deals effectively with indirect discrimination by public authorities. That means that compensation will be paid on occasion. However, we do not want to develop a culture in which people seek compensation for the sake of it or because it will make them some money, even though their rights have not been breached-that is what happens in the culture of litigation that has developed in some other countries. We want to develop something entirely different.

<P>
We want a culture of rights in which people realise that their right is also their responsibility or someone else's responsibility, and that rights are reciprocal. The development of such an understanding will, I hope, lead people to realise that all rights need to strike a proper balance between individuals and the community. In those circumstances, it is possible to move forward with mutual respect. The aim is to create not a litigious culture, but a culture of rights that are respected because they are enshrined in statute and in which people recognise their social obligation to comply with them.
<P>
3.15pm

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> To respond quickly to the Minister's last point, I understand that people are responsible for their own obligations under the law. I did not mean to suggest that the CRE should not be the first port of call for people who want advice. Just as the Government have taken the lead confidently and well by initiating and participating in events to make sure that people are geared up to understand the Human Rights Act, when we take on significant legislation in this area, as we shall do, we shall need again to make sure that people are informed and that they know where to go for the best interpretation and advice that is collectively available. Then they must do with that what they will.

<P>
Without wanting to extend the debate about religious discrimination, I hope that the Government will move consideration of those matter on as quickly and as soon as is practically possible, so that they are in a position to present some consultative document, perhaps in the form of a Green Paper, on how our religious discrimination legislation can be amended. The example that always occurs to me, and I use it as a member of the Christian church, is that there is protection in the context of blasphemy if it is against the Christian religion, but no protection if the blasphemy is against any other faith. I have always regarded that as an unjustified protection of the Christian faith. It is controversial but, like many other Members of the House, I believe that people should treat people of all faiths and their views equally. I hope that the Church will be as positive about getting rid of that privilege as any other faith would be, if it had the privilege.

<P>
It would be good to press on with the research that the Minister mentioned. Certainly the Liberal Democrat party is willing-I hope that other parties are willing, too-to take part in discussions on how to take that forward. As the Minister is ready to do that, it would be an appropriate task to set ourselves for those idle moments when people dealing with home affairs do not have a hundred other things to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I did not understand the point that the hon. Gentleman made about education. I do not think that he was suggesting that we set up a new advisory body. He was suggesting merely that we ensure that those who may be affected by the legislation are properly informed. I will certainly bear that point in mind because we shall be looking at the way in which we inform people about their rights in the context of the human rights legislation and we may well be able to find some read-across there. The Government have been discussing some areas of the information-providing agenda, and publicity campaigns, although, as always with such things, we still have to identify resources and commit to the expenditure.

<P>
I shall bear in mind the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. Please forgive me if I do not follow him down the route of blasphemy.

<P>
Amendment agreed to

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) Nothing in this section shall make unlawful any measures appropriate and necessary to meet the special needs of persons of a particular racial group or any measures designed to prevent or compensate for disadvantages suffered by persons of that racial group.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to debate amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) Nothing in Parts II to IV shall render unlawful any measure by a public authority in the carrying out of any of its functions that-

<P>
(a) relates to a particular racial group;

<P>
(b) affords access to facilities or services, and ancillary benefits; and

<P>
(c) is appropriate to meet the special needs of members of that racial group or to compensate for disadvantage suffered by members of that racial group.

<P>
(10) For the purposes of subsection (9) members of a particular racial group shall be treated as having suffered a disadvantage if the proportion of persons of that group who have suffered disadvantage in relation to a function of the authority has been, during a period of at least 12 months, and continues to be, considerably greater than the proportion of persons not of that racial group.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> These are amendments about positive action and they relate to two parts of clause 1. The hon. Member for mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) has commented that once we are past clause 1 it will all be downhill. If we appear to spend a great deal of time on clause 1, it is for a good purpose because that is the meat of the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 2 would add a section at the end of what will become section 19B of the 1976 Act. It relates to measures taken by public authorities to meet the special needs of, or compensate for disadvantages suffered by, people of a particular racial group. Amendment No. 16 provides an extended definition of those proposals. The hon. Member for Aylesbury referred to thresholds, measures or steps. Amendment No. 16 has built into it the criterion that there must be sufficient cause for a complaint to be in the category of meriting serious consideration. For example, there needs to have been a 12-month period of disadvantage, or a disadvantage that is considerably greater, not merely greater. We have sought to weight the criterion in a way that prevents consideration of frivolous, vexatious or flippant complaints.

<P>
The amendment would permit public authorities to take proportionate measures to meet the needs of members of racial groups. The intention is to permit authorities, where necessary, to go beyond the general requirement to justify policies and schemes intended to benefit certain communities. The amendment would also make lawful the taking, where necessary, of additional or different action-a point that was addressed by the Lawrence inquiry, and one of the lessons that came through strongly to those of us who attended some of its sittings. You will know, Mr. Sayeed, that that protection is necessary in legislation because in any targeting of special measures such as those relating to language, or to length of residence, without it we run the risk of appearing to discriminate in favour of group A rather than group B. The primary purpose is to ensure clearer drafting, but it is also to reflect the European Commission's proposal for a race equality directive, and is drawn from that.

<P>
I am aware from constituency and other work that such issues go to the heart of the social exclusion debate that is properly taking place at present. The reality is that certain groups may be excluded for certain reasons. For example, certain groups traditionally may have larger households on account of family composition. A pattern of staying together in an extended family is much stronger in some traditions than in others. That has knock-on effects on housing policy. Those of us who deal with housing policy need at least to know that there are different types of need, so that question must be addressed. To give a crude example, if a local authority were to commission and build only properties with two bedrooms or fewer, such properties would be rendered unavailable to certain families. That is a general example of the need to be conscious of indirect discrimination towards certain groups.

<P>
There are more specific examples, one of which relates to language. I will put it in a recent context. People arriving in this country from countries where there is no tradition of speaking English do not have easy access to services because they do not know that the services exist. I do not know the figures, but until five or 10 years ago the number of Albanians living in Britain and speaking Albanian was very small. Until the events in southern Europe of the past decade and the change of regime in Albania took place, that was the case. It may be necessary, therefore, to take action that targets a racial group, defined by race and language, in order to ensure that it has access to a specific service. There are obvious examples that allow us to understand why we need this provision to produce the more racially equal society that we seek.

<P>
Of course, one must always act in a way that is proportionate to the debate on discrimination. One avoids it and promotes equality by making sure that one does not enact legislation that adversely affects certain groups by positively supporting others. I hope that the amendments appeal to the Committee as a way to address the issue and are seen to be compatible with international legal obligations. Will the Minister give a positive response or, if this is not the right way forward, suggest another route that we may be able to pursue?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I understand the motivation behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The language that he and his hon. Friends have deployed draws on the exceptions provided in sections 35 and 36 of the Race Relations Act 1976 about education, training and welfare. Referring to the provisions of that Act leads me to express a measure of doubt about whether the catch-all exception that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey proposes is appropriate. I am instinctively cautious about going down that route rather than considering carefully specific policies to permit positive action, even if they involve incorporation into the legislation of statutory exceptions to a general principle of non-discrimination.

<P>
Even in my constituency, let alone in that represented by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I see measures introduced to assist people whose first language is not English, but I need to be convinced that the exception should be as all-embracing as is proposed in the amendments.

<P>
I also question whether the amendment is necessary in the light of the Government's intention to include in the Bill a statutory duty to promote racial equality and whether that would provide the means to combat the social exclusion of people from specific minorities, which is what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey seeks to address in his amendment.

<P>
We need to beware of over-simplifying the debate on race relations in Britian and the notion of the white majority and the ethnic minorities as a block. In truth, the different ethnic communities are very diverse. When one considers the Government's measures for social exclusion and refers to various studies undertaken by outside organisations, one finds that poor, white, young men often achieve least in education and good employment in many parts of Britain.

<P>
When we discuss this type of amendment to our legislation, we need to ask whether we would want to invite local authorities to target positive-action programmes designed to help white people in a particular way. Exceptions would not necessarily be applied only to ethnic minorities from the new commonwealth or elsewhere in the world. I am quite prepared to be open-minded and to listen to the arguments in the debate on the amendments, but I approach them from a somewhat sceptical point of view.

<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If we feared that the inclusion of indirect discrimination might prevent us from carrying out policies to assist disadvantaged people from ethnic minorities, we might have accepted something along the lines of the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which arises out of the European Union directive. However, we believe that the provisions in the Bill and the way that section 35 of the 1976 Act operates will enable us to pursue policies that deal with issues of social exclusion without creating such a provision for positive discrimination.

<P>
The Government agreed to consider the matter when it was discussed in the other place. That was in the context of looking at our concerns about indirect discrimination. Although the Government could not accept the amendment as it stood, we wondered whether there was a case for widening the positive-action provision to protect any acts to meet special needs of a particular racial group that would otherwise have become unlawful under the proposed new section 19B.

<P>
The main difficulty that the Government have with the amendment is that the provision enabling organisations to compensate for disadvantages suffered, where there is no special need, would have the effect of legalising positive discrimination. That is not only contrary to Government policy, but it is not really a request that black and Asian people in this country are making. Essentially, the ethnic minority communities want a fair deal. They want an end to glass ceilings and discrimination; they want to be able to achieve on merit. They are not asking for the sort of provisions that operate in the United States.

<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey does not advocate that, but is trying to ensure that any positive-action provisions would be safeguarded. On consideration and having done some further interdepartmental work on the issue, the Government have decided that there is no need for any additional positive-action provision. We believe that because the purpose of section 35 is clearly to allow services targeted at and meeting the needs of ethnic minorities, the provision is likely to be widely interpreted. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that section 35 is widely interpreted. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nothing in parts II to IV shall render unlawful any act done in affording persons of a particular racial group access to facilities or services to meet the special needs of persons of that group in regard to their education, training or welfare, or any ancillary benefits.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is quite a wide provision.

<P>
Having discussed the matter with our colleagues in other Departments, we have been unable to identify any acts that might be carried out by the Government or, indeed, by public authorities, whether local or otherwise, that are not already covered by the provisions in section 35. Including a positive discrimination provision in the Bill might send the wrong message. The message that we are trying to send is that there should be a positive duty to promote racial equality because we are a multiracial society and we must be a successful one. We all have a responsibility to contribute to it. That means getting rid of discrimination and being positive about the benefits of a successful multiracial society; but it does not mean giving ethnic minorities special privileges or preferred access in a way that disadvantages others. Sending out the right message-that we all benefit from a successful, multiracial society-is important. We are not seeking to provide privileges beyond equality.

<P>
I sympathise with the aims behind the amendment. In another place, the Government affirmed that if there were continuing problems with indirect discrimination, which prevented us from carrying out our policies to assist ethnic minorities, further provision might be necessary. Our researches suggest, however, that section 35 and the duty to promote will enable us to achieve our objectives. The amendment is unnecessary. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and that he will withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If I was not minded to consider the amendments as probing ones, the Minister will understand that I was encouraged to do so by the debate in another place where the issue came up twice-in Committee and on Report. The first time, Lord Bassam said that the Government saw some merit in the amendment, which would be worth considering further. The second time, he went further, as the Government had announced that indirect discrimination would be covered, which gave further support to this sort of amendment. It seemed that the Government had incorporated it in their work plan, so the amendment was an attempt to see what would come back.

<P>
The Minister may have misunderstood my argument, which it is important to get right. I did not argue in favour of positive-discrimination proposals: the generally agreed terminology nowadays is positive-action proposals. There is an important difference between them. Like the Minister, I take the view that the end product should be equality, not particular advantage. I also share his view that we must preserve a sense of equity and fairness in the wider community. Nothing could be less helpful to good race relations than the perception by the majority white community that others have advantages that they do not. The status, perception and self-esteem of members of ethnic minorities is also important: they wish to be where they are for what they are-on their own merits.

<P>
The Minister gave a reasoned reply. I am aware that section 35 provides some cover. It is limited in some respects, but it does cover the ground. I am happy to do what the Minister's colleague, Lord Bassam, did a few weeks ago in another place-to reflect further, take advice from outside and establish whether we agree with the Minister on further consideration. Under Government amendment No. 5, we are adequately protected. If further issues come to light, I shall not spring them on the Government on Report, but raise them earlier for exploration. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 2, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) Any damages awarded in proceedings brought by virtue of this section in respect of an act of discrimination shall be of a level which, in the opinion of the court, would not significantly affect the effective operation of the public authority in question.

<P>
(10) The court shall give all parties in proceedings brought by virtue of this section the opportunity to make representations as to the level of damages appropriate by virtue of the provisions of subsection 9, and shall have regard to any representations made.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment concerns compensation. It would restrict the risk, which we discussed earlier, that actions brought under proposed new section 19B could encourage a compensation culture. The amendment has two limbs. The first would ensure that any damages awarded in proceedings on discrimination brought under the section were of a level that would not significantly affect the effective operation of the public authority, in the court's opinion. The second would require the court to give everybody involved in proceedings under the section the opportunity to make representations about the appropriate level of damages.

<P>
I have in mind my memories of some recent successful compensation cases brought against public authorities. Many were controversial, and attracted wide publicity. I suppose the issue that grabbed headlines most was that of the women who successfully sued the Ministry of Defence for sexual discrimination because they had been required to resign from the armed forces after becoming pregnant. No matter whether one took the view that that was a sensible policy for the MOD to pursue at that time, there was considerable public disquiet about the size of the compensation awards against the Ministry.

<P>
When we debate public authorities as defined in the Bill, we will talk not only about Departments with access to the apparently limitless resources of the taxpayer, but about much smaller organisations in the public sector. Every year, many of them have to survive on limited budgets that are under considerable strain.

<P>
For example, the Minister will know that police forces are under strain. I will not start a knockabout session on who to blame for inadequate police funding, but any chief constable, regardless of his political sympathies, will say that his resources are fully committed, whether he receives less or more money than before. The pressure from pension obligations, employees' salaries and purchasing new equipment means that he has no spare cash in his budget.

<P>
A report published the other week shows that health trusts and authorities are already alarmed at the amount of money that they must hold in reserve from their yearly expenditure plans, to meet possible successful compensation claims. The Bill, however limited in form, could widen the scope for successful claims for compensation from the national health service.

<P>
Another example would be at the very local level of a school governing body. These are people who are not even full-time employees. Governors are volunteers-parents and teachers giving up their spare time to sit on the governing body. The head teacher may be a governor but has more than enough on her hands as well as attending governing body meetings, and there is a very limited budget.

<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
A school governing body of, say, a primary school, faced with a determined action for discrimination and advised by its lawyers of the risk of a very burdensome award for compensation as well as any legal costs incurred, might be inclined to throw in the towel, however well-founded its members believed their case to be and however much support they might have from the majority of the parents of the children attending the school.

<P>
There is a strong case for Parliament to require laws to prohibit discrimination. Provision should be made to enable people who have suffered loss because of discrimination to secure redress, but an award of compensation should take account of the resources available to the organisation against which that award has been made. I believe that the court, which will have examined all the evidence in a particular case, will know the facts and the gravity of the act of discrimination, if proved, and under the amendment would know the detail of the resources available to the various parties, is in the best position to take a decision about the appropriate level of compensation. To bind the court as the amendment suggests, so that it must have regard to the effective operation of the public authority, strikes the right balance between the need to make sure that there is proper redress for acts of discrimination on the one hand, and the continued effective operation of public sector organisations on the other.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments. He has consistently made the point that he does not want a compensation culture to develop, and from the tenor of his remarks-the Government agree with him-he wants legislation that is not unnecessarily burdensome and will work. I want to try to persuade him that the amendments are not necessary.

<P>
First, I remind him that the county courts at present have no limit on compensation claims and settlements, and I take the view that to move away from that position would be a retrograde step.

<P>
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the amendments apply only to public bodies. It would be strange to have a set of rules in the county court that applied to public but not to private sector bodies. That is a fundamental objection to the amendment because the Bill is about equity, and there should be equity between the public and private sectors.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also talked about the size of compensation claims. His concerns are legitimate, but claims made in the past, although substantial, have generally been at a level that public bodies should be able to bear. I am told that the current level of awards in non-employment cases in county courts is on average 1,000. Pre-legislative settlements by CRE officials have reached approximately 6,000. I contrast those figures with those that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in relation to sexual discrimination cases in the armed forces. There is a distinct difference in the size of the sums.

<P>
The second limb of the amendment would ask the county court to make a judgment based on the resources of the public body to settle a claim. It is unnecessary, because the county court already has the power to do that. It would be legitimate for a responding body to make its resource position clear in the course of litigation. Clearly, the county court would take that into account when making a settlement. Although I understand the purpose of the amendment and I do not object to the spirit of what is being pursued, I think that it is unnecessary. As a result of that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman has been persuaded to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response and for his assurance-like that of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)-that the Government's intention is that any awards of compensation under the Bill should be reasonable. The Minister made a fair point in saying that the amendment would risk introducing an unfair distinction between public and private sector organisations, although of course the amendment was drafted with clause 1 in mind, and the Bill applies specifically to the private sector and not more generally. I may reflect on whether an amendment that ranged more widely would fall within the scope of the Bill. However, for the purposes of this debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, leave out lines 22 to 25 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`19C.-(1) Nothing in section 19B shall render unlawful any act done by a relevant person in carrying out immigration and nationality functions in affording persons of a particular nationality, religion, or ethnic or national origin special treatment on humanitarian grounds.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment deals with the interesting and perhaps difficult issue of the application of this legislation to the work of the Home Office and the immigration service, particularly as regards our immigration practice. I apologise to you, Mr. Sayeed, and to the Committee, for the fact that, uniquely this afternoon, my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) has been given the afternoon off, so contributions from our corner of the Committee will have to be made by me. The consolation is that my hon. Friend will be back for the rest of the sittings and we will share the burden.

<P>
Amendment No. 3 stands alone. The next group of amendments relate to very much the same issue, and it will not be necessary to go round the course twice during the two debates. The amendment relates to a problem that was put to me in a letter from the organisation Asylum Aid, which may have written to other hon. Members. I will read a section of the letter, because it puts the case clearly. It welcomes the Bill and the extension of the application of the Race Relations Act to the police and other public authorities. It also welcomes the extension of indirect discrimination, and is positive about the work that the Government have done so far. It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are extremely concerned that the Bill includes a provision (clause 19C) which allows Ministers, immigration, asylum and nationality officials to discriminate on the grounds of nationality, ethnic or national origin. Such a wide and unchecked power to discriminate in immigration and nationality will undermine the important principle of racial equality which the Bill intends to enshrine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Home Office and Immigration Service have often been accused of racism in their practice. They are subject to no independent scrutiny, have no formal complaints system and, in addition, the new Immigration and Asylum Act-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which became law at the end of last year-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will give immigration officers wide new powers. We see no justification for them not to be covered by the new rules to prohibit discrimination. We are concerned also that the right of appeal which the Bill introduces for asylum-seekers against discriminatory treatment will be meaningless if such racial discrimination is not to be unlawful.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By that, it means the right introduced by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We strongly believe that it is in the best interests of the Immigration Service and the Home Office, like the police and other public bodies, to be seen to apply high standards of non-discrimination to their work.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We would therefore like to ask you to support the recommendations made by the Commission for Racial Equality on this Bill, and in particular, to urge the Government to amend clause 19C which exempts immigration, nationality and asylum officials from the new anti-discrimination measures.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am happy to follow the noble Lords by testing the Government and trying to move them in that direction.

<P>
My second introductory remark refers back to the comments of Lord Lester in the debate on the issue in the other place. They were made after an amendment in similar terms had been moved by Lord Lester, who argued that he was concerned about the breadth of the immigration exception that is still in the Bill. After the Minister had restated the case for differentiation between individuals on the basis of ethnic or national origins, Lord Lester said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Minister is saying that because people look Chinese we must reserve the right to single them out for special treatment on the basis of their appearance-their ethnic characteristics-and the fact that they are not white. We could not do that with anyone who was white because there are no distinguishing ethnic characteristics of that kind. If that is what is being said, does not the Minister realise that that is quite different from singling out people on the basis of their country of origin or their nationality: it goes to the root of what they are and cannot help being because of their ethnicity, their colour or race. Does the Minister recognise that?-[Official Report, House of Lords, 27 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1695.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to ask whether that was a correct understanding of the Minister's position.

<P>
Lastly, a comment from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants alluded to the same point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We know the system needs to distinguish by nationality. Only commonwealth citizens can have the right of abode; those who have the nationality of an EEA state are free from controls of the European law; visas are required for some nationalities and not others  Lord Lester pointed out that the clause was unnecessary, since there is already a power in the Act to make exemptions based on nationality or residence. It is also unfair because it goes further, allowing immigration staff to discriminate on the grounds of ethnic or racial origins. The only purpose of this extra get-out is to give policy-makers a free hand in drawing up the instructions under which officers work. The published rules will continue to be framed in a neutral way which appears to apply equally to everyone. Officers, though, do not work to the rules. They go by the much more detailed instructions, some of which are available, some withheld. Already the rules contain a rule that officers ``carry out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of persons seking to enter or remain'', but there must be very few people, who believe this has any effect on the variations that occur between entry clearance posts in different parts of the world, or your chances of being stopped at a UK airport depending on your nationality or your colour. If this Bill is to make a serious inroad into the culture of disbelief and cynicism in which the operation of immigration controls is steeped it must go further. We need to see lasting and irreversible change in the immigration system (a bastion of ``institutionalised racism'' if ever there was one), and that is not likely if this Bill makes it a special case, the one area of government policy where discrimination is encouraged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am happy for this debate to cover amendment No. 3 and the next group of amendments, which should help the Chairman.

<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred with approval to the suggestion that the immigration and nationality directorate was a bastion of institutionalised racism. The Home Office is addressing issues of institutional racism, but is the hon. Gentleman aware that 23 per cent. of IND employees are either black or Asian?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was going to deal with that later, but I shall do so immediately. No, I did not have the 23 per cent. figure in my head, but I am aware from my contact with the immigration and nationality directorate over the years that it has many black and Asian staff. I do not necessarily associate myself with JCWI's comment about IND. Unprompted by the Minister, I was going to say that I have had some good experiences of IND. My office deals with the directorate probably every working day of every week of every year. A huge bulk-probably 30 or 40 per cent.-of my constituency work relates to immigration and nationality. It certainly takes up that proportion of my time, because cases are often complex. About 25 per cent. of the electorate-or the resident community-in my constituency is from ethnic minority communities. There may be more who are not on the electoral register-asylum seekers, for example.

<P>
I therefore put clearly on record that the immigration and nationality directorate has done some extremely good work. Having said that, the JCWI quote makes it clear that there is a legitimate cause for concern, which needs to be monitored. The Government are putting the issue on the table bacause they are making provision for IND work to be excluded from the Bill.

<P>
I wish to focus on the key argument emerging from the refinement of the Bill during various stages in the other place. The experience that I and my constituents have had of immigration officials and other IND people-and it applies equally to FCO people working in posts abroad-has been good, but there are exceptions. Occasionally, I have had to complain: sometimes my complaints about treatment of individuals have been upheld and individual IND staff have been disciplined accordingly. Inevitably, experience goes in both directions.

<P>
In the other place, the debate moved on from the initial suggestion that we should accept the wider form of amendment. Work was done between the parties in seeking to redefine the amendment . Amendment No. 3 adopts a form of words that were first tried out at the end of the Lord's debate.

<P>
I shall deal briefly with the technical nature and consequences of the amendments. Amendment No. 3 would remove the provision that exempts from section 19B-which imposes a general duty on public authorities not to discriminate and is now extended to indirect discrimination as a result of earlier amendment this morning-certain acts in immigration and nationality cases. It would replace that provision with:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nothing in section 19B shall render unlawful any act done by a person in carrying out immigration and nationality functions in affording persons of a particular nationality, religion, or ethnic or national origin special treatment on humanitarian ground.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To employ a topical example, the minority Kosovan community could be granted exceptional leave to remain on the basis of their vulnerability as perceived by the British Government. In that case, their particular treatment would be justified on humanitarian grounds.

<P>
Amendment No. 17 would amend part of the newly proposed section 19C and defines how someone's immigration and nationality status is determined. Amendment No. 19 is a variant, which simply removes the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or ethnic or national origins.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would not be unlawful to discriminate on grounds of nationality, but it would be unlawful to discriminate on grounds of ethnic or national origins.

<P>
Amendment No. 4 brings into play the suggestion that the end of the clause should refer specifically to the immigration rules. Whichever definition of lawful is adopted, it would have to be lawful by virtue of being compliant with the immigration rules current at a particular time. Finally, amendment No. 18 would remove lines 40 to 42, which cross-refer ``immigration and nationality functions'' to subsection (5), producing another list. That subsection refers to Immigration Acts, British Nationality Acts and specific Acts dealing with the Falkland Islands, Hong Kong, immigration appeals commissions and European Community law-a menu.

<P>
I hope that the amendments will provide the Minister with an appropriate opportunity to respond to all the different propositions made in the other place and subsequently. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury will be aware, Lord Cope expressed similar concerns and moved amendments on behalf of the Conservative party in another place. His amendment was intended to allow discrimination on the basis of nationality, but not ethnic origin. We could usefully put pressure on the Government-if they still need it-to ensure that the perfectly proper actions of immigration officials are limited by proper criteria for discrimination. We are all feeling our way towards that.

<P>
I have one other substantive point. We must be mindful of and reflect on the international obligations behind these issues. The Government's intention is to allow discrimination on the grounds of nationality or ethnic or national origin only when a ministerial decision or primary and secondary immigration legislation make that necessary. However, the view put by Justice, which the Government have seen, is that the provisions are unnecessarily wide and would allow officials to act in accordance with immigration rules, even if those did not require discrimination on the grounds, for example, of ethnic origin.

<P>
The provisions also give Ministers unchecked discretion to discriminate on the grounds of ethnic or national origin. That comes back to the point made by the JCWI about limited jurisdiction, although I would not have chosen the same words as the JCWI. There is a huge area of ministerial discretion as regards decisions about people who come into the country. Ministers often use their discretion to go beyond the rules. That is not a criticism of those arrangements, but it is much more difficult successfully to review such decisions. I do not know the figures, but the number of people who succeed in judicial review applications against the Government is relatively small. I might add in parenthesis that bad immigration advisers frequently get people to pay up front for endless judicial reviews of decisions. that is very costly and individuals often cannot afford it. To that extent, I echo the strident comments that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) made yesterday. He had clearly decided that nailing abusive immigration practices in Manchester was part of his agenda for the week.

<P>
Justice makes another serious criticism, which I hope Ministers take seriously and will respond to fully. The breadth of Ministers' discretion will lead to breaches of the European convention, despite the declaration on the front of the Bill that Ministers believe it to be compatible with the convention. There could also be breaches of other declarations. Justice suggests that decisions on immigration and asylum that are made on the basis of national or ethnic origin might conflict with the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In any event, it is not necessary to protect victims of racially motivated violence who seek asylum. The distinction between their cases and those of others is not their national or ethnic origin, but the presence of a well founded fear of prosecution.

<P>
This is an unnecessarily broad exception, which will not assist in meeting the concerns of international human rights bodies  in relation to immigration law practice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Like others, Justice recommends that the provisions be modified to exclude reference to national or ethnic origin and that tighter controls be imposed on the ministerial exercise of discretion.

<P>
The Minister has a range of options on which to respond, but the sensible way to proceed might be for us to hear the considered position that the Government have reached following the tours of the horizon in the House of Lords. I am happy not to press the amendment today. I will take away responses from the Minister and other colleagues, including those of the hon. Member for Aylesbury, if he contributes, because I want us to ensure that if the proposals are changed, the change will be the right one, and will comply with our European and international obligations. I hope that colleagues on the Committee understand the importance of the issue and why I have had to take some of the Committee's time.

<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
One last relevant general point is that one of the controversial proposals that the Government have floated as an idea and justified recently is that there might be a requirement for bonds to be obtained from people coming to this country, to ensure that they return-in other words, as a token of their good faith. Colleagues in other parties and people who are not involved with politics resent that. Someone who is not involved in politics and is not my constituent, although he lives in London, came to see me yesterday about professional matters. He is a United Kingdom-born white Briton married to an Indian-born Asian. His extended family-in-law resent the characterisation of a particular nationality group in terms of the ability to come here and visit.

<P>
One matter that causes me great concern-the Government are alert to this and trying to be helpful, and the primary purpose rule change was helpful in this context-is that it is not justifiable and cannot be seen to be so, to make a presumption about a particular type of person on the basis of what they look like and what their background might be, and treat them differently. One long-standing complaint about the immigration service-or the perceived problem that it has-is that a white American person or white Commonwealth citizen coming into the country is far less likely to be stopped and checked than a black or Asian person. Things are changing and are not as bad as they were-and, of course, it is not as simple as that-but I merely flag up the fact that there is still a feeling generally that certain immigration and nationality cases are dealt with unfairly.

<P>
I know from recurrent complaints that I receive how many people who apply to come here for a holiday rather than to settle, have never been here before, have no record, personally or as a family, of non-compliance, have every logical likelihood of wanting to return home because nine-tenths of their family is in the country in which they live, and have come here simply to see a new born grandchild or whoever, but are turned down and have to spend a great deal of money that they can ill afford to exercise a right that we would take for granted-visiting a relative for a birth, christening, wedding or funeral or other family event away from home. We tabled our amendments because that sort of historic imbalance of advantages for some people in immigration and nationality legislation, and disadvantages for others needs to be corrected. The amendments appear to have significant support outside the House. I hope that the Minister can be sympathetic to amendment No. 3 or some of the others, or that he will table a variation of his own.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Sayeed. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey ranged fairly wide. Can you guide us on whether you intend to allow a debate that would cover not only amendment No. 3 but the group led by amendment No. 17 and perhaps Government amendment No. 27, which clearly has a bearing on the subject which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey addressed?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was about to say that, with the Committee's agreement, we will also consider the following amendments:

<P>
No. 17 in page 2, line 24, leave out from ``nationality'' to the end of line 25 and insert ``in determining a person's immigration or nationality status under any of the enactments mentioned in subsection (5) or any instrument made under or by virtue of any of those enactments.''.

<P>
No. 19, in page 2, line 24, leave out ``or ethnic or national origins''.

<P>
No. 4, in page 2, line 25, after ``functions'', insert ``in accordance with the Immigration Rules.''.

<P>
No. 18, in page 2, leave out lines 40 to 42.

<P>
I should add that we are not considering Government amendment No. 27.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised important issues. I was glad that he dissociated himself from the criticisms made by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants of the immigration and nationality directorate. In my constituency dealings with the directorate, which I readily admit have not been as frequent or intense as his, although they are more frequent than many of my hon. Friend's tend to assume, I found the directorate courteous and fair in its handling of cases. But, like the hon. Gentleman, I have dealt with a constituency case that I felt had not been handled justly and, more occasionally, I have dealt with a constituent whose case I felt was not handled as it would have been had the constituent been white.

<P>
I recall one case of a gentleman who came to see me on behalf of his sister, who wanted to visit him from India. Her application had been refused more than once. One reason cited on the notice of refusal was that my constituent and his brothers, had, lawfully and in accordance with the rules of the various relevant countries, emigrated from India to settle in the United Kingdom or Canada respectively. The entry clearance officer had noted on the notice of refusal that there had been a pattern of migration in the lady's family which he felt could not guarantee that she would return to India. I am pleased to say that after much to-ing and fro-ing, the authorities were persuaded to change their mind and the case was resolved successfully. The lady made her visit and returned home, to the satisfaction of my constituent and his family, but that case sticks in my mind because it best illustrates the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.

<P>
However, against that, I recognise that we ask the immigration service and entry clearance officers to do a job which Parliament, on behalf of society, regards as essential and which entails difficult judgments. There is a debate to be had about whether immigration law should be more restrictive or more generous. There seems to be no point at all in having immigration rules that are not enforced.

<P>
We need the immigration service and the IND to carry out their job and enforce the rules on behalf of us all. In their everyday work they have to cope with the reality of fraud, subterfuge, faked documents and organised attempts to circumvent immigration rules. Anyone who has discussed with immigration officers at Heathrow or other ports of entry, the problems that they encounter every day, as I have, will know how true that statement is. Therefore, we have to be careful not to change the law in such a way as to tie the hands of those people whom we in Parliament ask to implement immigration law on our behalf.

<P>
Although the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was correct in pointing out that Lord Cope expressed a number of concerns in the other place similar to those expressed by Lord Lester, I think it only fair to say that Lord Cope was considerably reassured by the statement from Lord Bassam. In his letter to Lord Lester, Lord Bassam described the reasons why the Home Office resisted the idea that the power of immigration officers to take account of questions of ethnicity, rather than just nationality, should be left in the legislation. The hon. Gentleman's amendment suggests that it be removed.

<P>
The example that Lord Bassam gave is a real, practical one. He stated that the immigration service had experience of rackets whereby Chinese nationals would appear at ports of entry with false documents that misrepresented them as Malaysian or Singaporean nationals of Chinese ethnic origin. While that had not proved a particularly large problem at the time that the Minister was writing, it had the potential to become so. This would perhaps be through the exploitation of migration by organised crime. The Minister stated that if that problem were to grow significantly, then it would be necessary for the immigration service to look with particular care at documents presented by Singaporean and Malaysian nationals who were visibly of Chinese origin. It would not help in the job of implementing and enforcing our law to carry out checks on everyone coming from Singapore or Malaysia. That would be a waste of effort. The Minister also said that he did not think the service had the resources to do so, and it would seem to be an unnecessary and wasteful restriction on the freedom of the immigration service to try to impose such a requirement on it.

<P>
I am driven to the conclusion, therefore, that the Government's wish to keep the right of the immigration service to have regard to ethnicity as well as to nationality is sensible. To remove it from the Bill would harm the effectiveness of the immigration service in a small but none the less material way.

<P>
I will listen with care to the Minister's comments in response to the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and, like the hon. Gentleman, I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of this debate to say a few words about where the Government's scheme for bonds and recognisances for visitors now stands. The Government made an announcement some months ago that they were minded to pilot the bonds scheme in one or more countries of the Indian subcontinent.

<P>
More recently, in response to an Adjournment debate initiated by the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) the Government announced they had changed their mind. When I have tabled questions about this, however, Ministers have been unable or unwilling to give me any indication of which countries, if any, they are now looking to as the subject of this experiment. It is interesting for us to consider whether a bond scheme of the sort that Ministers appear to have in mind last year will be compatible with the Bill once it becomes law.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has expressed some perfectly reasonable concerns about the operation of the Bill, but my inclination is to prefer the line that the Government has so far adopted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendments raise some serious and complex issues. Perhaps Committee members will forgive me if I spend some time dealing with them. They will be aware from the official record of the debates that took place earlier this year in another place on this part of the Bill that an identical amendment to amendment No. 3 was tabled by Lord Lester. The Government's view remains essentially unchanged, although we have carefully considered looking at additional safeguards in relation to the operation of the exemption in immigration and nationality functions. We will come to those in Government amendment No. 27.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
While we sympathise with the objective of ensuring that the Bill does not outlaw special treatment for those who need protection on humanitarian grounds, as in the recent special exercise in relation to refugees from Kosovo and Albania, we do not believe that the amendment would provide adequate protection for the immigration system as a whole and for maintaining our firm immigration controls.

<P>
The operation of immigration policy necessarily and legitimately involves differential treatment for individuals based on their nationality and on occasion their ethnic or national origins. In our view, the existing exemption for immigration and nationality functions in clause 1 strikes the right balance between providing victims of unlawful discrimination with an effective right of action and protecting the necessary, proper, legitimate and discriminatory exercise of immigration functions. That is perhaps required by the legislation, by regulation. Discrimination can be authorised by Ministers, including when it is necessary for humanitarian purposes.

<P>
The pressures on the immigration system have already been alluded to by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. The Committee will be aware that we cannot allow any ambiguity to arise in the application of legislation by immigration staff. We know, from experience, that those with an unfounded claim who are seeking to delay or frustrate the process frequently use the immigration and asylum system, including the appeal system. That is why we took firm action in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to streamline the process to produce a fairer, firmer and faster system. This Bill must make crystal clear what is unlawful and what is permissible in the public interest. We believe that the existing formulation in clause 1-new section 19C in other words-does this. Activity that is authorised and required by law or by Ministers will be lawful, as will personal decisions taken by Ministers in the public interest. Unauthorised acts of direct racial discrimination will be unlawful and open to challenge in the courts.

<P>
Let me deal with the point about Ministers having unfettered and unchecked discretion. Of course what the Ministers decide is always subject to parliamentary review and to the courts. Ministers are answerable to Parliament; they can be summoned before Select Committees and are always answerable for any decision that they take. Likewise, Ministers may well be the subject of a challenge in the courts and, in the area of immigration and asylum law, very often are the subject of a challenge. I dare say that, in the two years that I have had the burden of being the immigration Minister, I must have been the most judicially reviewed Minister in history.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> It goes with the job.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brian:</B> It certainly does. I think that must be true. Ministers have found that their decisions are often subject to judicial review. The courts might well have to look at any Wednesbury unreasonable decision reached by a Minister, and would then need to check the Minister.

<P>
There are provisions that allow Ministers to be checked, and likewise, regardless of whether our courts could check for a breach of the European convention on human rights, Ministers and the Government could always be challenged in the European courts at Strasbourg. Those courts would not be constrained by our domestic legislation. If a provision in our legislation contravened the ECHR, it would no doubt be drawn to our attention quickly, although it can take a while to get to Strasbourg, we are certainly conscious of the need to comply with the convention, particularly in view of the Human Rights Act. I draw hon. Members' attention to our derogation from the convention in respect of immigration matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Just so that the number of applications for judicial review relating to immigration matters is on the record, will the Minister write to us with the figures for the past five years-or would he rather that I tabled a question to his successor, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs Roche) so that the answers came from her?

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I cannot give figures off the top of my head, but there are a number of lawyers who judicially review almost as a matter of course in immigration cases. The figures certainly run to many hundreds, and probably well into the thousands. It would probably be helpful if the hon. Gentleman tabled a parliamentary question, so that my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, who has taken over responsibility for such areas, could reply.

<P>
Failure to provide clarity in legislation such as this Bill is therefore unwise because it is so readily open to challenge. Staff should be fully protected when they carry out the duties that Parliament and Ministers require of them. The Government do not believe that the legal safeguards under the Race Relations Act 1976 are adequate for such purpose, and that view is supported by case law.

<P>
Section 41 of the 1976 Act protects discriminatory acts that are carried out ``in pursuance to'' statutory provisions or ministerial arrangements, but the courts have adopted a narrow interpretation of ``in pursuance to''. For acts to benefit from section 41, they must be required by law, but the operation of the immigration system necessarily requires the exercise of discretion by Ministers and appropriately authorised officials. That discretion often is to the benefit of applicants, but often it is not. For example, the immigration service and the integrated casework directorate need the ability to carry out special nationality-specific exercises involving the fast-tracking of cases and even the use of detention in response to sudden or sustained influxes of certain nationals, most recently from some parts of eastern Europe, who are seeking to circumvent the control.

<P>
The immigration service at ports requires the ability to target and prioritise certain nationalities for particular scrutiny where it has intelligence that national travel documents are being abused, or that individuals or groups of one nationality are presenting themselves as the nationals of another country in order to benefit from the compassionate policies or asylum procedures that attach to a nationality or group of people for humanitarian purposes. Let me give some examples.

<P>
We are all aware that some people sought to take advantage of the Kosovan situation. Hon. Members may not be aware that there was evidence about 18 months ago that certain Italian identity documents had fallen into the possession of other nationalities. There was therefore a need to focus on Italian identity documents to identify whether the people who carried them were authorised to do so.

<P>
During the course of the debate in the other place, reference was made to the number of recent cases where Chinese nationals were misrepresenting themselves as Singaporean or Malaysian nationals of Chinese ethnic origin in order to evade the controls. Were that problem to increase, the immigration service would need to interview Singaporean or Malaysian passengers of Chinese ethnic origin, but clearly it would not wish to interview nationals of those countries of non-Chinese ethnic origin.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North Bermondsey correctly quoted Lord Lester's comments. My noble Friend Lord Bassam of Brighton replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My Lords, I am trying to explain to the House that, yes, there will be some circumstances where, on the basis of careful intelligence and a risk assessment, we have to make that judgment based on what is perceived as an individual's ethnicity.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 27 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1695.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point was clearly dealt with by my noble Friend: Such action is necessary on occasion.

<P>
The Committee will also be aware of the activities of immigration racketeers who present a real threat to our immigration controls. During 1999, the immigration service detected more than 5,000 attempts to enter the United Kingdom using forged or counterfeit travel documents or by persons impersonating a third party and presenting a passport to which they were not entitled. It is essential that, where there is intelligence, the immigration service retains the ability to deal with those activities effectively by targeting peoople whom it believes might be involved.

<P>
Entry clearance officers also need the ability to treat individuals differently on various grounds. Examples include if their country in associated with state-sponsored terrorism, has a track record of hostile intelligence activities, or is known to have lax or inappropriate passports issuing arrangements. Such activity is a necessary part of operating the immigration system, but may not be considered by the courts as strictly required by law. There are also examples where the immigration system discriminates positively in favour of individuals on the basis of their nationality or ethnic national origins.

<P>
<B>Mr. Piara S. Khabra </B>(Ealing, Southall): Proposed section 19C is a rehashing of section 41 of the Race Relations Act 1976. Can my hon. Friend assure me that amendment No. 27 will remedy the situation for immigration matters?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 27 is not under debate at the moment.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can tell my hon. Friend that we are attempting to ensure that we have a broad-based ability to deliver an immigration system that is fair and firm. Overall, the balance that will be struck in the Bill will meet the requiremnts of both firmness and fairness. We also want to ensure that, where appropriate, race relations legislation should apply to those who make decisions on immigration matters, although there is a broad area of concern in which the immigration system requires the ability to discriminate. As I am about to excplain, the obvious example is the Kosovan Serbs.

<P>
It was necessary to discriminate in favour of the Kosovan Albanians. There were also issues relating to the Kosovan Serbs that meant that they should not be treated in the same way. The positive attitude towards Kosovan Albanians might not be taken towards Kosovan Serbs entering the country. Other examples of guidance for asylum and immigration caseworkers direct that ethnic or national groups from the same country should be treated differently from one another. The applicant's ethnic or national origin is a key consideration in determining applications for asylum and exceptional leave, and it would be impsossible to operate a rational asylum or immigration determination process if caseworkers could not make distinctions based on people's backgrounds.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In practice, we are required to operate country-specific policies that treat all applications alike without considering the individual circumstances of a person who falls within the relevant ethnic or national group from the country. The immigration staff who work on this uniquely sensitive issue need clear guidance to help them to ensure that they respect the rights of others. The exemptions for immigration and nationality functions will give Ministers a framework within which to provide that guidance. Subject to operational necessity, those directions will be published for Parliament and the public to examine, in line with the Government's commitment to openness.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North Bermondsey referred to the guidance given to immigration officers. If I remember rightly, it was in response to a request from my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I decided to publish those directions. Apart from a few exceptional items that were deleted because they might assist criminals, that information is now in the public arena and available on the internet, so it can be accessed by those with an interest in the guidance given to people who control entry and exit from this country.

<P>
The issue is sensitive, and wide discretion is important. However, that must be checked, and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has properly tested the extent of the exemptions. Immigration procedures and practices will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that instructions from Ministers are clear and cover only necessary and justifiable discriminatory activity. Any unjustifiable discriminatory activity will be eliminated, because our objective is to have a system that is fair as well as firm.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 17, 19, 4 and 18 are complex, and they overlap in some respects. I will deal with amendments Nos. 17 and 19 together, because they overlap most. Amendment No. 17 would restrict the exemption for immigration and nationality functions in two significant respects. In common with amendment No. 19, it would remove the immigration system's ability to differentiate between individuals because of their ethnic or national origin. It would also require the system to base distinctions only on nationaity when determining an individual's immigration or nationality status.

<P>
Although the Government have carefully considered accepting the amendments, and we understand the wish of hon. Members to ensure that the immigration exemption is no wider than absolutely necessary, we believe that the amendments would not provide adequate legal protection for the immigration system. If the amendments were made, immigration staff who carried out their duties in accordance with immigration legislation and instructions approved by Ministers could face successful legal challenges from those wishing to frustrate our immigration laws. That would be unacceptable. As hon. Members are aware, the Government believe that the existing legal safeguards for actions taken in pursuance of statutory authority, contained in section 41 of the Race Relations Act, are insufficient. That is why we are making specific provision for the immigration system in new section 19C.

<P>
We take the view that, without the benefit of the exemption in new section 19C, Ministers would be unable to authorise special humanitarian treatment or deal with some of the issues that face immigration officers on all too many occasions. Nevertheless, we have listened to the concerns expressed in another place and today, and we will table an amendment to introduce some independent statutory oversight of the operation of the immigration system. The system requires the ability to make distinctions between individuals, but we should have some oversight of the way in which that is done. I hope that that is viewed as a helpful way to proceed.

<P>
Contrary to the suggestion by Asylum Aid, we have an effective complaints system, which is overseen by a complaints audit committee. There are very few substantiated complaints of discrimination each year. Many people are dissatisfied with the decisions that are reached, but that is different from saying that their cases were caused by unlawful or unjustifiable racial discrimination.

<P>
Amendment No.4 is similar to that tabled by Lord Lester in another place earlier this year. It would qualify the current proposed exemption for immigration and nationality functions by requiring all discriminatory activity to be in accordance with immigration rules. It reflects concern about the scope of the immigration exemption in clause 1. We need an approach that allows Ministers quickly to take account of circumstances and to make a decision about the excercise of discretion almost over night, particularly for humanitarian reasons or because a criminal attempt has been made to breach immigration controls. We might need quickly to assist people who come here, and we might not have time to change the immigration rules to do that. Equally, we might need to prevent people who seek to breach our immigration rules from doing so. To restrict the ability to make those decisions to the immigration rules, which would need to be subject to parliamentary approval and the normal procedures, would be completely unworkable in the practical circumstances faced by immigration staff. That could send the wrong message in humanitarian terms if there was a need to act urgently.

<P>
Amendment No. 18 would remove subsection (4) from new section 19C. For the purposes that new section, subsection (4) defines immigration and nationality functions as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>functions exercisable by virtue of any of the enactments mentioned in subsection (5).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would harm the clarity of new section 19C. We need to ensure that we have that clarity, and I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will not press the amendment.

<P>
Concern was expressed about the fact that immigration staff might act in a racist way. The immigration service would certainly reject any suggestion that it operated a culture of disbelief or rejection. The fact is that the immigration system is always controversial. Difficult decisions, which call for judgment, have to be reached. Often, those about whom decisions are made and their relatives are unhappy about the outcome, but that does not mean that the decisions have been improperly made, but there is always a need to make decisions in a careful and considered way. We want to ensure that all such decisions are properly arrived at and justifiable. However, immigration rule 2 requires all immigration officers to have proper regard to the race of passengers and applicants when carrying out their duties. Officers are, therefore, constrained by requirements, rules and the direction of Ministers to act in a proper way.

<P>
I shall deal now with the point about bonds and the small number of people for whom a ``minded to refuse'' decision is made. In such a case, the immigration officer would be unlikely to grant a visa, but the decision would be marginal-the officer thinks that the person will probably comply, but there are so many doubts that he cannot grant the visa. In those circumstances, as an added option for exercising discretion in the applicant's favour, a bond could be requested. The person would have no obligation to provide one, but would be aware that he would be unlikely to get a visa otherwise. I should make it clear that no one who would get a visa today would have to pay a bond. Some disinformation has been floated to the effect that the bond provision would apply to people who would get visas today. That is not the case. The aim is simply to provide bonds in a small number of marginal cases in which the entry clearance officer makes a careful judgment that he is not satisfied that the person is likely to return. We should remember that the person is required to show that he will comply with our immigration rules. If there is an element of doubt and the entry clearance officer would otherwise refuse the visa, he could then say, ``This is a marginal case and I might be prepared to consider a bond.''

<P>
The proposal for a pilot on bonds was very much at the request of members of the Asian community who spoke not only to me in my surgeries, but to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and many other hon. Members. When the proposal went through the House, it got a broad welcome. However, due to a campaign of misinformation subsequently, some members of the Asian community became concerned that it would have wider and more general applicability. It was never our intention that the proposal should apply to people who would get visas today. To end the campaign of misinformation and deal with concerns, we therefore decided to say that we were not disposed to apply the pilot to the Indian subcontinent. We are considering several options for piloting it elsewhere, although I cannot tell the hon. Member for Aylesbury where that is likely to be. Several suggestions have been made, but I am not sure where my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office has got to in terms of decisions, because I am not directly involved. Perhaps I will refer the hon. Gentleman's question to her, and she will, I hope, write to him in due course to tell him where she has got to on the issue.

<P>
I should emphasise that the approach behind the bond is to assist people who are trying to visit their grandchildren or attend a funeral, not to put an extra encumbrance in front of them. That was certainly not the case. The whole concept of the bond scheme is that it will not be discriminatory; it will not aim to target particular nationals or ethnic groups. The proposals for a bond scheme were a positive development, in that they will facilitate more people coming to this country by providing an opportunity for an applicant to visit family members in the United Kingdom to demonstrate their true intention to entry clearance officers. The proposals will not amount to additional requirements that need to be met for entry clearance to be granted. In all cases, the requirements of the immigration rules as they relate to visitors will apply equally and will have to be met for entry clearance to be granted.

As I said, we are considering where to pilot the scheme. Only after we have assessed the outcome of any pilot will we consider whether there should be any expansion of the scheme. I do not anticipate that in the next year. The pilot scheme might have begun by then, but any expansion in that time is unlikely.

<P>
I trust that I have not tested the Committee's patience too much. This has been a complex and important set of amendments. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will consider what I have said. If he still wishes to deal with the matters that we have discussed, he will no doubt have an opportunity later to table further amendments. Obviously, I hope that we can maintain an immigration system that is both firm and fair.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I thank the Minister for his extended reply. That is not a criticism; we have discussed various amendments, and I think that it was sensible to put our cards on the table at this stage. I also thank him for the information that he has given, in so far as he was able, to the hon. Member for Aylesbury and myself about the bond scheme. We appreciate that we must address concerns about such matters specifically to the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, but that information was helpful.

<P>
In a moment, I will withdraw the amendment, and deliberate elsewhere on a considered response to what the Minister has said. I will test him on one matter, although I do not mean to go over ground that we have already covered. A good example was given of obvious discrimination that could give rise to concern, which provided a contrast to the example that the Minister used and to which I referred. The example was an occasion when the Government had reason to believe that people of Chinese origin might be participating in illegal activity with regard to entry. Therefore, it was not only people from China, but people of Chinese origin from Singapore, Malaysia and other places, who were understandably the subject of immigration officials' attention at a particular time on the basis of information received.

<P>
In the House of Lords, a parallel example was given of a white Russian coming to this country, whom immigration officials would not be able to distinguish from any other white entrant from elsewhere in Europe. If the Government hold their current line, it seems that people who are not white would still be treated unequally in those situations, simply because it would be impossible to distinguish between white people-unless the Minister is saying that it would be perfectly possible for the immigration service to stop and check all the white people on a flight from wherever, and nobody else.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, the difficulty is that the presumption, on the basis of the history of complaints, has always been that if there has been discrimination, it has been against black and Asian people, where white people would not have been discriminated against. If people have benefited from the more relaxed regime, it is more likely to be because they are white and, like the majority of people in this country, have been treated in that way. There is still the question of the colour of the majority community and the origins of minority communities. This is not a simple issue, and I should be grateful for the Minister's response to the argument that certain groups of people will still be at risk of being singled out for no specific reason other than ethnic origin.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> White people are not one homogeneous ethnic group, incapable of being distinguished one from another. It is possible to distinguish people from different groups, although I shall not go into the ways in which that can be done. However, given the sheer numbers of white people who come into Britain, a white person might well find it easier to breach immigration control than someone from an ethnic minority. Given that only 6 per cent. of our population are from ethnic minorities, fewer people from ethnic minorities than white people will be entering at any one time. Therefore, the chances of someone who is running a scam getting into this country are greater if they happen to be white simply because of our national make-up. It is likely to be easier for a white person, but that does not mean that immigration officers should not be asked to exercise some judgment about people's origin, which does not just involve looking at them.

<P>
These days, intelligence-led immigration control relies less and less on that method of identifying people. That is why immigration service officers get rather perturbed when critics suggest that they are making all these decisions merely by looking at someone's colour. They may have received information, which did not readily identify the individual's colour, when making a decision to stop them. Information is often provided by the airline or by intelligence sources in other countries. It may not have identified the racial or ethnic background of the individual. It may be possible to gain that information from a name, but that is not always the case.

<P>
The immigration service needs to be able to exercise judgment. I do not accept the view that all white people look alike, any more than I accept that people from any other ethnic background all look alike. People differ and have different characteristics. Colour is not usually the sole basis on which an immigration officer makes a decision to stop and check someone. It is much more likely these days that he would receive information from an intelligence source and that his decision to stop and check would be unrelated to colour.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is helpful to have that explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 13, line 8, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`1B. In section 47 add-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(3B) In the course of preparing any draft code of practice relating to the implementation by public authorities of the duty under section (positive duty) for eventual publication under subsection (2) the Commission shall consult with such organisations or bodies as appear to the Commission to be appropriate having regard to the content of the draft code.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
By inserting new section 19C in the Race Relations Act 1976, clause 1 provides an important exemption from immigration and nationality functions. That is necessary to secure a proper alignment between the extended Race Relations Act and the administration of immigration and nationality legislation, which legitimately and necessarily involves somewhat differential treatment of individuals on the basis of their nationality and, occasionally, their ethnic or national origin.

<P>
The exemption seeks to protect only discriminatory activity that is either required by specified immigration or nationality legislation or is authorised by Ministers and carried out in accordance with strict instructions that will, subject to operational requirements, be made available to the public. The exemption also covers the personal decisions of Ministers in individual cases that are frequently taken in the interests of national security and the public interest. Ministers are, of course, always accountable to Parliament.

<P>
During the debate in another place, Lord Lester and others expressed concern about the breadth of the exemption for immigration and nationality functions. In particular, there was concern that there should be a mechanism allowing effective scrutiny by Parliament over the operation of the exemptions. We undertook to consider that carefully, and the amendment represents the Government's proposed solution to questions of scrutiny and accountability.

<P>
The amendment will create a new statutory function-the race monitor-to provide independent oversight of the operation of the exemption for immigration and nationality functions. In appointing the race monitor, the Secretary of State will be debarred from choosing a member of his own staff, which secures and underlines the independence and impartiality of the role. The Secretary of State will be required to consult the Commission for Racial Equality in appointing the monitor. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will therefore be able to draw on the commission's considerable expertise in the field of race relations in selecting a candidate with the right skills and background to perform this important task. We have decided to go down the route of creating a specialist race monitor, rather than relying on the commission to exercise its powers under the Act, because of the specialised nature of the immigration, asylum and nationality system. This important function requires a dedicated resource. This amendment will do nothing to restrict the powers of the commission in dealing with these issues. It will add to the oversight and control in the system.

<P>
The race monitor will monitor the likely effect of ministerial authorisations to immigration staff to discriminate on grounds of nationality or ethnic or national origin, and acts carried out in accordance with such authorisations. That means that the monitor will examine the justification for such authorisations, their likely effect on the operation of the exemption, and how they actually work in practice. The monitor will report each year his or her findings to the Secretary of State, who will lay the report before each House of Parliament. The monitor's report will provide an accessible focus for informed debate of these matters. The monitor will not monitor discriminatory activity that is required by legislation, because Parliament will already have considered the justification for such discrimination in passing that legislation.

<P>
There is a successful precedent for this approach. The Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 created an independent entry clearance monitor to monitor refusals given by our entry clearance officers overseas in cases in which, as a consequence of restrictions imposed by the 1993 Act, there is no statutory right of appeal. In creating the entry clearance monitor function-a role performed highly effectively by Dame Elizabeth Anson-Parliament recognised the importance of introducing independent oversight over what would otherwise have been an unrestricted executive power. Parliament reaffirmed the entry clearance monitor's function in section 23 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The option of appointing the same person to perform the race and entry clearance monitor roles will be carefully considered by the Home Office and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, though specific statutory authorisation is required.

<P>
The Government believe that the approach of establishing a race monitor for the immigration system provides the most effective, workable solution to concerns expressed about the breadth of the exemption for immigration and nationality functions. We have listened carefully to those concerns, and the amendment represents a constructive, proportionate response. I hope that hon. Members will support it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have no objection to what the Government have proposed because, as the Minister said, there is a good precedent in the 1993 Act. However, I have some questions for the Minister. First, I should like him to flesh out a little-if he can-the Government's thinking about how the post holder should operate.

<P>
I was not clear from the way in which the Minister described the post whether the Government envisage a full-time salaried position comparable to that of, say, the chief inspector of prisons or the chief inspector of constabularies, or a part-time post comparable to the work done by Mr. Rowe and, before him, Lord Colville, in assessing the impact of the Prevention of Terrorism Acts and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts and reporting in due course to Ministers and to Parliament.

<P>
Secondly, do the Government have in mind that the monitor should be able to receive and investigate complaints from the public, Members of Parliament or the staff of the Home Office, and, if the monitor is given that function, how will it fit alongside the other routes available for handling complaints-for example, representation to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration or an approach to the Commission for Racial Equality? I understand the Government's wish to have a dedicated post holder, given the specific exception provided for in the Bill, but will there be a risk of double jeopardy whereby the monitor investigates an incident that is subsequently investigated by the CRE? How will the different responsibilities interrelate?

<P>
Thirdly, have the Government yet decided what access to information the monitor should have, and whether he or she will be permitted to make unannounced visits to the immigration service, the immigration and nationality directorate and United Kingdom posts overseas? One of the great strengths of the chief inspector of prisons has been his power to make unannounced inspections of prisons to supplement his regular visits. To my certain knowledge, every Home Secretary in the past 10 years has from time to time cursed whoever was chief inspector of prisons. Nevertheless, one of the best decisions taken by my noble Friend Lord Hurd was to ensure that the chief inspector's reports were made public and that there was greater access to information about what went on in the prison system. If the monitor does have comparable access to information, will it include highly classified information?

<P>
Some of the work of the immigration service is secret and highly confidential and will, from time to time, involve the immigration authorities in contact with the security and intelligence services and Government communications headquarters-GCHQ. Immigration officers will have operational information about individuals or organisations which the public interest requires be kept secret, not divulged to a wider audience. Will the monitor have privileged access to such information or will the Secretary of State so organise the arrangements for the monitor's work that the immigration service, or perhaps the Secretary of State, will be able to determine what information should be available and what should be withheld? If the Minister is not able to respond immediately, I hope that he will reply in writing in due course.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On a peripheral point, I note that whatever the merits of the amendment, we have clauses that not only have numbers but have lots of letters too. When there is a new section such as 19CC, there is something wrong with the legislation. When we come to tidy up the Bill, I hope that we will make it more user-friendly. I also wondered whether it would be worth tabling a written question to find out how many species of appointment by different titles there were at the beginning of this Administration and how many more there are now. As the Minister said, we have had one monitor before. I am not aware of any prefects, but probably there are. We have a few tsars. I think that we are a bit muddled about our hierarchy; we have some domestically grown titles and some that are clearly imported.

<P>
After those fairly light-hearted comments, I make the serious point that it would be helpful to try to make both the status and the lines of accountability of those whom we appoint to adjudicate, watch, report, monitor, or come back to us as consistent as possible. Like the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I am a recent veteran of the Terrorism Bill Committee, in which we spent a lot of time discussing the reports of someone who, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, has been doing a parallel job-to conduct an annual review and to compile a report for Parliament's consideration. It was valuable and important work on recent substantive anti-terrorist legislation in Ireland.

<P>
The provisions of the amendment are better than unrestricted, unmonitored Executive power. That is progress. Clearly it is a good idea that somebody should report back to Parliament, especially in relation to sensitive areas of work where discretion is exercised. As the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Khabra) hinted in his intervention, that is clearly part of the quid pro quo for the Government's resistance to changing the original exemption. The proposal for a monitor who will report back does ameliorate matters.

<P>
I think that I detected a contradiction and I want to ask the Minister whether it was a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation. He talked about the other monitor, a post set up under the previous Administration for immigration and asylum legislation. I do not cavil at his conclusion that the work was well done. I believe that he used the phrase-Hansard will confirm it-that that was seen to be necessary in order to deal with what would otherwise have been perceived as unrestricted Executive power.

<P>
We need to be careful about cases dealt with by the monitor, because even though the decisions will be made abroad by entry clearance officers and by Foreign and Commonwealth Office employees, people will be subject to the same judicial review and administrative law review process. I want to be sure that we are being consistent. I would have been surprised if the Minister had tried to sell us unrestricted Executive power, as he was careful to say how often he was subject to judicial reviewed when he was the Minister in charge of immigration-of which I am personally aware.
 
<P>
Let me deal with remaining concerns about the wording of the Minister's amendment. He will be aware that the Commission for Racial Equality remains nervous about it. There are only six minutes before we adjourn, so I must finish soon to allow the Minister time to respond. I shall summarise the Commission for Racial Equality's main points. It is unsure about the amendment's meaning, particularly the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the likely effect on the operation of the exception.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is uncertain about the object and purpose of the monitoring exercise and about how it will be carried out in practice. It acknowledges a move towards transparency and accountability, but raises questions about what will happen once the monitoring is in place and the report is laid before Parliament. If there is anticipated discrimination, what next? That is a question rightfully asked.

<P>
Finally, we anticipated this sort of amendment as a result of debates in the other place. Just because the amendment is an improvement on what came before does not necessarily undermine the case for continuing to argue for further amendment. Understandably, we are looking at it in the round. The proposals to amend section 19B may be a slight improvement, but we may wish to return to the issues again later.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with whether the post will be part time. It is envisaged that it will operate in a similar way to the current entry clearance monitor-currently the very able Dame Elizabeth Anson-which is a part time and remunerated post. I am unsure whether she receives a full salary, but she is certainly remunerated for her work. She does not deal with individual complaints: she is not a court of appeal and does not have the ability to deal directly with complaints from the public, but she looks at individual files and decides how the entry clearance system is operating in practice. She is able to conduct unannounced visits. Similarly, the race monitor will be able to examine case files-in as random or systematic a manner as he or she requires-to establish how they are being dealt with.

<P>
I was asked what would happen if a discrimination were disclosed. First, it would be reported to Parliament and the circumstances in which it happened, if unacceptable, would doubtless be changed. It would become public. That shows that there is oversight and the ability to check how the provisions are operating. As I said, there could be unannounced visits.

<P>
It is not envisaged that the activities of the security services would be investigated in any way by the race monitor. There are other oversight provisions for the security services, which will remain in place. Separate legislation-passed about 18 months ago-deals with the way in which immigration operates in security cases. The race monitor is, however, likely to be informed about intelligence operations in the immigration service when they relate to criminal matters. In those cases, the monitor will have to operate carefully and brief Parliament about sensitive intelligence information. We shall choose someone who will be able to exercise the requisite degree of sensitivity. I hope that the Committee will support that.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.
