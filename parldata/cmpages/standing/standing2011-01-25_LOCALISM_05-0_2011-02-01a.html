                           </strong> Before we start our line-by-line consideration, I
wish to make a few points. I recognise that although I have been a
Member for a long time, many colleagues on the Committee have not.
Indeed, there are some for whom this is their first Bill Committee. I
will take all such matters into consideration, but if we set out a few

Members will be glad to hear that the purpose of amendment 26 is to
strengthen clause 1. In our four evidence sessions, we heard again and
again doubt about whether the Government’s intention to devolve
power could be trusted. Opinion has it that the term “power of
general competence” is stronger than the other term, which means
a generic power of competence. When the Local Government Association
published its draft Local Government (Power of General Competence) Bill
in March 2010, the idea of such a power was supported by the
Communities and Local Government Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has been
argued that local government will never have all the freedom it needs
until the ultra vires principle is abolished. Others argue that members
of the community will always need the ability to challenge the actions
of a local authority as ultra vires through a judicial review in the
courts. However, there seems to be a consensus that the Government need
to be much clearer in their intention if they are to deliver the power
of general competence to local authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
am not sure why the phrase ‘general power of competence’
is used rather than the well understood ‘power of general
competence’. This may seem to be semantics but in my opinion it
could provide support for some judges to adopt a narrower
interpretation because ‘the widely accepted formulation was not
used so it must have been intended to be
different’”—<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>that is an important

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“That
leads into one main criticism which is that Part 1 Chapter 1 is couched
in terms of providing just another power of uncertain width, rather
than making it clear that this represents a major change in the way
statutory powers of local authorities should be viewed. That is
important because as we have seen in the <em>LAML</em> case, the judges
ignored the clear intention that the well-being power was to be a move
away from the restrictive and problematic interpretations of s.111 of
the 1972 Act, and it was held explicitly that these interpretations
applied to s.2 of the 2000 Act. What is needed to eliminate this
possibility is a clear statement of principle as to how all powers
should be interpreted, or that they must be interpreted to support a
wide purpose of local government rather be construed as simply
technical
powers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000346">&#160;</a>

was also a great deal of concern among witnesses last week about the
126 powers for the Secretary of State that are proposed in the Bill. I
am sure we will come back to that issue many times in Committee. A
witness at our first session, Andy Sawford of the Local Government
Information Unit, said that the Bill should

amendment does not make that happen, however. Some Members might not be
aware that about half the Committee was here at 10 o’clock this
morning, so people are obviously very keen to last through our five
weeks in Committee. We would get through our proceedings pretty quickly
if we made an amendment that deleted everything in the Bill after the
first line. However, we aim to strengthen clause 1 by adding to it the
term “power of general competence”, because that is
judged by many to be a stronger term for the power that we all, I hope,
want to see devolved. I hope that the Committee will support the

a good case for saying that clause 1 is the most

back to town halls and communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000052">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Indeed, one struggles to see the difference between  the
“general power of competence” in the Bill and 
the “power of general competence” proposed in the
amendment. It is quite difficult to build a substantial philosophical
case on those two sets of words. A general power of competence is
exactly what it says in clause 1 —exactly what it says
on the
tin.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
subsection (1), we have provided that local authorities have the power
to do anything that an individual may do. Subsection (5) makes it clear
that the generality of the power is not limited by the existence of
overlapping powers. The definition is there to clarify that the power
is precisely what we have claimed it to be—a general power of
competence. We are giving every local authority a general power. It is
not vague but it is limitless, which means that those limits are not
defined. During our debates on subsequent clauses, we will discuss some
of the practical implications of that and where the natural boundaries
should be. Every local authority should be treated as though it were an
individual, and it should have the general power to do all
that such an individual can do, with the limitations
detailed in subsequent clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
and proper that we discuss the Government’s intentions, and I am
happy to provide the hon. Lady with any reassurance that she requires
about our good faith and the legal precision of the Bill’s
measures. The use of the phrase “general power of
competence” instead of “power of general
competence”, as she would prefer, is not some deep Government
conspiracy to subvert the intention of all of us who have been
concerned about local government, and about the relationship between
central and local government, for not just a year or two, but decades.
None of us wants anything to dilute the transfer of power and authority
so that local councils can do exactly what clause 1 intends.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I reassure
the hon. Lady that her amendment is not necessary. Indeed, inserting
such a definition into subsection (1) might be
counter-productive. I urge her to accept the Government’s good
faith—she may quiz and question us by all means—and to
accept that the ministerial team, members of the Committee and the
whole Government are clear about the need to give every local authority
in the country a general power of competence with only those
qualifications that appear in subsequent clauses. I hope that,
following that reassurance, the hon. Lady will withdraw the

Minister’s answer has left me more confused than I was
originally. I accept his assurance that there  is no conspiracy
on the part of the Government. Unfortunately, however, as we go through
the Bill, we will see many loose ends in the form of ideas with
implications that have not been thought through. I fear that the
“power of general competence” or the “general
power of competence”—whichever
phraseology we adopt—is an example of that. The Minister said
that the power was limitless, but he then qualified that by saying that
limits would be introduced in subsequent clauses. Without going beyond
the boundaries of the amendment, that is a straightforward
contradiction, as one cannot have a limitless power that is subject to
subsequent limitation. That is the first indication of a lack of
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p>We
all know, however, that local authorities are not the same as
individuals. Individuals can do a whole series of things that corporate
bodies cannot do, because of other statute. Procurement rules for
corporate bodies mean that they are subject to a whole raft of European
obligations that would not apply to me, as an individual, if I bought a
product. I do not have to publish an OJEU—Official Journal of
the European Union<em>—</em>notice, for example, if I want to buy
particular household goods. Therefore, there are obviously differences
that make the concept of a local authority having the power to do
anything that individuals generally may do open to question. Until the
Government can give much clearer indications about the basis of the
thinking that led to the formulation they adopted, I will remain
somewhat
sceptical.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not expressing scepticism in an unfriendly way. In preparing for
today’s session, I looked at the Local Government Act 2003,
which I was responsible for taking through the House as Minister, and
in which similar issues occurred. The opening section has a clear
enunciation of a general principle. The Act could have been presented
as major legislation devolving power and giving greater freedom to
local government, but the then Opposition—now the
Government—did not want to see it in that light.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Section 1
sounds pretty good:<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
local authority may borrow
money—<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>(a) for any purpose relevant
to its functions under any enactment,
or(b) for the purposes of the
prudent management of its financial
affairs.”<p>That
is pretty wide and devolutionary. It gives enormous power to local
government, but there are limitations in subsequent sections. As a
Government, we had exactly the same challenge as the current Government
in setting parameters that are workable in practice and conform with
wider obligations—I referred to EU obligations. The argument
that the provisions are a wonderful extension of local government
freedom remains open to a great deal of questioning while we are
unclear as to how the Government intend to frame the restrictions and
limitations on the power of general competence in clause 1.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I remain
sceptical. I accept the Government statement that there is not a
conspiracy, but they have been unconvincing in saying that the idea has
been rationally and well thought through. We should not take what they
say about the extensive devolution of power in the clause on trust. I
hope that they can offer us a better explanation
before a decision on the clause is
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Like my right hon. Friend, I found the
Minister’s response disappointing. I hope it does not represent
the stance the Government will take on the whole Bill. The Bill has not
been properly scrutinised. It has not been the subject of consultation.
It is rushed, and, as has been said, it is ragged. Work needs to be
done on it. The amendment does not, in any sense, represent a
conspiracy theory.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
says he wants to give me every reassurance, but the reassurance is not
just for me. Signals need to be sent from the Committee in two ways.
A signal needs to be sent to
local government, so that it starts to believe that this is a localist
Bill. The main difficulty with that, to which we will
return, is that whether there are 126 or 142 powers
taken by the Secretary of State in the Bill— whichever
count you take—it sends the wrong message. That was absolutely
apparent in the evidence last week. As I said, with
regard to the evidence before us, we need to send the right messages
for later interpretation in the courts.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000066">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I did not say
that the point was about semantics; that was a quote from our witness,
who was an adviser to the Government on the power of well-being and has
reviewed its use. We should listen to the people who struggled to send
the right signals to local government and to the courts, such as my
right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and other
former Ministers. That way, we will not get into situations like that
of the London Authorities Mutual Limited case, and all  the
work we do here and that which needs to follow will not flounder on an
interpretation. Colin Crawford worries that if we do not get the
wording and the intention right in the Bill, it will
cause<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is somebody who helped the Government to craft a power and has reviewed
its use. There have been issues with that, and I do not understand why
the Government cannot accept the simple addition of a few words to the
first clause. It is disappointing, and I will press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Our first debate touched on the general power of
competence, which is far-reaching and broad, and it was nice for
Members to get to vote in the first half-hour, so that we can see how
that works.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have a
number of questions on clause 1. Earlier, I talked about the need for a
clear statement of principle on the powers and how they are meant to be
interpreted. Will the Minister issue such a statement? Will there be
clarity about what councils are expected to do, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 179<a class="bkMark" name="Column179">&#160;</a>
                           </div>what they are not? That debate should have been had during
pre-legislative scrutiny, or in a White Paper consultation before the
Bill was introduced, and the Bill would have been better for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Local
Government Information Unit said that there should be a constitutional
statement about local government’s role. Otherwise, the courts
will interpret that role in a fairly minimalist way, in relation to how
permissive they are of what local government can do, which is surely
not the Bill’s intention. We must bear in mind that if the
desire really is for councils to start to innovate and use these
powers—and I believe that that is the desire—people out
there will want to challenge them. Councils that begin to innovate will
be challenged, so the surer we can make them in their new powers, the
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
witness asked for clarity about the new role of representative
democracy, alongside the Bill’s measures on direct democracy,
which is a theme we might return to. In some cases, councils are
starting to feel that the powers might bypass them. The Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry
into the prospect of codifying the relationship between central and
local government. On 20 January, my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), who is Chair of the Communities and
Local Government Committee, gave evidence,
stating:<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
think there is a need for some sort of long-term settlement as to the
responsibilities and relationships between central and local
government, particularly in what is still and will remain a
parliamentary democracy. What are the rights of local government within
that parliamentary democracy where Parliament is
sovereign?”<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>He
also talked about the European charter of local self-government, to
which we signed up as a country, saying:<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“if you put that
into a legislative format so it was something we had to have regard to,
and it was something there and something that both Houses of Parliament
had agreed, that would be a basis for a long-term good relationship
where local government would have a greater
standing.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is important, because I received messages before we started on the
Bill, suggesting that some councils thought that they were being
bypassed, and that direct democracy for communities meant that their
role was being undervalued. Many of us understand the role of local
government and the local councillor, and we value it. It is important
that we send out the right message to those who do that valuable
job.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we heard last week, Professors Jones and Stewart suggested a code,
which clarified relations between central and local government, to the
Select Committee on Political and Constitutional Reform. Can members of
the Committee be supplied with that code, so that we can review it? I
must say that I looked for it in vain. I found all kinds of other
things related to it, but I could not find the code itself. Will the
Minister say whether such a code could be issued alongside the Bill? It
would add clarity to all the issues around the roles and
responsibilities of local and central Government that were raised by
many of the witnesses who are stakeholders in local
government.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand that the Chairs of the Communities and Local Government
Committee and the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee have
agreed to keep talking about having a code. My hon. Friend the Member
for Sheffield South East said that he would be talking to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 180<a class="bkMark" name="Column180">&#160;</a>
                           </div>his Select Committee about creating a code that would be suitable for
the UK, based on elements of the European charter. The work of those
two Select Committees is relevant to the Bill. If there had been
pre-legislative scrutiny, or at least a consultation on a White Paper,
we might have settled on something that could have been ready at the
same time as the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the Bill and the general power of competence is to give
greater powers to use flexibilities, as appropriate, in the local area.
The Law Society is concerned that, where a different approach is taken
in different areas, comparisons and challenges are likely to arise
regarding the inconsistent use of those flexibilities. It feels that
that could potentially lead to human rights or judicial review actions.
Thinking about the context of local government, with 28% cuts over the
next four years, that litigation could be difficult and costly, with
lengthy appeals, and it would be difficult for local government to
fight. The Law Society sees the setting of minimum standards nationally
as being the way to overcome that, but there is no mention of that in
the Bill, nor has the matter been raised in debate in the House. Will
the Minister look at that issue? It is important for areas of service
provision such as social care. We already see a substantial divergence
in the levels of service and support that different local authorities
deliver.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000104">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final question is one that was raised by retailers. Does the general
power of competence undermine the primary authority scheme, which
ensures consistency of trading standards enforcement for companies
operating in multiple local authority
areas?<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000105">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr Amess. I agree with all that my hon. Friend said. In last
week’s evidence, we heard a lot that emphasised the need for the
general power of competence to be something that is understood and
clear, and not something that leads to problems in the courts.
Professor Jones made that clear when he said to the Communities and
Local Government
Committee:<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p>In
other words, before the Bill is passed, we need to be clear on what the
general power will allow councils to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
point is along the same lines as that made by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich earlier: I would be interested to
learn what advice the Government have had on what legal challenges
there might be from people who are not comfortable with local
authorities going about the business that we want them to undertake,
and that the Bill will empower them to undertake. We need to know where
that advice is and how the Bill can better position local authorities,
because there was no pre-legislative scrutiny and it is our
responsibility to improve the Bill. I welcome the Minister’s
comments of last week, in which he recognised that this is an
opportunity to improve the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to be clear about where there might be legal concerns. As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said earlier, the
power of well-being was supposed to move councils forward. That proved
to be problematic, and we now have legal precedents for those problems.
How can we ensure that we do not have a minefield of legal problems
with this

will find it difficult—we have been advised that they will find
it impossible—to unpick that. Subsequent clauses, as the right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has pointed out, include
necessary limitations, which, when we come to debate them, may be
examined to see whether they might have any inadvertent

councils in particular, felt that the well-being power would do all the
things that we are talking about, so the advice that “Everything
in the power is fine; it will all be great” does not convince
the people outside who have tried it. Could he comment on that, and not

achieve what a general power of competence would. We received plenty of
assurances during those debates that it would achieve that, but some of
us understood from the beginning that there would be a problem, because
council officials and, to a lesser extent, lawyers would be very
cautious. They would back away from anything that looked challenging or
difficult, and, with one or two exceptions, that proved to be the case.
A driving force for moving forward with this legislation is that the
well-being power has all the problems that the hon. Member for Worsley
and Eccles South described. As a result, it is much less effective than
its proponents expected, but not less than its critics expected it to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000120">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister makes a good point about the reticence
and caution of council legal officers. It is a moot point that needs to
be addressed as the legislation is put in place, to ensure that it
changes the culture with which those of us who have worked in local
government are familiar. One thing I would like clarification on is
whether the Secretary of State’s retaining a power to curtail
the general power of competence will, in itself, put an element of
risk-aversion back into those legal minds. Is that not a contradiction
and a hurdle in the legislation that there is an opportunity at this
point to put
right?<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly agree with the hon.
Gentleman’s point that many local authority officers are
risk-averse. That is not a bad thing to be, but it sometimes leads them
into situations that stifle innovation and opportunity. However, I do
not want to blame everything on the officers. Clearly, it is right for
councils collectively and councillors to have confidence in the powers
in the Bill—and, for that matter, for the courts to be clear
about the intention of the legislation. I hope that my words now and
later will give that confidence.

point I am making is that the Government will not go down that track,
and if Labour Members are tempting me to do so, I tell them that we
shall not. The hon. Lady made an important point about the need to
value councillors. Plenty of the evidence we took showed that they feel
undervalued at the moment and that the regime they have been required
to operate under—I was going to say “oppressed
by”, but perhaps that goes a little too far—means that
they have lost their sense of self-worth. In many cases, it has led to
worse rather than better local government because councillors have been
so constrained and hampered by the framework in which they are required
to operate. I welcome the work the Select Committees are undertaking to
look at how to take forward and implement the ideas in the Bill, and I
look forward to the outcome of their work in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000126">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady went on, a little paradoxically, to say that she was
concerned that local authorities might provide different provision in
different areas and that therefore we needed something to override
clause 1 and impose minimum standards on service delivery, but that is
exactly the opposite direction of travel from that of the Bill. Local
communities and local councils are the right people to decide how
services should be delivered, by whom they should be delivered, and how
much they should pay for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000127">&#160;</a>

Society’s concern that there will be legal challenges if no
minimum standard is set. Do we want to open up a situation where there
will be legal challenges up and down the country about the levels of
social care provided? There has already been a case in which the mother
of a disabled child has tried to raise such an issue with the Prime
Minister. That will be repeated throughout the length and breadth of

question. The problem she describes has occurred in circumstances in
which the local democratic system is extremely closely regulated by
Parliament at every turn. It is clear that a general power of
competence

			Column number: 184<a class="bkMark" name="Column184">&#160;</a>
                           </div>does not absolve any local authority from fulfilling its other statutory
functions. Nothing in the provisions says that no law will apply to
local authorities and that they can do whatever they want. It will be
open for local authorities to account to the courts about whether they
are complying with statutory requirements. It is mistaken to impose
additional and, by implication, statutory requirements on local
authorities to safeguard people from the impact of a general power of
competence which, as she quite rightly said, was not her suggestion but
the Law
Society’s.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to be unduly cynical about this, but when the Law Society
gives us evidence that a certain course of action might lead to more
rather than less work for its members, one should take careful stock of
the quality of that piece of advice. I reassure the hon. Lady that
nothing in the general power of competence would undermine trading
standards, and I must admit to having some difficulty understanding her
point. Every local authority will retain duties enshrined in other
legislation to provide services and not to charge for them, if charging
is not allowed at present. The Committee will see that all that is
covered in subsequent
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000130">&#160;</a>

essence, the hon. Member for Scunthorpe suggested that because the
power of well-being did not turn out to be as fireproof as Ministers
thought when it was introduced, that will also be true of the power of
general competence. We believe that we have learned from the experience
of the power of well-being. Indeed, the then Government and the right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich proposed it in very good faith.
They had high expectations and hopes, but it did not deliver. We have
looked at what the problems were. We have picked up the idea of having
a general power, which he discarded—no doubt for what looked
like good reasons at the time—and we are putting it right at the

but in the previous one. It was not, therefore, my personal
responsibility, although I was a member of the Government and I was
well aware of their objectives and intentions. I have no doubt that the
legal advice that that Government received was similar to the legal
advice that the Minister and his colleagues are receiving to assure
them that the power is framed in such a way as to resist
judicial review. Life does not work out like that, however.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000134">&#160;</a>

other words, the Secretary of State can say to local authorities,
“You may have a power of general competence, but I am telling
you that you simply cannot do this.” Why do we not have the
draft regulations? Why do we not know, when we are debating this in
Committee, exactly what the Secretary of State intends to do under that
hugely extensive power? The provision allows him to undermine
completely all the Minister’s good intentions of devolving
greater power to local government. Without sight of the draft
regulations, we would be foolish indeed as a Parliament—and
certainly as an Opposition—to accept the Minister’s
blandishments about the Government’s good intentions when we
simply do not know clearly how the Secretary of State intends to use
those wide-ranging powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000137">&#160;</a>

said that the general power of competence was limitless, but I have
pointed out that that is not the case. We do not have a clear statement
from the Government about where they think there are limits, where
there should be restrictions, and in what areas limitations are to be
placed on the powers of local government to do what it wants under the
power of general competence. We have a second area, therefore, where
there is no statement of Government policy, and that is quite apart
from the absence of draft regulations indicating how the Secretary of
State intends to use the draconian powers that the Bill
confers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000138">&#160;</a>

the question of commercial purposes. The Minister himself said that
clause 1 gave power to local government to do anything “for a
commercial purpose” or “without charge”.
Unfortunately, there are limitations on what local government can do
for a commercial purpose. I have referred to the 2003 Act, which
introduced the power for local government to charge and to trade. Those
extensive devolutionary powers, which were given by the previous
Government, were inevitably subject to some limitations, partly because
of competition law coming into play.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000139">&#160;</a>

doubt that Ministers and their officials have received representations
from commercial interests who are concerned about a limitless power for
local government to trade or to carry out activities for a commercial
purpose. What representations have been received from businesses? Let
us remember that the most important piece of litigation that has
circumscribed the power of well-being, which was relating to the wish
of London boroughs to form a mutual insurance association, was brought
by commercial interests that saw it as competitive. That is going to
happen. I am sorry but the Minister is not living in the real world if
he thinks that the Law Society’s comments can be brushed aside,
that everything

be no problems with the powers contained in the Bill. There will be
problems. Some outside interests will be uncomfortable with local
government exercising a number of the powers that the Minister would
like to give it, because they will see that as a competitive threat. If
they are unsatisfied with the answers and regulations that they get
from Government, they will almost certainly use the courts as a means
of trying to restrict the power of general
competence.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000140">&#160;</a>

met representatives of business—possibly even the insurance
business—to ascertain whether they are comfortable with an
open-ended power for local government to compete in that area, or
whether they would still see difficulties, as they saw with the power
of well-being in relation to London Authorities Mutual Ltd. I must say

Local government already has wide powers to charge and to trade, and we

intervention, but he has only reinforced my point that while the powers
to trade and to charge were introduced by the previous Government as a
devolutionary power, they were subject to certain limitations. The
powers in this Bill are also subject to limitations, although he seems
rather reluctant to admit it. If local authorities are going to trade,
why is it required that they must do so through a company? That is
provided for in the Bill in exactly the same way that the power was
subject to limitation in the 2003 Act. Clearly there have to be
limitations, and if he looks in the Bill, he will see that those
limitations are
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000143">&#160;</a>

to the issue that I was highlighting, the power of well-being was
interpreted by London local authorities as giving them the ability to
run a mutual insurance scheme. That, however, set up competitive
tension with others from the insurance industry, who made a successful
challenge in the courts. What representations have the Government
received from representatives of business? If those powers raise
competitive challenges similar to those explored by the courts in the
case of the London mutual insurance scheme, they may feel uncomfortable
about the extent of the powers now being offered to local
government.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000144">&#160;</a>

who have not done the detailed work, published the detailed draft

not submitted them to pre-legislative scrutiny, as they should have.

decisions about things like that, so we do not need the Government or
Secretary of State to tell us how to carry out scrutiny or how to
organise our management arrangements. Such inconsistencies do not give
us as much confidence in the GPC as we would like, but perhaps the

whether he could supply members of the Committee with the code that was
suggested by the professors in our evidence session last week so that
we could review it. A code for local government is key, and two Select
Committees are working on that issue. Such work should have gone
alongside the Bill, and we should not complete our Committee

it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000148">&#160;</a>

Minister to tell us what consultation had been carried out with
business. There was a short evidence session with senior
representatives of business organisations last week, but we did not
address specific sectors, such as insurance. Will the Minister say what
consultation there has been with business—and particularly with
insurance—about the new powers for local government? We keep
returning to the fact that we suffer because the Bill has not been
subject to enough scrutiny. There was no pre-legislative scrutiny, and
there has not been any consultation—effectively, our Committee
proceedings are the first scrutiny of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000149">&#160;</a>

touch on what I said about minimum standards. We will have difficulties
if Ministers shrug off everything that has been said about the
necessary standards that people have come to expect in certain areas,
and there is an interaction between that and the powers. As the
Minister will see, certain outside organisations are concerned about
having some kind of free-for-all in which councils can
outsource—as the Secretary of State and his Ministers are
encouraging—and devolve all kinds of powers and services. At the
same time, however, Ministers cause confusion by constantly telling
local government what to do. Whenever Labour

groaning under the weight of letters from the Secretary of State. The
Minister says that we cannot discuss minimum standards or what is
necessary to protect vulnerable people, but I remind him that Ministers
are telling local councils to keep libraries open, not to change their
eligibility criteria for social care, and not to issue redundancy
notices—there are many, many letters. At a local government
conference last week, the Secretary of State spent 20 minutes of his
speech talking about bin collection. He is obsessed with bins and that
local councils should do exactly what he thinks they should do about
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000150">&#160;</a>

shadow Secretary of State has given in speeches. I can provide the hon.
Member for Congleton with those speeches, if she is interested. We
believe in certain statutory minimum standards. I believe that we can
protect vulnerable people only if, for instance, we protect social care
funding. As I have said in the Chamber, and certainly in Westminster
Hall, the Government will come unstuck with their laissez-faire
attitude.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000156">&#160;</a>

Government are moving towards what they think of as open guidance, with
Ministers sending letter after letter to councils telling them what to
do on every little detail. On the important matters that people really
value and believe in, however—on the things that vulnerable
people need, such as social care, child protection and safeguarding of
adults—they seem to draw back. The Minister did not address the
question of what Ministers will do, when the Bill has become law, if a
council decides that it will not offer much social care, for example.
Overlapping powers and overlapping guidance

                           </strong> I will do my best to respond to the latest points
made. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich asked why local
authorities are required to trade through companies, and why the Bill
does nothing about that. There are a number of reasons for that, but
the most significant, underlying reason is that local authorities
should trade on an equal footing with the commercial sector; there
should be a level playing field, and that is what we are ensuring in
requiring them to trade as companies. It is also important from the
point of view of taxation; I think that he is well aware of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This point
relates to something that several hon. Members have taken—or
perhaps mistaken—from what we are proposing: the legislation
that applies to the provision of statutory services is not repealed by
the Bill, which aims to widen the scope of local authority competence,
not narrow it. If a statutory duty is in place, therefore, it remains
in place. For the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South to say, as
she did, that we do not care about matters such as child protection is
not acceptable. I understand her point of view, but I hope that she
will accept and understand that that is a somewhat offensive way to put
it on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000159">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that the Minister will not keep up this
combative turn. I did not say that; I have been misquoted a couple of
times in this debate. I asked the Minister—he tried to brush it
aside—about having some guidance on minimum levels and minimum
standards. He dismissed that as telling councils what to do, but it is
not. In the innovative new world into which we want to take local
government, it is important to be clear—as I said in my opening
speech—about what councils will, and will not, be expected to
do. As the Minister knows, some councils think that they can outsource
everything. I am not saying that the Minister does not care about these
issues—I am sure that he does—but how will adult
safeguarding, child protection and social care for vulnerable people be
protected if there is a free-for-all and everything can be outsourced?
Such questions about local authorities’ powers are important.
That is my question; I did not in any sense say that the Minister did
not care about those issues. I would be grateful if he was a bit more
careful not to misquote.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000160">&#160;</a>

powers of the Secretary of State, which we will discuss under clause 5,
and some points about the governance  
<div class="columnNumber">

                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the point that the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South made
about Ministers writing letters, the ministerial team want to move to a
much more equal relationship between central and local government. That
does not mean that we do not talk to each other and say what we think
should happen. As she will know well, the Local Government Association
has given the ministerial team some pretty vigorous and robust advice
about what it thinks we should do. There is nothing inappropriate about
that dialogue going in both directions. The difference between the
letters that Ministers have sent to local authorities since the
election and the equally profuse streams of letters sent before the
election is that ours do not statutorily compel authorities to do
things. The whole point of the new dialogue is that local authorities
will be equal partners with central Government in local service
delivery and performance. It is absolutely right for us to tell local
authorities what we think, and it is absolutely right that they should
tell us what they think. Perhaps, as the hon. Lady and I just
demonstrated, there may be a question of tone that we can get right,

earlier that we will look with interest at the work that the Select
Committees are doing on codes. We are certainly open to seeing whether
there is work that needs to be done. We believe that we have the right
framework, and that it would not be consistent with what we are trying
to achieve through the power that we are introducing to talk about
codes and frameworks, to give examples, and generally to hedge it about
with practical restrictions. Those restrictions would inevitably be the
focus when matters got drawn back into the courts, because somebody
would claim that section 32 on page 19 had not been complied
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000168">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just to be clear, I did not ask about codes
generally. I asked whether the Committee could be given the code
suggested by the professors so that we could consider it, because it is
important. The Minister talks about a relationship with local
government; the work being done by two important Select Committees 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>will help to produce a code and a framework for that. That is important.
It is not right to bring forward a Bill that changes the powers of
local government and the Secretary of State without that work; it
should have been done at the same time. As that
work is going on right now, could members of the Committee be supplied
with the code? I also hope that the Minister will answer the question
asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich

those provisions. I am unsure of the ownership of the code to which she
refers, but I would be content for it to be circulated to the
Committee, if it is within my compass to say that it should be.

they will either intervene on me or give me a chance to intervene on
them, as the case may be. It is quite right that we should be tested
and probed on this; and it is quite right that we should be challenged
on whether our intentions are honest and deliverable, which is perhaps
the point that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich was
making. I suppose that one should be most worried when politicians say
that they are honest, but our intentions are very clear and
straightforward. We mean this clause to deliver what it appears to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000171">&#160;</a>

“Chariots of Fire” with an expression of intent, because
we all want to get to the same place. The example that I gave earlier
was that if someone gets on an aeroplane and finds that the lock on the
toilet door is not working, they would worry because if the company
cannot sort out the lock on the toilet door, what are they doing to the
engines? I know that my concern will be covered in detail later on, but
if we cannot allow a local authority to decide whether it wants 10 or
11 people on an executive, are we really of the mind to give
it the radical and revolutionary freedoms that the general power of

allow?<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000177">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> At the outset, the Minister’s opening
gambit was to say that the Bill would give a limitless general power of
competence to local authorities. In answer to the hon. Member for
Bradford East, the Minister talked about previous legislation. I
thought that the whole idea behind the Localism Bill was to free up
local authorities to determine their own future in any way they see
fit—I am talking about in a reasonable world, with reasonable
people behaving reasonably. The limitlessness of the Bill as the
Minister describes it only goes to clause 2. Further restrictions are
then put on it in clauses 3 and 4 and so on. I am struggling to see
where any limitlessness to the powers of local authorities under this
Bill can stretch. I really am struggling with that whole
concept.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000179">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Put that down to me learning the job. Perhaps
there is a better word than “limitless”. The fact that we
are not defining every boundary of this power in clause 1 is
deliberate. In the past, local authorities could only do things that
were permitted to them by legislation. We are now inverting that and
saying, “You can do anything that isn’t forbidden by
legislation.” That does not mean that we are taking away the
current forbidden territory and saying to authorities that they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 193<a class="bkMark" name="Column193">&#160;</a>
                           </div>can go into the forbidden territory. It is not saying that they
can abandon their statutory and legal duties that are imposed by
existing legislation. Perhaps it is that concept that I
failed to convey in my previous contributions. I apologise if that is
the case. That is the real point of clause 1. Instead of having a
regime in which everything has to be authorised by Parliament, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East pointed out that often means
the Secretary of State of the day, and instead of having a regime that
can proceed only under permission and under legislation, we are
changing it round and saying, “You can do anything an individual
can do unless it is
forbidden.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps, this will help the Minister who is
struggling to find a form of words. To answer the question from the
hon. Member for Bradford East, or Mr Bradford as you were calling him,
Mr Amess, the issue with the Bill—as the Minister has just
said—is that things have been repeated in the schedule from
earlier Bills. That is the problem. A person will be sitting in local
government looking at this Bill with its horrendous schedules. Why was
time not taken to rethink those things? I am sure that we will come on
to this again, but if we are talking about localist, limitless powers
for local government, why are we telling them what to do, how many
members they need and how to record their minutes? We will come back to
that when we discuss governance arrangements, but that is the question
the Committee has to sort out.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000181">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady asks a good question, and I guess
if we had a 10-year rather than a five-year Parliament we could set
about rewriting every one of the local government Acts the previous
Administration put in place. We thought we would start with the big
one, which is the Localism Bill, which changes the power relationship.
When we get to the relevant provisions, one of the Secretary of
State’s powers, which the Committee seems to want to ask
questions about, is the power to make further changes to governance
arrangements subsequently. A local authority, such as Bradford, might
want to put to a future Secretary of State that it would like that to
happen, but perhaps I am trespassing on a different debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000182">&#160;</a>

introduced by the previous Government in the 2003 Act. I pointed out
that, like this legislation, that Act started with a magnificent
statement of general principle, perhaps because those who drafted it
are people similar to those who put together this Bill. It is a very
devolutionary principle that states that a local authority would have
power to borrow

there have to be limitations to ensure compatibility with other

obligations on procurement and so on imposed by our membership of the
EU. I would be grateful if we did not rush to agree on the clause
without further explanation from the Government about what led them to
their view on the right balance between freedom to charge and to trade,
which I hope the Minister will give. As I said, the previous Government
introduced those freedoms, and we are delighted that the current
Government have continued with that thinking. Do they have any
intention to change the framework? If so, what is the thinking behind
the Government’s policy? Is it simply a matter of carrying
forward the existing arrangements without significant

freedom accompanied by an incredibly detailed prescription of how many

comfortably together. I understand the Minister’s answer on the
previous clause; the Government have simply carried forward existing
provisions. That may be the case, but what thought have they given to
the need for those restrictions? What thought have they given to the
need for specific restrictions and limitations on the power to charge,
particularly in clause 3? Is there scope for greater freedom? Will
competition, which is why I highlighted the representations that may
have been received from business interests, create difficulties? We are
owed a rather greater explanation from the Minister about the
Government’s thinking on clause 3 and what the limitations
should be on the power to charge under the general power of

                           </strong> Briefly, it would be helpful to the Committee, and
certainly to me, if the Minister explained clause 4 by answering
questions, as he has just done with my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich on clause 3. In particular, I want to ask about
clause 4(2), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Where,
in exercise of the general power, a local authority does things for a
commercial purpose, the authority must do them through a
company.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>There
is a budding and important development in councils—certainly
Labour councils—of mutuals or co-operatives. In sending out the
right signals, we want to be sure that we recognise and support the
idea of a co-operative council, that we recognise the value of mutuals
and that clause 4(2) in no way undermines that. It is rather alarming
that the subsection does not include “or a mutual or a
co-operative”, because that is valid. If there are points that
relate to questions asked about clause 3, it would be helpful if the
Minister made those
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000198">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly share the hon. Lady’s interest
in seeing a diverse range of providers, including, as she quite rightly
says, mutuals and co-operatives. I remind her that they can, of course,
be set up as companies. The underlying point here is that local
authorities and their trading arms have to be on a level playing field
with the private and commercial sector in both a positive and negative
way. They should not be at a disadvantage, but they should not have an
outstanding advantage. Taxation is a particular issue. It is right to
carry forward the requirement that such bodies should be companies and
trading as such. A mutual can trade as a company and, if appropriate,
it pays tax and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000199">&#160;</a>

hope that that is reassuring. If the hon. Lady wants me to spend a
little longer discussing it, I will, but I assure her that nothing in
the clause undermines the Government’s intention, which I know
that she shares, to see mutual enterprises and co-operatives play a
bigger part in the delivery of public
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This group of amendments would change the
Secretary of State’s powers to make supplemental provision to
the general power of competence. We have already touched on that power
this morning, and we now turn to the big difficulty that many of our
witnesses talked about last
week.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
we debated a Labour amendment on Second Reading, we made several
points. The first was that we would welcome a Bill that genuinely
devolved powers to local authorities. That is what the Localism Bill
was meant to do, but as we have heard this morning, and as a number of
our witnesses said, including Councillor Gary Porter of the Local
Government Association, it does not do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the promise of a radical redistribution of power from central
Government to local people is undermined due to the extent to which the
Bill hands powers to the Secretary of State to override those devolved
powers. I should also add that the Bill copies, instead of reworking,
provisions from earlier Acts, and takes a non-localist, centralising
approach, rather than a localist one. Schedules 2 and 3 are full of
that, and make very difficult reading for anyone outside this
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
received evidence from 14 witnesses on the local government proposals
under discussion, and the concern that the Bill hands too much power to
the Secretary of State was expressed by the LGA, the Local Government
Information Unit, the Centre for Local Economic Strategies, the leader
of Cheshire West and Chester council, the leader of Shropshire council,
Professor Jones, Professor Stewart, the New Local Government Network,
the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, Unison and London
Councils. That is the majority of the organisations that gave us
evidence on local government
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000210">&#160;</a>

According to the amendment paper, amendment 29 would delete subsections

they would make it harder for the Secretary of State to amend or revoke

                           </strong> I will come to that. We are here to discuss
whether the Bill is localist or centralising. There must also be
safeguards, however. If the Bill had received better work, more
consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny, it could have contained a
simple statement of the general power of competence. It should not
contain all the details that are in schedule 2, and it should not give
142 or 126 powers to the Secretary of State. A code could have
clarified the relationship between central Government and local
government, but as we do not have such a code we must limp on with a
Bill that does not do the job very well. Many of our witnesses last

want to do under that power. Regarding subsections (1) and (2), which
the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth has just mentioned, there will be a
different view on each side of the Committee. Subsections (1) and (2)

uncomfortable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000229">&#160;</a>

Department for Communities and Local Government memorandum to the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee described a similar

I am not convinced. I am surprised that Local Government Ministers are
convinced, because in a similar debate on the Local Government and
Public Involvement in Health Bill Committee three years ago, the

We agree with that sentiment, which is why we have proposed the
amendment. If local authorities find that a statutory provision either
prevents them from exercising the general power or overlaps with that
power, the Secretary of State can and should report to Parliament, and

good enough that a Minister took a power, because when a Minister moved
on to another job, another Minister might come in with a different
ideology or ideas on how to exercise that power, and we should not be
left with such matters at the whim of a particular Secretary of State.

have us replace it with is not an obligation to consult local

an obligation to consult Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000246">&#160;</a>

want to clarify the whole point about subsections (1) and
(2). These powers are extremely far reaching. To give the Secretary of
State the power to set aside statute by order without parliamentary
consideration goes too far. I believe that people in this House and
certainly in the other place will look askance at a proposal to give

protection of local government in a power that allows the Secretary of
State to do what the Secretary of State decides. There is no obligation
to agree with local government a mechanism to resolve the problem. If
there were such a provision we would feel more comfortable although we
would still feel nervous about giving such extensive powers to set
aside statute by order. That is a point of principle. The real problem
arises in subsection (3) and those that follow from it. By
any account subsection (3) is draconian. It allows the
Secretary of State by order to<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is an extreme Henry VIII power. For this Parliament to allow a
Secretary of State to set aside anything on his say-so after
consulting, but not necessarily having to agree with the people he has
consulted, strikes me as a very dangerous precedent. I should
have thought Government Members who think about this would regard it
with some alarm. The point has already been made that one may believe
that the present Secretary of State will act benignly. I am not sure
that everyone does but some people may. But we have to take account of
whoever may be in that position in future if we propose to give them
those powers. This is an extremely wide-ranging power.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000250">&#160;</a>

Government policy and how the Secretary of State intends to use these
powers? Why do we, the Committee that is supposed to be scrutinising
these provisions, not have sight of the draft regulations? It is a
normal constitutional politeness that the Government publish
regulations in draft form before a Committee comes to the relevant
stage of its proceedings where the implications of order-making powers
are considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000251">&#160;</a>

to give the go-ahead to provisions that give such extensive powers to
the Secretary of State with no sight whatever of what the Government
intend to do with those powers is, frankly, a constitutional outrage.
The Government should be deeply ashamed of what they are doing. If they
use their majority to railroad the Bill through this House, I hope that
the other place will make certain that the power does not carry
through, because it is utterly wrong for powers of such extent to be
given to the Secretary of State without this House having the
opportunity to scrutinise in detail the Government’s intentions,
their policy and how they intend to use those powers. If we are
anything other than a totally supine House of Commons, we should be
crying from the rooftops that this is wrong and that it is a
constitutional
outrage.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000252">&#160;</a>

to go to the Secretary of State to explain that somebody is getting in

government to get on with doing what it needs to do without the
rigmarole of a Bill going through Parliament. So this is freeing up
local government. Having central Government decide what it is going to
be before local government has told central Government what it needs
them to do seems to be getting it the wrong way round and possibly goes
back to the top-down control that the Labour party has always

minds on this, but, having listened to the comments, I am now into my
third, and possibly my fourth, phase. I was originally concerned about
this, but my localism gene kicked in with subsections (1) and (2). I
found it attractive if the purpose is to fast-track the removal of
barriers to a localist agenda where a local authority wants to do
something but cannot because something stands in its way. I then began
to think about things, particularly where there is an elected
mayor—with power residing in one person—who approaches a
friendly Secretary of State to remove some legislation, such as
employment legislation or health and safety legislation, that could
have ramifications beyond that local authority. So the powers given to
the Secretary of State by subsections (1) and (2) need to be
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000260">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Ministers are asking us to believe that these powers would only ever be
used benignly. The thrust of the argument is that these are benign
powers that allow the Secretary of State to always be helpful. We need
to agree legislation that is always safe, whoever the Secretary of
State might be in the future. That is why such great concern has been
expressed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South
did in her contribution, by the many people who gave evidence to us.
Those were people who are active in local affairs. The biggest irony to
me is that if we drive these clauses forward without amending them,
what we are saying is, “We have heard the voices of concern from
you local people, you people who crack on with the job day in, day out,
as the hon. Member for Bradford East has done over many years. We hear
your voices of concern, but you know what? You’re wrong. You do
not need to worry—these will only ever be used in a benign way,
because we know best. The centre knows best how to empower
you.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
will the greatest irony of the lot, if we start from a point of
patronising arrogance and telling local people not to worry about their
fears, because it will only ever be benign, to trust us and to not take
on board their thorough and very real concerns, which give heart and
evidence to the clear concerns outlined by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. If we get that wrong right at the
start, we will be doing exactly what Professor Jones and Professor
Stewart said: creating a centralist Bill, not a localist
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
goes to the very heart of whether we are genuine about our localism. If
we are genuine, we have to listen to what the local voices on the
ground have told us. We have to listen and engage with those voices,
not just brush them aside and say, “There, there, it will be all
right, we are only ever going to be benign.” We have to engage
and build trust with local people. That is the biggest challenge at the
hub of the Bill, and I hope that the Government will respond to the
challenge in an engaged and proper
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000264">&#160;</a>

just want to say a few words on this group of amendments. Although they
are grouped together because they relate to the same clause, it seems
to me that amendments 27 and 28 point in a different direction to
amendment 29. The first two seek to amend the Bill in a way that makes
it less radical. We heard a lot from the hon. Member for Worsley and
Eccles South about how the Bill was not radical enough, how many limits
were prescribed over the general power of competence that the Bill
provides to local authorities. As a number of my hon. Friends have
tried to say in interventions, if the Secretary of State thinks there
is a provision in place or one that will be introduced in future
legislation, which prevents or restricts local authorities from
exercising the general power of competence, these clauses make 
it easier for the Secretary of State to do something about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000265">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 27
and 28 would make the Bill less radical and make it harder for a future
Government to give local authorities full reign in terms of the general
power of competence. Amendment 29 would delete subsection (6) and (7),
which are both relevant to how subsections (1) and (2) would be
exercised. Subsection (6) is sensible, because it gives the
Secretary of State the power to disapply a particular provision on a
temporary basis for a particular period of time. Taking on board the
point made by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, one can
imagine a situation where there was some concern about whether it was
right to revoke a particular provision. Under subsection (6), the
Secretary of State has the power to do that temporarily, so that we
could see how the provision worked in practice. I strongly oppose
amendments 27 and 28, because they make the Bill less radical and, in
tone, they go completely against the points that Opposition Members
have been making on clause 1.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
29 would make the Bill more radical, because it removes the power of
the Secretary of State to constrain the general power of competence.
Personally—I speak as someone who served as a councillor for
12 years in my home town—I can see a case for the
Secretary of State to have the general power of competence under
certain circumstances. We can all envisage that local authorities may
use that power in a way that we cannot foresee but that all hon.
Members would deem inappropriate. The Government may wish to take quick
action to deal with such an event, so I can see the case for such a
power. Having said that, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich makes the fair point that this is a catch-all clause that
gives a wide power to the Secretary of State. I hope that when the
Minister responds to that point, the Committee will receive some
reassurance about the way the Government will use the measures in the
clause. For me, such powers should be used only as a last
resort.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000267">&#160;</a>

amendment. The difference between the Labour party and the Government
lies in how much trust or confidence we have in the Secretary of State
to exercise powers—I hope it is clear that our trust is not very
substantial. It is also about whether we have confidence in
consultation. However, consultation can just be ignored—it
frequently is. Next Wednesday in the local government finance
settlement, we will see how much notice the Secretary of State has
taken of his consultations with local governments. We will look at
whether anything has been done about front-loading or to make the
context easier, and that will inform the debate in Committee. This is
about confidence in consultation, but at this point my confidence is
not very high. However, I remain to be convinced and if the local
government finance settlement changes next week, perhaps we will see
that the Secretary of State has been listening.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000268">&#160;</a>

me return to my earlier point. I recommend hon. Members who are

Committees on codifying the relationship between central and local
government. Our difficulties were caused because we tried to act
through a concordat, and it is recognised and
accepted—particularly

what I said earlier and the question of my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield South East (Mr Betts): what are the rights of local
government within a parliamentary democracy where Parliament is
sovereign? That is what we are tussling with. The Labour party has one
view of how that should work. That view depends on whether we have
confidence in Ministers and the Secretary of State, and we do not.
Government Members have confidence in consultation, although I do not.
Codifying that relationship is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000270">&#160;</a>

Government side who are working on this issue, who are trying to set
out the rights of local government within a parliamentary system. As I
understand, the idea is to build on the European charter of local
self-government, and to suggest a Joint Committee—like the Joint
Committee on Human Rights; a Joint Committee of the Commons and the
Lords—that will look at legislation as it goes through and see
what the impact will be on local government.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000271">&#160;</a>

Government Members think that laying an order and debating a statutory
instrument represents parliamentary scrutiny, they will soon come to
see that it does not. They will not be encouraged to speak by their own

                           </strong> The first thing that springs to mind is that one
person’s barrier is another’s protection. I know that
this Government do not like health and safety, but the legislation
contains an awful lot of protections. The Minister has not said which
four authorities are involved; he might like to inform the Committee.
If those councils specify barriers that constitute important
protections to other people, will he meet their request to bust those
barriers or say, “No, we can’t do
that”?<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000276">&#160;</a>

has delivered my argument for me. Let us suppose that one of those

regulations. That has not happened, but let us suppose that it did.
Would she not want a moderator to exist so that the authority could not
simply say, “From now on, health and safety rules are over in
the London borough of Sutton”, or in Liverpool? There must be a
moderating mechanism, and subsections (1) and (2) provide it and put it
in the hands of the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000278">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> At the end of the paragraph. The difference is
that there will be some occasions when moving a barrier does require
primary legislation. In such cases, such as the abolition of a health
and safety rule, that will be a matter for statute, and it is right
that the House should go through a formal procedure. However, many
barriers that the authorities are drawing to our attention are
administrative and are posed by the interpretation of regulations. In
such cases, clarification by the Secretary of State is appropriate, and
it would be tremendously heavy-handed for that to require primary
legislation, with all the associated delay and consequences. If we must
return to primary legislation every time we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 207<a class="bkMark" name="Column207">&#160;</a>
                           </div>want to do any barrier-busting that goes beyond the purely
cosmetic—changing regulations or eligibility criteria, for
instance—barrier-busting will become a joke. It will become
treacle-walking, and it will not deliver what we want to achieve. It
would be a grave mistake for the Committee to eliminate clause 5(1) and
(2).<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That brings
us to what should be the mechanism for moderating and breaking down the
barriers. Should it be a decision that is taken solely by the Secretary
of State? No, it should not be. Clause 6 sets out the procedure, which
is that the Secretary of State is the safeguard against arbitrary
action by a local authority in exercising its barrier-busting. Clause 6
is the safeguard against the Secretary of State taking arbitrary action
in barrier-busting. That requires the issue to be brought to the House
and there is a consultation process in relation to that. Of course, if
there is a belief in the House that the Secretary of State has
mishandled or not undertaken the consultation, they can be challenged
at that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is perhaps
worth saying that the power is drafted in almost identical terms as
those of the one relating to well-being. The Secretary of
State’s capacity—the reserved power—to intervene
is not something that will be used lightly. It is equivalent to the
power that was attached to the well-being power. The interesting thing
is that despite there being a variety of Secretary of States since that
measure was introduced, no Secretary of State has intervened and used
that power so far. This is not a power that will be particularly
attractive or likely to be open to abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bradford East makes a good point, because let us
suppose that a mayor comes forward with what he and I might judge to be
a barmy idea and the Secretary of State, on a whim, approves it. The
proposal would come to the House—in a room like this—and
there would be the opportunity for Members to challenge that barmy
idea, if it had somehow got
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us consider the alternative case, because that is also built into
clause 5. Let us suppose that the mayor comes up with an idea that is
so barmy that the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend both think he
should be stopped. In a way we have not yet imagined, that idea might
breach common sense, propriety and so on. Surely it is right that
Parliament, via the Secretary of State, has the capacity to say,
“Actually, you’ve just found something that we realise we
don’t want.” It would be right for the Secretary of State
to bring that to the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
kind of things might that be? I have imagined an entirely hypothetical
situation but local authorities started experimenting a few years ago
with various financial measures, as a consequence of which some of them
got into hot water. There has to be a reserve power so that if
something is clearly going horribly wrong, something can be done about
it. That is what clauses 5 and 6 are
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Scunthorpe said that the measure is fine if there is a
benign Secretary of State. This is the safeguard mechanism in respect
of totally inappropriate behaviour by local authorities; the safeguard
in the case of totally inappropriate behaviour by the
referee—the Secretary of State—is the fact that the
matter comes before Parliament. We are certainly not dismissing the
voices of concern but, just as we have been encouraged to think about
what happens if things go wrong, the voices of concern need to be
challenged with the arguments

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South is absolutely right in what
she identified as being at the heart of the problem: what level of
trust can we presume of the system? How far can central Government and
Parliament trust absolutely everything local authorities do; how far
can any of us trust what a future Secretary of State might do; and how
far ultimately can we trust Parliament to get it right anyway if one
party has a majority? Trust is an important
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000291">&#160;</a>

the negative side, we have a power that will be used rarely and in
exceptional circumstances but, on the positive side, we have a power
that we hope will be used frequently to break down barriers. I can say
in all honesty to the Committee that we have a mechanism that
safeguards civic society from the predations of a local authority that
is out of control, that safeguards it from a Secretary of State going
native, and that provides the right level of opportunity for Parliament
to intervene in the process, if it is not content. If we are going to
bust any barriers, going through primary legislation really is not the
way to do

hearing a clearer statement of intention than the one we received from
the Minister about the Government’s intentions in respect of
subsection (3). The inference of the Minister’s speech was that
this provision would be used only in extreme circumstances when a local
authority was behaving in a wholly irrational and unacceptable way.
Before we agree to the clause, we should have a clear indication from
the Government that they have no intentions at the current time of
making any provisions under subsection (3). Secondly, we deserve from
them

we come on to clause 6, we will, I think, be probing the Government
about the different procedures for consultation that apply to
provisions in clause 5. Clause 6(1) sets out certain provisions that
will apply in the case of clause 5(1), but does not apparently extend
to others. It will be useful to hear why the Government have
differential procedures for consultation. Given the draconian nature of
the provisions of clause 5(3), it would be helpful
to know what safeguards they regard as appropriate both in terms of
local government and of this House before they bring forward any order
giving effect to the powers in that subsection, so I hope that the

                           </strong> Serious concerns were expressed during our
evidence sessions about the proposals for the Secretary of

                        <p class="tabbed">The Equality
and Human Rights Commission is concerned that as the private sector or
community bodies take on public service provision, there is a risk that
those services might not be subject to the fundamental protections
contained in the Human Rights Act 1998 or the new public sector
equality duty under the Equality Act 2010. Obviously we can return to
that question when the Committee considers part 4 of the Bill, but at
the moment we are discussing the overlap between the provisions in
clause 5. This is an appropriate point to ask the Minister to reassure
the Committee about the protections that will be in place if non-public
bodies start providing local services, because, clearly, that is the
intention behind the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000333">&#160;</a>

organisations involved in social care, including Aid UK, the Royal
National Institute for the Blind, the National Autistic Society, Sense,
Scope and Mencap also has concerns. The group reminds us that there are
statutory requirements on local authorities to assess the needs of
people asking for social care support, to have due regard to public
equality duties, and to safeguard vulnerable adults. Those six
organisations are concerned that the power granted to the Secretary of
State is subject to less parliamentary constraint, so we have a
difference of opinion. We think that there should be more parliamentary
constraint on the exercise of those powers, as do those six
organisations. Will the Minister further reassure me, members of the
Committee and those six important service-providing
organisations?<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000334">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that I can give the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich the assurances that he was seeking. The power
for the Secretary of State to remove restrictions involves rigorous
procedure, including scrutiny by the House and consultation. It will be
for Parliament and not the Secretary of State to decide which
procedure—super-affirmative, affirmative or
negative—should apply to any order proposed under the power. We
certainly do not have anything in mind in the near future that would
bring this abruptly into use. I hope he will see that we have no
intention of exploiting this—as he might see it—at the
drop of a
hat.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000335">&#160;</a>

bodies delivering public services—we might have mutuals,
co-operatives, the voluntary sector or the private sector. As I am sure
we will discuss later in our proceedings, any duty that applies to the
provision of public services will apply whoever the provider is. The
duty is transferred with the function. Nobody gets out of conforming
with statutory requirements on delivery simply by changing their
status. I saw the concerns expressed by the charities and
non-governmental organisations that the hon. Lady named, and I want to

Equality and Human Rights Commission. It is not a small forum or body,
so if it is concerned, it behoves the Minister to do more than he has

saying, “Trust me. It’s going to be okay.” I do

equality duty. The Minister should remember that the public sector
equality duty comes from the Equality Act 2010 and is brought into
force only this year. Public service providers are only just
understanding what the duties are. In view of the changes the Bill

new organisation or the private sector—we need a little more

okay,” if we are to be reassured.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000338">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is asking for reassurance, and I
want to assure her that I intend that she has it. I am sure she will
let me know if I have failed.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000339">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The equality
duty will pass to the service providers. The private sector already
provides lots of public services. There is plenty of evidence that it
is capable of retaining its human rights and equality duties, and, in
many cases, flourishing while delivering them. I assure the hon. Lady
that what is in the Bill is intended to provide— and does
provide—those safeguards.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000340">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister gave me an assurance that the
Government do not intend to bring forward provisions under subsection
(3). Clause 6(1) refers to the Secretary of State doing
something<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>Will he clarify that
that is entirely compatible with what he has just said? It might imply
that the Secretary of State intends to move very quickly. This is
complicated but, as I read the Bill, that might not cover clause 5(3).
In that case, my earlier point about the rather different consultation
requirements, which I find confusing, might be his get out, but I would
welcome
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="11020139000342">&#160;</a>
