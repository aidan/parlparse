<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000253"></a>The
Chair:</b> Good morning everybody. I am delighted to see an
army of volunteers here today to participate in consideration of the
Bill. This is the first time I have had the privilege of chairing a
Committee on a private Member&#146;s Bill, so it is a novel
experience for me. Before we start, I wish to make a couple of
announcements. If people wish, they can remove their jackets, and if
they have mobile phones or pagers, I should be grateful if they ensured
that they do not disturb our
proceedings.</div><a name="10030974000014"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I beg to
move amendment 1, in clause 1, page 1, line 20, leave out
&#147;identify&#148; and insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#147;have identified by the date that this Act
comes into
force&#148;.</div><a name="10030974000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Chope. This is the first time I have served on a Committee considering
a private Member&#146;s Bill, but&#151;notwithstanding that it is a
new experience for you&#151;I am sure you will guide me as
necessary.</div><a name="10030974000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to a specific aspect of the meaning of
&#147;qualifying debt&#148; under the clause. I shall make broader
remarks about the definition in our stand part debate and set out
briefly what I hope to achieve during this morning&#146;s
proceedings. The amendment is narrow. It relates to which countries
fall within the definition of qualifying debt. Essentially, the regime
focuses on heavily indebted poor countries falling within the HIPC
initiative, but it is also extended to include potentially eligible
initiative countries. I tabled the amendment to obtain clarification of
the provision. Under subsection
(6),</div><a name="10030974000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Potentially
eligible Initiative country&#148; means a country
&#151;</div><a name="10030974000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
&#147;that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank identify as
potentially eligible for debt relief under the Initiative,
and</div><a name="10030974000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
in respect of which decision point has not been
reached.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was not entirely clear when reading the provision whether it included
simply those potentially eligible initiative countries identified at
that point, or
subsequently.</div><a name="10030974000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000255"></a><b class="B">Sir
Gerald Kaufman</b> (Manchester, Gorton) (Lab): I am sure the
hon. Gentleman is speaking to the amendment with the most constructive
of intentions. If it were accepted, would enactment of the Bill be a
cut-off point for such identification?</div>
<a name="10030974000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000256"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am seeking to clarify whether the Bill already
does what the right hon. Gentleman suggests. If I develop my point,
perhaps I can also deal with his intervention more fully. The
words</div><a name="10030974000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;potentially
eligible for debt relief under the
initiative&#148;</div><a name="10030974000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">suggests
that it is not a cut-off point, although I note that the explanatory
notes to the Bill refer
to</div><a name="10030974000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;countries
that have been identified&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="10030974000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">which suggests that it
is a cut-off point. They go on to
state:</div><a name="10030974000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Five
countries currently fall into this
country.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
word &#147;currently&#148; suggests that the position could change,
and that it is not a cut-off point. It is fair to raise such an issue
because the general thinking behind the Bill and the clause is to
ensure that it is retrospective. There are good reasons for that, which
we shall debate in a moment or so. The intention is to say,
&#147;Here are particular debts that will, at the date of
commencement, fall within the regime set out in the Bill and to which
the debt reduction mechanisms will apply.&#148;</div>
<a name="10030974000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(11) states:</div>
<a name="10030974000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the terms of the Initiative are amended after commencement in such a
way as to change a relevant eligibility condition, this Act has effect
as if they had not been so
amended.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention is largely to say, &#147;This is where we are now; this has
happened in the past; these particular loans are
effectors&#148;.</div>
<a name="10030974000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
considerable attempt to provide certainty regarding where the Bill
actually applies. It could be understood to mean that&#151;in the
case of subsequent changes of facts in a given area, such as a country
becoming potentially eligible&#151;debts not currently affected by
the Bill would become so affected. That may be an incorrect way of
interpreting it, but my intention in tabling the amendment is to seek
clarity on that point.</div>
<a name="10030974000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000257"></a><b class="B">Michael
Connarty</b> (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab): I agree with
my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton, in that I am
sure the amendment is well intentioned, but in fact the subsection
refers to a &#147;potentially eligible Initiative country&#148;,
not debt. I have just read a book about someone who followed in the
footsteps of David Livingstone across the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. At one time it had 11,000 kilometres of motorway, and
now it has 1,100 kilometres of passable roads. So a country that at the
moment seems quite secure after the ravages of war could end up, like
the DRC, unable to pay back the debts it currently has. Given that the
provision focuses on the &#147;country&#148;, to say that nothing
could be considered for the country in question in future would be
entirely wrong.</div>
<a name="10030974000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000258"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I take that point and I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for acknowledging that the amendment is well intentioned, as
was his intervention. I do not want to get into one of the broader
debates just yet. However, one of the issues that the Treasury&#146;s
consultation paper has tried to wrestle with&#151;and which the
Government and the hon. Member for Northampton, North acknowledged in
her thoughtful speeches on Second Reading&#151;is that we do not want
to pursue a policy that means that the costs and interest rates that
developing countries will have to pay will go up because of a risk
premium. There is a carefully calibrated argument to address that
issue. The Government&#146;s consultation paper and the Bill have
addressed it by providing some certainty, essentially looking backwards
and saying, &#147;These particular debts are covered.&#148; I do
not want to labour this point&#151;I want to let the hon. Lady
proceed&#151;my purpose is simply to provide some certainty on what
the thinking is and what the wording means.</div>
<a name="10030974000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000259"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): For very good constituency
reasons, some of us were not present at the debate on Second Reading.
It would help the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>if we had an understanding&#151;or if my hon. Friend gave us an
understanding&#151;of what the casus belli are today. What are the
differences, if any, between my hon. Friend and the supporters of the
Bill? What are the outstanding issues that he thinks we need to press?
Otherwise, it is a bit of a secret garden, consisting of Treasury
nerds, that some of us might like to feel we could take part
in.</div>
<a name="10030974000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000260"></a><b class="B">Peter
Bottomley</b> (Worthing, West) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Chope. Is the word &#147;nerd&#148; an acceptable
parliamentary expression?</div>
<a name="10030974000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000261"></a>The
Chair:</b> It is an acceptable parliamentary expression. As
far as this intervention is concerned, may I remind the Committee that
we are considering a very narrow amendment? During the intermission,
perhaps the hon. Member for Banbury might like to look at the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> report of Second Reading to bring himself up to
date.</div>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000262"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
Banbury for that intervention. I will not try your patience,
Mr. Chope. As I said earlier, I wanted to deal with the
questions that arise from this provision, but perhaps it would be more
appropriate to do so in the stand part
debate.</div>
<a name="10030974000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000263"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Is not the issue simply that
one sets aside contracts at one&#146;s peril, and that it is
important that, although there is the real-world issue of the burden of
debt, which needs to be relieved&#151;everyone in the Committee wants
to address that; indeed, it is why we are here&#151;it needs to be
done in a precisely defined way that is not likely to give rise to
trouble or to compensating commercial premiums in the
future?</div><a name="10030974000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000264"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who sets out the
issue very well. There is no casus belli. I hope we will be able to
work constructively, as we did on Second Reading, and proceed with the
Bill in that
spirit.</div><a name="10030974000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention, as my hon. Friend points out, is to ensure that the Bill is
appropriately calibrated so that it will address the legitimate
concerns of developing countries and assist them. There is no sympathy
in the Committee for vulture funds&#151;the intention is to help
developing countries. However, in doing so, we must be careful and not
make developing countries pay a risk premium on borrowing in the
future, which will have a detrimental effect. That is a concern that we
all recognise, which is why we want to calibrate the measures
appropriately, and hence my entering now into some of the arguments I
was going to raise in the stand part
debate.</div><a name="10030974000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 is a probing amendment. The general approach in the Bill is to look
back and enable us to identify a narrowly defined set of debts to which
the Bill will apply, but there appears to be an exception. One reading
of the Bill suggests that a country could become eligible and at that
point, debts that were entered  into before the
legislation&#146;s commencement, but which  could not
currently be identified because we do not necessarily know which
countries will become eligible, would suddenly fall within that
jurisdiction. I am not sure that, in the great scheme of things, the
consequences of that would be particularly terrible, because we would
be talking about debts incurred in the past. However, the
clause&#146;s wording is not entirely clear, and if the hon. Lady
could provide some clarity, that would be of service to the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="10030974000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000265"></a><b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): I am sorry, but I
cannot agree with the amendment if it is pushed to a vote. The clause
is about identifying countries to which the Bill, which is effectively
a form of creditors&#146; voluntary arrangement whereby everyone will
get the same poundage, will apply. More complex issues that relate to
how enforceable the Bill will be&#151;the issue is an international
one, and the Bill will only affect the UK&#146;s
jurisdiction&#151;are for later. Logically, if we are to
have  a creditors&#146; voluntary arrangement whereby
everyone  gets a poundage, all creditors should get the same
poundage. That should apply to all countries where  that
process occurs.</div>
<a name="10030974000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030974000266"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): It is a great
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. I know
that, given your interest in the Bill, all the issues will be aired and
debated. I welcome the amendment, which is important. This is an
historic Bill&#151;it is the first to deal with this issue, which is
a concern in a number of countries. We have an opportunity to get the
Bill through by the end of this Parliament. Given the time constraints,
it is important that the issues are aired and that people are clear
about the Bill&#146;s purpose.</div>
<a name="10030974000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has
to provide for the orderly management of debt. There is a need for
consistency and certainty, which is important for developing
countries&#146; economic management and the risk premium they might
face in the future. Therefore, having clarity on which countries are in
and which are out is
important.</div><a name="10030974000228"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="10030974000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle here is that the scheme as it was agreed by the World Bank is
what should apply. If the scheme varies at some date, this legislation
will not. The legislation is based on the 2004 ring-fencing of the HIPC
initiative, so there is no question of revisiting the matter and
including new countries, to a point&#151;I will explain that more
fully. Repeated assurances have been given, and the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire knows, that the measure applies not to future,
but to historic, debt. That is because the HIPC process manages the
debts of heavily indebted poor countries, so that they can start with a
clean sheet and manage their economies in the future. If they take on
further debt, they can  do so on reasonable terms, and not be
subject to the vagaries of misfortune to which they have been in
the
past.</div><a name="10030974000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two issues on the potentially eligible countries about which I
think the hon. Gentleman is concerned, and which need some
clarification. The HIPC initiative was ring-fenced in 2004, and if
circumstances change after that it is a whole different ball game.
There are some countries that might have been completely closed but
might have been eligible for the HIPC initiative at the 2004 point,
based on information that has come to light. The example that springs
most to mind is Afghanistan, which, on the 2004 figures, qualified for
the initiative. I imagine that Zimbabwe is the only country anyone can
think of that is currently a closed society in which information is not
known, that might be included on 2004 data. I suspect that if there was
a big debate here about finding a proper way to manage
Zimbabwe&#146;s historic debts, people would accept that if we looked
at the 2004 data and it applied, the country would go into a set
process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="10030974000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only other
possible circumstance would be a country that currently does not exist
but for which there is data, and it is clear that on the 2004 data it
would have qualified. Perhaps the only such country that one can think
of is southern Sudan, and people would accept that, given the
circumstances&#151;depending on what happens, as there will be a
referendum there&#151;that might also be appropriate. It is not a
matter of saying, however, that we will have a 2008 or 2009 cut-off
point. The data that are used to determine whether a country is a HIPC
were ring-fenced in 2004 and are therefore not open to variation. That
provides a consistent and coherent way of dealing with the debts of a
closed list of 45 countries, as set out in the explanatory
notes.</div>
<a name="10030974000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
pre-decision point countries are well known: Comoros Islands, Eritrea,
Kyrgyz Republic, Somalia and Sudan. We have a defined list of
countries, historic debts and an agreed process, which has been
scrutinised nationally and internationally. All that therefore provides
the certainly that the hon. Gentleman seeks and the assurance that the
measure will not spread to any list of countries drawn up on any
criteria. The process is clearly defined, and that certainty will help
to ensure that the money markets see that it is consistent and not
whimsical. I hope that that also deals with the concerns about the risk
premiums, and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10030974000052"></a>

has clarified the intention behind the wording of subsection (6). I
accept that other countries, not currently on the list of eligibility
for the HIPC initiative, may be added, and she set out the very limited
circumstances in which that might happen. As I may have mentioned in my

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000268"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> May I suggest to the hon. Member for
Northampton, North, who is promoting the Bill, that she might want to
consider adding 2004 to the Bill at a later stage? The year appears
once, by chance, in clause 7. The issue raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West Hertfordshire might not be immediately obvious to
many people but, given that those involved in providing future loans
might have their attention drawn to the Bill, if and when it is
enacted, we ought to make it clear that there is a time limit to which
it can go back. That would be a little mark of safety, and it would be
helpful if it is possible to do that with a bit of imagination later in
the parliamentary
procedure.</div><a name="10030974000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000269"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="10030974000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 is at the heart of the Bill because it concerns the definition of a
qualifying debt. Getting the definition right is vital, a point that we
touched on in the last 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>debate. The hon. Member for Northampton, North was absolutely right to
make that point. Criticisms about the definition of qualifying debt
come from two directions. Some argue that the clause is too narrow and
that the focus is on HIPCs. Why should we not apply the Bill to
developing countries as a whole? Why should we not apply it to other
regimes in which debt reduction has been negotiated? Does the Bill go
far enough? No doubt at some point in the course of the morning we
shall debate the impacts of the Bill, including the benefits arising
for developing countries, which some will argue are unduly
modest.</div><a name="10030974000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
counter-argument, which was put in a number of responses to the
Treasury consultation and some of which was quoted on Second Reading,
is that if we interfere in contractual rights we run a risk of
undermining confidence in the sanctity of contracts. Lenders will
become wary of lending to developing countries&#151;perhaps HIPCs
specifically&#151;because of the risk of being caught up not so much
in the Bill as in future legislation using the Bill as a
precedent.</div><a name="10030974000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
ought to debate such matters intelligently, to ensure that we calibrate
the proposals correctly. I thank the hon. Member for Northampton, North
for how she has consistently conducted the debate, ensuring that we do
not fall into oversimplifying the matter and dismiss such concerns but
that we address them. I am sure that no one in Committee would in any
way want to jeopardise the long-term ability of developing countries to
borrow at affordable, sustainable and sensible levels. Consequently, I
shall ask the hon. Lady a number of questions and, in responding, she
can set out why those who are concerned about the Bill should be
reassured.</div><a name="10030974000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
why should the Bill be focused on heavily indebted poor countries and
on them alone? Why not include all creditors to developing countries?
Why is the focus on loans entered into before the commencement of the
Bill? Why is the Bill essentially retrospective legislation, applying
to contracts entered into in the past, but does not apply going
forward? We understand why, but it would be helpful to the Committee if
the hon. Lady could set that out. We have already touched on why
potentially eligible countries are included. If she is in a position to
provide some breakdown of the benefits, and whether they will apply to
countries falling within the existing HIPC initiative or those
potentially eligible for the initiative, that might be helpful. She has
already touched on the issue, to be fair, but perhaps she could add a
word or two about why subsections (11) and (12) mean that any
amendments to the initiative will not change the nature of the
Bill&#151;additional debt will not be liable to be treated as falling
under the Bill as a consequence of any
changes.</div><a name="10030974000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
I seek as much reassurance as possible from the hon. Lady that the Bill
is a one-off. I do not say that because of the concern about the
position of developing countries going away&#151;far from
it&#151;but the Treasury consultation response recognised that if we
focus on narrowly defined areas, if we look backwards at debt already
entered into and if we restrict the effect of the Bill to specific
countries, the more we provide reassurance that we shall not come back
in the future and produce another Bill, although well intentioned and
undoubtedly with support from some organisations outside this place,
that could have an impact on the attractiveness of lending to
developing countries. We all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>seek to achieve that balance, which is finely calibrated. We should use
the opportunity of the stand part debate to ensure that all sides
recognise that we must be
careful.</div><a name="10030974000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Comment
from the Minister, setting out his views, will also be welcome, so that
all sides recognise that we need to focus narrowly, to ensure that we
are serving the best interests of developing countries and not engaging
in gesture politics, which could do harm. The Bill is not about that,
but we need to put on record that we are thinking the issues through
and that we recognise the dangers that
exist.</div><a name="10030974000229"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10030974000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000270"></a>John
Hemming:</b> The essence of the Bill, as discussed earlier,
concerns a country being unable to pay its debts because its income is
too low. An individual would have some form of bankruptcy arrangement
and, effectively, we are dealing with countries in such a
position&#151;their exports are so low that they cannot
pay.</div><a name="10030974000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot get away from the fact that in future, lenders will take into
account countries&#146; ability to repay debt when loaning funds to
them. I think that that is a healthy situation. Having a situation
where lenders hold out massive quantities of money to developing
countries, some of which find their way into Swiss bank accounts and do
not do the country any good whatsoever, is not helpful for developing
countries. Within all that, there are factors&#151;for example, the
Bill will only affect UK jurisdiction, so debts enforceable in other
jurisdictions remain enforceable there anyway. It is an issue that
requires international rather than UK resolution.</div>
<a name="10030974000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a question about whether it is appropriate to have corporate entities
controlled by the Government included within the Bill, as opposed to
sovereign debt. The nature of sovereign debt is particularly different.
If one looks at the history of Haiti and how sovereign debt has caused
problems there over centuries, and the fact that most debt disappears
into people&#146;s estates when they die, one can see that that
particular type of debt hangs on. Again, we are interfering with
contracts&#151;there is no question about that. However, bankruptcy
arrangements interfere with contracts, so it is with
precedent.</div>
<a name="10030974000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000271"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a good point, and I
say that not only because I also made that point on Second Reading.
There is no equivalent of insolvency procedures for a country.
Interfering with contractual rights is something that, by and
large,  we do not believe in doing in this country. However, we
recognise that there are times when we have to do so in a case of
bankrupt individuals and insolvent companies. He is making a helpful
point; those are the narrow circumstances in which interfering with
contractual rights can be
accepted.</div><a name="10030974000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000272"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
We are in agreement&#151;we are effectively dealing with the
insolvency of countries, which do not have the revenue. If there is
insolvency of countries, we are asking whether the poundage applies to
everyone. That is a fair process to resolve a situation. If a country
in that situation decides, in the interest of its long-term credit
rating, to put particular effort into paying someone, that will be a
different issue. However, that is an issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>for the countries themselves. The responsibility is always with lenders
to consider the ability of the people to whom they are lending funds to
pay them back. There have been many problems with people doling out
money without considering whether people can pay it back. We see that
in the banking crisis that we have had ourselves. To that extent, I am
supportive of the Bill, and I should congratulate the hon. Member for
Northampton, North on promoting
it.</div><a name="10030974000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000273"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I, too, am delighted to serve under your
chairmanship this morning, Mr. Chope. I welcome and applaud
the pioneering work of my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North
over an extended period, recently supported by my hon. Friend the
Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew
Gwynne).</div><a name="10030974000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also agree with much of what the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire said in his remarks. The Government agree that the Bill
should mirror the internationally agreed HIPC initiative, as the clause
specifies. The aim is to ensure that all creditors provide debt relief
in line with the initiative, as the vast majority of creditors are
already doing. I welcome the clarification of the scope and the
illumination that has come from the debate on the amendment, which we
had a few minutes
ago.</div><a name="10030974000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also agree that the Bill should not apply to debts taken on after its
commencement, as we do not want to deter new lending to countries.
Therefore, it is right to exclude new lending. However, I very much
support the clause and hope that we can agree to
it.</div><a name="10030974000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000274"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I will pick up the points that the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire made and give some assurances to the hon.
Member for Worthing, West. There is a criticism that the Bill is too
narrow. Indeed, my original Bill went wider, but that was a different
Bill for different purposes. To be honest, if we start to cast the net
more widely, we will have problems of definition, and then we will get
into issues of uncertainty for countries that might be looking to raise
loans, and potential sources of finance might say, &#147;Is it going
down or up? Might it bump into or bump out of the provisions?&#148;
In addition, there has not been international discussion about how
countries might be treated, and therefore the uncertainty that the hon.
Gentleman wants to avoid would be created if we cast the net more
widely. As I said, in my previous Bill, we considered different
definitions and there were problems with
them.</div><a name="10030974000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
important matter is that the Bill has two logics to it. One is about
justice for developing countries; the other is about justice for
British taxpayers, which gets overlooked a bit. One of the big
arguments about this, and why I was interested in including HIPC
countries in my original legislation, is that there is a logic that
says, &#147;Why should British taxpayers pay money to write off debts
for developing countries when private, completely uncontrolled vulture
funds can swoop in and cream off some of the money?&#148; Therefore,
it is about different types of debt being treated equitably but also
about protecting British taxpayers&#146; interest. The HIPC countries
have benefited from UK taxpayers&#146; funds, so there is a need to
ensure that different types of debts are treated equally. That second
logic is often overlooked in some of the discussions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="10030974000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the issue of moral hazard, about which the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire is right. It has come more to the fore because of the
credit crunch and the banking crisis. The moral hazard of letting
people off their debts is why it is so important that the legislation
is carefully defined with safeguards so that we cannot suddenly extend
the list of countries and extend the debt to others. My right hon.
Friend the Financial Secretary has set out why new debts are not
included. If we look at the other part of the HIPC initiative, the debt
write-offs and the protection against profiteering by vulture funds and
others have a quid pro quo, which is that developing countries have to
engage in the programmes that are required as part of the HIPC process.
That also gives some protection against what otherwise might be seen as
the moral hazard of the excuse of private
debt.</div>
<a name="10030974000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
properly targeted, because it deals with the worst cases of indebted
countries, it deals with the protection of British taxpayers&#146;
interests, and it has safeguards against the moral hazard of excuse
from debt, which the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
identified. I hate to say it, but it is a much better way forward than
my original Bill was. It will provide consistency and stability,
ensuring that those countries can demonstrate sound governance and that
the international process has been fair, sound and consistent. As my
right hon. Friend said, if those countries need to take on debts, the
international markets will be well disposed towards
them.</div><a name="10030974000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="10030974000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000275"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Chope? Without wanting to reopen the
issues that have been amply rehearsed on clause 1, I too wish to echo
my overall support for what is being achieved here. We have a balance
not only in terms of the equity of the existing loans but the needs of
the developing world, which are real. Even though we do not want to
express it, we all probably feel a certain degree of distaste at having
to go through the nitty-gritty of working out the balance of assets and
liabilities, and I do not intend to add to that process. It occurred to
me that my remarks might be interpreted as an attempt to qualify as the
authentic Treasury nerd or, as I would prefer to call it, the anorak on
the matter, but I have to admit that this particular anorak has not
done his homework as well as he might have. If he had, he would have
tabled an amendment, but as we are now on clause 2, looking at further
definitions, I just want to probe the interaction of a
couple of points relating  to subsections (9) and (10). That is
as near as one gets to scheduling
it.</div><a name="10030974000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to pause on two words. The first is &#147;external&#148;. In
subsection (10) it is clear enough to me that there is a presumption
that a debt is an external one, unless someone proves the contrary,
which is an interesting way of looking at it. I appreciate that UK
rather than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>international jurisdiction is involved, but I particularly want to
rehearse the case of a country listed in the table in the explanatory
notes having a currency other than its own, or using another
country&#146;s currency. That might define whether the debt is
external. For example, although I have not visited the country, I think
that Liberia uses the US dollar. I do not know whether that creates
confusion&#151;if it is the domestic currency it is also the external
currency.</div><a name="10030974000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is on creditors. I may have misunderstood this, as I claim
to be no expert and certainly no advocate of vulture funds, but
regarding the interaction of subsections (9) and (10),
subsection (9) talks about &#147;the creditor&#148; as
if there were only one within a particular line of debt. Presumably
some of the debt is factored around, and may be owned by a number of
creditors who may or may not be resident in the particular country,
quite apart from the fact that the currency may or may not be a
currency that goes from outside that country to another country. I am
concerned to probe whether, if there are different categories of
creditor, some of whom are clearly resident in the country and others
of whom may not be, that affects the treatment of the overall debt, or
means that individual debts would be treated differently, depending on
whether the holder of the tranche of the debt was in one country or
another.</div><a name="10030974000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that there are answers to those questions. Equally, I am sure
that there need to be answers, because the trouble with all this, in
trying to do something that is a real-world improvement, is that, when
we get down to the difficult words in the small print, we might end up
with unintended consequences or inequities that we would not wish to
defend. I hope that the hon. Lady can satisfactorily explain that, or
reflect on it. The last thing I want to do is distract the Committee
from the important and substantial task of taking the Bill
forward.</div><a name="10030974000084"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000276"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> May I ask the Committee to pay attention to
subsection (10)? Are the words on line
16&#151;&#147;treat the debt&#148;&#151;the best ones? Might it
be considered at some stage whether they might change? They are
admirably clear in English and that is good, but I wonder whether it is
better to say &#147;the debt is to be treated as external
unless&#148; after &#147;qualifying debt,&#148; on line 15. I
leave that as a reflection. Perhaps the current wording is fine, but it
can perhaps be
improved.</div><a name="10030974000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue here is in line 16. It
says:</div><a name="10030974000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
in any proceedings there is an issue as to whether a debt is a
qualifying
debt&#148;,</div><a name="10030974000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
goes on to talk about how the debt is to be treated as external. Might
it be worth adding something on the question of externality? There may
be other reasons for questioning whether a debt is a qualifying debt
other than just that it is external, as we see from earlier in the
clause.</div><a name="10030974000230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000277"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is fair to say that clause 2, which defines the
debts to which the HIPC initiative will apply, is based on the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund definitions. Clause 2(3)(a) states
that the definition of debt
excludes</div><a name="10030974000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
liability to pay for goods or services that arose on the delivery of
the goods or the provision of services&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div><a name="10030974000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a significant
carve-out. I can see why it has been made, but does the hon. Lady have
any evidence&#151;it might be unfair to spring this question on
her&#151;relating to the scale of the carve-out? A substantial amount
of debt that would otherwise fall within the regime might not do so
because of that exclusion. Why has that carve-out been made? As I have
said, it is probably based on the World Bank and IMF definitions, but
it would be helpful if the hon. Lady could shed further light on the
issue.</div><a name="10030974000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000278"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Clause 2 deals with some of the details of what
is, and is not, a debt. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, a great
deal of discussion has taken place, and much experience has been built
up, with both the World Bank and the IMF. On the point made by the hon.
Member for Daventry, the definition of residence is not based on
currency, but on the residency of the creditor. It is quite common for
debts to be incurred in different currencies from that of the country
concerned. I do not, therefore, think that that is an issue. To offer
complete clarification, however, the definition mirrors the IMF
definitions and is not based on
currency.</div><a name="10030974000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
subsection (10), I understand that the Government have consulted the
IMF and that they have been able to apply the residence test without
difficulty. They are clear about what is, and is not, an external debt.
The subsection clearly sets out what should happen if there is any
doubt. On the final point about the exclusion of revenue spending, the
carve-out of the liability to pay for goods and services in subsection
(3) mirrors the IMF initiative, which also makes those exclusions. They
seem eminently practical, because if we included liability to pay for
goods and services, almost all Government spending would apply to the
kind of relief involved, and that would clearly be unworkable. The
approach in the legislation is not about inventing new procedures, but
about using tried and tested mechanisms that have been subject to
scrutiny and international negotiation to deal with the issues
connected to the remainder of the private sector
debt.</div><a name="10030974000209"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000279"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I hope that the hon. Lady will consider the
point that I made on subsection (10). As for the issues raised about
debts and subsection (3), under subsection (4)(a), a short-term debt is
included in this subsection if it ought to have been
discharged</div><a name="10030974000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;more
than a year before
commencement&#148;.</div><a name="10030974000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
that mean commencement when the Bill becomes an Act or is it some other
commencement? It cannot be the commencement of the loan because that
would mean repaying it before it was made, so presumably it is the
commencement of the
Act.</div><a name="10030974000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000280"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I am being told that that is the case. That is
correct. I am sorry for not responding earlier; I thought that I had

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000281"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The first two clauses are about definitions. Clause
3(1) specifies the mechanism that will apply to reduce the amount of
recoverable debt. The definition of the relevant proportion is covered
by clause 4. One worry about the Bill relates to article 1 of the
European convention on human rights. It may be argued that deprivation
of possessions are involved or at the very least the control of use of
possessions&#151;essentially, property rights are affected. We have
touched on the comparison with insolvency procedures and so on. As I
said, it is a fair point. However, there is an interesting assessment
of the European convention on human rights in the explanatory notes to
the Bill. Clearly, it is a matter to which those who drafted and
introduced the Bill have given some
consideration.</div><a name="10030974000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes set out the argument that the measure is not about
the deprivation of possessions, but the control of use, because the
creditor still has the ability to recover the debt if it is only able
to recover an element&#151;not all&#151;of it. That is therefore a
control of use rather than deprivation. I do not know whether the hon.
Lady can give the Committee further details on that. I do not in any
way pretend to be an expert in such matters, but it is clearly an
important part of the argument to say that the clause is not contrary
to article 1 of the first protocol of the convention. That must be a
strong
argument.</div><a name="10030974000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is retrospective, and we have discussed the reasons for that. The
explanatory notes state:</div>
<a name="10030974000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Retrospective
measures may in principle be compatible with A1P1, although the ECtHR
has referred to the need for an &#145;obvious and compelling public
interest&#146; for retrospective
measures&#148;.</div><a name="10030974000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no argument about the obvious and compelling public interest in the
Bill, although it would be helpful for future legal arguments for the
Bill to be given proper scrutiny so that matters can be debated more
fully.</div><a name="10030974000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the points made in response to the Bill and the Treasury
consultation is that the compelling public interest applies because the
measure will help developing countries. The argument made by some
respondents is that such is the narrowness of the Bill that the benefit
for developing countries&#151;the sums concerned&#151;is now so
small that the compelling nature of the public interest has
diminished.</div>
<a name="10030974000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful to explore that issue. EMTA&#151;the Emerging Markets Traders
Association&#151;has certainly argued that the only debt covered by
the Bill is that relating to Liberia, on which there was a judgment at
the end of last year, but that is about it. The Government&#146;s
impact assessment takes a different view, arguing that HIPCs and
potentially eligible HIPCs will benefit by about &#163;145 million in
total. We should at least consider the scale of benefit to developing
countries. Is it sufficient to say that there is an obvious and
compelling public interest in introducing the
Bill?</div><a name="10030974000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000282"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I have personal knowledge of substantial debts in
countries such as Sierra Leone. Much of the issue relates to the
question of the jurisdiction in which parties would bring proceedings.
A number of debts in Africa have the potential to result in proceedings
brought either in South Africa or in this country, so it is difficult
to quantify. However, I reassure my hon. Friend that there are
substantially more debts simply than those that have been identified in
Liberia.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000283"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
intervention, partly because he did not call me a Treasury nerd on this
occasion&#151;perhaps I am an aspirant Treasury
nerd.</div><a name="10030974000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not necessarily endorsing that interpretation but, given the narrow
definitions in the Bill, for reasons recognised in all parts of the
Committee, given that liability to pay for goods and services is not
dealt with, given that the Bill applies only to those debts that can be
enforced in the English courts and given that it is retrospective, as
well as the various other points we have debated, some criticism of the
Treasury&#146;s original assessment of the numbers involved is
noticeable. Those numbers were reduced from some &#163;250 million to
&#163;145
million.</div><a name="10030974000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
concern is that we cannot simply look at all the various claims,
because by definition they tend to be higher than the claimants and
creditors would ever achieve. The Committee might be a useful
opportunity to flag up the issue of the likely benefits of the Bill for
developing countries, so that we can state with confidence the obvious
and compelling public interest in such retrospective legislation. I
wish to stress that I am not arguing that there is no such interest,
but that the Committee is the right opportunity to address that
concern. When the Minister responds, would he set out the
Treasury&#146;s
thinking?</div><a name="10030974000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury acknowledges that quantifying the benefit in such an area is
difficult. What about the particular claim that the Bill would address
the Liberia matter alone and that nothing much else would apply? That
is an interesting point: if it can be refuted, great, but if particular
examples of debts that would fall within the regime can be provided, so
be it. Such examples would be helpful in answering any arguments made
against the Bill under article 1&#151;that there is not the obvious
and compelling public interest that the European Court of Human Rights
would seek in order to justify retrospective legislation. Subject to
those points, we have no particular difficulties with clause
3.</div><a name="10030974000231"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000284"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Perhaps I see things from a different
perspective. Let us say that we have an insolvent country that cannot
pay all its debts and we do not want any creditor to be preferred, and
let us assume for a moment that the Bill will have sufficient force and
that people will not jurisdiction-shop and go somewhere else to enforce
the debt. In principle, we are saying that insolvent countries cannot
pay all the debts. It is in the interest of all creditors to get paid
their poundage, and we are saying that that should be fair and no
creditor should be preferred. I do not see that as retrospective,
because that is current&#151;the current situation is that it cannot
pay its debts. Yes, that interferes with contracts, but not to the
extent that the contract is enforceable. Creditors can get their money
paid only because there is an agreement to have a poundage. I do not
see the difficulty.</div>
<a name="10030974000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000285"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. To be
fair, the word &#147;retrospective&#148; is used in the explanatory
notes. I do not think there is an argument that the provision is
explicitly designed to be retrospective &#151;for the reasons
we debated, and rightly so. I do not disagree with his point that the
situation is the equivalent of an insolvency
arrangement.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="10030974000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000286"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. I am looking
at page 9 and I accept that that is how the measure is perceived here,
whereas I see it as an insolvency procedure for a
country.</div><a name="10030974000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000287"></a>Michael
Connarty:</b> I respect entirely the probing nature of the
comments made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. This
issue is at the heart of the Bill and it is where the overarching
public interest is clearly focused. Jubilee Scotland, the Justice and
Peace Scotland movement and the Fairtrade movement all see the Bill as
a small but significant step. It is about fairness and being against
predatory behaviour in the market. It is against selfishness, and there
is all-party agreement on it. That is why, although the Bill is a small
step and there are some questions about its effect, I hope that in
future, it will be built on and not washed away, with people saying,
&#147;That is the job finished&#148;. The Bill is the beginning of
a rearrangement of what happens to countries when they fall into deep
debt and are exploited for predatory reasons.</div>
<a name="10030974000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will make a
sectarian party comment here. The latest person who declared herself
for the Conservative party in Scotland, a lady who runs the Scottish
fashion show, said that she wants to support the Conservative party
because she wants the UK to be more selfish. I intend to send her the
speech made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire on Second
Reading, because clearly, Governments over the period and of all ilks
realise that we are not about being selfish: the UK is about building
on a generous view of what we do when countries fall into deep
debt.</div><a name="10030974000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000288"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="10030974000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000289"></a>Michael
Connarty:</b> Not at the moment. I do not mind if the hon.
Gentleman wants to make comments, but I do not want to take too much
time.</div>
<a name="10030974000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire put the problem down to bad
management by Governments, but let us be frank: having talked to people
who are concerned about this issue, I have always felt that it is 200
years of exploitation by the developed world that has reduced most of
these countries to their level of indebtedness. We have exploited their
resources, and at one point stole their people to use them as slaves.
Let us not kid ourselves&#151;most of their indebtedness has arisen
because we have taken their wealth and given them nothing in return. We
are not just being generous; we are also dealing with our own
conscience.</div><a name="10030974000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000290"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In seeking to intervene on the hon. Gentleman I
was, if anything, about to reinforce his point. I, too, think that this
is in our long-term national interest. The existence of depressed, poor
countries that can find no relief from their long-term situation is not
a satisfactory state of affairs. I would not have risen to speak were
it not for the fact that I ought to declare an interest as a member of
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which, in a sense,
is the guardian of the European convention.</div>
<a name="10030974000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
couple of general and one or two specific remarks to make. I am no
lawyer, although, as it happens, I have a daughter who is a human
rights lawyer and takes an interest in the convention. I find the
European approach interesting. First&#151;we should get this point on
the record, and I say this as a Conservative&#151;we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>talking about not the convention but article 1 of the protocol to the
convention. Property rights are, in a sense, subordinate&#151;I am
not suggesting they would be in a judgment&#151;to other, perhaps
more serious issues such as murder, torture and the rights of prisoners
and of family life, which are convention rights. That may say something
about
hierarchy.</div><a name="10030974000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is that, looking at the European convention, which I do
quite often, I find it striking how it is understood that there are
clashes. There is no absolute way of resolving an issue according to
some principle, because there are clashes here between the rights of
predators and the laws of contract: the prudential virtues of the laws
of contract on the one hand; and, on the other, the situation in which
some developing countries find themselves. So it is not unfamiliar to
people in European jurisprudence to be saying, &#147;We have to try
to sort out these relative
pressures&#148;.</div><a name="10030974000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to commend the Treasury for once. One normally gets a peremptory
certificate from a Minister, but here we have a full explanatory
memorandum following consultation in which the issue is seriously
agonised about and explained in a way that I find very reassuring. We
come back to the point that there is an overriding public interest. It
is in our public interest, as well as that of developing countries, to
get this issue sorted out in a fair, orderly and equitable manner
between the various creditors, as the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley said. I am comfortable with that
approach.</div><a name="10030974000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two questions, the first of which concerns forums, and perhaps the
hon. Member for Northampton, North will come back to it. If my
constituency neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury, is
right, there are many potential debts that might come to our courts.
There is always the danger of forum shopping&#151;of people going
somewhere else if they think they will get a better deal. Can we have
an appraisal from the Bill&#146;s promoters as to whether that is
likely? If that happens, in a sense it will devalue the Bill and create
potentially awkward international
anomalies.</div><a name="10030974000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point may be contrary&#151;I am merely reflecting&#151;but I
would like the promoters&#146; response. Let us make a comparison
with the historic position of, say, Chinese Boxer debt or pre-Russian
revolution bonds. I hasten to say I do not own nice share certificates
or stock certificates, but if I happened to be the owner of some of
that ancient and completely useless sovereign debt, I would have two
choices&#151;or I might have had two choices if I were lucky. One is
to be paid off something by a country that wishes to re-establish its
credit rating and be able to service debts in future. If it says,
&#147;We&#146;ll give you something&#148;, I could assent to that
debt. On the other hand, if I decided to hold out, or liked the stock
certificate better, I could as an individual stay non-assented to that
debt and I would still have my full entitlement. According to the term
of art used in the explanatory memorandum for the right to sign for
debt, I would not have anything in my hands because it would not be
paid, but I could still in principle claim the whole lot and I could be
in either the assented or non-assented category. I wonder whether the
hon. Member for Northampton, North will reflect on that. If that
situation existed it would further untidy the position, in that I am
sure it would be better for the country in question to be able to know
exactly where it stood with all the creditors involved with
it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="10030974000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My basic view
is that we should be taking this on the chin as the right thing to do.
There are difficult, complex and detailed issues that need to be
thought about intensively to get the final outcome resolved, but I
would not in any sense wish them to devalue the need to get on with
things and seek a common haircut for all holders of debt. At the moment
in the real world, that debt cannot be serviced or discharged. It is
doing more damage than good to the international
economy.</div>

Bottomley:</b> I ask the promoters to consider&#151;not
necessarily today&#151;two minor points. Subsections (4) and (6)

that any sentence that starts with the word &#147;but&#148; is not
needed. I do not think it is a condition. If one reads &#147;the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000292"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me comment on a couple of questions that have
been raised about the Government&#146;s perspective, the first of
which concerned compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998 and
European legislation. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for
commending the Treasury on this occasion. The explanatory notes outline
the Government&#146;s view that the Bill is compatible with the
European convention on human rights. It reduces the recoverability of
debts in line with the HIPC initiative. The reduction, in our view, is
not a deprivation of property but a control of use. The European Court
of Human Rights has found there to be a deprivation only where there is
a total practical or legal extinction of the rights of ownership. Under
the Bill&#146;s provisions, the creditors will still retain an asset
of some economic value. Although the face value of the debts will be
considerably reduced by the Bill, their current market value is likely
to be much lower than their face value. We consider that control of use
to be justified in the interests of promoting fairness among creditors
and promoting the development of poor countries. My hon. Friend the
Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk set out the moral case for doing
that.</div><a name="10030974000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000293"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister has highlighted the Treasury&#146;s
view that the reduction is a control of use rather than a deprivation
of possessions. What would be the significance if it was a deprivation
of possessions, and why is it important that it is a control of
use?</div><a name="10030974000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000294"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It is an important distinction in order to secure
that the Bill is compatible with the Human Rights Act. The hon. Member
for Daventry referred to compatibility with article 1 of the protocol
to the European convention on human rights. The measure is
proportionate for compelling public policy reasons. It promotes
fairness among creditors and the development of poor countries.
Creditors that enforce their debts for the full face value divert
resources that are intended for development, including debt relief and
international aid provided by the UK Government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="10030974000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is this worth
doing and is it, ultimately, a substantial measure? Of course, it is
true that, compared with overall financial flows, the amounts we are
talking about are small. For the countries involved, however, they are
significant. The case of Liberia has been mentioned, and the amount
involved is reported to represent 5 per cent. of its
Government&#146;s annual revenue. That will have a huge impact on
that country. The World Bank survey reports other active cases that are
larger still. I think that every member of the Committee agrees that
the threat of any resources being diverted to vulture funds, away from
a country where almost half the population live on under a dollar a
day, is very serious. That concern is shared on both sides of the
Committee.</div><a name="10030974000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000295"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Has the Treasury given any thought to the
alternative of offering the creditors expropriation at the current
market value of the debts, and then paying the appropriate
compensation? Would that be an alternative approach? Would it be dearer
or cheaper, and would it be equally compatible with the European
convention on human
rights?</div><a name="10030974000232"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="10030974000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000296"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The World Bank&#146;s debt reduction facility
helps settle the commercial debts of HIPCs on terms that are compatible
with the HIPC initiative. It negotiates buy-backs at the deeply
discounted rates consistent with the initiative by using funding from
donors, including the UK, to purchase and then cancel debts from
commercial creditors that choose to participate. In the case of
Liberia, last year&#146;s operation bought back 97.5 per cent. of
eligible debt, with a full value of $1.2 billion, for just 3 per cent.
of that value. Of course, we cannot be absolutely sure about what will
happen because of secrecy on the part of the commercial players
involved. There is bound to be some uncertainty about the number of
cases that will come forward, but the Bill prevents creditors from
taking action against the HIPCs to get full
value.</div><a name="10030974000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
year&#146;s World Bank survey of HIPC Governments reported 14 active
or unresolved law suits by commercial creditors worldwide, with a total
value of $1.2 billion. Active law suits are reported against, among
others, Ethiopia, Uganda, Sierra Leone&#151;mentioned by the hon.
Member for Banbury&#151;and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The
survey has reported 54 cases since 2002, about a fifth of which have
been brought in the UK, and new cases continue to
arise.</div><a name="10030974000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000297"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am, again, grateful to the Minister for giving
way with his characteristic generosity. First, what would he say to the
argument that is sometimes made that using surveys of litigation can be
an inaccurate way of measuring claims, because by their very nature
claimants tend to have an optimistic assessment of their claim? They
claim for as large an amount as possible. Court judgments tend to
reduce the claim as a matter of course, and there is the whole issue of
enforcement. Some argue, therefore, that trying to assess the benefit
for developing countries on the basis of a survey is not a reliable
methodology. What is the Minister&#146;s response to that? Secondly,
what trends are there in the number of claims being made? He mentioned
the 54 claims. Is there a reduction in the number, or is it increasing?
What is the trend in the enforcement of the
claims?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="10030974000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000298"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I certainly accept, as I have already indicated,
that there is a degree of uncertainty&#151;that is inevitable. One
cannot give absolutely definitive figures. We have set out our best
valuation in the impact assessment, which is that the Bill will prevent
&#163;145 million from being transferred from heavily indebted poor
countries to litigating creditors through free-riding. While
acknowledging the uncertainty, I think that that is as good an estimate
as one can make. We can, however, be certain that the Bill will prevent
the minority of commercial creditors that litigate and extract
repayment in excess of that permitted under the HIPC initiative from
using UK laws or courts to do so. That is an aim that I think the whole
Committee shares, and that the Bill will
fulfil.</div><a name="10030974000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000299"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I think that most people have had their questions
about insolvency arrangements, the management of the debt and the
arrangements for orderly wind-down answered, and my right hon. Friend
the Member for East Ham dealt with the human rights issues, so there is
absolutely no point in my covering those matters. I just point out that
the calculation of what are sustainable debts for the countries has
already been agreed, and is set down in the explanatory
notes.</div><a name="10030974000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, we talked earlier about the fair treatment of different types
of debt, and I point out that some of the commercial creditors have
already behaved properly, going through the process and writing off the
debt. The issue is about dealing with different classes of debt
equally. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Worthing, West, the
HIPC amount is a ceiling, and if parties agree to less than that
amount, they can recover only the lesser
amount.</div><a name="10030974000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and
East Falkirk, made the case about the obvious and compelling
circumstances. It rests with some of the countries&#151;and here I
mention the steps taken by the British taxpayer&#151;to underwrite
some of the costs. Looking at the list of countries, we see that one of
them is Haiti. We must ask whether there are obvious and compelling
circumstances for Haiti that require the kind of management of debt
that we are talking about. In most cases, things are being done
perfectly properly. However, a country in such circumstances should not
be prey to a fund that suddenly decides to hit it for the full amount
of repayment of
debt.</div><a name="10030974000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000300"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Clause 5 flags up another issue concerning the
European convention on human rights, relating in particular to the
enforceability of judgments. Before turning to some of the legal
arguments, may I put down a question for the Minister or the hon.
Member for Northampton, North, about the significance of
clause 5? How much of the &#163;145 million that we have
been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>talking about&#151;the Treasury estimate of the benefit accruing
directly to developing countries as a consequence of the
Bill&#151;relates to judgments that have already been made and is
therefore dependent on clause 5, and how much does not? In part, that
goes back to what I was talking about earlier&#151;the EMTA claim
that the beneficiary of the Bill will be Liberia, essentially, because
of the judgment made at the end of last year, and that the effect will
not be felt more widely. A breakdown of which claims will relate to
judgments already made and which will not would be
helpful.</div><a name="10030974000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
we must deal with the issue of article 6 of the European convention on
human rights and the enforcement of judgments. The explanatory notes
are helpful in setting out the Government&#146;s case as to why
article 6 will not apply. Again, I do not claim any particular
expertise, but I note that the Government basically argue that article
6 will not be a problem. First, they acknowledge that the European
Court of Human Rights has repeatedly found an infringement of article 6
in circumstances where states have refused to enforce judgments or have
delayed doing
so.</div><a name="10030974000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the explanatory notes set out the grounds on which the Bill can be
distinguished from such decisions. Those grounds include the state
itself being a party to the proceedings, or situations in which the
state could and should have adopted other measures to achieve its
objectives. Clearly the state&#151;the UK&#151;is not party to the
proceedings. Could the objectives have been achieved in other ways? We
have touched on alternatives, but it might be helpful if the Minister
or the hon. Member for Northampton, North, underlined the reasons why
the legislation is the best way to achieve the
aims.</div><a name="10030974000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second argument is that the Bill would be significantly hindered if it
did not extend to judgment debts, which is the point that I was making
a moment or so ago. The explanatory notes
say:</div><a name="10030974000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;given
the number of creditors who have obtained judgments on their debts
against
HIPCs.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if we had further information on that point. However,
as an argument for saying that article 6 does not apply, I do not know
that it is as successful as the first
point.</div><a name="10030974000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third distinguishing feature is that in this context, there is little
difference in principle between creditors who have obtained a judgment
debt and other creditors. The explanatory notes
continue:</div><a name="10030974000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whether
or not creditors have gone through the court process, which may have
been no more than a formality, is not a robust basis for distinguishing
between
creditors.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see precisely what the thinking is, and I can fully understand it,
but it seems to suggest that the more contentious the judgment, the
more important its enforceability. That may well be right, but I do not
know how that compares with other cases that the European Court of
Human Rights has
debated.</div><a name="10030974000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final point, set out in the explanatory notes, is
that</div><a name="10030974000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;judgment
debts are possessions within A1P1. It would be inconsistent for the
state to be given a wide margin of appreciation in relation to A1P1 for
judgment debts, but to be subject to an absolute prohibition when
controlling the use of judgment debts by the terms of Article
6.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that it was helpful for me to set out the reasons in the
explanatory notes, so that those who subsequently read the debates will
be clear that we have considered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>those points. I would be grateful to the hon. Member for Northampton,
North, and the Minister if they could provide any other comments
regarding ensuring that we do not run into a problem with article 6 as
a consequence of the
Bill.</div><a name="10030974000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5 is key. If we stripped it out, we would substantially reduce the best
estimate of &#163;145 million. It will be helpful to have some
clarity on the numbers. However, clearly, we need to ensure that the
measures will not result in endless litigation&#151;we need to be on
robust ground in that area. However, I have no further remarks on
clause
5.</div><a name="10030974000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000301"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I compare the clause with insolvency legislation,
where judgment debt is treated the same as non-judgment debt. Neither
of the creditors is preferred, and on that basis, the application is
not
retrospective.</div>
<a name="10030974000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000302"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give the
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire the breakdown he was asking
for. If anything comes my way, I will let him know.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Actually, I can give a little
illumination. Our estimate is that if clause 5 was removed, the benefit
would be reduced by a third. It is of that order of
magnitude&#151;substantial, as he
thought.</div><a name="10030974000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
having legislation that affects cases where a court has already given
judgment rightly raises some important issues. It is not something that
should be done lightly or often&#151;it needs to be considered
carefully. Here, there is a compelling case for doing so on three
grounds, which the hon. Gentleman touched on. First, there is $1.2
billion-worth of HIPC debts worldwide on which judgments have already
been made or action is continuing. Other creditors can theoretically go
to court before any legislation comes into effect to get judgments on
those debts, which would then be excluded from the legislation.
Creditors would be able to enforce those debts in UK courts against the
assets of poor countries, disrupting trade and investment, which would
clearly be inconsistent with the aims of the legislation.</div>
<a name="10030974000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
excluding judgments would not be economically logical. The purpose of
the legislation as a whole is to limit repayment of otherwise valid
debts to the level the debtor can afford to
repay.</div>
<a name="10030974000233"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10030974000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question that follows is whether to exclude some kinds of debts, such
as judgment debts, which would, in effect, be treating them more
favourably. I do not think there is a strong argument for doing that;
it is logical to treat them equally. The judgment will have been
reached on the validity of the debt, rather than on the debtor&#146;s
capacity for repayment. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley is
right to highlight the strong similarities with insolvency law, which
provides for a fair and orderly restructuring in situations in which
creditors&#146; claims in total exceed the capacity for repayment. As
he says, in insolvency law, a debt on which there is already a judgment
is not, in general, treated more favourably&#151;that is, to be
repaid at the expense of other debts. The same effect should apply in
this legislation, as the hon. Gentleman
suggested.</div><a name="10030974000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
excluding judgment debt would considerably reduce the effectiveness of
the legislation. Around a third of the value transferred to creditors
would be at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>stake. If we accept the reasons for enacting this legislation in
general, it is important that the judgments be included. Although I
recognise the seriousness of this issue, we should include judgments
and this clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10030974000157"></a>

said, the main point is to have consistency and to deal with different
types of debt equally and fairly. To exclude judgment debt would be to
give status to a particular type of debt, which would not be consistent
with the orderly management of the debts of the country in question. It
is very important, therefore, that clause 5 remain part of the

example if they go against UK public policy&#151;it is consistent
with the aims of the Bill to do so. None the less, there are some kinds
of judgments and arbitration awards which the UK is obliged to enforce

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000313"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10030974000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I echo the words of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton? He
perhaps rushed in a little early with his comments. Perhaps that can be
put down to his newness in this place&#151;or perhaps
not.</div><a name="10030974000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have tabled new clause 1 because in an ideal world, we would have
followed a slightly different process. Concerns exist outside this
place about the impact that the Bill will have. Some people argue that
it goes too far and some, as I said earlier, argue that it does not
go  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>far enough. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk has made the
case that we should build on it. Others would argue that that is a
potentially dangerous argument and undermines confidence. I am not
taking a position on
that.</div><a name="10030974000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an ideal world we would have followed the proceedings that the
Government have brought in in recent years whereby we have witness
sessions. Value would have thereby been added to the Bill and to this
process. We could have examined and scrutinised the arguments for going
further. We could have addressed the concern that the Bill may damage
lending to developing countries. It would have been a helpful process.
We all realise where we are in the parliamentary timetable. As a party,
we have been keen to assist the process and move as swiftly as
possible, consistent with our having Committee stage as early as
possible to move the Bill forward as quickly as possible. As I said, in
an ideal world we would have gone through a lengthier scrutiny process.
The witness process, which is a welcome development of proceedings in
this place, would have been useful in these circumstances.</div>
<a name="10030974000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fair degree
of uncertainty exists. It is to the Treasury&#146;s and, indeed, the
Minister&#146;s credit that they acknowledge in the response to the
consultation process that sometimes there is uncertainty in such
matters. It would be helpful to consider the matter again to see what
has actually happened. Will some of the concerns turn out to be
overblown? Will there be a detrimental impact? What will be
the benefit to developing countries in terms of the debt that is not
pursued? How many cases will be dropped? How much will the amount to be
recovered be reduced by as a consequence of the judgment, and
so on?</div>
<a name="10030974000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
recognise that there is some uncertainty about a lot of these issues,
and there are two alternative ways of addressing that uncertainty. I do
not intend to press new clause 1 to a vote, but one way of addressing
that uncertainty is to issue within 12 months of the Act&#146;s
commencement a report that assesses the various issues that have been
raised today.</div>
<a name="10030974000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we
should consider the impact on the availability and cost of lending to
countries to which the initiative applies, which is at the heart of
what we are doing. Secondly, we should consider how the initiative
applies more generally to other developing countries, including,
potentially, eligible initiative countries. There is the question of
the impact, in terms of the monetised value, of going from the
creditors to the debtors&#151;the relevant developing countries. As
the Minister acknowledged, there is a fair degree of uncertainty about
that. Finally, there is the question of the impact of determining the
choice of law or the choice of jurisdiction for financial contracts. We
have not particularly debated that issue today and it is not at the
heart of the Bill; nevertheless, the Minister is certainly aware of
concerns that this initiative might have an adverse impact on the
UK&#146;s position as a place to do business. Even if we put those
concerns to one side, there is a worry that contracts will be pursued
in other jurisdictions and that this initiative will have no great
effect in the grand scheme of things, simply because other
jurisdictions will be used.</div>
<a name="10030974000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hope, as
expressed by the Treasury and the hon. Member for Northampton, North,
is that we will lead the way and that other jurisdictions will follow
suit. On Second Reading, we debated the fact that in the US a similar
measure attempts to do the same thing. I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>know what the likelihood is of such a measure ever reaching the statute
book. None the less, it would be helpful for us to look at these
matters again. Uncertainties exist now, when we are passing this Bill,
and the parliamentary timetable has meant that we have been unable to
question and scrutinise in Committee those who have raised concerns
about the Bill. Looking at the Treasury response to the consultation
process, it is clear that plenty of people have raised such concerns.
Given all that, an opportunity to look again at this measure would be a
good thing.</div>
<a name="10030974000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a moment,
I will say a little about new clause 2 and the alternative means it
proposes to address the uncertainty that exists. However, if new clause
1 were accepted, the Treasury would produce a report and respond to
these concerns, and we would therefore be in a better position to
assess the Bill&#146;s impact than we are this
morning.</div>
<a name="10030974000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000314"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I understand that we are very short of time. New
clause 1 has merit; new clause 2 does not.</div>
<a name="10030974000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000315"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I, too, shall be very brief. Let me simply assure
the Committee that we keep all legislation under review. We would
certainly do so in this case, without the need for the proposed duty to
do so. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
for saying that he does not intend to push new clause 1 to a vote. As I
have given that reassurance, I hope it will not be necessary for him or
other Members to do
so.</div><a name="10030974000191"></a>

do not need to run through the various arguments about the current

the matter. It is worth quoting the Treasury&#146;s response to the
consultation. Paragraph 2.30 notes
that</div><a name="10030974000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Predicting
the scale of any negative spillovers from legislation is very difficult
in advance of
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="10030974000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 is essentially a sunset clause. It means that we could proceed
with the Bill as drafted, and then assess what happens over the next 12
months&#151;whether there has been a risk premium, and what the
benefit to developing countries has been. At the very least, the new
clause would stop the pursuit of outstanding debts under the HIPC
regime over the course of those 12 months, and would provide
immediate relief for developing countries that are in the
scheme.</div><a name="10030974000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
12 months we would make another assessment&#151;I propose doing so
through secondary legislation to ensure that we do not have huge
difficulties with parliamentary time&#151;and take a view on whether
the concerns raised have proved immaterial or not. We could then
proceed to place the Bill on the statute book on a permanent basis.
Alternatively, we could say, &#147;So far, so good, but we
don&#146;t have all the evidence,&#148; and we could extend the
measures by a further year. There is also a risk&#151;I do not think
that this is likely&#151;that the Bill will have an impact on the
risk premium. If that happened, we would not proceed with it any
further, and it would
lapse.</div><a name="10030974000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying point is that it is vital that we tread carefully in this
area. In that interim 12 months, I hope that we would have a proper
opportunity to scrutinise the provisions further. It is not for this
Committee to direct the International Development Committee, but this
would be a useful area for it to examine. It could  dig into
the evidence on the basis that the Bill was on the statute book. We
could then see what the Bill&#146;s impact was, and would have the
opportunity to return to the
issue.</div><a name="10030974000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is somewhat rushed, and we are doing what we can to provide
a fair wind. I thank the Treasury Ministers, and the parliamentary
draftsmen who assisted with the drafting of the new clause. There has
been cross-party co-operation, and I take responsibility for the
spelling mistake in the first line. The new clause would be a good way
of ensuring that we can proceed with the Bill while addressing existing
concerns, so that we can ensure that the legislation actually helps
developing countries. We would then be able to legislate from a
position of understanding, and with knowledge of the Bill&#146;s
implications, rather than having to rely too much on guesswork, as I
suspect is currently the case in some
respects.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000318"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I shall listen with great interest to what my hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton, North, has to say on the new clause.
I have some reservations about it, but I should say on behalf of the
Government that, in the interests of ensuring that the Bill is passed
smoothly, I am happy to accept the new clause. It would leave the Bill
intact and logical. There is also an advantage in ensuring that the
effect on new lending is assessed before making the Bill
permanent.</div><a name="10030974000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030974000319"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Obviously, everyone wants the legislation passed
and progress to be made in dealing with developing country debt. It is
right that progress should be made in an orderly and proper way that
serves the interests of developing countries, so that they do not find
themselves damaged by a risk premium. Everything in the proposed
legislation is carefully targeted and structured and will not produce a
risk premium. I will not go into the reasons for that, but basically
creditors have their own ways of judging when a country is a bad risk,
as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire knows.</div>
<a name="10030974000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, at
the end of a Parliament there may be a suspicion that legislation is
hurried, and it is particularly important to give real assurances about
that. That is why I say to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley,
that although we would prefer not to have to accept a sunset clause, in
the interests of ensuring that we can make orderly progress, the new
clause should be agreed. We should, therefore, accept the principle of
a sunset clause. If we agree that that is a way forward, I am sure that
secondary legislation can be made in the next Parliament. That will
mean that there is not a huge problem with parliamentary timetabling;
that can be done in an orderly way, so that we can retain the
cross-party consensus that has been so important in making progress

conclusion, I repeat the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member
for Manchester, Gorton, about our great regret
that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish could not be
here to take the Bill through Committee himself, as I am sure he would
have wanted. I hope that we will be able to proceed to Report and Third
Reading, so that we can get his legislation moving. The Bill will be a
world first, and I am sure that it will be greatly appreciated by other
jurisdictions around the world and by developing
countries.</div><a name="10030974000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
