after `authorise', insert `no more than two'.&#151;[Mr.
Maclean.]
<P>
<H5>4.32 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we were
taking amendment No. 967, in page 73, line 25, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for every person named on the said warrant'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr.
Maclean) was in the process of moving amendment No. 966, but had
not finished doing so. Unless any other hon. Member wishes to
finish moving the amendment, we shall move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I wish to continue
moving the amendment. The purpose of these amendments is to probe
the nature of the parties or the groups of immigration officers
who might be called upon to execute a warrant. They seek to
ensure that when a warrant is issued under the powers that will
be given to immigration officers, the person who issues it has
some idea of the size and nature of the group who will use it.
For every person named on the warrant no more than two additional
persons should go out on the mission to arrest or to enter and
search premises.
<P>
It is important that those who issue warrants have some idea
of the nature of the operation because of the enormous
sensitivity in terms of community relations, which we have
already discussed. Some clarity is needed here and that is the
view of ILPA too. The clause as it stands could allow a warrant
to be issued in the name of a single immigration officer for what
would effectively be a large-scale exercise. A search at a
hostel, for example, could involve quite a large number of people
who have broken their immigration conditions. We therefore seek
a little more clarity about the process of issuing warrants and
the extent to which the justices of the peace who issue them will
have information on the nature of the operation they are
authorising.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> The aim of the amendment is to
prevent excessive numbers of immigration officers or police
officers accompanying the officer who is to execute the warrant.
I confirm that the restrictions that apply to the police in this
regard will also apply to immigration officers. Indeed, the
immigration service is not so flush with staff these days that
it will send large numbers of people to do anything.
<P>
A warrant is issued on the understanding that the number of
accompanying persons is necessary for the purpose of the search.
If the number is unreasonable, the search may be deemed to be
invalid. There are difficulties in setting a precise limit in
certain operations. For example, some operations involve
attending a factory where a large number of people are present,
so a number of officers may be necessary.
<P>
If it was considered appropriate for a police officer, an
immigration officer of the opposite gender and a person from
another agency with an interest in a search to accompany the
officer executing the warrant, who would be left out? I am not
sure that we would want anyone to be left out in that situation.
<P>
The amendments are based on the assumption that all warrants
will be issued with the intention of searching for persons.
Clause 107 provides for the issuing of warrants to search for
evidence. How would the amendments comply with that clause? What
would happen if a large premises was to be searched, but the
provisions did not allow sufficient officers to do it?
<P>
Those examples display the care that we must take before
introducing new elements into legislation that has already been
tested in the operational arena. The provisions in the clause are
based on the existing provisions in section 16 of PACE. They are
necessary not only to provide consistency between the police and
immigration practices, but to avoid two sets of procedure for the
justices of the peace and the sheriffs who will consider the
applications. Justices of the peace are well used to signing
warrants for such searches. They will make appropriate inquiries.
In my experience the extent to which they make inquiries varies,
but they will want to know what the purpose of the warrant is and
how it is proposed that it should be executed. They will also
have the right to ask any other questions that they deem
appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border):</B> I apologise to
the Minister and to you, Mr. Maxton, for being late back to the
Committee. I was the one raising points of order in the Chamber
on the Macpherson leak inquiry. I apologise that I was not back
to continue the debate on the amendments that was begun just
before lunch. I am sure that the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Hallam (Mr. Allan) dealt with them excellently. What I heard of
the Minister's reply suggested that it was probably satisfactory,
but I shall let the hon. Gentleman give his opinion on its real
quality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It was indeed a useful exchange and a satisfactory
reply. The Minister made the crucial point that the expectation
was that the warrants would be used and the parties would be made
up in a similar way to that used by the police in exercising
their warrants. We have sought to ensure throughout the
amendments that the same safeguards exist for immigration officer
operations as for police operations. Secondly, the Minister
referred to the concept of reasonableness in the make-up of the
party, again an important concept to have on record.
<P>
In view of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

Mike O'Brien.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part
of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Can the Minister put on the record an explanation
of the reasons for the changes that are being made here and their
likely implications? He will be aware that I and my colleagues
have grave reservations about the way in which detention is used
and are unhappy about the way in which we believe it is used at
present. The Bill seeks to make some improvements in bail
provisions. Can he also give an indication of scope of the
changes and say whether there is any relationship between the
changes to the detention regime and the other provisions, such
as the automatic bail hearing within a week of the person being
detained?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We shall have a chance to discuss detention on
later clauses, but let me explain the purpose of the clause.
<P>
There is a difficulty with the current detention provisions
which the clause is intended to overcome. The present position
under schedule 2 to the Immigration Act, 1971 is that a person
may be detained if he is liable to examination or removal. In
some cases, although there has been compelling evidence that,
prima facie, a person falls into one or other of those
categories, it has subsequently been determined that that is not
the case. Even where a person has not assisted the immigration
officer to determine the true facts, such a detention is
currently unlawful and as such exposes the immigration service
to legal action and damages, even though it may have been
effected honestly and properly. Indeed, that issue has had to be
addressed in a number of cases. We therefore seek to clarify the
law so that, where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting
that a person is in one of those categories, the immigration
service can deal with it properly.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 116, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 992, in page 75,
line 15, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Any person exercising a power conferred by sections
(Fingerprinting) or (Attendance for fingerprinting) may, if
necessary, use reasonable force.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments
Nos. 988 to 990,
<P>
Government new clause 41&#151;Proof of identity of persons
to be removed or deported.
<P>
Government new clause 42&#151;Fingerprinting.
<P>
Government new clause 43&#151;Attendence for fingerprinting.
<P>
Government new clause 44&#151;Destruction of
fingerprints&#151;
<P>
Government new clause 45&#151;Other methods of collecting
data about physical characteristics.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> At present all asylum seekers are fingerprinted
under existing provisions, a policy that has operated
satisfactorily and sensitively for some years. Now we intend to
incororate that power into the Bill and to ensure that
fingerprinting can take place for other categories of person
known to abuse our immigration system.
<P>
The categories where fingerprinting can take place now are
limited. For reasons that I shall outline, it is necessary to
extend the powers primarily for categories other than asylum
seekers, although some of the provisions may have an impact
across the board.
<P>
Where an immigration officer has apprehended and detained an
offender under paragraph 16 of schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, he has
the power under paragraph 18(2) and under paragraph 2(4) to
schedule 3 to the 1971 Act to take all necessary steps to
photograph, measure or otherwise identify the person. That
implies the power to fingerprint only for purposes of
identification. There is no power in law for the immigration
service to retain those fingerprints once a person is released,
even if only on temporary admission. In addition, the person may
have been detained under paragraph 16. It would not cover those
arrested for offences under other parts of the 1971 Act. In the
majority of cases, fingerprint records are kept for a maximum of
10 years.
<P>
Amendment No. 992 would provide that anyone authorised to
take fingerprints under the Bill&#151;constables, immigration
officers, prison officers, authorised officers of the Secretary
of State and employees at detention centres&#151;may use
reasonable force if necessary when taking fingerprints. It is a
necessary provision, although we hope that it will be used
infrequently. The definition of what constitutes reasonable force
in a certain circumstance is ultimately a matter for the courts,
but it is a well-worn route and the courts are familiar with the
concept. Any force used must be no more than necessary to achieve
a lawful purpose such as, in this case, the taking of
fingerprints.
<P>
I come now to amendment Nos. 988. Under paragraph 18(2) of
schedule 2 of the 1971 Act, immigration officers, prison officers
and the police have powers to take any steps that are
``reasonably necessary'' to confirm the identity of someone who
is detained under that Act. We have always been firmly of the
view that the powers to take ``reasonably necessary'' steps to
confirm someone's identify include the power to take
fingerprints. The purpose of amendment No. 988 is to make that
clear beyond any doubt.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 989 and 990 are technical. They make it clear
that the power to fingerprint under the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984&#151;PACE&#151;and the Police and Criminal
Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 do not affect in any way
the power to fingerprint contained in the Bill. PACE and the 1989
order already contain a similar provision in respect of the
existing power to fingerprint under schedule 2 of the 1971 Act,
which provides the power to fingerprint those who are detained
for identification purposes. The amendments are in line with that
provision, and I invite the Committee to accept them.
<P>
Government new clause 41 will allow the release of
fingerprint data to the authorities of other countries in
circumstances where the individual concerned is to be removed
from the United Kingdom, but does not have a valid passport or
other identity document that perimts him to travel. The release
of any personal information to another country is obviously
extremely sensitive and should be done only in limited
circumstances when there is a specific need to do so. We will,
therefore, only use the power as a last resort when the
authorities of the country to which the person is to be returned
refuse to acknowledge that the person is one of its nationals
unless a fingerprint is provided and when there is no other way
of returning that person to his home country. For example,
Morocco refuses to issue travel documents to its nationals
without a copy of their fingerprints. However, that is rare and
we expect to use the power infrequently.
<P>
I stress that no information about any asylum claim will be
released to an individual's national authority. Of course, those
provisions will apply not only to asylum seekers. Someone who is
being removed for other reasons might be part of the provisions,
so the other country would not know whether he had made an asylum
claim.
<P>
I come to Government new clause 42. At present, with the
exception of asylum seekers, our powers to fingerprint the
individuals who may commit, or may have committed, an immigration
offence are limited. That inability to fingerprint them, and more
importantly to retain fingerprints, greatly reduces the scope for
effective enforcement action to identify and to remove
immigration offenders.
<P>
If we leave aside asylum seekers, the only power to
fingerprint we have at present is the power to fingerprint
someone who is arrested for the purposes of identification. That
power does not permit us to retain fingerprints once the person
has been released, even if only on temporary release. We are
determined to strengthen immigration controls where necessary.
Therefore, we need additional powers to fingerprint and to retain
those fingerprints in order to achieve that aim.
<P>
It might help if I set out the scale of the problem. Every
passenger arriving in the United Kingdom has to produce a valid
passport, identity card or other document that satisfactorily
establishes his or her identity and nationality. In the first
half of 1998, 10,000 passengers arrived in the United Kingdom
with inadequate identity documentation or no documentation at
all. They were unable to satisfy the immigration officer at the
port of entry of their identity. Such people fall to be refused
entry to the country.
<P>
Most cases merit futher investigation before the individual
concerned is removed from the United Kingdom. The immigration
service has limited detention space, so the majority of people
in that position are granted temporary admission&#151;so too are
most asylum seekers. There are powers to deal with asylum
seekers, but the new clause is primarily concerned with others.
<P>
Persons suspected of being immigration offenders and
apprehended in-country&#151;that is after they have entered the
United Kingdom&#151;would normally be given temporary release,
which is the equivalent of temporary admission. Unfortunately,
many of them subsequently abscond. Absconders from temporary
admission or release, failed asylum seekers, illegal entrants and
overstayers are all likely to become the object of enforcement
action. Without adequate powers to fingerprint such persons, they
could make successful use of false identities to avoid
identification and further action when apprehended and to repeat
the process on subsequent occasions using a series of different
identities.
<P>
It would obviously be disproportionate to fingerprint all
those who are granted temporary admission, because many of them
are genuine visitors whose immigration status is quickly
resolved. We therefore intend to extend the power to fingerprint
only in respect of specific categories of people. The first is
inadequately documented arrivals&#151;for example, people who
arrive without passports. Another is people who have been refused
entry and given temporary admission when an immigration officer
reasonably suspects that they may abscond.
<P>
In the case of inadequately documented arrivals, instructions
to those authorised to take fingerprints will make it clear that
they should be taken only when there is no reasonable excuse for
failing to produce adequate documentation. The persons against
whom that power will be directed are, for example, those who have
deliberately destroyed or concealed their documentation&#151;not
those who have an innocent explanation for the failure.
<P>
We also intend to extend the power to fingerprint people who
are to be removed or deported so that we can identify them if
they try to return to this country by adopting a new identity.
Unfortunately, that is all too common an occurrence.
<P>
The amendment also provides for the power to fingerprint
anyone arrested under the second schedule of the 1971 Act. That
will help us identify someone, for example, who is fingerprinted
as an inadequately documented passenger, subsequently absconds,
is then arrested under the second schedule on suspicion of having
breached temporary admission conditions and is fingerprinted
again. The fingerprint comparison would enable us to make an
immediate identification. Finally, we want to extend the power
to fingerprint certain dependants.
<P>
However, I should stress that we have no intention of
routinely fingerprinting children. We intend to fingerprint
children under the age of 16 only when there are doubts as to
their identity. Where such doubts do arise, it may be necessary
to obtain the authority of a chief immigration officer to take
the prints and, in all cases, the parent or guardian of the
child&#151;or an adult who has taken responsibility for the
child for the time being&#151;must be present.
<P>
The provisions mirror those relating to the fingerprinting
of the dependants of asylum seekers. We recognise the
sensitivities surrounding fingerprinting. However, we believe
that there is a considerable need to enhance immigration control
by these means. Asylum seekers have already been fingerprinted
for several years and it has operated satisfactorily. We shall
build on that experience. We intend to introduce safeguards to
the system and we will publish the instructions to be issued to
immigration staff before the provisions come into force, so there
will be some time for representations to be heard.
<P>
New clause 43 provides a power to require those who are
liable to be fingerprinted to go to a specified place within a
specified time in order to be fingerprinted. There is also a
power for a constable or immigration officer to arrest without
warrant anyone who fails to do so. Similar provision exists in
section 3 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 in
relation to asylum seekers only.
<P>
The new clause deals with the practicalities of
fingerprinting those persons identified in new clause 42.
Ideally, fingerprints will be taken immediately. For example, a
person who arrives at a port of entry with inadequate
documentation who cannot offer a satisfactory explanation is
likely to be fingerprinted on arrival. Similarly, we would expect
someone who has been arrested under paragraph 17 of the second
schedule to the 1971 Act&#151;referred to as ``D'' in subsection
(7)(d) of new clause 42&#151;to be fingerprinted as soon as he
is arrested.
<P>
However, it may not always be possible to fingerprint
immediately&#151;perhaps because of something as simple as a
finger wound or, in the case of someone under 16, the absence of
a responsible adult, as defined in subsection (4). That is not
ideal because the idea of taking a person's fingerprints is to
ensure that we are certain of an individual's identity and have
a record for future records before he is released.
<P>
On occasions when it has not been possible to fingerprint
someone immediately, we would expect to use the power in the
amendment to issue them with a notice advising them that they are
required to return either to the same place or to somewhere more
convenient where their fingerprints will be taken. The notice
will also give a seven-day period in which the person must attend
for fingerprinting and may specify a time of day or particular
hours during which the person may attend. The period will not
begin any earlier than seven days after the notice was issued.
If the person does not attend as required, the power to arrest
him is needed in order to take his fingerprints. The 1993 Act
made similar provisions in respect of asylum seekers. If the
arrest takes place at an immigration office&#151;perhaps the
person has returned for further interviews&#151;his fingerprints
may be taken there. It is possible that the arrest would take
place as the result of a person being apprehended in the field.
In such circumstances, he may be removed either to an immigration
office or a police station where his fingerprints will be taken.
<P>
New clause 44 provides clear and specific guidelines on when
fingerprinting records must be destroyed. It also provides
safeguards so that the person whose fingerprints have been taken
can be sure that the database records have also been destroyed.
That mirrors the existing provisions on the destruction of asylum
seekers' fingerprints in section 3 of the 1993 Act.
<P>
In the majority of cases, fingerprint records will be kept
for 10 years. That is the essential counterpart to the power to
take fingerprints; without it, that power is meaningless. For
example, someone is fingerprinted because he is to be removed as
an illegal entrant. He is successfully removed, but some years
later he returns to the country and arrives at port without
documentation. Under the new powers, his fingerprints could be
taken and compared with previous fingerprints for immediate
indentification. That would not be possible if we did not have
the power to retain fingerprints.
<P>
There are exceptions, however. We will not retain
fingerprints for 10 years if, for example, a person was
fingerprinted because the immigration officer was not satisfied
as to his identity. If it is later proven that he is a British
citizen, the fingerprints will probably be destroyed. When an
asylum seeker has been granted indefinite leave to remain in the
United Kingdom, the fingerprint records will be destroyed as soon
as practicable. That mirrors the provisions in section 3(6) of
the 1993 Act. Similarly, when a person in any other category is
given leave to enter or to remain in the United Kingdom, the
fingerprint records will be destroyed as soon as practicable.
<P>
In addition, fingerprint records taken from a person who has
been refused leave to enter and granted temporary admission will
be destroyed when he has left the United Kingdom, unless he has
broken the conditions of his temporary admission relating to
residence or reporting requirements. That is so that the
fingerprints can be used in any future enforcement action. There
is a possibility that someone who has committed an offence once
by breaking a condition of his or her temporary admission may do
so again after removal, for example, by returning to the Unted
Kingdom and entering as an illegal entrant. A fingerprint will
help to identify such a person. Other exceptions to the 10-year
rule are those in respect of whom removal directions cease to
have effect and those who, having been arrested under schedule
2, are subsequently released.
<P>
Finally, if a person has been fingerprinted as the dependant
of someone whose fingerprints are taken under the categories set
out in new clause 42, their records will be destroyed at the same
time.
<P>
We are determined to make the procedure as secure as possible
and for that reason new clause 44 provides for all copies of the
original fingerprint records to be destroyed. When those records
are held in electronic form, it will mean ensuring either that
they are destroyed or erased or that access to the information
is blocked. The person to whom the data refers will also be able
to request a certificate confirming that the records have been
disposed of in that manner. The Secretary of State will be
required to supply such a certificate within three months of a
request to do so.
<P>
Taking anyone's fingerprints is a sensitive matter. The
retention, and ultimate destruction, of those fingerprint records
is equally sensitive. The amendment fulfils our obligation to
treat the matter with the utmost care and security, while still
allowing the operational requirements of immigration control to
be met. I urge the Committee to accept the new clause.
<P>
New clause 45 would provide the Secretary of State with
powers to make regulations to enable data to be collected about
a person's external physical characteristics other than by taking
fingerprints. New methods of uniquely identifying people are
being developed all the time: for example, there are systems in
development based upon the recognition of the iris of the eye,
or of a palm print. Another likely technique may involve a
sophisticated photograph.
<P>
The new clause would give the Secretary of State the
flexibility to take advantage of new technology, as and when it
develops. However, it is drafted so that the provisions of the
regulations covering new technology would have to be equivalent
to the provisions of new clauses 42 to 44. I invite the Committee
to accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> There are a number of issues in the amendments.
The Minister rightly said that fingerprinting was a sensitive
matter and it certainly will be in practice when, as the
amendments provide, it is brought under statutory control.
<P>
Amendment No. 992 refers to the use of reasonable force by
authorised persons carrying out fingerprinting. That seems
acceptable because immigration officers&#151;who, I hope, will
have received additional training&#151;and prison officers will
need those extra powers. However, subsection 5(e) of new clause
42 covers a wider range of people as it refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person who is employed by a contractor in connection
with the discharge of the contractor's duties under a detention
centre contract.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister reassure us about the nature of the training
that will be given to those working in detention centres if they
are to use reasonable force to take fingerprints? A certain
technique is required to take fingerprints without transgressing
the requirement to use reasonable force. Will the Minister say
whether such activities are currently being carried out in
detention centres, especially in places such as Tinsley house and
Campsfield house where problems have arisen between the detainees
and some of the staff? Is what is proposed novel, or is there
experience in such matters?
<P>
In referring to new clause 42, the Minister said that the
permission of a chief immigation officer would be required to
take the fingerprints of a person under the age of 16. In such
cases, there is often a dispute about the individual's age. Those
whose age and identity is hard to establish might be precisely
the category of people whom the immigration officers want to
fingerprint. Although the amendment makes special provisions for
people under the age of 16, their age may be in dispute. how will
that problem be resolved? Will they be given the benefit of the
doubt on whether they fall within the category of those requiring
exceptional treatment because they are under 16?
<P>
Who does the Secretary of State imagine will take
responsibility for an unaccompanied minor? When there is a
dispute about a child's age and identity, who will be the
appropriate adult in whose presence the immigration service will
be permitted to take fingerprints?
<P>
I am glad that the Minister assured us that subsection (7)(a)
of new clause 42 is intended to catch inadequately documented
arrivals. The wording of that proposal implies that it could
catch anyone, at any time, who is unable to present documentation
to an immigration officer. The subsection does not refer to the
point of arrival; it seems to imply that the new clause would
allow an immigration officer, at any point, to request
documentation if not presented with it, and then to require
fingerprints to be taken. The Minister said that that is not when
he intends the power to be used, but I should be happier if the
wording made it clear that the proposal applies to the point of
arrival rather than to any other time when an immigration officer
may come into contact with an individual. I hope that the
Minsiter can show that when fingerprinting is done at the point
of arrival people will be treated sensitively, as some arrive in
a traumatised condition. The Medical Foundation for the Care of
the Victims of Torture reports that people known to them often
arrive with a fear of authority, for understandable reasons. The
fingerprinting process may not necessarily be appropriate at the
point of arrival if, during the initial interview, immigration
officers have a strong indication that the person is traumatised.
They may have inadequate documentation and therefore fall into
the category that the immigration service usually seeks to
fingerprint, but that may not be appropriate.
<P>
Does the Minister consider it appropriate to use a different
provision to require the person to come back at a later date for
fingerprinting? It would be better to take fingerprints then than
at that tense moment when someone has arrived, claimed asylum,
and started an interview in which evidence of trauma has
manifested itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are largely talking about people who are not
asylum seekers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I accept that. Certainly, the provisions cover
people who arrive without adequate documentation, although the
Minister has confirmed that they will extend beyond that.
<P>
What is the relationship between the fingerprint database and
that used by the police? New clause 44 (11)(a) states that data
may be ``held in electronic form''. Is the intention to share a
common database with the police, or will there be a separate
immigration fingerprinting database? Will immigration officers
use the same technology as the police?
<P>
What will happen to the fingerprints of someone given
exceptional leave to remain for a limited period? Will they be
destroyed? New clause 44(3)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in any other case, is given leave to enter or remain . .
. the fingerprints must be destroyed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Proposed subsection (3)(a), however, applies to someone who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is given indefinite leave to remain''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the fingerprints of someone with ELR not be destroyed
unless or until they receive indefinite leave to remain?
<P>
I am going to have a moan about how new clause 45 is drafted.
I accept what the Minister said about making technology
legislation independent. It is better to do that than to rewrite
such legislation every time a new technology comes along.
<P>
However, the method in new clause 45 is inappropriate. The
Government have tabled a series of new clauses referring to
fingerprinting, but say that they may apply them in differently
to a different technology. As a general principle, it would be
clearer to have clauses referring to identification by external
means and a way of applying that to fingerprinting which could
then be adapted to apply to other technologies.
<P>
That would avoid having to use regulatory powers if another
technology, such as iris identification, were used. As a general
principle, it would be better to have generic clauses for forms
of external identification&#151;and clarify that the Bill
applies to fingerprinting&#151;than detailed provisions on
fingerprinting which are applied in a wholly different way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): I shall make brief comments
on the new clauses.
<P>
There was a long debate on fingerprinting asylum seekers when
the Bill that became the 1993 Act was in Committee. There was
considerable opposition to such fingerprinting from Members on
one side of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): Which
side was that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I think that my hon. Friend can hazard a guess
about that.
<P>
One must be careful about extending fingerprinting
requirements to matters that are not criminal offences. There
were lengthy debates in 1992 and 1993 on whether fingerprinting
was appropriate for asylum seekers who had not been charged with
criminal offences. One normally expects fingerprinting when
someone is charged. Therefore, is we are to extend the powers to
cover people who may have been in this country for many years and
who have not been charged with a criminal offence, we should
carefully consider the circumstances in which fingerprints can
be taken.
<P>
I would like the Minister to reply to other points that have
been made by the hon. Member for Hallam. New clause 42(7)(a) has
been drawn extremely widely. It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any person . . . who, on being required to do so by an
immigration officer, fails to produce a valid passport with
photograph or some other document''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The drafting is very broad, so it is important that we are
precise about the circumstances in which the new clause might
come into effect.
<P>
The definitions of ``relevant period'' in new clause 42 have
also been drafted very widely. Subsection (7)(a) refers to the
point at which an immigration officer requires someone to produce
a valid passport. The point at which the ``relevant period'' ends
for person A is set out in subsection (9), which states that it
ends on the earliest of the following: the grant of leave to
enter or remain, or removal or deportation. That could be a long
time, so it is a very open-ended power.
<P>
New clause 43 will create a requirement for someone to attend
to be fingerprinted. If that requirement is not met, that might
lead to arrest without warrant. If someone can be arrested
without a warrant, we must be careful about the circumstances in
which that might be possible. In particular, we must ensure that
that person knows that he is required to attend.
<P>
The new clause uses the phrase ``by notice in writing''.
Other clauses of the Bill contain safeguards on the mechanism by
which someone is notified. There does not appear to be much of
a safeguard in this new clause. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may, by notice in writing, require
a person . . . to attend''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Safeguards are important if someone might be subject to
arrest without warrant.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also referred to new clause 44,
which deals with data held in an electronic form. Is that data
covered by the Data Protection Act 1984? If data is held in
electronic form, it is important to know who will have access to
it and how that access relates to other data banks held by the
police or other European countries? We know that police forces
and immigration services share information. Therefore, we need
to know who will have access to the data, under what
circumstances they will have it and whether the Data Protection
Act 1984 will apply?
<P>
I wish to raise a point about new clause 45 which the hon.
Member for Hallam has mentioned. I am a little worried about this
vaguely drafted, catch-all clause which talks about technological
developments that may occur in the future. As the Minister said,
some of these are on the way and may be available shortly. I
understand that we do not want continually to have to bring in
new primary legislation becuase there has been a new
technological development, but the provisions that are
appropriate for finger printing may not be appropriate for a new
form of technology.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 45 talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulations containing provisions equivalent to sections
on (Fingerprinting), (Attendance for fingerprinting) and
(Destruction of fingerprints)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I am not sure how that might operate in practice. Will
those regulations be positive or negative resolutions? Parliament
has had to look carefully at the provisions necessitated by the
changes that have taken place over the past few years in criminal
evidence and policing. We have moved from a reliance on
fingerprinting to much more sophisticated methods such as DNA
tests and many safeguards have been built into the criminal law.
If we are to have regulations because we are bringing in
significantly different technologies I hope that, rather than
being brought in using the negative procedure, they can be laid
before the House so that the House can debate them and vote on
them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I had hoped that I had dealt with most of the
points in my lengthy introduction but obviously there are other
points that need to be addressed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam asked whether detention centre
staff would be specifically trained. Any detention centre staff
who carry out these duties will need to be specifically trained
to do so. It is not currently envisaged that that provision will
be introduced in the immediate future. The aim is to use
immigration officers, but in the longer term we want to be able
to use detention centre staff if that is appropriate and the
proper safeguards are in place. They would then be constrained
by precisely the same requirements for training in the techniques
for taking fingerprints as directly employed immigration staff.
They would also be subject to the same statutory and regulatory
constraints.
<P>
No one would be able to take fingerprints unless they were
subject to the same requirements. The scenario in which detention
centre staff would be likely to take fingerprints would be where
they worked together with an immigration officer who was present
at the time. We want to be able to ensure that, in the future,
things are done properly in the detention centres. I can assure
the hon. Gentleman that there is no intention that anyone who is
improperly regulated or improperly trained should take
fingerprints.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about new clause 42 and how hard it
is to establish age. The usual intention is to err on the side
of caution, particularly when there is a power to require the
person to come back in seven days. Where there is any doubt, it
is better to use that power rather than take fingerprints
immediately.
<P>
People are likely to be fingerprinted quickly when there are
serious doubts about their identity. That is not usually the case
with unaccompanied children: there are often other reasons why
they are unaccompanied. They will usually be either handed over
to relatives, in which case their identity is established, or
handed over to social services, in which case there is no need
for immediate fingerprinting&#151;it can be done at a more
convenient time. I can therefore provide some reassurance on
that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also asked about appropriate
adults. An appropriate adult is the parent or nearest relative
available. If no relative is available, someone from a social
services department would be required to be present. The
fingerprinting would be undertaken in the same way as for a
juvenile who was being detained for disorder or a criminal
matter. The safeguards in the codes of practice for dealing with
juveniles would have to be complied with by the immigration
officer in the same way as they would by a police officer. In
many ways we are going down a well-trodden path, in which
substantial legal safeguards are already present. As I said,
those safeguards will continue to apply.
<P>
It is worth re-making the point that we are dealing largely
with non-asylum seekers. It is likely that the victims of torture
identified by the hon. Gentleman would claim asylum and would be
covered by other provisions. Here we are dealing with people who
may have destroyed their documentation when they entered the
country, who are not seeking to claim asylum but may have other
reasons for wanting to disguise their identity. I can assure the
hon. Gentleman that anyone who is traumatised is usually
requested by the immigration service to return for fingerprints
rather than fingerprinted on the spot.
<P>
I was asked about new clause 44 and the electronic database.
A separate database&#151;separate from the police's&#151;is
intended for immigation matters, although the police will
exchange information with the immigration service under the
information-sharing provisions in the Bill. A specific reason
would be required to access the gateway, but the ability to do
so is there. The hon. Gentleman asked me whether the database
would be separate and the answer is yes.
<P>
I was also asked about asylum seekers granted ELR. Their
fingerprints will not be destroyed until they gain ILR. At that
point, they will be able to remain here indefinitely so there
would be no need to retain the identity controls that
fingerprints provide. Those granted ELR, however might make
further asylum applications in order to gain refugee status in
another identity, which has been a problem on several occasions.
ELR is obviously a temporary status: until ILR is granted,
fingerprints will be retained. At that point, however, other
provisons apply, so there are safeguards.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam and my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) raised the issue of technological
independence. Let me consider their point about the need for
regulation. Regulatory powers may cause difficulties because they
may interfere with the ability to test new technology. However,
the hon. Gentlemen raised some good points about the way in which
new technology might be introduced. I shall consider them and
perhaps come back with an amendment on Report or earlier. I shall
write to the hon. Gentlemen to tell them whether the introduction
of some powers by regulatory means would be a possible safeguard.
<P>
It is arguable that the introduction of new technology will
cause an intrusion into privacy that does not occur in
fingerprinting, so we must ensure that it is done with some care.
When I have thought about those issues, I shall write to the hon.
Gentlemen's with my proposals.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow raised a number of
other issues. First, he was concerned about the way in which new
clause 42(7)(a) would operate. We shall consider the matter with
care. People are required to have a passport on entering the UK
and, if they are released without proof of identity, we should
be able to fingerprint them to ensure that we have a hold on
their identity if they fail to come back later and are picked up
for another reason, perhaps for committing an offence. However,
we intend to table an amendment to specify that inadequately
documented arrivals will be fingerprinted only if they have no
reasonable excuse for being inadequately documented. That may
provide the safeguard that the hon. Gentleman seeks. I am
convinced by the point that he made; it was something that we
were considering and I hope that the amendment that we shall
table will satisfy some of his concerns.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then moved onto new clause 43, which
allows an arrest without a warrant to obtain a fingerprint. We
are dealing here with people who were not fingerprinted
immediately, for various reasons, but have been asked to come at
an appropriate time within a seven-day period and have their
fingerprints taken. Therefore, in a sense we are dealing with
people whom the immigration service determined, for whatever
reason, that it could trust and they have significantly breached
that trust. Therefore, if they are seen on the street, it is
difficult to see why we should require the immigration office to
find a justice of the peace to sign a warrant before he can
arrest someone who, some weeks earlier, should have presented
himself to have fingerprints taken. The person would then be
arrested so that he could go to the police station and provide
the fingerprints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> How can we ensure the delivery of the notice to
the person? If we know that somebody has had the notice and has
just ignored it, in a sense he is asking for trouble. We must
ensure that the notice is there, so that somebody is not arrested
without a warrant, not knowing why.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The aim is to ensure that the person receives
a notice. We will use our best endeavours to ensure that anyone
likely to be the subject of the provisions knows that.
<P>
In practice, the person is likely to be aware that he has
been given this trust, likely to have had a notice given into his
hands at the time and likely to have been told ``Go away. We will
not fingerprint you now, but come back within seven days.'' We
are therefore dealing with a group of people who the immigration
service does not expect to abscond or to cause problems and who
understand that they have this obligation. It will be up to the
immigration officer to make sure that such people not only have
a notice but understand that they are supposed to come back.
Otherwise the immigration officer is likely to insist that the
fingerprints be given straight away.
<P>
We are dealing with practical circumstances where this is
less of a real issue than it appears in the Bill, because they
are people about whom the immigration service has less concern
than one might think from the wording of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
These provisions mirror those in the 1993 Act and are a
mechanism by which someone is notified of the requirement. It
semns to work and does not produce substantial difficulties, so
we hope that it wil continue to do so.
<P>
Finally, we shall of course comply with the provisions of the
Data Protection Act 1984 in relation to date-sharing, but we
shall data-share with thei nvestigative authorities&#151;the
police, Customs and Excise and the National Criminal Intelligence
Service as well as the DSS. That does not contravene the data
protection legislation as such, which will otherwise apply.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part
of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Earlier in this group of clauses I expressed my
concerns about the new powers being given to immigration
officers. In that context and in the context of the use of
reasonable force in exercising those powers, the Minister wrote
to the Committee, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``immigration officers are bound by the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act (`PACE') Codes of Practice when investigating
offences and, when their powers are extended, they will be
obliged automatically to adhere to the parts of the Codes which
apply to the new powers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I am advised that section 67(9) of PACE states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Persons other than police officers who are charged with
the duty of investigating offences . . . shall in the discharge
of that duty have regard to any relevant provision of such a
code.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I read PACE correctly, immigration officers will merely
have to take account of the relevant provisions. There will not
necessarily be any disciplinary consequences. Certainly the
Immigration Law Practitioners Association believes that breaches
of the code should have specific disciplinary consequences to
ensure compliance. It asks for a specific code of practice for
immigration officers exercising these powers.
<P>
I accept that immigration officers will exercise these powers
in consultation with the police, but the picture in my mind is
of large, over-crowded estates in the east end of London; estates
where, long before immigrants, asylum seekers or black people of
any kind lived there, people in uniform were not welcome. On long
summer evenings all types of people would stand around with
nothing to do but watch what was happening in flat such-and-such
in a particular block with English not being spoken and mutual
incomprehension. Those whom immigration officers are sent to lift
often do not want to go. There will be a lot of excitement and
hysteria. It is a combustible mix, and I accept ILPA's argument
for a specific code of practice for immigration officers in that
context.
<P>
Again, ILPA has expressed its concern. It says that the
immigration service complaints unit is not an adequate&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Lady is now
beginning to discuss amendment No. 982, which is in her name.
There will be an opportunity to speak on that when we reach the
relevant part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton. You are always
on the ball.
<P>
As regards a code, the circumstances in which immigration
officers will exercise the powers are combustible. I am concerned
about ILPA's interpretation of PACE, which is that immigration
officers will simply have to ``have regard'' to the code: there
will be no disciplinary consequences as a result of breaching it.
I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The wording that the hon. Lady read out was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall have regard to these powers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not mean that they have discretion; if it did, the
words ``may have regard  . . .'' would be used. It is an
imperative, a clear direction to have regard to the powers. There
is a safeguard there.
<P>
The immigration service is subject to codes of discipline.
A Home Office staff book is given to all officers on recruitment.
Penalties for breaching standards are similar to those available
in the police service, and range from a written reprimand for a
minor matter, to dismissal. Other penalties may be posed for more
serious breaches of the code. We have already discussed the
requirement to comply with PACE. It will apply to immigration
officers in much the same way as it would to police officers. The
aim throughout has been that, in so far as we are able
practically to do so&#151;we are not always so able but in this
case we are&#151;we must create safeguards that align with those
of police officers who exercise similar powers. The hon. Member
for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) will be aware
of a difficulty with her amendment, but we shall come to that
later. There is little or no difficulty with this issue, and the
safeguards available to us as citizens as regards police
officers' behaviour will, as far as possible, be available to
those who are subject to these provisions, whether citizens or
not, if they are being administered by an immigration officer.
In so far as we are able to create it, there is symmetry of
protection, which is the approach that we have tried to offer.
The disciplinary rules relating to immigration officers and the
manner in which they will be dealt with for transgressing them
will be available to the public. I shall ensure that they are,
but I feel sure that they are available now because as the hon.
Lady knows, we published as much as we can of what, under the
previous Government, were secret rules. We published many of the
directions and, as far as I know, the code relating to
immigration officers is available. I can assure the hon. Lady
that if it is not, it soon will be.

<H4><center>Management of detention centres</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> There is likely to be broad support for the
aims of the clause. We sought to comply with the suggestion from
Sir David Ramsbotham, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, that there
should be a statutory basis for dealing with private detentions.
I trust that the clause will have the support of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister is right to assert that the clause
has the support of my hon. Friends at least because it is what
the chief inspector wanted. Will he clarify for the record two
aspects of the clause? Subsection (2) relates to the Secretary
of State's approval of the detention centre manager. How will the
approval process work? If the private prison sector has a
comparable process, to what extent will the Secretary of State
give his approval, and how will he effect that?
<P>
Subsection (5) constrains in several ways
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The manager of a detention centre . . . except in cases
of urgency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are there comparable instances in which ``cases of urgency''
are defined? That will help us to understand when a case of
urgency is deemed to have kicked in and the manager of a
detention centre need to resort to paragraphs (a) (b) and (c).
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal with the first point raised by the
hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Any person appointed as a manager of a contracted-out
detention centre must be a detainee custody officer certified in
accordance with the Bill, and his appointment must be approved
by the Secretary of State. The Home Office will therefore be able
to say that someone is not suitable. That will provide a
statutory framework and a consistent approach for the management
of detention centres.
<P>
Clause 119 (5) deals with circumstances in which the manager
of a contracted-out detention centre may order an emergency
search. Such circumstances may include rioting, trauma or someone
being taken ill. We hope that the manager could tackle such
urgent matters without the imposition of the restrictions
specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).
<P>
The words ``cases or urgency'' are also used in section 85
of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and, in that context, have not
caused difficulty for private sector prisons. We want to give
private sector detention centres a statutory basis. As Sir David
Ramsbotham has suggested, we can fall back on provisions relating
to privately-run prisons.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to take the opportunity to register Liberal
Democrat opposition to the contracting-out of prison and
detention functions. A key element of our Liberal beliefs is that
the deprivation of liberty should be a matter for officers of the
state and should not be commercially contracted-out. I state that
opposition, although I know that it will not get us anywhere.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 123</center></H4>
<H4><center>Visiting Committees and inspections</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 974, in page 78, line
37, leave out `may' and insert `must'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 441, in page 78, line 42, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) to ensure that information on conditions of detention
and procedures for making complaints are available to detainees
and that reasonable steps are taken to make such information
available to detainees in a language they can understand'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We move on to visiting committees and the
inspection of detention centres.
<P>
The idea is, in general, welcome, and we support clause 123's
proposals for setting up such committees. The Bill offers
visiting committees various options for carrying out their
functions. Amendment No. 441 would like those functions
mandatory.
<P>
I hope that the Minister accepts the amendment. The functions
set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are the minimum functions
for any visiting committee. I fail to see the value of having a
visiting committee that does not carry out those functions. I
would be very concerned if visiting committees were set up and
did not perform them.
<P>
It is important that detainees know that all visiting
committees will visit centres, hear complaints and report to the
Secretary of State on any matter that the committees consider it
expedient to report. Substituting the word ``may'' with ``must''
would clarify the role of visiting committees. Such clarity is
important not only for the committees, but for detainees, who
would feel that a genuine exercise was being undertaken and that
the functions listed in the clause were not optional extras.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 441, which
would add a paragraph (d) to subsection (3). The wording largely
speaks for itself.
<P>
There is no point in the great and the good visiting
detention centres to check on conditions and to hear the
complaints of detainees if the detainees are informed in advance
who is going to descend upon them and what their purpose is.
Unless such information is given to detainess in their own
languages, they will not be able to make any sensible
contribution when a board of visitors comes round. They will not
be able to say that they should have conditions X when they have
conditions Y. Furthermore, they will not be able to voice their
complaints.
<P>
The amendment is sensible and it would not cause the Minister
any harm to add it to the clause. He might say that it is not
necessary, because the Government will apply the same conditions
that apply in prisons. However, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of
subsection (3) will require a board of visitors to perform
certain functions. Therefore, it would not be an exceptionally
onerous task to include a paragraph (d) requiring information to
be made available in advance to detainees, so that they can make
a sensible contribution when boards of visitors make their tours
of inspection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have considerable sympathy for the
reasoning behind the amendments. I assure the Committee that
detention centre rules will require visiting committees to report
to the Secretary of State along the lines provided for in
subsection (3). That is what visiting committees are already
required to do and the clause will give statutory effect to that.
I also reassure the Committee that the rules will require that
information on conditions of detention and procedures for making
complaints are available to detainees. There will be reasonable
attempts to make such information available in the languages that
detainees can understand.
<P>
The aim of clause 123 is to ensure that visiting committees
are appointed for every detention centre and to ensure that rules
are made to set out their functions. The equivalent provision in
the Prison Act 1952 requires that prison rules must make
provision for the type of functions listed in subsection (3).
<P>
I agree that detention centre rules should set out for
visiting committees the type of rules described in subsection
(3). I am sympathetic to amendment No. 974, and I am willing to
agree to it in principle. However, I would like the parliamentary
draftsman to consider the wording further so as to ensure that
flexibility is retained on how the relevant provisions are
reflected in the rules.
<P>
The list of requirements set out in subsection (3) is
non-exhaustive. It is intended that detention centre rules, which
will be laid down in a statutory instrument, will set out the
functions of visiting committees in detail. One of the functions
will be to monitor and to report on the proper implementation of
detention centre rules, including those requiring proper
provision of information for detainees.
<P>
I see no reason to cover all the intended provisions of the
rules for visiting committees in a subsection of the Bill. I do
not want to prejudice the importance that might be attached to
other aspects of the rules relating to detention centres that the
hon. Member for Hallam has not thought of or specified for
inclusion in the subsection. It might set the kilter of the
regulations out of balance. I agree with the concept behind the
amendment, but this is not the appropriate place to apply it:
good idea, wrong place.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is nice to be in agreement on clauses for a
change.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A bit like Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr Allan:</B> Indeed, agreement after much heartache.
<P>
The Minister has said clearly that he accepts the intention
behind the amendment&#151;that the subsection should set out a
compulsory minimum rather than an optional set of functions. I
am happy to leave it to the good offices of the parliamentary
draftsmen to devise the appropriate wording. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I seek the Minister's assurance that when
visiting committees are established, the Secretary of State will
appoint sufficient numbers of people who can deal sensitively
with asylum-seeking children. It is important for any visiting
committee to relate to, and hopefully gain the confidence of, any
children who are detained. I am not suggesting that children
should be appointed&#151;on the grounds that they are the only
ones likely to relate to other children&#151;but not all members
of the visiting committee should be the senior great and good.
I accept, of course, that some older people can relate easily to
children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am depressed at the right hon. Gentleman's
pessimism that we are going to fail to pass a later amendment to
ban the keeping of children in detention centres, which would
render the amendment unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is my experience that the Minister seldom
accepts many of the sensible amendments that are proposed by the
various opposition parties. If the Minister of State, Lord
Chancellor's Department (Mr. Hoon) were to return, I might be
more optimistic because he had a concession-making habit in the
early hours of the morning. I cannot remember how many amendments
he accepted. I am pessimistic that the Minister will accept the
amendment to which the hon. Member for Hallam referred. I make
the small but genuine point that if children are detained, some
of their visitors must be able to deal sensitively with them. The
visitors should hear what the children have to say and not always
accept the word of adults.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Children are very rarely detained. Yes, we
seek to reflect a range of backgrounds and qualities in
appointments to the visiting committees. If children were
detained, we would hope that visitors would be sensitive to their
needs.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I shall make just a brief point. The clause sets
out the arrangements for the appointment of detainee custody
officers. Will the Minister confim that the Government intend
pre-employment checks to be carried out on those authorised to
perform escort or custodial functions? We spent some time in the
House one Friday recently debating that issue with respect to
those who look after children. I assume that full pre-employment
checks will be carried out. Will the Minister give an assurance
that detention centre staff and those moving detainees will have
relevant training in how to deal sensitively and appropriately
with children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To reinforce that point, can we have an assurance
that police checks&#151;expected as a basic minimum&#151;will
not be the only checks carried out? Other indices&#151;the
DFEE-held list 99, the Department of Health's consultancy index
and so forth&#151;with information on people at risk of harming
children, should also be taken into account. We, as the state,
are, against my better judgment, employing third-party
contractors to look after people in detention. I hope that all
the checks will be carried out, because the private security
industry has not always had the best record in terms of who it
employs. We await a formal set of regulations from the Government
in respect of the private security industry, which is not yet in
place.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Pre-employment checks are already in place and
detention custody officers will be given specific training to
deal with children, if children are detained in a detention
centre. The Home Office departmental security officer already
carries out checks on all the DCOs.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 125 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Detainee Custody Officers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 446, in page 104,
line 18, leave out from `level' to the end of the line and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`5 on the standard scale or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding six months or to both.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 918.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Again I shall be brief. The amendment seeks to
increase the penalty to level 5 on the standard scale or a
maximum of six months. Is the Minister content that level 4 is
a heavy enough penalty to punish someone who obtains a
certificate of authorisation as a detainee custody officer by
making a false statement? It is a serious offence. What is the
Minister's justification for a level 4 rather than a higher
penalty?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We considered the penalty and believe that it
is appropriate. The aim of paragraph 1 of schedule 9 is to create
an offence of obtaining certification as a custody detainee
officer by false pretences. The penalty will help to deter those
who may not be fit to carry out the duties of a detainee custody
officer. It will also make those working in the private sector
accountable for false statements in the same way as those who are
employed by the state. Those who practise deception with a view
to obtaining a certificate of authorisation should be charged
and, if convicted, punished, but I do not believe that a prison
sentence is necessary or proportionate.
<P>
However, I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says. In the
light of his earlier comments that paedophiles may seek to obtain
such jobs, we shall look at it again, although I emphasise that
the number of children detained for any length of time in a
detention centre is so small that we do not believe that it is
a likely target for paedophiles. However, I shall consider
whether we have sufficient punishing powers.
<P>
Amendment No. 446 would impose a heavier penalty on detainee
custody officers than is currently available to the courts in
respect of prisoner custody officers committing the same offence,
and there is a need for symmetry.
<P>
Amendment No. 918 is one that I hope the Committee will
accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> In view of the Minister's assurances that he
will ensure that there is symmetry, I shall not press the
amendment. We were dealing a couple of weeks ago with the
Protection of Children Bill, which I hope will soon be an Act.
If there is a level 4 penalty in that and other measures for
those who seek to obtain a certificate of employment in order to
work with children, I should be happy with level 4 here, but it
is important to have symmetry. It is an area of employment where
people might perceive the penalty to be less if they want to work
with children.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 973, in page 105, line 22, leave out
`2 and 3' and insert `4 and 5'.&#151;[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 977, in
page 105, line 25, leave out `or otherwise'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendment No. 977 examines the identification of
the detention custody officer. Schedule 9 (6) states that a
detainee custody officer is only to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``be regarded as acting in accordance with escort
arrangements''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when he is readily identifiable by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a uniform or badge which he is wearing or otherwise''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We think that ``otherwise'' should not be included. If we are
going to define conditions for the detainee custody officer to
be identifiable, such identification should be via a uniform or
badge. If there were to be a complaint or other problem and the
issue of identification arose, to be acting without a uniform or
badge would make identifying the officer extremely difficult.
<P>
Detainee custody officers have had problems with
identification themselves, as became clear when they went to
trial over disturbances at Campsfield house. A badge is the only
sensible way of identifying custody officers. The wording ``or
otherwise'' would lead to people claiming all sorts of
identification.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall suggest circumstances in which it might
not be appropriate to have a uniform.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that detention centre rules will
make clear that detainee custody officers engaged in escort
functions should be readily identifiable. However, a degree of
flexibility is required to deal with certain exceptional
circumstances in which security or political concerns might
require a less conspicuous presence. For example, there are
occasions on which detainees have to be escorted to funerals or
hospitals for inpatient treatment. Security situations may
require that we expose certain detainees to as little public
observation as possible.
<P>
In such situations, it is envisaged that the rules will
require detainee custody officers to be identifiable by the
detainee who is being escorted, but not necessarily to be readily
identifiable by members of the public.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the words ``or
otherwise'' have a useful and practical purpose in such
circumstances. I suspect that he would approve of such a purpose
in the sort of circumstances in which we intend to use it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I feel like a paranoiac after that eminently
reasonable and sensible explanation. I regret that I could think
that detainee officers might have nefarious reasons for wishing
to be anonymous when they are simply trying to be humane when
attending funerals, hospitals and so on. I shall not press the
matter any further.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A penalty notice under sub-paragraph (2) must specify
those items which may not be brought into a detention
centre'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Schedule 10 deals with discipline at detention
centres. Paragraph (7)(1) makes provision for contractors of
contracted-out detention centres to ensure that there is a
penalty notice in a conspicuous place and paragraph (8)(1) makes
provision for the Secretary of State to do something similar for
other detention centres. Paragraph 7(3) states that a penalty
notice should set out what constitutes transgression of the
rules.
<P>
We want to ensure that everything set out in the rules is
specified in the penalty notice. Visitors to detention centres
must know what items they can or cannot take into a centre. If
they breach the rules, they will be guilty of a criminal offence.
<P>
We do not want people to take into a detention centre drugs,
alcohol or equipment that would assist someone to escape.
However, that fact needs to be spelt out explicitly in the
penalty notice. That would not only be fair to the visitors, but
would make the rules as effective as possible. The Minister
rightly wants to put up penalty notices, but there must be a
direct link between them and the articles that we are telling
people not to bring into the centres.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that detention
centre rules will require the prominent display of a list of
prohibited items, so that no one entering a centre will be in any
doubt as to what items will constitute an offence under
paragraphs 4, 5 and 6(1) of the schedule.
<P>
The paragraph 6(2) offence is drafted intentionally wide in
order to prohibit the placing of any items just outside the
detention centre with the intention that they come into the
possession of a detainee. It would be inappropriate for the items
relating to this offence to be set out in any notice or rules.
<P>
As paragraph 7 points out, a penalty notice is intended to
draw attention to the penalties to which a person might be liable
if he commits an offence under paragraphs 4, 5 or 6. I submit
that the inclusion of a list of prohibited items would be
inappropriate in such a notice.
<P>
As drafted, the provisions are entirely consistent with the
equivalent legislation applying to prisons. I see no reason to
adopt a different approach towards detention centres.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 980 and 981 would amend paragraph 7 of the
schedule and would require the penalty notice to list the items
that cannot be conveyed to a detention centre. As drafted, the
amendments would limit the list of prohibited items only to those
that may not be brought into a centre. That would be inconsistent
with amendment No. 979, which relates to items that may not be
left outside the centre. The need for such a list in relation to
paragraph 6(1) offences will be addressed in detention centre
rules. Amendment Nos. 978 and 980 are therefore unnecessary.
<P>
For the reasons that I have just given, amendments Nos. 979
and 981 would unnecessarily limit the paragraph 6(2) offence and
are inapproriate. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We sought some clarity on the operation of the
penalty notice, and the Minister has provided enough. Therefore,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Tenth schedule
to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Again, I want to refer to the issue of children
in detention centres and to the penalties that might be applied
to them for breaches of the rules.
<P>
Some time ago, when we were setting up youth detention
centres, I had responsibility for considering their rules. A huge
number of rules had to be drawn up on how one could detain
children and punish them if rules were breached. Those rules
applied to children, or young people, who had committed some
appalling crimes. They were guilty of what I shall describe as
``misbehaviour''. The rules on how they could be punished and on
the regime in place had to be very detailed.
<P>
Has the Minister given thought to the sort of penalties that
might be imposed on the few young people who might be detained
in detention centres and who have broken the rules and to the
regime for young people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> In practical terms, the answer is no. It
is not envisaged that people aged under 18 will be detained in
the centres other than when they are held overnight before being
handed over to social services. The only exception is when they
are detained with their parents or any adult with a view to their
removal. That will be for only a short period before they are put
on a plane and leave the country. It is intended that the
circumstances with which the right hon. Gentleman is more
familiar, in which immigration offenders are kept in detention
centres for a long peirod, will not arise. It is not therefore
necessary to create a system of penalties to be imposed on people
under 18, because if they are under 18&#151;except in the
limited circumstances that I have outlined&#151;they are not
supposed to be there.
<P>
Question put and agree to.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 10 agreed to.
<P>
Clause 127 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 11 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 128</center></H4>
<H4><center>Wrongful disclosure of information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendmet No. 975, in page 81, line
5, after `duty', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if so ordered by a court,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 976, in
page 81, line 7, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`whether or not that person is still detained at the time of
disclosure.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr Allan:</B> We welcome the clause to which the amendments
relate because it will prevent the disclosure of information
about detainees and therefore protect them. The amedments seek
to clarify an issue that arises from the duty not to disclose,
in which an individual working at a detention centre could
transgress the provisions in the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 975 seeks to make it clear that if a court case
arose because of something that happened in a detention centre,
the court could order the individual's detainee custody officer
to disclose information. The Secretary of State could authorise
that disclosure, as the clause states that a person is guilty of
an offence if he discloses information.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise than in the cours of his duty or as authorised
by the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it would be sensible to make it absolutely explicit
so that there is no confusion. Thus if there were a court
case&#151;for example, a coroner's inquiry into a death in
custody, or a criminal trial arising from events that had taken
place in a detention centre&#151;it would be helpful for the
detainee custody officers if the Bill stated that a court could
order them to breach their duty of disclosure.
<P>
Amendment No. 976 would make clear who is protected against
wrongful disclosure of information. The clause as drafted refers
to a particular detained person; we want it to be made clear that
the protection exists both for those currently in detention and
those who have previously been detained when the information was
acquired by the detainee custody officer during the period of
detention. The amendment would put in the Bill the fact that the
duty not to disclose exists whether or not the person was still
detained at the time of disclosure. There would thus be no doubt
that the detainee custody officer's duty not to disclose
information, and his liability to penalty if he does so
wrongfully, carries on after the point at which a person has been
released from detention.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> When a detainee custody officer seeks to obey
a court order there is no question of that person committing an
offence under these provisions or having a problem with the
Secretary of State or his employer. A witness called before a
court has an obligation to disclose material information; there
must be a good reason why that information would not be
disclosed. That is why there were arguments in the Matrix
Churchill case about whether certain matters could be withheld
from the courts.
<P>
There would be no problem in a person who wished to do so
disclosing information in the proper pursuit of a court case, nor
would the Secretary of State, or anyone else, place any
restriction on their doing so. It is difficult to see in what
circumstances, other than those of a public interest immunity
certificate, it would be possible to prevent a court from having
access to proper and relevant information. I hope that I can
reassure the hon. Gentleman in that regard.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is also the case that in the Bill as drafted, the offence
of wrongful disclosure of information by a detainee custody
officer is related only to those occasions when the person who
is the subject of the information is still detained. The same
interpretation has been given to section 91 of the Criminal
Justice Act on which clause 128 is based. The aim of the hon.
Member for Hallam seems to be that there should be no disclosure
after the detention has ceased to have effect. I want to
reconsider that point, because we have tried to achieve a
consistency between the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act
and the Bill. I had assumed that that would provide us with the
certainty that we required, but I shall reconsider the matter and
write to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response and for
his clarification of the amendment. If the aim of the clause is
to prevent damage being done to the detained person by the
wrongful disclosure of information, such damage could equally be
done when the person has left detention. If, under the bail
provisions for example, people can leave detention earlier, a
detainee custody officer giving information about someone he has
just released from detention could be as harmful as releasing
that information while the individual is still detained.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way. I have checked the provision and sought advice and it
appears that our proposal will cover the point that the hon.
Gentleman raised. In the case of a person subsequently released
there will be a restriction on the disclosure of information. Now
that I have had a further opportunity to consider the measure I
can confirm that the hon. Gentleman's fears are unwarranted and
the amendment unnecessary.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I would not want to miss this opportunity to
restate my anxieties about turning marriage registrars into
immigration officers. In earlier debates, various concerns were
expressed about the exercise of these powers, particularly with
respect to mixed-race marriages, because they could cause
significant damage to individuals.
<P>
I understand that some people seek to use marriage as a means
of getting round immigration rules, but it is a question of
balance. The Government are setting up additional systems and new
powers rather than restating existing practice. They are giving
registrars a new legal power to require the presentation of
documents, which will inevitably lead to difficulties and
hardships for individuals who should be passing through a joyous
phase. In some cases, the implied suspicion in having to produce
documents will be unwarranted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We have already debated that earlier in our
proceedings so I shall not rehearse the arguments. The provisions
are straightforward and I do not accept that they will create the
hardship that the hon. Gentleman suggests. In most cases, they
are easily complied with. The hon. Gentleman's objections have
already been aired.

16A.&#151;(1) If the registrar refuses to issue a

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part
of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I would like some clarification. The clause
provides the possibility to obtain redress where there are
problems. However, it refers to frivolous refusal, yet motives
or forces other than frivolousness may be at work.
<P>
I should like to clarify what damages are recoverable by an
applicant refused a marriage certificate when the
Registrar-General deems it to have been frivolous. Will the
damages include compensation for distress&#151;emotional
distress would clearly be a major component&#151;as well as for
the costs of arranging a marriage and having to cancel it? We all
hope that marriages will not go wrong, but we must be clear about
the damages that can be awarded if they do.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Damages would be for the courts to determine in
the normal way. Let me make it clear that the powers relate to
refusal to issue a certificate of marriage when the registrar is
satisfied that there is no lawful impediment but is not satisfied
that one or both of the couple are legally free to contract a
marriage&#151;for example, due to being under age, bigamy or the
registrar's suspicions of impersonation. As I said, it will be
for the courts to determine an appropriate level of damages under
the normal rules.

New clause 40&#151;Immigration Complaints Authority&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `.&#151;The Secretary of State shall establish an
independent Immigration Complaints Authority to deal with
complaints arising from the exercise of the powers contained in
Part VII of the Act.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> New clause 39 deals with a matter that I mentioned
about earlier&#151;my concern about the new powers for
immigration officers in the social context of some immigrant
communities. The Minister assured me earlier in our deliberations
that PACE will affect immigration officers, and that they can be
made subject to disciplinary action. With that in mind, I shall
not press new clause 39.
<P>
New clause 40 relates to the establishment of an independent
immigration complaints authority to handle complaints arising
from the exercise of the new powers. It has been put to me and
other members of the Committee by the Independent Law
Practitioners Association that what is needed is a genuinely
independent complaints authority. The Minister knows of the
long-running debate about the Police Complaints Authority and
about it not merely being independent but being seen to be so.
There is a case for an independent immigration complaints
authority along the lines of the PCA. I hope that the Minister
will consider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> On new clause 40, the Minister has helpfully
provided us with a document outlining how complaints against the
immigration service now work. That is useful context for this
debate but it gives us some cause for concern, especially in
light of the Minister's statement that the Government intend to
dramatically step up removals and to take even more vigorous
action against people who are in the country illegally&#151;as
they are entitled to do&#151;and that part of the purpose behind
the new powers for immigration service officers is to give them
the resources to do all that. So it is clear that the scope for
complaints against those officers will increase dramatically.
<P>
The Minister gave us certain reassurances today about this
being developed slowly. He said that it will not happen
overnight, and that there will be training and codes of practice.
But all that will not be effective unless there is a truly
trusted and independent method of establishing fault and learning
from things that went wrong.
<P>
Under the current system set out by the Minister, initially
a complaint would go to the immigration service complaints unit
to be investigated. He said that there is to be a non-statutory
but independent complaints audit authority which will oversee the
complaints made to the IS complaints unit. Having a complaints
unit and then simply an audit committee is far less than applies
to the police&#151;which have the independent Police Complaints
Authority. The powers of investigation will be unsatisfactory
given the circumstances that might arise. We must bear in mind
that, at worst, the system might have to deal with complaints
resulting from deaths in a traumatic situation, such as a
difficult arrest. That is the worst extreme, but the complaints
mechanism should be capable of dealing with such cases as well
as more straightforward complaints of incivility and so on.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The police model is the most appropriate because different
levels of complaint can be activated. The immigration service
complaints unit will be adequate to deal with the straightforward
complaints about alleged incivility or minor misdemeanours that
a local police force handles. However, more serious complaints
about unnecessary damage to property, failure to act within the
appropriate tems of a warrant or resulting from serious injury
or even death might be made. Therefore, we need a more rigorous
and independent body to investigate such complaints. Crucially,
it must have the necessary resources.
<P>
At the first level, complaints made against the police are
investigated by officers from an independent, or
semi-independent, complaints unit within the same force. At the
next level, officers from another force are called in to
investigate. The ability for investigations to be carried out by
people not directly involved in delivering the service is
important. However, there is no suggestion in the Bill that the
system will allow for investigations to be carried out by anyone
other than members of the immigration service.
<P>
The only exceptions will be cases involving criminal
investigations. However, criminal investigations might not be
appropriate for even the most serious complaints. It might be
better for them to be dealt with by the immigration service, but
only if it has the power to set up rigorous investigations that
may lead to the avoidance of similar problems in the future.
<P>
The Minister said that the complaints system needs to be
reviewed in light of the extension of immigration officers'
powers. How does he intend to carry out that review? In
particular, does he have any plans to create, at the highest
level, a broader and more representative body? Such a body should
be at more of an arm's length from the Home Secretary than the
current complaints audit committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Lest there be any confusion, may I assure
the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington that we
intend the PACE powers to apply? In order to make sure that they
do and to remove the confusion that may have arisen in some
organisations, including ILPA, we shall table an amendment. That
will make it clear that immigration officers exercising powers
provided by part VII of the Bill or under schedule 2 to the
Immigration Act 1971 will have regard to relevant provisions in
the PACE code. The Bill might have created some doubt, so we
shall ensure that the position is clarified.
<P>
The hon. Lady also mentioned a statutory authority. I do not
deny that there is an argument for one. I do not support the
creation of one at this point, but I do not have a closed mind
nor have the Government. At some point in the future, we might
look to establish one, but I do not think that that time is now.
<P>
We intend to operate much the same system, but to have a
small group of enforcement officers carrying out enforcement
work. Initially, we shall look to have 20 officers, but
establishing the whole regime of a statutory organisation, such
as the Police Complaints Authority, would be a large step. We do
not intend to do that now.
<P>
I accept that an effective complaints system is vital to
maintaining confidence in the way in which immigration officers
operate. In our view, an effective system with independent
monitoring is in place, and we do not believe that, at this stage
at least, it is necessary to set up a new statutory organisation
that would not provide much more than the current level of
scrutiny.
<P>
An independent body, the complaints audit committee, was set
up in 1994 to monitor the investigation of complaints against
immigration officers. Members of the committee are appointed by
my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and must meet certain
criteria, including experience in race relations, community
relations, immigration law, customer relations and local or
central Government. They are given unfettered access to all
complaint investigations and can&#151;and from time to time
do&#151;make critical comment on the quality of investigations
and conclusions. They can do so openly and effectively, to ensure
that things are done properly. The committee is required to
produce an annual report to the Secretary of State, and the Home
Office must respond to the committee's recommendations and
criticisms.
<P>
I have written to you, Mr. Maxton, and to members of the
Special Standing Committee enclosing a paper that details our
present complaints procedure and outlines further measures that
we intend to take to strengthen them. Those measures including
looking urgently at issues such as managing the cases under a
separate handling process, notifying the complaints audit
committee as soon as possible after receipt of a complaint,
appointing specially trained investigators to carry out
investigations and reviewing the process 12 months after the
provisions have come into force to assess their effectiveness.
That is the point at which we shall consider whether to go to the
considerable expense and effort of setting up a statutory body
to oversee this exercise.
<P>
We shall treat complaints arising from the exercise of these
new powers separately from the others. We intend that they will
be investigated by a small team of specially trained officers,
who will have knowledge of enforcement law and practice and of
the PACE codes. We shall ask the complaints audit committee to
monitor each complaint from the outset to ensure that the
investigation is receiving the necessary attention and priority
and that the matter is property investigated.
<P>
In the early stages we shall ensure that the powers are used
satisfactorily and appropriately in all circumstances and that
the work carried out by the enforcement officers is of a high
standard. The success of the exercise will depend on that.
Therefore, there is a strong incentive to ensure that the
complaints audit committee does its work. We shall monitor that
after 12 months and consider whether we should set up another
body or whether the Police Complaints Authority or a similar body
might have a role to play in certain investigations.
<P>
For the moment, given the nature of the pilot scheme, the
stage that we have reached, the systems that are in place and the
added extras that we are seeking to put in place to monitor the
new exercise, we believe that the scheme will provide adequate
safeguards. We do not have a closed mind about setting up a
statutory body. At some stage we shall review the issue and reach
a conclusion. I hope that, on that basis, the amendment can be
withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I listened with interest to what my honourable
Friend the Minister said. On codes of practice, I am sure that
the Immigration Law Practitioners Association and other
organisations will be glad that the Government intend to make the
position clear by tabling an amendment. Rightly or wrongly,
immigration officers do not have a great reputation for cultural
sensitivity in carrying out their work. One of the great
campaigns among ethnic minorities was a campaign in the 1980s
against immigration officers who tested the virginity of young
Asian women coming into the country by physical examination.
<P>
It will reassure many people if the Bill says that PACE
applies to them and that they can be subject to disciplinary
action. On that basis I shall not press the new clause. On the
question of complaints, it is always said that doctors bury their
mistakes, immigration officers are in the unfortunate position
of deporting theirs.
<P>
Even though it may seem disproportionate to the Minister it
is important to ensure that an effective, widely respected and
independent system of complaints is available. I am reassured
that the Government do not have a closed mind. I would never
consider the Minister to have a close mind&#151;strange perhaps,
but not closed. I am glad that Ministers are willing to commit
themselves to reviews at the appropriate time. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.
