							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The
Association of Colleges gave evidence to this Committee on 22 January,
as I am sure you know. I asked them what they felt about the new duty
placed on colleges to promote good attendance. Sue Dutton of the
association saw this duty as an extension to collect information on
education maintenance allowances. Her view was that:</div>
					<a name="080129136000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is obviously
onerous on institutions to have to collect that level of
detail,&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>

					<a name="080129136000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">How do
you interpret the duty contained in the Bill to promote good
attendance? How will colleges work with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>local education authorities to enforce these
arrangements &#151;are you resourced, geared up and staffed
specifically to do this
job?</div>
					<a name="080129136000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Ioan
Morgan:
							</b>
						</i> I am happy to take that one. My college has
recently benefited from a full Ofsted inspection which finished last
Friday. One of the features of the outstanding grade that the college
got was its very high attendance rates&#151;well into the 90s. That
is done through the fact that we offer very good teaching and an
appropriate product. If those two elements are in place, attendance is
something that follows. The element of compulsion is interesting, but I
think that the success or failure of the volume of attendance at a
college is about the issues and characteristics that I have
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="080129136000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleges
are now very much measured on attendance performance. When inspectors
come into a college one of the first things they look for are measures
of attendance as an indicator of health. At Warwickshire college we
have many systems in place for monitoring attendance. We have at-risk
systems which flag up students who are not attending and so on. Working
with the local authority to co-ordinate and correlate that information
is something that we could do.</div>
					<a name="080129136000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would go further. One of the
issues for us is the compulsion element for students who would be on
work experience, working with employers, and the onerous duty that
employers would have. In our partnership work with companies, we try to
relieve companies of that burden now. Colleges could have a role in
helping companies, small and large, to look after the compulsion and
monitoring element within the Bill.</div>

							<a name="080129136000349"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> So what you are really saying is that the
Association of Colleges representatives are wrong and this provision is
not onerous? Perhaps you might comment further and say whether they are
right about the Connexions database, which they say is not fit for
purpose in these terms. I appreciate that your college is exceptional
in this regard&#151;I have visited and it is a model of good
practice&#151;but this duty is going to apply to all colleges. Is the
Association of Colleges wrong about the Connexions database not being
fit for purpose and about this duty being onerous? This is not about
promoting the best; it is about what you have to do in every
case.</div>
					<a name="080129136000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Paul
Head:
							</b>
						</i> I do not think it is onerous, because it is
exactly what a college should be doing. If you are a skills-based
college, preparing people for the world of work, the expectation of 100
per cent. attendance is what should be there. All the colleges that I
have visited have systems in place to monitor attendance and
punctuality. We already work with the local authority on the 14 and
15-year-olds who have not been successful in school and who attend our
institution full time&#151;we have to do attendance reports on them.
We also have more than 300 14 and 15-year-olds doing tasters every
Wednesday and every Friday and we have to do attendance reports on
them. So we have to do it and good colleges will do it. The vast
majority of colleges will not see it as onerous but as part of their
key task.</div>
					<a name="080129136000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view on
the Connexions database is that it would be a mistake to take a
database that has been developed for one set of purposes and believe
that it can suddenly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>fulfil another set of purposes. I do not know the detail of whether it
can be adapted or changed but, having worked in the sector for a number
of years, all my experience of IT systems suggests that you cannot take
one and make it do something else. The AOC is dead right to flag up a
concern now, when we have plenty of time to plan for implementation. It
is right to say, &#147;If you are going to do this, look carefully at
what the Connexions database was designed to do and work out what you
want it to do now.&#148; I suspect the transition from one to the
other will be quite
complicated.</div>

								Ian
Pryce:
							</b>
						</i> Yes. We have similar systems to the two
colleges that have just reported. I do not see the reporting
requirements as a major issue. It is hard to talk about the Connexions
database because we do not come into contact with that. Our role is
more about providing information about our own students. I do not see
an
issue.</div>

					<a name="080129136000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, as you will know, said in a document published yesterday,
that companies such as McDonald&#146;s will be allowed to issue their
own qualifications. The Foster report of 2005 talked about a galaxy of
oversight bodies in the further education sector&#151;17. Given the
new obligations in this Bill and the, hopefully, central role FE will
play in extending educational opportunity for people from 16 onwards,
do FE colleges have the autonomy they need to develop strong links with
business and their communities? Do you feel that the machinery of
government changes have been helpful in respect of funding in
particular? Would you like to see a move to greater
self-regulation?</div>
					<a name="080129136000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Ioan
Morgan:
							</b>
						</i> The opportunity for self-regulation that is
being extended to our sector by the present Government is something
that I welcome and I know that a significant number of my colleagues
feel the same way. It is an element of recognition of the trust in and
the maturity of the sector.</div>
					<a name="080129136000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Foster report, which I was
happy to contribute to, was an opportunity for the sector to focus on
what was important in terms of the skills agenda in this country. The
Foster report gave us the opportunity to concentrate and develop close,
meaningful links with companies. Some colleges were doing it before but
since the Foster report and that energy injection in to that agenda,
the majority of colleges have now formed very good links. That was
something commented on in a number of recent Ofsted
reports&#151;really deep and meaningful links with companies, sharing
a vision of the future, picking up the skills agenda and helping
companies who want to inward invest in an area or indigenous companies
to grow and develop. Good-quality FE colleges are now among the first
ports of call to see what they can contribute to the skills agenda. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>
					</div>
					<a name="080129136000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">So my
response in terms of self-regulation is an
enthusiastic welcome. As for working with companies,
that absolutely central to the role of a college such
as
mine.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Ian
Pryce:
							</b>
						</i> Autonomy has been very important for colleges
and it is one of the reasons why the sector has been very successful
over the past 15 years. It is important to have a good relationship
with the local authority, but as long as that autonomy is preserved we
will continue to be successful.</div>
					<a name="080129136000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would prefer a national
funding system, partly for administrative reasons. At Bedford college,
we draw students from more than 100 local authorities, so having a
relationship with that many bodies would be very difficult and might
deny people the opportunity to come for specialist subjects such as
sustainable technologies.</div>
					<a name="080129136000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the McDonald&#146;s development. On balance, I come down in favour of
compulsion to stay on, with the necessary proviso that all employers
must be able to offer apprenticeships so they have to become more
flexible. We have to achieve an increased volume of apprenticeships,
and I see that development as part of the way of doing that&#151;as
long as companies can offer high-quality programmes. Quality is clearly
an issue, but as long as there is high quality, then I have no problem
with that.</div>
					<a name="080129136000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Paul
Head:
							</b>
						</i> I agree completely with all
of that. I think we can only welcome that the big national companies
actually want to have nationally recognised qualifications for their
employees. Nobody has any problem with Microsoft-accredited IT
training, because that qualification has industry currency. So, it can
only be welcomed that big employers can become Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority-approved. And I think the big bit is that it is
QCA-approved&#151;that there is quality control over those
qualifications. I think the same applies to the Bill&#146;s clause
that gives colleges the ability to award qualifications. My own view
there was that, if they have local, regional and national currency, and
they meet a market demand, colleges should be able to do them. And that
is part of a strong self-regulated
sector.</div>
					<a name="080129136000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the machinery of Government changes, I personally welcome the fact that
we have a Cabinet Minister sitting in Cabinet now. I hope that,
regardless of the nature or flavour of the Government, that will
continue in the future. That someone actually gets up in the morning
and is worried about Britain&#146;s skills base, and is not just
dominated by schools and universities, is a really good thing. We have
to do some detailed working through on the relationship between the
Department for Innovation, University and Skills and the Department for
Children, Schools and Families.</div>
					<a name="080129136000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the re-engagement of
local authorities in a leadership role through local area agreements,
multi-area agreements and all those kind of things, as that has to be
in the interest of children up to the age of 18 under Every Child
Matters, and so on. It is down to the Government, in the detailed
administration of colleges, to find ways of actually working together
in the interests of young people, so I think the machinery of
government changes have to be
welcomed.</div>
					<a name="080129136000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be honest, people worry too much about galaxies of organisations
covering further education; I cannot get too upset about it. Everyone
creates new things; they come and they go. Our job is about delivering 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>high-quality education and training, and doing that in the most
cost-effective and efficient way possible. That is about having good
employer links, good links to local authorities, and, most of all, an
undying passion that what matters is student success rates, be it in
the workplace or your own institution. You ignore the noise that we all
have to live with&#151;we are paid to deal with it&#151;and focus
on the
learner.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Ioan
Morgan:
							</b>
						</i> May I come back on that? I think one of the
areas I would flag as a potential danger, though, is that we have to
make sure that we distinguish between qualifications and skills. We
happen to measure lots of targets in terms of qualifications, but what
industry wants is skills. There is a difference. Qualifications are
often a convenient measurement, but we must not take our eye off the
fact that we have to look at real, hard-nosed skills that will make a
difference in the future&#151;and they are
different.</div>

Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> The AOC
has been quoted already this morning on a couple of occasions. They
said to us that colleges already concentrate on the hard to reach and
on widening participation by young people. I do not think that is
desperately controversial, but in the Bill we are chasing after perhaps
the last 10 per cent. who are not participating. How well placed do you
think colleges are to respond to that challenge to raise the
participation rate for that last 10 per cent., and to respond to the
adult skills elements of the
Bill?</div>

						</i> I think colleges are very successful where
they try to prevent young people getting to the stage where they are
not in education, employment or training. It is pre-NEET activity that
is important, and that is about partnership with schools. There are
some very effective examples in our sector, with intervention at 14. A
college like my own has nearly 1,000 14-year-olds attending two days a
week, and the transformation and our success in keeping them away from
entering that NEETs group is very significant. Further education is
doing a really powerful job in that
area.</div>

								Ian

						</i> The college environment is a good one for
disaffected pupils from school&#151;e have proved that. The majority
of our students do not have five good GCSEs, and when they come to us
it is a fresh start. It is very much moulded around a culture of the
workplace rather than the school, and deliberately so. Of the 3,500 16
to 18-year-olds we have, we discipline about 150, and last year we
excluded two. We are expecting about another 300 to 600 students as a
result of the changes, but we think that we can cope with that. The

are well placed to do that. I think colleges have responded well to
efforts to tackle those currently categorised as NEETs, and as Ioan
says, building up beforehand with 14 to 15 year-olds. The reason I
welcome compulsion is that it changes the nature of the terms of the
debate. You no longer ask, &#147;How do we work our way up to 85 or
90 per cent.?&#148; You actually start asking, &#147;Why are we not
at 100 per cent.?&#148; That is a mindset difference that schools,
colleges, local authorities, employers and private training providers
need to get their heads around. We have to do it for 100 per cent. For
me, it is an investment in 20 years down the line: if we can get it
right with this generation coming through, we will not have the skills
gaps identified by Leitch for
adults.</div>

the adult element, which has to be welcomed, particularly the level 3
entitlement for the 19 to 25-year-olds. I did my stats before I came

full level 3 this year. There is real demand there, and I think
recognition for that entitlement has to be welcomed because what
frightens me is, we cannot afford to end up in 20 years&#146; time
having missed the opportunity to tackle a systemic problem. It will be
tough and it will sometimes be a bit more expensive to deal with them,

provision that has been made for additional capital costs for the

year or something like &#163;90 million over 15 or 20 years. Does

additional challenge. I think that to deliver on the exciting
agenda&#151;perhaps I should say challenging, rather than
exciting&#151;that we are presented with in the Bill, we will have to
work smart. It is not all about bringing people into colleges; it is

						</i> To follow up that point, colleges play a key
role in their local communities by working in local strategic
partnerships with the health authority and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>local authority, and that is crucial in getting this
cocktail right. We are heavily involved in partnership work across the
piece, looking at what we need to do to support young people to
re-engage and stay engaged with education and training. We can do some
of it on our own. One decision we took was to employ our own full-time
mental health worker, because we recognised there were particular
mental health issues. We worked with the mental health authority to
make sure that person we employed worked with the mental health teams,
particularly to support young people in staying re-engaged.</div>
					<a name="080129136000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have, for example, nearly
70 young people under the age of 19 who are classified as having
special learning difficulties and disabilities. We are working with the
health authority and the local authority to make sure the package of
support keeps those young people on the programme. It is not just about
getting them into the college as somewhere warm to go, but about
getting them on to programmes where they make genuine progress. For
example, going to your question on capital, we have just won a capital
bid to run a virtual shop on site for SLDD students, so that they can
train to work in a shop. Just because you are SLDD does not mean you
cannot aspire to have some form of active engagement as a volunteer or
employee. </div>

from exclusion resulting from drug and alcohol abuse, and getting them

						</i> Further education is the sink for a lot of
this activity at the moment. The students whom we get in at 14 at
Warwickshire college range from the gifted and talented right through
to those with very extreme problems. It is a matter of training staff
and having the resources to cope. For example, at Warwickshire college,
we have a deaf centre and a centre for the visually impaired. We
specialise in trying to bring those students into the mainstream and
allowing them to benefit from as much mainstream activity as possible.
It is an integration model, but there are some people for whom you
cannot take that model forward. For example, we run a course for
acquired brain injury students, where success is measured not so much
by traditional success rates but by the ability to lift a
paintbrush&#151;that is quite a success over 12 months if you have
suffered a brain injury. These are the types of extreme students with
whom further education is already dealing on a day-to-day basis. So we

getting students on to the right pathways and programmes initially.
Inevitably some students find that they are not succeeding on the
programme they are on, and they need to move on to something else. They
are then at risk of dropping out. I think the important bit is having
the right learner support environment surrounding young people in
particular. We do not have a sixth form centre separate from the rest
of the college, but we try to provide an experience where everybody has
a tutor and a learning mentor. At-risk students go on to the at-risk
process and we try to manage the drop-out process.</div>

gone?&#148; We follow it through. Good colleges do that&#151;I know
that it sounds a bit of a mantra from the three of us&#151;and most
colleges will do so. I think it is a matter of having sufficient
resource as an institution to be able to provide the individualised,
personalised support. As my colleague was saying earlier, as you get
into the final 5 and 10 per cent., some of them drop out for reasons
other than their experience within the institution. Therefore, we need
to work with children&#146;s services, the health service and the
criminal justice system to make sure that we can all identify why an
individual has disappeared, and who is responsible for seeking to get
them to re-engage.</div>

the product. It is the way in which they are treated. If you are trying

including the state-of-the-art Trident technology and business centre,
which we built to celebrate our activity and links with major companies
such as Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin and so on. When it was built, it was
pristine and beautiful, and we had a long debate as to whether we would
expose 14-year-olds to that environment. We did so, and it was the best
thing we ever did, because they have responded to that environment.
They see that they are in a professional set-up; they see that we are
measuring things on a commercial and professional basis, and the
response has been enormous.</div>

of literacy in a vocational context&#151;and nine out of 10 fly
through that process, and get a literacy and numeracy qualification
alongside a practical skills-based qualification that gets them on to
the skills ladder. It is about doing that kind of work. Not every place
can do that, so it is about making sure that that is our specialist
contribution to the local environment. Up the road, however, the
horticulture college does an entry to employment programme for young
people, getting them into the horticulture industry. It is about making
sure you find the right curriculum mix for them: you do not, as Ioan

traditional vocational subjects associated with men are challenged, for
example, by encouraging women into construction or men into
hairdressing. We have been involved in various programmes trying to
break down gender and, indeed, race stereotyping about what people do.
I think that you do that by engaging with employers and trying to get
the best people for their jobs. We recently undertook an event for
construction employers aimed both at ensuring that the
disproportionately high number of people from black and minority ethnic
communities who are unemployed in our area see construction as an
option, and at what employers need to do to attract such employees. So,
yes, I completely agree with you: there are ways of doing it through
the frameworks and the incentives in the system to make people think
differently about how they do it. Again, it is about partnerships and
working through things like the area-based grant, to ensure that we are
not using that money to spend on more of what we already have, but on
the excluded groups, where we want to use it most effectively. We are
about to begin a programme on the Broadwater Farm estate for women
returners to construction. Research has identified the fact that lots
of women want to get into &#147;handy person&#148; activities. That
idea is the direct result of work with local authority outreach
workers, and we want to try to achieve that.</div>

youngster was that it was the first time that anyone had bothered to
make college feel like an option. I learned a big lesson by virtue of
the fact that we were trying to achieve something on the NEET
programme: do not make assumptions about people on the NEET register.
They want you to provide a supportive way into the process and so, when
it comes to sanctions, what about the one who does not get up in the
morning, or the one who turned up to our NEET event in a brand new BMW
series 3, who clearly was economically active, but perhaps not as we
would want him to be? What do you do about those people to get them to
engage? Ultimately, yes, we do need a sanction. I think it is like
interviewing people who are non-attending: we do all the bits about why
they are not attending, but it is important to follow through to the
ultimate sanction. The expectation is: we are making opportunities for
you, you will engage. I suspect that there will be a tiny number of
people who do not engage at the end of the day, but the big benefit

						</i> It has been a five-year journey with my
institution. Since I have been principal, we have gone from only six in
10 ten students getting a qualification to over nine getting a
qualification. It has been about learner support, as Ioan was saying,
and having those systems in place. The change process that has been
going on in the sector is massive: we are dealing with the presumption
of local sixth forms, and we have a new sixth form centre in our area.
There were certain people who traditionally came to FE colleges at 16
to 19, even when I started working in the sector six years ago, but the
position is very different now, so we have to shift the resources
around. There are challenges for work force development, and there will
be changes to the nature of teaching, learning and the curriculum we
have to deliver. However, the amount of public money that has gone into
education in the UK is at an historic high, and whenever my staff say,
&#147;We can&#146;t do this without more money&#148;, I tell them
that we have an awful lot of resource&#151;&#163;30 million-odd a

the challenge facing the sector. Yes, we can always argue for more, but
we have to make what we have work better. I passionately believe that,
because the only way you get more money is if you can make the case for
using the existing resource to its maximum benefit. Finally, let us not
assume that everything that DIUS or DCSF puts in is all the money we
need to be able to tackle this particular problem. The local authority,
through local area-based grants, also has a responsibility to put
resources into
this.</div>

importance of the transition from primary to secondary school. A huge
amount of effort has gone in to making sure that that transition is
eased. Do we need to take into account the importance of the transition
for 14 to 19-year-olds to the adult world of work, adult

we have done for a decade demonstrates, as Ioan said earlier, that the
14 to 16-year-olds do better in school work because they suddenly get
it, and we get almost guaranteed progression and achievement post-16.
If you give us somebody at 14 we will give you a work-ready person at
18, almost 100 per cent of the time. That is very important. It is

into the college environment and the adult environment that you
mentioned. It is about work-readiness and the readiness to progress to
higher courses&#151;it is all about stages of readiness. In most

There are certain qualifications that need to have currency. I have no

						</i> There is a general acceptance that we would
like to see a greater proportion continue in education and training,
but the root cause of that is a failure to inculcate a greater degree
of skills earlier in the piece. We felt that in throwing resources at
16 to 18-year-olds the problem was being tackled at the wrong age.
While not discounting the importance of intervening early, if extra
resources and support were being offered, they would be better targeted
at primary education. That was the fundamental
point.</div>
					<a name="080129136000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
concerned about the impact that this policy would have in its
implementation, not just on the young people we are specifically
targeting&#151;we need to think about whether compulsion is the right
way to encourage them to participate&#151;but on small employers.

								Alexander
Ehmann:
							</b>
						</i> I am happy to do so. The first point is that
if we accept provisionally that Alison Wolf&#146;s document is
correct in suggesting that 20 per cent. rather than 10 per cent. of the
cohort would be in reach of the Bill, it would boost the cost of
employer checks from &#163;8.4 million to &#163;16.8 million. That
&#163;16.8 million is based on an estimate from the Department that
suggests that a process of discussion, checking, any changes to rotas
and/or agreeing an employee&#146;s needs will take a maximum of 10
minutes. Doing some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>very rough work in the IOD before the meeting, we
think that that is a very conservative estimate. It is much more likely
to be something in the region of 20 minutes, so that doubles again the
figure up to &#163;33.6 million.</div>
					<a name="080129136000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any understanding of the
guidance that would be necessary for employers about what they can and
cannot do or ask of their employees is also missing from the figure.
Conservatively, I assume 20 minutes to read any guidance; that is based
upon my reading of the document on the &#147;Raising
Expectations&#148; consultation last night, which took me 17 minutes.
So, that doubles the figure yet again, and we end up with a figure,
very roughly, of &#163;67.2 million. The interesting thing is that if
it were imposed before 2010, it would eradicate all of the
Government&#146;s efforts within the Department to remove the
administrative burdens of regulation. In fact, it would add 7 per cent.
to the current regulatory burden on business. So, we have some serious
concerns about the impact of the regulation.</div>
					<a name="080129136000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me add that the upshot of
our argument is that the necessity to check the status of an
employee&#151;if they have registered at a college&#151;seems to us
an unnecessary process. I am happy to elaborate on that in some detail
later.</div>

can come back to you on that. Do you have an opinion about the youth
market, the employability of 16 and 17-year-olds and the impact the

						</i> There is a risk of increasing unemployment in
that cohort, but it is impossible to predict to what extent. It was
picked up in the impact assessment itself produced by the Department,
which estimated something like 5,500 16 to 17-year-olds will be
displaced because of the lack of small employers&#146; ability to
respond flexibly to the requirements. They may replace those 16 to
17-year-olds with 18-year-olds. It is impossible for us to say whether
that is a valid figure, but it is a genuine risk and an example of how
you would end up with an unintended consequence of a well intentioned
proposal.</div>

						</i> No, nothing to add except that that is a very
possible real consequence for many small employers. If you look at IOD
members, 75 per cent. of those with less with 50 employees have no

that small businesses may choose to employ older members of the work

the IOD, the British

favoured universe. Such organisations tend to invest very heavily in
skills and training and take it particularly seriously; they tend to
have all of those sorts of processes and tend to be interested in that
aspect of developing young people. Generally speaking, however, among
small employers it is safe to assume that if there is a choice between
certainty and the unknown risks of doing the wrong
thing&#151;completely unintentionally&#151;some will opt for
certainty and employ 18-year-olds rather than 16 to

						</i> That sounds a perfectly reasonable assertion.
There are clearly a number of discussions that take place&#151;in
both the interview process and at the point of employment. A lot of the
assumptions within the impact assessment about this policy, where it is
assumed that the process of checking would take place on the first day
or first week of employment, seem to contradict that discursive
possibility of an employer engaging with potentially a young employee
about the nature of the course that they will undertake. I think that
those discussions certainly take place, and it is possible to do that,
but we are slightly sceptical about whether they are valuable in that
first week of employment.</div>

Ehmann:
							</b>
						</i> In my understanding of the Bill, the
production of the piece of paper proving that the employee concerned
has enrolled with a college is the transaction that needs to take
place&#151;the discussion is slightly deprioritised. The issue with
the piece of paper, as we see it, is that is has a potential for rather
large costs on a business associated with the administrative nature of
it and the guidance that one needs to read before doing so. Moreover,
there seems to be no protection, as there is no process suggested here
where the employer would be audited in any way in respect of the piece
of paper&#151;indeed we would not suggest that this should take
place. It is an administrative process that exists within a vacuum and,
seemingly, without much purpose.</div>

that the bureaucracy surrounding the piece of paper you talk about was
minimal, and if the guidance was clear about what kind of ongoing
burdens there were on employers to monitor that process and that they
would be kept to a minimum, could you then be sufficiently happy that
you could see the benefits of increasing the level of training and
skills in the work force? Would that change the balance of your

						</b> Finally, let me just turn to that question because
I am interested in the answer. Clearly, you think the priority of
resources should be pre-16 rather than post-16, which is not an
unreasonable position to take, but is it not reasonable to ask
Government to do both&#151;to tackle pre-16 education and make sure
that we are ever improving the standards of literacy and numeracy and
work readiness of people when they get to the age of 16, and to try to
address their engagement and their level of skills
post-16?</div>

						</i> I think that is reasonable. Nobody is arguing
against the idea that what we want to see are better educated young
people&#151;young people with better skills, who are better prepared
for the work place and for life generally. Put simply, the argument is
about what is the most effective mechanism for ensuring a greater
degree of post-16 participation. Is it support, which is very
important; or is it equipping people at 11, which enables them at 14
and then at 16 to have the skills they need to participate effectively
post-16?</div>

the longer-term, mitigate some of that risk of not employing 16 to
17-year-olds. But I think it is very much a long-term objective rather
than a short-term aim. That is especially true for smaller employers,
because the sort of employers that have the resources to do that tend
to be the blue chip companies and the big internationals.</div>

necessarily be relevant to conduct those activities otherwise. So,

we are not in favour of the Bill, we are not disputing the fact that
access to that time off should be granted. What we are saying is that
the activity of transacting a piece of paper between the young person
and the business seems to sit in a vacuum, which&#151;based upon the
reassurances we have had about the way in which this will be policed

those costs could be as high&#151;could be&#151;as &#163;67.2

offering courses at different times of day and at weekends, so that

but we would argue that it is the Government&#146;s or the
state&#146;s job to educate them to the basic level that gives them
that platform to progress in employment and in life generally. It is
very much the minimum that, at 16, people should have a good grasp of

						</i> There are two things. There are general
procedural difficulties&#151;the administration that is required.
When we talk about apprenticeships, we want to be clear that we want
high-quality work-based training, preferably backed by an older mentor
and underpinned by off-the-job training, with regular reviews and
appraisals and full employer involvement. Those are the apprenticeships
we want to see, but of course that is correspondingly more difficult in
many instances for small business to deliver. You can go so far in
helping small businesses to cope with that, particularly with the
administrative side, but sometimes they will simply have alternative
methods of meeting their training needs. It will not necessarily be an
apprenticeship. You can do so much, but businesses may have very valid
alternatives to
that.</div>

Government pushing them as a supply-led process. There have been
indications that employers have been sidelined through that process.
However, we want them to be absolutely centre stage. The barriers to
that are on the administration and support side. If we can start to

the current work force. IOD members are already engaged in that
process. However, we also need a much greater flow of skills through
the education system into the work force, which is why these particular

that the number one priority that employers have in the education

						</b> Our previous witnesses this morning, the
college heads, spoke about the soft skills, the employability skills,
that the FE colleges can help with. I know you said you have not had a
chance to look at the apprenticeship announcements made yesterday, but
I was particularly struck by the programme-led apprenticeships which
will focus on learning that develops generic employability skills. One
of the SMEs in my constituency was worried that they were taking on
apprentices who did not understand the rigours of employability, such
as the requirement to turn up on time. The world of work is very
different from the world of learning. Do you think SMEs are more likely
to take on apprentices who have been through this type of programme-led
pre-apprenticeship work, where the FE college takes on the training in
those general employability
skills?</div>

						</i> Those skills are very important. They are
increasingly important for employers. We did a survey at the end of
last year which emphasised this, not just at this age but also for
graduates. It was not just about literacy and numeracy; it was about
turning up, it was about reliability, punctuality, team working, and a
good work ethic. My only concern with the pre-apprenticeship programmes
is that, if these skills are inculcated, that is very useful, but we do
not want to develop the pre-apprenticeship programme in isolation from
the demand for employers for full apprenticeships. You do want to be
stacking up young people in a pre-apprenticeship when there is not an
apprenticeship place for them to go on to. The other feature of
apprenticeships is that we have seen a decline in level 3
apprenticeship as opposed to level 2. In the context of the Leitch
review and the need to shift that emphasis from level 2 to level 3
training, that would be another
worry.</div>

attainment and qualifications those currently not participating have
achieved. About 20 per cent. of 16-year-olds and around a quarter of
17-year-olds have reached level 2 on leaving school and are therefore
perfectly capable of going to do A-levels, for example. Would you agree
that there is therefore not an issue for them around the quality of
their pre-16 education? It is more a question of motivating them to
carry on learning. How do you suggest we achieve the culture shift that

would not be supported by research we have done. How do you encourage

be more effective to do currently within the education system that will
result in people being more motivated and more engaged. However, it is
absolutely crucial to motivate people, because unless you are motivated

have to want to learn.</div>

effect a culture change of that nature I am really not sure, beyond
equipping people with a much firmer grasp of the basics, because that
is the majority of people that you are talking about. There will be
that minority who have obtained their level 2, and then it is a
question of how they progress to level 3. The real problem is the much
greater volume of people who do not have the basics and have not even
got level 2 at 16.

survey in 2003 on the volume of apprenticeships being delivered by
members of the Institute of Directors. We do not have a subsequent
track, so I cannot say if our experience is the same as the national
figures. It may simply be that people, particularly the small
employers, have alternatives of offering that level, as we suggested.
In particular, it is a concern that the level 3 number has declined,
because that was the reason for the introduction of the apprenticeship
programme back in 1995 and it is so crucial to meeting the aim of
shifting the emphasis from level 2 to level 3 in future. I do not know
why there has been that decline in apprenticeships in

						</i> I think that the Bill goes some way towards
addressing the points made in the National Audit Office report, but it
could go further; specifically, in the context of ensuring that, where
the Bill relates back to the Education Act 1997 and the duties on
schools and colleges to provide careers information and careers
education, the scope of those duties are extended beyond year 11, to
which they currently apply, to age 18 and 19. If we are raising, or
proposing to raise, the statutory leaving age, young people should have
a right to careers information, careers advice, careers education and
careers guidance up until the age of 18, which fits them for the
choices that they need to make from 18 and beyond, as well as the
respective choices that they make during the 14-to-19
pathway.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Kieran
Gordon:
							</b>
						</i> There is not great clarity. We are still
waiting to hear how those pilots are expected to
operate and through which means. I think that there is a key issue
relating to the Bill, particularly parts 1 and 2, which is that we need
to be preparing young people increasingly for decisions and transitions
that they make at age 19. If you look at the performance of young
people, particularly those who are NEET or who are at risk of becoming
NEET, you see that the older they are in the 16 to 19 age group, the
more likely they are to be NEET and, secondly, they are more likely to
be NEET who are not available to the labour market. We will miss a
great opportunity, if we do not address that.</div>
					<a name="080129136000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a lost generation of
young people that a future adult careers and advancement service
probably would have to try and re-engage with and work with. If we
could provide some vertical integration of services, particularly

an adult careers and advancement service, I think that we would have a
much more efficient and effective working

						</b> You have discussed with me and others in the past
the fact that Connexions clearly focuses on some of the most
challenging young people and, by the way, does an excellent job in that
respect. Is there not a case for having a parallel careers
service&#151;an all-age careers service&#151;sitting alongside
Connexions? As you know, it is done elsewhere with some success
elsewhere, and might be an appropriate way of bringing to light some of
the provisions in the Bill for the young people that you describe and

an all-age careers service and I think that we could look in further
detail at how that is provided in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>context of Connexions services currently provided for young people. It
is true to say that Connexions has been very effective in reducing
NEETs, and particularly in targeting those young people who are the
most vulnerable in society. There is a strain, and the National Audit
Office to which you referred showed that strain in terms of providing
universal services for all young people to enable them to plan and make
transitions into adult and working life. We need a clearer statement on
that, and clearer ring-fencing of resources to ensure that that is not

groups.</div>
					<a name="080129136000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
be more attention to the career service element of Connexions services,

does not happen at specific points in a person&#146;s life. People
need to be equipped throughout life to be able to go with those changes

the transitional arrangements for local authorities

						</i> Connexions engages with young people from the
age of 13, which is around the transition to key stage 4 or year 10 in
schools. Connexions normally makes contact with young people through
the school in the first instance, by providing support to careers
education and guidance programmes in schools. We therefore get a fair
bit of information on young people from local authorities and
individual schools. We use that to populate the database that is
aggregated at national level in the national connexions customer
information service
database.</div>
					<a name="080129136000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">From there,
once an engagement has been made with a young person, a client record
is effectively created on the system. That record is constantly and
continually updated, according to the various interventions that
Connexions personal advisers have with a young person throughout their
journey through to age 19, and beyond for young people with learning
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="080129136000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
fair to say that the majority of young people and, happily, an
increasing proportion of them are staying in learning voluntarily and
participating and progressing. It is easier to maintain contact with
them because they are in some form of education&#151;in school, in a
school sixth form, in a college or in a training establishment. But a
significant number of young people, as we know, do not participate or
progress in that way beyond 16. That is when the individual tracking of
young people becomes detailed and resource intensive, but very valuable
to the wider partnership.</div>
					<a name="080129136000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">A Connexions personal adviser
will work with a young person and record the intervention, the
progression routes and the steps that have been agreed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>with that young person. The personal adviser will follow up that young
person and record at various points whether they become NEET, go into
learning or, as happens to a significant number of young people who are
NEET, churn in and out of learning. That is resource
intensive.</div>
					<a name="080129136000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that tracking has improved markedly during the life of
Connexions. The percentage of young people who are not known has fallen
radically through better engagement with young people. Connexions does
not always have the right answers and offers for young people, which
may depend on what is available in their locality, but maintaining that
contact is
critical.</div>

It is not purely Connexions or careers advisors that would do that,

enhancing the current power under the Learning and Skills Act 2000,
which is exercised by Connexions partnerships, so that over-16s who are
likely to leave education and go into some form of further education or
training would have right of access to assessment. It suggests,
therefore, that there would need to be more assessment of young people,
as currently specified in section 140 of the Learning and Skills Act.
There need to be more assessments in the future. If the volume
increases and local authorities only have the funds devolved to them
that are available currently, those may not be sufficient to ensure
that the services are provided and that existing services provision, in

important. Our view is that there would need to be a trusted worker who
has the right skills and a good knowledge of the range of learning and

assessed further, and that consideration can be given to their needs,
which will change over time. That is a welcome enhancement to the Bill.
However, it could be strengthened by ensuring that both sides of the
assessment system work in tandem. In specifying the needs and how best
to address them, provision should be made available to address them at
the individual level, rather than just a global offer into which we try
to fit young people. Very often, those young people need bespoke
provision. There is an interesting issue for local authorities, which
in the future will be responsible for assessments, given the changes to

						</i> Yes. Certainly by the time we in the
Connexions service get them, some young people already have sporadic
attendance at school. That is often linked with poor levels of academic
attainment. That causes a problem for those young people. For some
young people, it becomes a spiralling problem, because if they do not
feel confident enough to present themselves and read a vacancy board in
a Connexions office, for example, they will rather absent themselves
than embarrass themselves. We have to tap into that. It is about
engaging with the individual, recognising problems early on and trying
to put things right.</div>

Chairman:
						</b> Do other colleagues want to contribute? There is
a deathly hush. If there are no further questions, we can conclude this
sitting, which is the last of this morning&#146;s evidence-taking
sessions. I thank Kieran Gordon on behalf of myself and all the members
of the Committee for his very clear and lucid evidence. We are grateful
for it and we have benefited from it.</div>
