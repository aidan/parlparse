                  </span> On a point of order, Mr Amess. In
early September we had an orderly and well informed debate on S4C and
its funding. I have been approached by many people in Wales over the
past few weeks who had believed that the Secretary of State will be
responsible for the adequate funding of the channel, which was the
basis for our debate on 15 September, but the Government
apparently entered into an agreement with the BBC on 13 September, two
days previously. New clause 63A(2)(d) of the 2006 agreement, which I
have here, states that between 2015 and 2017 it will be for the BBC,
not the Secretary of State, to determine how much funding it gives to
S4C from the licence
fee.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000016">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>How can
we have had a proper debate in the morning sitting at 9 am, and in the
afternoon sitting at 1 pm, when many Members would not have been aware
of the agreement or its contents? Will you advise me on how we may
revisit that matter, Mr
Amess?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000018">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Further to that point of order, Mr
Amess. I made it clear to the Committee that the agreement had been
laid before Parliament on the very afternoon on which the Committee
sat. It was clear that the negotiations on funding, which had been
ongoing, were concluded up to that point and that negotiations on
governance arrangements were continuing between the BBC and S4C. The
Committee cannot have been in any doubt about the state of play.
Indeed, there was no way that the Committee could have had more
information than was made available. I hope the Committee feels not
only that I plainly set out the position, but that there was no further
position that could have been set out at that
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000019">&#160;</a>

is a great pleasure to see you back in the Chair after a short break in
proceedings, Mr Amess, during which time various Opposition Members
have been elevated or moved in some direction by their leader. It would
be churlish if Government Members did not offer our

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
4 confers on Ministers the power to make an order modifying the funding
arrangements of a body or office listed in schedule 4. The Government
intend, for example, to reform the Drinking Water Inspectorate by
allowing it to recover its costs from the water industry, which will
bring that body in line with the existing principle that businesses
that benefit from regulation should bear the cost of regulation, not
the taxpayer. As with all the principal order-making powers in the
Bill, the use of clause 4 will be restricted by the conditions that we
have discussed at length and will continue to discuss throughout our
considerations. Those conditions include the provision in clause 8 that
Ministers may only make an order that they
consider<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“serves
the purpose of improving the exercise of public
functions”.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>A
change of funding that would leave a body unable properly to carry out
its public functions, for example, would be unlikely to meet those
benchmarks, which provides an important reassurance to Parliament, to
the bodies listed in schedule 4 and, ultimately, to the public we
serve.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
further remind the Committee that no body or office may be listed in
any of the Bill’s schedules unless Parliament has given its
approval through the primary legislative process. The
Government’s position is that ultimate decisions on the
allocation of funding must rest with Ministers, who are ultimately
accountable for the delivery of public services by central Government
and for public expenditure within their spending review settlements. It
is also right that Ministers have the assurance that public money is
being spent appropriately. In the case of most non-departmental public
bodies, Ministers or Departments must be consulted by public bodies
before they exercise certain financial powers, such as borrowing or
capital
expenditure.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the powers conferred by clause 4 on Ministers are entirely
in keeping with that position and do not establish a new status quo,
but rather reaffirm ministerial accountability for public expenditure
and create the framework for a series of useful reforms to public
bodies. On that basis I ask that the clause stand
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000026">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
want to ask the Minister why Natural England has been included in the
clause. Natural England has important powers relating to awarding
grants and designating areas of outstanding natural beauty and sites of
special scientific interest. Its role includes managing some national
nature reserves, overseeing access to open country and, of course,
regulating. The point is that it is an extremely important
body, responsible for the administration of numerous grants schemes and
frameworks that finance the development and conservation of the natural
environment. There are some really big and important programmes, such
as the environmental stewardship fund, the countryside stewardship
scheme and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given
Natural England’s important role in administering and awarding
grants, it is important that the Committee know whether the Government
plan to change that significantly. The body was established by the
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which was a
response to the widespread Haskins review. The powers it received came
from the amalgamation of parts of the Countryside Agency, English
Nature, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the
Rural Development Service. Natural England is extremely important in
protecting our countryside. Is anything planned that would in any way
diminish its countryside protection and management
role?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have questions that I would be grateful if the Minister answered.
First, why is Natural England in the schedule? Secondly, do we have
some guarantee that its powers will not be diluted, that its funding
will not be substantially reduced and that it will still be able to
produce independent reports such as the excellent “State of the
Natural Environment 2008”, which was widely acknowledged as an
important benchmark for countryside policy development? Finally, given
that the funding could be changed at any time, how does the Minister
intend to maintain the organisation’s independence, especially
as there might be concerns about challenging the Government’s
policy on the environment and the countryside if the result could be a
reduction in funding?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000035">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is doing exactly what she is required
to do as an Opposition Member in questioning the Government’s
intention in including Natural England in the schedule. However, it is
a great pleasure to think that the reply I am going to give will
satisfy her in every respect and that she has nothing to fear. The
amendment, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 224<a class="bkMark" name="Column224">&#160;</a>
                  </div>which I suspect is a probing one to clarify the situation, would remove
the Secretary of State’s power to make an order modifying the
funding arrangements of Natural
England.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Natural
England has powers in the founding legislation and other enactments to
make charges for services that it provides and in relation to its
licensing functions, subject in some cases to making an order under
section 11 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities
Act 2006. It is included in schedule 4 to enable an ambiguity in
existing legislation to be removed. That ambiguity arises because the
existing charging powers are worded in a way that gives rise to doubts
over their scope. In particular, the existing powers enable an order to
be made providing for a charge for issuing licences, but it is not
clear whether the powers allow for a charge to be made when an
application is received for a licence that is subsequently withdrawn or
refused. Natural England is therefore included in schedule 4 so that
the Secretary of State can amend and clarify existing legislation and
thereby make the scope for charging powers clearer—nothing to do
with the legitimate concerns the hon. Lady raised. This simply enables
the Secretary of State to correct an ambiguity in existing legislation.
I hope that clarifies the Government’s intention, and that on
that basis the hon. Lady can withdraw her amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000037">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment will add the office of chief coroner to schedule 5, enabling
the transfer of most of the office’s functions to the Lord
Chancellor or the Lord Chief Justice. I fully agree with hon. Members,
Members of the other place and stakeholders about the need for urgent
reform to the existing coroner service. I was one of those who argued
strongly for that in the previous Parliament, and I was very frustrated
by the delay in that reform. The amendment will allow us to deliver
such a reform. We must address delays in the inquest process, remove
the barriers that prevent inquests from being heard in the most
convenient location for bereaved 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 225<a class="bkMark" name="Column225">&#160;</a>
                  </div>families, and ensure consistent training for and standards of service
from coroners. The amendment allows for all such things to happen as
quickly as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I should
clearly set out what the Government believe the debate’s terms
are because, to be absolutely frank, there is a financial element. It
is the view of the Ministry of Justice that we cannot afford to
implement the office of chief coroner as such, and, therefore, we
cannot reform the system without transferring the office’s
functions and implementing key provisions in the Coroners and Justice
Act 2009. It is imperative that the amendment be passed if there is to
be significant, meaningful reform of the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
indicated, I am well aware of the strong feeling on this subject. The
Government’s decision not to proceed with full implementation
was not taken lightly. Establishing costs of £10.9 million and
running costs of £6.6 million may not sound a great deal to
some—however, it does to me—but against a backdrop of
cost reductions of over 20% in the Ministry of Justice, new funding,
which is what this would have to be, on top of existing budget
commitments, cannot be found.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Concerns were
expressed on Second Reading about the impact such changes would have on
the independence of coroners. I refer hon. Members to the statement
issued by the Government on 14 June, which confirmed that the Lord
Chief Justice had approved the proposed transfer of statutory
functions. If a function is judicial, Government will have no role in
it. In practice, that will mean that the Lord Chief Justice’s
functions include the power to direct coroners to conduct
investigations and to make training regulations for coroners, including
targeted training on specific areas of concern. The Lord Chancellor
will take on non-judicial functions, such as maintaining a register of
inquests lasting more than a year, and the power to designate medical
practitioners for the purpose of performing post mortems. I hope hon.
Members are reassured that the proposals will protect the judicial
independence of
coroners.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are very few chief coroner functions that we do not propose to
transfer, the main exception being section 40 of the 2009
Act, relating to appeals; that is because the costs of establishing and
maintaining a bespoke appeal system are simply not justifiable. The
existing systems of redress will remain, so that decisions can still be
contested through judicial review or through application by, or under
the authority of, the Attorney-General to the High Court. Complaints
about the personal conduct of a coroner will continue to be made to the
Office for Judicial Complaints, as would have been the case if a chief
coroner were in place. Coroners will therefore continue to be
accountable for their personal conduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those avenues
of redress are set out in the proposed charter for the coroner service,
a draft of which we have just consulted on. The charter, which we
intend to publish early next year, will set out for the first time the
standards of service a bereaved family or other interested party can
expect.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000050">&#160;</a>

provide a better service for bereaved families of servicemen who have
sadly lost their lives. This is not simply about military inquests;
those of us who were engaged in the debates on the reform of the

                  </strong> Coroners will be accountable in exactly the same
way as they currently are. There is a process of redress, which I have
just explained, regarding their personal conduct—personal
conduct remains with the Office for Judicial Complaints—and they
are responsible for the conduct of the actual inquest by means of
either the judicial review system or the application by the
Attorney-General to the High Court. They are judicial posts, however,
and they were never intended to be accountable to a politician or to
the chief coroner.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I turn to the
supervisory role of the chief coroner under the previous legislation,
because there is a lot of misunderstanding about that role. Concerns
have been expressed about leadership and oversight of the coroner
system. Many people have misunderstood the intention of the previous
legislation regarding the extent of the chief coroner’s powers
in those areas. Statutory powers to direct coroners are limited to
conducting investigations where there is no body, and transferring
investigations to another coroner. We propose to transfer those
functions to the Lord Chief Justice. The chief coroner would have been
able to effect change within the coronial system only through influence
and persuasion, because there was no hierarchical structure in the
system under the previous legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000055">&#160;</a>

the discussion about the role of the chief coroner centred on having an
individual who is seen as leading a service and can drive through
change in that role? Do the Government not accept that the chief

                  </strong> The Government are suggesting that that role can be
carried out as effectively by the Lord Chief Justice at a lower cost to
the Exchequer. As the hon. Lady knows, the Lord Chief Justice has
widespread responsibilities and powers in the judicial system, and the
coronial system is part of that wider family. He would take on those
functions of the chief coroner, with whatever support he requires in
that role. The important thing is the function, not the person. I have
already mentioned the limited powers of direction that the previous
legislation conferred.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000057">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There is
another big issue, to which I think the hon. Member for City of Durham

<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>about ensuring that the coronial system was equal to the task that it
was set. Under the proposals, a new ministerial board will be tasked
with advising on coronial policy, standards of service and the other
administrative aspects of the coroner service. The board could, for
example, review national statistics gathered from the coroner service
to support an action plan for
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000058">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
quarterly publication of progress on inquests concerning service
personnel killed in operations and exercises overseas provides a model
of transparency. The board will be advised and supported by a bereaved
organisations committee, which will be independently chaired and
represented on the ministerial board itself. It will have a particular
remit in monitoring the charter. That will provide the representatives
of the bereaved with a direct line to
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have listened to the concerns expressed in the other place
and elsewhere, which is why we have amended our proposals to retain the
office of chief coroner in statute, rather than pushing for outright
abolition. That will allow Members here and in the other place to hold
the Government to account on the proposed
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have also listened to Members of the other place and key
stakeholders about the remit and composition of the new ministerial
board and the bereaved organisations committee. The Under-Secretary of
State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member  for Huntingdon
(Mr Djanogly), has discussed the Government’s proposals with
Members of both Houses and he is happy to continue that dialogue on the
structure and remit of the ministerial
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is a pragmatic and sensible solution to the need to reform in
the current economic climate. I ask members of the Committee to
consider what would happen if the amendment were not accepted: the
office of chief coroner would remain on the statute book, but its
functions would not be transferred. Without that transfer, it will not
be possible to implement the main coroner provisions in the 2009 Act,
leaving us with the worst possible outcome of little or no meaningful
reform of the coroner system. That would be unacceptable to me, and I
suspect from previous comments in Committee that it would be
unacceptable to other Members, too. I therefore urge Members not to
oppose the amendment today, but I welcome their views and will ensure
that they are faithfully transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.
However, the proposal deals with the reform and effectiveness of the
coroner service, which is what we all want to see, without an excessive
cost to the Ministry of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000062">&#160;</a>

but—I am sure this is also the view of my hon. Friends—we
have not been given the reassurance we may have expected. The issue is
extremely difficult. I was in the House when we had many detailed
discussions about the 2009 Act, and I am deeply concerned that the
amendment will unravel substantial parts of it. Indeed, given the
amount of cross-party agreement on that Act, I share the shock
expressed by several organisations about the way the Government are
looking at the whole coroner service.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
several points to make and I apologise in advance for taking up the
Committee’s time, but this is such a serious issue that we must
examine it very 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 228<a class="bkMark" name="Column228">&#160;</a>
                  </div>carefully. A number of us find it quite extraordinary that the issue has
come on to the agenda so soon after the 2009 Act was given Royal
Assent, and before its main provisions have been implemented. We need
an explanation from the Minister—one that goes beyond simply
cost—as to why the Government are looking at the coronial
service in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000064">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friends have already pointed out, many organisations have
written to members of the Committee and have been campaigning widely in
the country about these proposals. There is huge concern and anxiety
about what is being proposed and I should like some more details about
the rather fragmented service that the Government will apparently
create with the haphazard—that is the appropriate
word—transfer of powers to different individuals and bodies. We
have heard in detail from organisations that know better than any
others what needs to happen to improve our coroner service and what is
wrong with it at the moment. We have heard from Inquest, the British
Medical Association, the Royal British Legion, Cardiac Risk in the
Young, Victim Support and Mencap. Does the Minister feel he knows more
than all of those organisations about the operation of the coronial
system and what needs to happen to improve it? That is a legitimate
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
organisations seem to conclude that the framework that was approved by
Parliament two years ago is still the best way forward. They point out
that the 2009 Act was structured in a way that would help reduce the
problems being experienced by those dealing with the coronial system.
We need to understand that so that we can make a proper assessment of
what the Government propose in the amendment. There was much debate
before the 2009 Act and it was argued that<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
coroner’s system operates as a fragmented, non-professional
assortment of individual coroners who operate with no compulsory
training and little accountability. There are a growing number of
coroners who adopt an efficient, modern approach to running inquests,
but overall there is a ‘postcode lottery’ of service for
bereaved families with good practice dependent on the approach of
individual coroners.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not
think we accept that as being a suitable or appropriate style of
behaviour for any service at the moment, and particularly not for one
dealing with very sensitive issues and bereaved families. Delays of two
or three years to the inquest process are not uncommon. That causes
difficulties not only for bereaved people but for all those involved in
the inquest process. Because of the huge delays, the opportunity to
identify what went wrong at an early stage and perhaps use that
information to prevent other deaths is missed, which is a major
failing. Compounding that problem, the current system has no robust
mechanism to monitor inquest findings or to take any follow-up action
with the relevant public bodies. Indeed, that is an issue that comes up
again and again in the comments made by the BMA and Inquest about what
the Government propose in the amendment. An inquest will often have to
take on board statutory bodies, such as the NHS, and do so in a quick
and efficient manner. There is huge concern that the
Government’s proposal will simply not allow the reform of the
system that would enable inquests, where blame is attached to the NHS
or other public bodies, to be dealt with quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000067">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">An excellent
report by Mencap, “Death by Indifference”, documents the
failings of the current inquest process, which lead to distress for
families. We have seen such criticism across the board. A number of my
constituents, and I am sure of other hon. Members, have found that that
delay and the process add to, rather than ameliorate, their distress.
There have been numerous reviews of the coroner service, such as those
in 1936, 1965 and 2001. The most recent review by Tom Luce was
instrumental in identifying the key problems and setting in train the
campaign that led to the 2009 legislation. That review concluded that
the coroner service was simply not fit for purpose. Among the major
criticisms was the rather fragmented state of the service. My concern
is that the Government’s proposal will take us back to that
highly fragmented service, without the head of service having the
ability or skills to drive through the change that is
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Interested
organisations say that they want the 2009 legislation to be
implemented; they oppose the Government’s plans, as we do; and
they believe that the role of the chief coroner can be created at
significantly lower cost than has been set out by the Minister. Will
the Minister indicate whether discussions have been held with relevant
charities and the organisations I have listed to see if a way forward
can be found to satisfy all parties? I understand that at the moment
those bodies do not accept the Government’s proposals as a
satisfactory way forward. Given the widespread recognition of the need
for a 21st-century coronial service, I believe they should not accept
what the Government put forward in the amendment. It simply does not
deliver on key aspects of the 2009 Act, in particular, having a
cohesive service with an overview.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that the Government have not sought to reinstate the coroner’s
office into schedule 1. However, I do not think they should have
introduced the service to schedule 5. That does not accord with the
views expressed in the House of Lords. They had a very detailed
discussion about the service and obviously voted with quite a
substantial majority to remove it from schedule 1. In their debate,
members in the other place emphasised the issue before us today. They
pointed out that the fragmented and antiquated system that was in place
before the 2009 Act was largely created by the Coroners Act 1887. I
heard nothing from the Minister today that leads me to believe that we
are getting a substantial updating of the service through the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The 2009 Act
introduced reforms intended to give the chief coroner necessary
oversight, but also responsibility for training, leadership of the
coronial system and a place at the head of the appeals framework. I
will come back to appeals later, but the Minister today made me
sigh—I am sure Committee members heard me do so—when he
said, “Well, the current arrangements will continue and people
who are unhappy with the system can use judicial review.” That
is not acceptable. I would very much like the Minister to reconsider
the points he made about the appeals system, which I will mention
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We know that
the powers and responsibilities of the chief coroner under the 2009 Act
were more extensive that the Minister outlined in moving the amendment.
They would have had the power and responsibility to manage the
coroners’ courts by allocating cases to deal with backlogs,
delays or particularly complex cases. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 230<a class="bkMark" name="Column230">&#160;</a>
                  </div>The Minister knows that a major criticism of the operation of
the current system is about delays. A chief coroner would also have
been able to put specific arrangements in place to cater for
unexpectedly large numbers of deaths due to a major incident.
Crucially, we need to know how that would be managed in the system if
the Government’s proposals are passed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We know that
a major role of the chief coroner was to drive up standards in the
system through training. We were awaiting guidance on how that could
have been put in place with national standards of service being
developed. We heard something about that in the Minister’s
statement earlier, but I would certainly like to hear more about how
training will be implemented and who will be responsible for ensuring
that it happens and is of the necessary quality. The chief coroner
would have been able to work with the Lord Chancellor and Ministry of
Justice to make regulations and rules overhauling practice and
procedures at inquests and setting how a role could be extended, for
example. They would also be able to deal with appeals against
coroners’ decisions, including on issues such as whether to
investigate a death and any findings as to the cause of
death.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new appeals system, overseen by the chief coroner, would have offered
families a route to resolve poor decision-making by coroners and spared
them the challenge and expense of going through judicial review.
Families and organisations feel strongly about that. Why have all the
points made about the difficulty of using judicial review been largely
ignored by the Government, because that appears to be the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">11.15

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
chief coroner also wanted powers to develop and operate an effective
scheme for ensuring that recommendations about public safety and
related warnings emerging from coroners’ investigations would be
brought to the attention of those responsible for creating the relevant
risks. Again, the Minister may need to tell us where that whole set of
responsibilities will end up in the current system, should his
proposals go
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Last
but not least—this is really important for improving the
service—the chief coroner had powers and responsibilities
regarding monitoring the performance of the coronial system, including
through the provision of an annual report to the Lord Chancellor
addressing, among other things, levels of consistency between coroner
areas, the number of investigations that have been ongoing for more
than a year, the identification of specific resource issues and any
other matters that the chief coroner wishes to bring to public
attention. The annual report would have been published and laid before
Parliament, offering an opportunity for further scrutiny and debate.
Again, we need an absolute assurance from the Minister about who will
put that report together, and who will be responsible for ensuring that
its contents are listened to and—this is crucial—acted
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
issues arise from the amendment. We have already dealt with the number
of organisations that have concerns about the proposal, but I want
briefly to summarise the main issues. The chief concern, which we have
dealt with before, is the lack of independence in the proposals for
dealing with the transfer of functions. As the Minister has informed us
and as we know from elsewhere, it is proposed that most of the
functions will transfer to the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Chief 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 231<a class="bkMark" name="Column231">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Justice. As I said, we have not had a sufficient explanation from the
Minister as to whether that really honours the spirit of the 2009 Act,
or whether the degree of impartiality the chief coroner’s office
was envisaged to have will be
maintained.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
had several reports before the 2009 Act, including huge reports by
Inquest such as “How the Inquest System Fails Bereaved
People”. I will not detain the Committee by going through the
many reports that pointed out that what was really important in order
to satisfy public anxiety and bereaved families’ anxiety was
that the system be independent from Government and able to hold them to
account, and that it be able to respond to issues raised by bereaved
families and organisations representing them. Reference was also made
to the current lack of information for bereaved families about their
rights, the frequent lack of understanding of religious or cultural
practices and beliefs, and the huge variation in the quality and extent
of
post-mortems.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not clear from what the Minister said how the postcode lottery,
which is a systemic failure of the current service, will be addressed.
There is a growing body of evidence, which also underpinned the 2009
Act, that the system is failing the families of servicemen and women.
The Royal British Legion has not welcomed the Government’s
proposals, and the Government must seriously consider why their
assurances are not being accepted by the Royal British Legion or many
of the other bodies I have mentioned. Such bodies know better than
anyone how the current system is failing the bereaved families of our
servicemen and women. We need to unravel the system that the 2009 Act
introduced very cautiously indeed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I turn to the
key questions that I want to put to the Minister. The 2009 Act put the
bereaved and bereaved families at the heart of the process, but the
current proposals do not appear to do so. Will the Minister comment on
that? He is looking at me rather quizzically; however, some of the
Government’s proposals deal with everyone who may come into
contact with the coronial service, rather than specifically addressing
the needs of bereaved families.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How will the
coronial service be independent, and how will the driving force for
change be created? How will the Government’s proposals lead to
an increase in transparency and accountability? The Opposition, along
with many organisations and families, question why the service is in
the Bill at all, because it does not seem to meet the criteria for
inclusion. The Government’s proposals will not increase
transparency and accountability, cut out duplication of activity or
discontinue activities that are simply no longer needed, so why are
they in the Bill at all? There are strong arguments in support of the
opposite case. Under the 2009 Act, the role of the chief coroner was to
bring transparency, accountability, judicial oversight and national
leadership, and to prevent duplication.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The many
people campaigning against the amendment conclude that it must be a
question of cost, and cost only. The Minister went some way towards
admitting that this morning. A number of people argue that it is false
economy, because there will be huge costs to the public purse that have
not been included in the Minister’s projections, never mind the
human cost. It is important that we concentrate on the human cost as
far as possible, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 232<a class="bkMark" name="Column232">&#160;</a>
                  </div>but I will deal for a moment or two with the financial cost. The
Minister’s figures do not include the huge cost of delayed or
postponed hearings, repeat investigations and judicial reviews. If he
is really suggesting that judicial reviews are the way forward for
appeals, the huge cost of those must be included.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
organisations have put serious points to the Minister regarding
reducing office set-up costs, which are extraordinarily high. There is
a strong case for reducing start-up costs and initial office sizes. It
is also important that the Minister make it clear that it was not the
intention of the 2009 Act to set up a largely administrative body. I am
concerned by the Government’s comment that the Act did not
include a need for an individual at the head of a service to spearhead
reform, because that is not anyone else’s
reading.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is also huge disagreement about whether powers can simply be
transferred to alternative bodies. As I said earlier, there is huge
concern that we might end up with a system as fragmented as the current
one. We need to be clear about which individual will be responsible for
the leadership, culture and behaviour of coroners. From what the
Minister has said, that does not seem to be anyone, and there is huge
concern about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a whole set of concerns about the ministerial board. The widespread
opinion is that the board cannot do the same job as the
coroner’s office would have done, had the 2009 Act been
implemented. The Minister said something this morning about trying to
make the board more responsive. We welcome that, of course, and we
would like the board to listen carefully to the experiences of those
who are using the coronial service. Nevertheless, we do not know what
powers the board will have to implement any changes that might come
about from its listening exercise. We need much more information from
the Government on how the board will operate, therefore, before we can
agree that this might be a sensible change. We are not convinced at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
the organisations I have mentioned are critical of the draft charter,
about which the Minister has told us a little more. There is huge and
widespread consternation about the charter because we believe it will
be monitored by the hard-pressed voluntary sector. I am not sure
whether the voluntary sector considers having such a scrutiny role
appropriate unless it can ensure that some changes occur as a result.
We know that, in practice, charters often turn out to be rather
toothless and do not give the protection people want from problems with
the coroner service. That goes back to the point I made earlier: there
is huge concern that the special place the 2009 Act gave to bereaved
families will be lost in the new
structures.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon), who chairs
the all-party group on suicide and self-harm prevention, has written to
me, and it is important that we address some of the group’s
comments. It is concerned that the lack of leadership that will result
from the Government’s proposals will mean that the locally based
system, which has no national oversight, will continue. That will put
at risk research into suicides. In particular, it will prevent lessons
from quickly being learnt about what can lead to a huge rise in suicide
rates—my hon. Friend has some experience of this
issue—and the level of consistency between different coroners
will not be improved by the Government’s proposals. Indeed, the
all-party group has carried out a substantial review of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 233<a class="bkMark" name="Column233">&#160;</a>
                  </div>those proposals, and I urge the Minister to look at the points it makes.
In particular, it is concerned about the lack of consideration that
will be given to ongoing and relevant
research.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000087">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to return to the conversations the Minister has had with the many
organisations that are concerned about the amendment. It would appear
to the Opposition that they have put forward a sensible proposal to the
Government. They describe it as “a pragmatic way forward”
and wonder why the Government have not decided to concur with them in
their new approach. They say that the office of the coroner can be set
up with much lower costs. We heard nothing from the Minister earlier
about how the costs of the office could be reduced substantially. They
also say that the process that was implemented under the 2009 Act could
be elongated so that costs would not be borne so quickly in the next
few years. Again, we heard nothing from the Minister about why that
would not be possible. Thirdly, they suggest that the appeals process
could be delayed: instead of simply abolishing the appeals process that
was due to be introduced under the 2009 Act, it could be implemented at
a later
date.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
seems to be a very sensible set of suggestions. The Minister needs to
explain why the Government have decided to ignore completely the views
of many organisations that deal with the sensitive issues around the
operation of the coronial service and their proposals that would have
delayed the implementation of the 2009 Act and seriously reduced the
costs. We might have been able to get some consensus on that. I
conclude my comments there for the moment as I know that other Members
want to speak on this, but a significant set of points and challenges
have been put before the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000089">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I want to add my voice to those of
the many organisations that have spoken about this matter and of my
hon. Friend. They believe it is a mistake to abandon the reforms. They
were an important and clearly significant step forward and—in
the view of Inquest and the Royal British Legion, which my hon. Friend
mentioned—were essential, not just to bereaved families, but to
every one of us. I received testimony from those expert organisations
and I have a huge amount of respect for them. Like many other members
of the Committee, I have also received e-mails from bereaved families
who have gone through this process, families for whom the system did
not work. Their testimony is heartbreaking. It bears out the view of
the last independent reviewer of the system that the system is not fit
for purpose. It may work for some people but it simply does not work
for far too many.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000090">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was
particularly struck by those e-mails, one of which related to the death
of a child. As the Committee knows, I have an interest in issues
relating to children, and although this is not my particular expertise,
I was made aware of just how difficult it is when a child dies and how
important this process is to families.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">After reading
into the subject and learning more about it, it became clear that child
deaths require rigorous standards and strong national leadership, and I
am concerned that the Bill breaks something up that would have been
able to provide that. Although I welcome Ministers’ assurances
about the creation of a ministerial 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 234<a class="bkMark" name="Column234">&#160;</a>
                  </div>board, I have worked with several ministerial boards in my time and I
know that, by their nature, they are unable to do as thorough a job as
the reforms propose. Ministers are extremely busy, so ministerial
boards meet infrequently and can only devote a certain amount of time,
energy and attention to something that frankly deserves more.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The 2009 Act,
as we have heard from many expert organisations and my hon. Friend, was
about fundamental, co-ordinated reform. It was not only about the
office of chief coroner; it was about the office of chief coroner as
part of a tightly knit system, rather than a piecemeal one. The
frustration of Inquest and other organisations which have lobbied us
about this matter is so clear because that Act was fought very hard for
and this was such a significant step. Their frustration is borne out of
the fact that the system is now being fragmented and broken up even
though alternative proposals are on the table. We have all received a
lengthy set of proposals from those organisations, proposing an
elongated time scale for implementation and a full review of the
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As with many
other bodies that we have discussed in Committee over the past weeks,
the real concern is that the changes are happening so quickly. It took
so long to put this framework together and to devise something that
would really work and deliver a service that was of the standard that
families who are bereaved expect from us, but it has taken such a short
time to break that up and destroy it. That is the concern, and that is
why such organisations as Inquest and the Royal British Legion are
asking Ministers, as I am, to think again.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
particularly concerned about what will happen now that the appeals
system is not going ahead. When I worked in the voluntary sector, I was
involved with taking judicial reviews on behalf of families. The
circumstances were different but judicial review is a very lengthy
process. When dealing with bereaved families, adding to the amount of
time that it takes for them to get a proper answer and proper redress
is simply not appropriate—nor is it ethical, frankly, to force
families through a process that takes them that long to get closure.
Furthermore, for too many families—the statistics bear this
out—no redress at all is provided. Currently, we only see around
25 judicial reviews a year, even though thousands of cases come before
us. This approach cannot be right.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that Ministers have been given a very strong imperative—to cut
costs and abolish public bodies—but this is simply not the right
target for them, nor is it the right thing to do. I urge Ministers to
listen to such organisations as Inquest and the Royal British Legion,
and to take the provisions out of the Bill and discuss these matters
further. They should really consider the proposals that are on the
table, because how people are treated at such a difficult period
matters to them, not only at that time, but for the rest of their
lives. It matters, too, as part of a wider system that is so important
to all of us. I urge Ministers to think
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000096">&#160;</a>

                  </div>of the House spoke for his party on justice issues, and was also very
familiar with the 2009 Act as it went through Parliament. I am told
that there was cross-party support—I do not know whether that
extended to the Liberal Benches—for the establishment of the
office of chief coroner.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I wanted to
speak on this amendment because I have received a considerable number
of representations on this issue from the British Legion and people who
supported its campaign. I want to say at the outset that I
wholeheartedly support the British Legion and what it is trying to
achieve. The previous system, in which there were inadequate
arrangements for dealing with service personnel killed in Afghanistan
and Iraq, was simply not acceptable, and I entirely support the British
Legion’s campaign. I want to focus, however, on the leadership
role that was envisaged for the coronial service, and the framework
that would have been put in place. I would like to raise a few
concerns, which I hope the Minister can respond to.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000099">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I understand
the broader point that the Minister has made about functions being
transferred to the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor, but
there are deep worries that that will result in a fragmented service,
as my hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham and for Wigan have
just outlined. As I understand it, the chief coroner’s office
would have had the responsibility to drive up standards, issue
guidance, set national standards of performance and report annually to
the Lord Chancellor. Functions will be transferred to the Lord Chief
Justice and the Lord Chancellor, but some of those responsibilities
will not be transferred. I listened carefully to the remarks of the
Deputy Leader of the House, but I am coming at it from this angle. Many
members of the Committee will be familiar with the demographics of the
city of Leicester. If they are not, they are more than welcome to come
with me to Leicester, as long as they tell my constituents what a good

                  </strong> I would be delighted to visit Dover at some
point in the future and knock on doors for my party there. The serious
point is that I represent a city and a constituency that is rich in its
diversity. Families have come to Leicester over many years from across
the globe, from places such as India—from Gujarat and Punjab,
mainly, but also from elsewhere in India—Malawi, Uganda,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Somalia, Turkey and, in more recent years, from
Afghanistan and eastern Europe. We are tremendously diverse, and we are
proud of that. My city, and my constituency in particular, is graced by
numerous mosques, Hindu temples, a Jain temple, gurdwaras, synagogues
and many fine churches. We are a city of many faiths, and we are proud
of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Being a city
of many faiths brings with it many responsibilities, however. In
particular, we have responsibilities for how we deal with the deceased,
which sometimes differs from faith to faith. Members 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 236<a class="bkMark" name="Column236">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will appreciate that Muslim communities, for example, require burial to
take place as soon as possible, and that particular practices for
handling the body ought to be observed. Other communities require
cremation to take place as soon as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It should be
said that in Leicester our coronial service is very good indeed. Our
hospitals are good at dealing with such issues. We have many years of
experience, and a great deal of understanding and respect has built up
between the different communities about how such issues are dealt with.
When I talk to groups—the Muslim Burial Council of
Leicestershire is based in my constituency—they are very
welcoming of how we deal with such issues in Leicester, but they
express concerns about how burial, cremation and so on are dealt with
in other parts of the country. They feel that such issues vary from
district to district. Pushing for that universal level of service is
therefore something that would be appropriate for the chief
coroner’s office to do. Was it not envisaged that the chief
coroner’s office would lead in issuing guidance and
disseminating best practice on how to deal with various faith groups
and their burial needs? Where will that type of function now
fall?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
a written ministerial statement in June, the Lord Chancellor
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“As
the functions to be transferred are limited, and the Office of Chief
Coroner not filled, neither the judge nor any other individual will be

               </p>
               <p>So who
will be responsible? I appreciate that the Minister has mentioned the
ministerial board, which will be supported by a bereaved organisations
committee, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan has said,
Ministers are busy people, and I am not sure how often the board is
envisaged to meet. I know that Ministers sit on many Committees. I have
worked for Ministers and I know how busy their private offices can get.
I am not making a partisan point, but to what extent will the
ministerial board realistically be able to deal with issues and take
them up—obviously not day to day, but throughout the
year—in the way that a staffed chief coroner’s office
could?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have an example of another issue that needs to be raised. Faith groups,
and, to be fair, also people of no faith, sometimes have an objection
to invasive autopsies. Research, which happens to be from the
university of Leicester, is being done on imaging techniques that could
replace invasive autopsies. That is a good example of something a chief
coroner’s office could look at, to see whether such techniques
could replace invasive autopsies and be rolled out across the whole
coronial service. That is what groups in my constituency are arguing
for, and it is the sort of issue that a chief coroner’s office
could examine and pursue. I am not sure whether the ministerial board,
meeting three or four times a year or whatever, would have the time to
do that. I will be happy to hear the Minister’s thoughts on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
understand that the ministerial board will be supported by a bereaved
organisations committee. Will faith groups be represented on that
committee or on the ministerial
board?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a broader argument about costs, and I concede that the costs
outlined by Ministers do seem stark: start-up costs are £10.9
million, and running costs are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 237<a class="bkMark" name="Column237">&#160;</a>
                  </div>£6.5 million. Of the start-up costs, £4 million is for IT
and £2.5 million for recruitment, publications, additional
coroners and transition costs. It must be said, however, that there is
a great body of people out there who think that those costs are not
credible. I have worked in government and I am not sure whether they
are credible. There must be a better way of funding the scheme. The
Paymaster General is fond of boasting that he has managed to negotiate
better deals on Government procurement. Perhaps the Justice Secretary
should let the Paymaster General loose on this deal, because there must
be a better way of funding
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
reiterate what my hon. Friends have said: are there not concerns that,
because of the system that is being put in place, the number of
judicial reviews will actually end up costing more? The British Legion
has put forward a set of proposals for implementing the reforms much
more cheaply. I would welcome the Minister’s views on that. I
notice from yesterday’s <em>Hansard</em> that the Secretary of
State for Defence said that he had some sympathy for the proposals,
although he did go on to dismiss my hon. Friend the Member for West
Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle), who raised the issue, by saying that they
would cost too much. I would welcome the Minister’s views on
that,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
is a serious and delicate issue that affects people in all kinds of
ways. I mentioned how it affects people from faith groups in my
constituency. It is also perhaps worth reiterating what the director of
the British Legion said on hearing about the
proposal:<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We

families… The Legion campaigned long and hard as part of its

               <p class="tabbed">Before
I get to the serious business, I must say that I have visited the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency in Leicester. I learned of my
appointment to my present post while I was there. Rather
disconcertingly, I was at the ground of Leicester Tigers, who had
inexplicably just beaten Bath in the play-offs of the rugby
premiership, and was surrounded by Tigers fans roaring their support
for their team when I received a call from the Prime Minister, which
was difficult to hear in the circumstances. A little bit of history, my
personal history, took place in Leicester
South.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
us move on to more serious matters. The essence of the issue is not the
role of the chief coroner, which we are discussing today, but the
package of reforms. For many years, many of us have argued for reforms
to get the coronial system working better—for bereaved families
and for people involved with the system—and to make the system
more coherent and comprehensive across the country. Key to that are the
changes to working practice, standards of service, advice on training
and the coherence of the system. We must get those in place, which is
why I, among many others, was so impatient when, year after year
following the review of the coronial service, we were waiting for the
legislation. The legislation never happened and continued to never
happen—then eventually, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 238<a class="bkMark" name="Column238">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in 2009, we got the Bill. I maintain that it is the reforms to the
coronial system that are important, not the office of chief
coroner.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
are we actually discussing? We are discussing not the destruction of
the raft of proposals nor a reversal of Government policy, but whether,
under the current proposals, the role of the chief coroner is best
accomplished by the Lord Chief Justice, assisted by a High Court judge
with delegated powers for that purpose, or by a High Court judge with
powers given under the legislation for that purpose. That is the
distinction. It is a narrow distinction, but one with a cost. The cost
of setting up a self-standing body for the administrative functions,
rather than using the existing offices of  the Lord Chief
Justice and Lord Chancellor, is 
considerable.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester South asked about the costs. He raised an
eyebrow at the itemised costs, and I can exclusively reveal to him that
I did, too. They were worked out not by the present Government but by
the previous Government in their impact assessment of the 2009 Act. If
the costs are invalid now, they were invalid then. I trust the Ministry
of Justice has made a sensible assessment of the costs of implementing
a proposal that it wants to work
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000117">&#160;</a>

what the Government are saying—whichever Government worked out
those costs—and what Inquest and the Royal British Legion are
saying. That is why we are asking for this provision to be taken

idea that there has been no discussion with the organisations involved
is so far from the truth as to be unreasonable. What the Committee has
before it today is the result of continuing discussion and dialogue
with those bodies, and we have taken on board a lot of suggestions that
arose from those discussions. I accept that they are still not
satisfied with the outcome, but those discussions will continue. The
door is not closed, and I know that my colleagues in the Ministry of
Justice will want to continue to discuss the details of the proposal
and whether it can be improved, within the cost context we are
discussing. That is the point we cannot get away from as a Government:
there is a very substantial cost here, and it is not clear how that can
be met, except by trying to provide the best possible outcome within
the cost
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000119">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will come back to the alternative option a little later, but first I
need to address a number of points made by the hon. Member for City of
Durham. She talked about the need for the bereaved to be at the centre
of the process. That is absolutely the thrust of what is proposed.
There is no difference. The hon. Member for Leicester South mentioned
that there was all-party agreement on the direction of travel, and
indeed there was. We were very clear that the coronial system needs
radical reform—that is the basis upon which the previous
legislation was founded. Part of that process is making sure that the
voice of the bereaved is heard very clearly. That is why the proposed
set-up—the ministerial board, advised by the committee of
organisations for the bereaved—is absolutely crucial. It will
act as a sounding board for precisely those concerns about the way the
bereaved have so far been treated as part of the process. Those are
concerns we all
share.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for City of Durham also mentioned independence. There could
be no more independent person in the country than the Lord Chief
Justice. That been demonstrated time and again—by the present
post-holder and his predecessors—and I am not sure I can find a
better example. The Lord Chief Justice has both the status and the
necessary level of judicial independence to ensure that their voice is
heard. That, in my view, is crucial to the process. Judicial
independence is absolutely guaranteed by what is now proposed; it is
arguable that it was not under the original proposals. As a result of
listening to what was said in the other place, we have come back with a
measure that retains a clear strand of independence, and that should be
recognised.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady talked about reports learning lessons, and this is a key area
in which we have to ensure best practice. At the moment—and this
will continue—all reports from a coroner are sent to the Lord
Chancellor. That will still happen; moreover, it will be enshrined in
legislation and order; it will be published and sent to all those who
need to know about those reports. That includes the National Offender
Management Service, the prisons and probation ombudsman, the
ministerial council and the independent advisory panel on deaths in
custody. That process is clearly
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000124">&#160;</a>

the Department, in saying that I am sure that will be the case. That is
a key aspect of the reform process now under way. We have already
talked about the leadership role, which will be shared by the Lord
Chief Justice, in terms of the judicial aspects of the coronial system,
and the ministerial board. I heard what the hon. Member for Wigan said
about ministerial boards, and I have some sneaking sympathy with her
suggestion that there might be an overload on ministerial time.
However, there cannot be a better level of responsibility if one wants
things done. If one wants to drive through changes in practice, there
is executive power in place. That is the importance of the ministerial
board, provided it gets the right advice in a timely way. That is what
I hope will be achieved by the support systems that are being put in
place by the bereaved organisations committee, which I am sure will not
sit around twiddling its thumbs waiting for something to happen. It
will have a very active voice.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000128">&#160;</a>

have the composition of the committee, which partly answers the hon.
Member for Leicester South. There is no reason why that committee
should not include faith groups. Irrespective of whether it does, one
of its functions is to report on the charter, and that is particularly
sensitive to the different needs of faith groups in dealing with
deceased people. That function is inherent in what it does. The chair
of the bereaved organisations committee will be independent and a
strong advocate for the sort of reforms that we all want to

issue of appeals involves a financial decision. Setting up a bespoke
appeals process is an expensive option—one that Ministers in the
Ministry of Justice have decided cannot be justified in present
circumstances. Not having the appeals system will not increase the
number of judicial reviews, which will remain reasonably constant. One
factor that might be involved is that improved information will be
available to “users” of the inquest system. They will
have better information on how to seek redress if they feel that it is
appropriate to do so, which is an improvement on the present system. We
do not expect an increase in the number of judicial reviews as a result
of not introducing a new level of appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Comments have
been made about the charter. It is a draft, which is under
consideration, and we are open to the views of organisations that have
an interest. The Department will listen to any criticism of the
charter. It must be borne in mind that it refers to the current
coroners system, and it will have to be revised entirely as we drive
through the reforms to the coroners system to make it better. The
charter relates to what can be achieved under the current arrangements,
rather than to what we hope will be a very much improved system under
future
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000131">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
have not yet addressed the question of whether there is a low-cost
alternative. I reject the idea—I invite the Committee to do
likewise—that we can deal with the economic situation by simply
delaying reforms. I do not want these reforms delayed any further.
Delays in, and malfunctioning of, the coronial system causes damage to
families and individuals, which we cannot allow to persist, so we need
to drive the reforms forward. Extending the time period would not be a
satisfactory outcome. We need to look at how we can achieve the reforms
in the shortest possible time scale with the least cost, because doing
so is in all of our interests. Of course, the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 241<a class="bkMark" name="Column241">&#160;</a>
                  </div>money that is saved goes into ensuring that the system is more
effective. That supports the Government’s view that for the
reforms to be timely and effective, the role of the chief
coroner—which we do not propose to abolish—should be
taken on by the Lord Chief Justice, assisted by a High Court
judge.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000132">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
support of the ministerial board, with the assistance of the bereaved
organisations committee, and the powerful independent chairman will act
as a sounding board for the concerns that have been expressed.
Consideration is taking place—perhaps I might mention this in
light of the amendment made to the Armed Forces Bill last night in
another place—of how the performance of the coroners system, in
respect of not only military inquests but all inquests, can be properly
reported to Parliament, so that we have a much clearer handle on what
is going on.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000133">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The system
consists of a number of disparate individuals; coroners for each county
are separate judicial figures, and nothing in this world will dragoon
them all into the same pot, but they have a very important role to play
that needs to be undertaken with a great deal of care, consideration
and expertise. Our proposals allow the necessary reforms to be driven
through. I repeat: if the Committee votes against the amendment, it is
effectively voting not to have the raft of reforms. I appreciate that
there are arguments, which I do not diminish, to be had outside and
within the House about whether what is proposed is the best solution,
but the idea that one can achieve that best solution by not accepting
the amendment, which allows the chief coroner’s role to be
substantive, albeit carried out by the Lord Chief Justice, would lead
to a retrograde step. I urge the Committee to reject that view and
support the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000134">&#160;</a>

is largely consequential on amendment 36, which is in my

Secretary, Cabinet Office, who has responsibility for civil society. He
has been a powerful champion and advocate of civil society, the big
society and the extraordinarily far-reaching programme that the Prime
Minister has set out for a new flowering that will enable
decentralisation and localism, and let the whole big
society—social enterprises, mutuals and charities—to play
a larger role, so that it is not just the third sector but, as the
Prime Minister likes to say, the first sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000142">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Cabinet
Office has been doing a fantastic job as an advocate in Government for
this new way of thinking. Nevertheless, it does not always get its own
way, so I have moved an amendment to smooth things along for the Dover
harbour board, and to assist it in its positive dialogue with the
Department for Transport. That is another great Department that is
fixed in its view of the world. It is sometimes a little bit binary
when one would hope it was hexadecimal. I tabled the amendments to
further discussion on the future of the port of Dover, which is
important to my constituency of
Dover.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000143">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
should explain the background, and the mischief that the amendment
seeks to address. There is currently a proposal to privatise the port
of Dover under the Ports Acts 1991, which I am sure, Mr Amess, you
recall in minute detail. That Act essentially enables trust ports to be
privatised. It is a matter of major concern to my constituents. There
is a voluntary privatisation mechanism in section 9 of that Act, and a
compulsory privatisation mechanism in section 10. The port of Dover, or
the Dover harbour board, as it is officially known, has put it to the
Department for Transport that it would like to privatise itself under
section 9 of the Ports Act so that it can find someone to buy it,
whereupon it will become a private company, like so many ports in this
country that have taken that
route.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Ports Act 1991 was a great Act of its time. It was fine for two decades
ago, but the country has moved on. This old, stale debate about
nationalised or privatised, or nationally owned assets or privately
owned assets—the binary world of 20 years ago—has become
more nuanced in the post-bureaucratic age, the age of the information
revolution. That is because there is a greater sense of
knowledge—knowledge that is not just locked up in London in the
civil service or big business, but available to everyone across the
nation. It could be summed up as “We know as much as they
do.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000145">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that
point. It is an important and interesting question. In the early 1990s,
there was a proposal to privatise Dover under the Ports Act process. My
predecessor, David Shaw, fought against the proposal, and against a
Minister who was very determined to privatise the port of Dover. There
was then a reshuffle, and as is the way of these things, the new
Minister took a slightly different, more nuanced approach,
so the issue was put to one
side.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
was a change of Government in 1997, as most of us will recall. At that
point, the proposal was put on ice. Why did it pop up again under the
previous Government—a Labour Government who were not in favour
of privatisation? Under a so-called “modernising trust
ports” programme, they asked all trust ports in the UK to review
their status. Each trust port did so and came forward with proposals.
The idea was to improve their governance. Dover, however—a
harbour port that is unique in many ways—decided to put forward
a proposal not to improve its governance, but to privatise itself. It
concluded that, under the “modernising trust ports”
review, it wanted to sell itself off under section 9, and that was what
it put to the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
previous Government could have killed the situation off at that point.
Unfortunately, the timing was bad, at least for the people of Dover,
because this happened immediately after the financial crisis, and
suddenly the previous Government were in a very difficult financial
position. I will not go into the issue of blame or how the situation
came about, as that would not be helpful, and is not relevant to this
discussion. Given the financial crisis, the previous Government put
together a report called the “car boot
sale”—officially known as the operational efficiency
report—and put Dover into it, to sell off a number of assets to
plug a hole and give confidence to the markets, so that we would be
able to borrow. There was a coalescence of timing: on the one hand,
there was a port that suddenly wanted to sell itself off, and on the
other, the Government were in need of rapid cash, and that led to a
situation in which a voluntary privatisation process was suddenly under
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All that took
place immediately before the general election. A key plank of my
personal manifesto to the people of Dover was that I did not want to
see a privatisation like this go ahead, as it was manifestly not in the
interests of the community. The idea had been tested by my party at the
previous general election, and the voters gave a clear response,
showing what they thought about selling off the port of Dover. I
therefore took the position that there would be a better
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
won the election, I put forward an alternative proposal, and I moved
the amendment to ensure that there is greater consideration, so that
rather than having a vanilla privatisation process, there can be reform
under the Public Bodies Bill. The process can then take place under the
reform mechanism, so that instead of the old-fashioned, 1980s approach
of “just sell it off if it’s not bolted down—and
possibly even if it is”—an approach that the previous
Government continued—we can adopt a more nuanced approach,
including the ideas of social enterprise and mutuality that Prime
Minster has been
advancing.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000151">&#160;</a>

and his point is brilliantly made. The Bill sits across the
political landscape rather like a superstructure. It does not change
the landscape at all. If the amendment were accepted, it would be an
additional tool in the tool bag of the Secretary of State for
Transport. It would not in any way prevent him from proceeding under
the Ports Act 1991, if that was what he wanted to do, and if that was
the thrust of policy in his Department, irrespective of the ambit of
the wider Government policy and vision for social enterprises, mutuals,
the big society and community engagement. It would not in any way
detract from the Secretary of State’s powers under the Ports Act
1991.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000153">&#160;</a>

Preseli Pembrokeshire, the Whip, who is not permitted to speak in this
Committee. However, I assure the Committee that all Members who have
ports in their constituency wrestle with this issue: on the one hand, a
port is a business, but on the other, it is also a social beast, to
which communities attach. Communities have concern for and an affinity
with their port, and desire a level of engagement. A port is a key
asset. It dominates the whole coastline of a coastal town. People
engage with it very readily, want a say about it, and want it to be
part of the community.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000154">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful
intervention. Let me turn to that key question: how does the community
of Dover and Deal, which I represent, feel about the proposal? As a
Member of Parliament in a marginal seat who believes in engaging widely
with constituents, I have been in dialogue with them, and have put the
proposal to them. Following public meetings, we had a referendum on the
issue in Dover. It is not possible to have a district-wide referendum
until the Localism Bill has passed through the House. However, reading
my law books and dusty tomes, I discovered that there was a provision
in the Local Government Act 1974 for a parish poll. I discovered that
while it was intended for villages with about 500 people and a dog and
maybe a
horse—<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000156">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Indeed; a cat, and a variety of other animals
that cannot vote. I realised that the rules pertaining to parish
councils also applied to town councils. One could offer a statutory
referendum to a town with a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 245<a class="bkMark" name="Column245">&#160;</a>
                  </div>properly constituted town council, which Dover has. The rules are
slightly odd, as it is quite an old Act: voting can take place only
between 4 o’clock in the afternoon and 9 o’clock at
night, and there can be no postal or proxy votes. Despite that, turnout
in the referendum was higher than at the previous district council
elections. The result has been described by colleagues as North Korean:
98% of voters were in favour of what we call the people’s
port—the community mutual social enterprise
option—whereas 2% were against, and a small fraction spoiled
their papers. The reason why it was North Korean rather than
Saddam-Hussein Iraqi was that we did not get more than 100% of
the vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
serious point is the strong, unanimous community endorsement. I
received a number of angry e-mails from constituents in other villages
and towns who could not vote, demanding to have a say. I had to explain
that the referendum could only be in one town, and to have multiple
referendums would cost a lot on their parish rates. Following a public
meeting of about 500 people, the people of Dover were prepared to hold
the referendum as part of the process. They understood that it would
cost £15,000. They were up for that, because they felt it was
such an important issue for the future of the town and the constituency
as a whole. They wanted to have that say and send that message to the
Government. That was classic, strong, powerful community engagement.
They wanted to communicate, and to say to Government, “This is
the way the community wants to go.” They did not want the port
sold off to the French or whoever; they wanted it to be owned by the
community—to have the community right to buy. They wanted the
chance to own and operate their port.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000159">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">When one
thinks of the community right to buy, one thinks of the village shop,
the post office or the pub. A port that is worth north of £200
million is a little more substantial. As a strong advocate of the big
society, decentralisation and localism, I would argue there should be
no difference in principle if a credible, sensibly funded proposal is
put together to enable that to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000160">&#160;</a>

the amendment, his general erudition, and the support for this project.
Were Watford a port, which I have always argued it should be, I would
do exactly the same. My hon. Friend is very fond of the word
“nuance”. I have made a note to use it in future
interventions and speeches, because I like the nuances of it. Does he
perceive the social enterprise as being on the public or private side,
if it were a binary choice? Having seen the proposal, it seems to me
that significant amounts of private capital are involved. Would he
accept that, whether it is a social enterprise or not, the entity
providing the private capital needs exactly the same kind of return
that it would get if the project were
private?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000161">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful
intervention, which gives me an opportunity to explain. First, let us
assume that a person owns a house and has a mortgage, which most of our
countrymen do. That is borrowing, but who owns the house—the
person or the bank? Economically, it is clearly the bank, but in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 246<a class="bkMark" name="Column246">&#160;</a>
                  </div>fact the person owns the house, and feels that it is theirs. They feel
much more strongly engaged with it, Conservative Members would say,
than a tenant would be. Home ownership is essential to their sense of
control and engagement. It is up to that person what colour they paint
their house, whether they do renovations, and how the garden looks.
They end up with the attributes of ownership, and are not simply
watching the house. If someone else owns the house, or the person sells
the house, it is no longer anything to do with them—a point that
goes to the heart of the community social enterprise
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000162">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
community would be the owners of the port. They would not sit there
having to watch it, as they would if remote directors—either
appointed by the Department for Transport in London, or responsible to
other people far away—were appointed. In either case, the
community does not get a say. In this case, the community would, with
the attribution of ownership.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend raised a point about returns. The essence of his argument was
that the cost would be the same. As we both know, there is a big
difference between the return demanded by an equity investor and that
demanded by a debt investor. An equity investor will want up to 8% or
10% real, whereas a debt investor will want something closer to 2%
real. That goes to the heart of why the ferry companies—the port
users—are so enthusiastic about the scheme. A key aspect of it
is that it would be funded by bonds put in the market in the City of
London. That fundraising has effectively been agreed in principle,
subject to the usual due diligence, to the tune of £200 million.
There would be a very low rate of return, and if the facility has a low
rate of return—or a very low cost rate for the investment in
it—the cost that the facility needs to charge to its users or
customers is lower, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is
another major issue for the community, because a whole load of ferry
companies are deeply concerned about the price path that the harbour
board wants to put in place. The board wants to increase prices by a
third over the next three years, at a time when ferry companies are
starting to recover and see trade and revenues stabilise after a
difficult and painful downturn. If the price path and mooring fees rise
by a third, the companies will be put under considerable financial
pressure and strain, which will result in them having to look for
savings, particularly through jobs. That directly concerns my
electorate, because the ferry companies are responsible for about 5,000
local jobs. As a constituency MP, the challenge to which I am trying to
rise is that of protecting the jobs and businesses of my electorate. I
want to ensure that their costs are not increased, and that people are
not put out of work unnecessarily. That can be achieved simply by using
a different form of financing, building on the community
mutual.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000165">&#160;</a>

an example in my constituency, the Galeri arts centre, which cost about
£5 million to build. By European standards, at least, it is a
first-class arts centre, built in a town of 10,000 people. The crux of
the matter as far as Galeri is concerned—I would be interested
to hear the hon. Gentleman’s remarks on this point—is its
accountability to the local community. How does he see the development
in Dover achieving that direct accountability to the
community?<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000166">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman’s
point. Accountability is a central part of this. In trying to put
together a proposal that squares the circles, I have had to do my best
to protect the competitive position of the port users, the ferry
companies, which are in competition with Eurotunnel. Secondly, I have
had to address my constituents’ deep concerns, patriotic as they
are, about the idea of their port, as they see and feel it, being sold
off overseas. That is a deeply felt, emotional position. Thirdly, I
have had to ensure that there would be regeneration—a subject to
which I will return in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will now address the point raised by the hon. Member for Arfon on
accountability. If a mutual, or any social enterprise, is to engage
with the community and to work properly, the governance and
accountability issue needs to be solved. The question is: what do we
do? How do we work out the solution to that problem? First, there are
the bond markets, which want to ensure that, as they would put it, the
lunatics do not take over the asylum. It is always the fear of the
money markets that, somehow, mad community groups will take over and
wreck their investment. To my mind, that is not a real concern, but a
generalised fear. I do not see it as a real concern because, back in
the day, building societies were mutuals. Theoretically, the people who
had money in building societies could impose boards of directors that
might have behaved in wild and outlandish ways. Some investors, and the
Government, are concerned that unqualified people will take over and do
rash
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000168">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful case
for local community ownership of the port of Dover. Does he acknowledge
that in this country there have been many interesting methods of
community ownership and housing ownership? Much earlier in the 20th
century, well before I was born, the National Union of Mineworkers
instigated a mortgage scheme in Wales so that colliers could buy their
own home. There are many interesting examples from the co-operative
tradition, which is one of the reasons why the hon. Gentleman’s
comments are so
interesting.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000169">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Of course the trade union movement was, and is,
a co-operative movement. From time to time, Government Members do not
agree with the positions taken by the leaders of that movement. I wish
those leaders would concentrate more—and more of their
subscriptions—on helping their membership, rather than running
around organising campaigns, but that is a political issue rather than
the substance when it comes to trade unions and the important role that
they can
play.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
history of building societies does not lie in the financing houses that
they have become. They built houses, one by one, on a mutual basis.
Housing associations, like the housing association movement, are, in
many cases, mutual and social enterprises. They are responsible for
substantial amounts of money and investment. If they were private and
listed, the biggest housing associations, such as Places for People,
would be on the FTSE 100. One might think that mutuals could be taken
over by people in communities who will do crazy things, but many
mutuals are large and serious businesses, with serious corporate
governance and serious accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000171">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">How, then, do
we solve the accountability conundrum? The way to solve it would be to
ensure that there is ownership while ensuring that, as with housing
association financing, the business plan is effectively locked. There
would be undertakings and an agreement between the port users and the
port that financing and services would be provided in a particular
manner that would ensure that the port has the funds to service the
interest and make investments, as agreed under a framework agreement
with the port users. In return, the port users would underwrite the
revenues of the port, which would underwrite the interest on the bonds
and would give the port a lower rate of interest and a higher credit
rating. In essence, to use City-speak, the port would become a
non-statutory contractually regulated utility. Effectively, the port
would become like a water
company.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000172">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is a very good question. How do we know
that an indicative pledge will turn into a real and funded one? As my
hon. Friend will know, having been to the City of London and spent time
with the chief executive of the London stock exchange, the London stock
exchange was excited about the idea of having bonds on its exchange and
excited about the port of Dover—just as it was excited about the
recent retail bond issue by Places for People—so that it can
create a quoted market. Places for People’s retail bond issue
went exceptionally well. In the same way, I think that the port of
Dover would have no problems getting away bonds to raise the purchase
price to buy it off the Government, for the simple reason that we have
safe, strong revenues and a secure return. That would enable that issue
to take place, and I would expect it to be underwritten by the
financial advisers. They assure me that that issue could be
underwritten without difficulty.
<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
should add that this is not a fly-by-night proposal but a serious and
substantial one. Substantial financial advisers in the City have been
involved with it. The president of the People’s Port Trust is
Sir Patrick Sheehy, who used to run British American Tobacco. Not
everyone here will approve of tobacco companies quite as much as I do,
as a smoker from time to time, but it is a substantial business and he
is a substantial businessman who brings immense credibility. Likewise,
Algy Cluff, who opened up the North sea to oil exploration, is a
director. Serious and substantial people who live locally are directors
of the People’s Port Trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The idea is
that the trust is a mutual, and anyone can join for £10. The
members of that mutual vote for half the board, and half the board is
made up of stakeholders, local councillors, myself—or my
successor; the Member of Parliament for Dover at the time—the
chamber of commerce and a say for the port users. That is how that side
is organised. The proposal is that one third of the directors of the
operational port company will be appointed by the People’s Port
Trust. One third of the directors will be appointed by port users, so
that they have a say in the boardroom, and the other third would be the
management of the port.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000176">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We would never
get a situation where the community would be able suddenly to do wild
and wacky things, because they would never have a majority for it. They
would always be outvoted by the port users or the management. We would
never get a situation where the port users would try to skew the
business plan to suit their interests, because the management and the
community would prevent that. In that way, by having everyone in the
boardroom working together positively in a partnership for the
improvement of the port, we would have sound, secure financing.
Everyone would have a say, everyone would be involved and the community
would retain overall ownership. I hope that that would give the
community a bounce of confidence, because the one thing that Dover
needs, as a town with a lot of deprivation, is more confidence. A
bounce of confidence would have powerful and important economic
effects, and we all understand that confidence is key to driving the
economy forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Returning to
regeneration, which is the third leg that I mentioned earlier, the
business plan will put £50 million aside for the
regeneration of the Dover seafront. Why does that matter? We have a
lovely seafront. Half of it is what is called the eastern docks, which
are operational in nature, with ferries going in and out majestically
in the shadow of the white cliffs. The western side, however, was
decimated 60 years ago in the war. It was very beautiful but it has
never quite been rebuilt, so it is all a bit of a muddle. It is a cross
between spaghetti junction, with roads going round lifted
helter-skelter in the air, and buildings that are half falling down,
isolated and island-like.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000178">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
that regeneration fund of £50 million would kick-start the
regeneration of the western side. One might ask why that has not been
done before. Why has the harbour board over the past 60 years not done
something to improve the western docks area? The reason is two-fold.
First, it was not its core interest. It is interested in pushing
ferries in and out, not in what the community is concerned about, which
is the regeneration of the seafront. Secondly, it would find it
difficult to raise the funds to do so, because—we are
told—a port’s borrowing is scored under the public sector
borrowing requirement, because all the directors are appointed by the
Government. That means that the port theoretically cannot borrow,
because it is an emanation of the state and therefore it scores as
public borrowing. The other problem is that as an emanation of the
state it is also hidebound by EU procurement rules. The advantage of
having a community mutual, as opposed to a current trust board, is that
there are no EU procurement issues or PSBR borrowing restrictions;
investment is then possible. That is also the advantage of
privatisation—the more fleet-of-foot side.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
difficulty of privatisation is the continued sense of alienation that
has dogged Dover for the past 50-odd years. People feel very alienated
from the port; they feel the harbour board does what it pleases and
does not work in partnership with its port users or the community. A
vanilla privatisation would not change that. That comes to the heart of
the difficulty that faces me as a constituency MP: how to fire up that
community 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 250<a class="bkMark" name="Column250">&#160;</a>
                  </div>engagement and regeneration; how to protect those jobs in the ferry
industry and port users; and how to foster a greater sense of
partnership between the businesses, between the port and the community.
The proposal of the people’s port is the essence of the big
society, social enterprise, mutuals and what can be done. It does not
have to be on a small scale; the big society can be—dare I say
it—big. One cannot get much bigger than  £200
million.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am aware that I am probably the first MP for about a century, since Joe
Chamberlain was building Birmingham, to put together a serious piece of
corporate financing in my own constituency off my own bat without any
public funding, officials or assistance. I had to dream it up from the
structuring I used to do as a tax lawyer before I arrived here. In my
dialogues with Government I have been very open to a positive
engagement of how the proposal we have put together and submitted to
Government can be improved on, implemented and worked up. I have found
it difficult at times to get the kind of engagement with the Department
for Transport that is in line with the vision that the Prime Minister
set out and inspired me to draw up the proposal in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
responsible for civil society and other Ministers have been extremely
generous, and I want to pay tribute to them. My purpose in the
amendment is to send a stronger message to the Department for Transport
than it has currently received—that the Prime Minister’s
vision is a good one and that social enterprises, mutuals and the
co-operative movement are great for our age. In the information age,
they are something we can do more. I was personally inspired by the
Minister’s remarks on “Newsnight” recently when he
talked so movingly and powerfully about the desire to encourage
communities to rise up and have a greater sense of their own destiny,
to build with the tool set that we have in the modern
age.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I recognise
how difficult it is to make that kind of change, because there is an
amazing amount of inertia in the Government machine. There always will
be; any Government will find that. I am sure that former Ministers on
the other side of the aisle will realise that as much as anyone on this
side of the aisle. It can be difficult for new thinking and new ideas
to take root to make change. It takes a long time, so I am aware that I
am trying to beat down the door of the House with a reform that the
Government are trying to prosecute. They are doing their very best, but
it is inevitably hard because government is so large and, much like a
supertanker, it is hard to turn around and move forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that I
have set out why the community mutual model is supported by 98% of the
community, by more than 90% in the port worker trade unions in a ballot
that they themselves had, and by the ferry companies, port users and
wider local business interests. The whole community is united in that
and in thinking that the harbour board has not taken the best approach.
It is about not only privatisation, but something much wider. It is
about a whole sense of engagement with the harbour board, how its
members behave towards the community and about the perception that
through privatisation members of the harbour board will net millions in
share incentives based on the embedded value of the company and the
business that they did not build up—it was built up over four
centuries.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000184">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not think
that anyone on the Government Benches has problems with share
incentives for earned rewards, but not for rewards based on something
that was there beforehand. That is why the 1990s’ privatisations
sometimes went wrong; they allowed the embedded value of companies to
go to executives and management, rather than give share incentives for
management and executives to build up and be rewarded for the value
they created. In that way, my community and I are strongly capitalist
and say that this is not an opportunity to grab a load of loot and do a
runner. It is wrong in principle for share incentives and investment
rewards to be granted where that value has not been created or added to
by the people in question. It is a very powerful view in my community
that value has not been added to or created by the management, who
would do very well out of the current privatisation
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
community is cynical for the same reason and believes that the
motivation behind the privatisation proposal and the enthusiasm of the
harbour board for it might be that board members will substantially
benefit from it, to the tune of between £15 million and
£20 million, by my calculation. It is a substantial
amount of money, which I look at and think, “I want that for the
community”. I have to capture maximum value and benefit for my
bosses—the electors who sent me here—and, in tabling the
amendment, putting together this organisation and winning support
across the community, that is what I am trying to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister, who has put up with me for so long, as have
other Members on the Committee, will tell me whether he is minded to
accept the amendment with a view to encouraging our friends in the
Department for Transport to go further towards embracing how things
could be done.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000187">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on,
first, breathing life into the Government Benches with his amendments
and, secondly, speaking to the amendments so powerfully. We return to
flattery again in the Committee, and it will be interesting to see
whether the Minister succumbs to it and supports the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman said, but I disagree ever so
slightly with him over whether the Government are making great progress
on the big society agenda. I think we are on the fourth relaunch of the
big society project and it does not seem to be exactly resonating with
all members of the public, the voluntary sector or, given the length to
which he seems to have to go to get them to listen to what the
community wants, with all of Government. I wanted to spend a moment or
two looking at why the Government object so strongly to a really
sensible proposal from the hon. Gentleman.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is clear
from the Localism Bill that the Government wish to give communities
more say and more control over what happens to their local areas. Here
is a golden 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 252<a class="bkMark" name="Column252">&#160;</a>
                  </div>opportunity for Ministers to listen to what the local community want and
to agree to it. Indeed, it puts a huge question mark over whether the
Government mean anything by the Localism Bill if they are not prepared
to listen to what the community wants in this case and to the excellent
arguments that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward on its
behalf.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
years ago, and over a period of time, we may have considered a body of
this nature to be either public or private, and we did not sufficiently
consider whether there were other forms of ownership that might be more
suitable for some of our public bodies. Since 2007-08, a lot more
consideration has been given on a cross-party basis to alternative
forms of delivery. That has considerably strengthened the consideration
that is given in the House to co-operatives and other forms of mutual
and employee-owned companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
perfectly reasonable to suggest that in 2008 we should have considered
a whole set of options for bodies of this nature, in addition to that
of privatisation. Indeed, across the board now, and in a variety of
different circumstances, many organisations are looking at
co-operatives and at becoming mutual in a way that they would not
previously have done. It will come as no surprise to the Committee to
learn that the Opposition support co-operatives and mutuals. They are
very much part of our foundations as a party and we feel we should have
done more over time to promote co-operatives. Therefore there is much
in the hon. Gentleman’s case that we would wish to
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want to say something about how the hon. Member for Dover has
engaged with the local community about what it wants, and I am sure
that a number of us will look anew at the 1974 Act. It is not a piece
of legislation that I am terribly familiar with, but by the end of the
week I will be a lot more familiar with it. It seems a very useful
piece of legislation in terms of going out there, having a type of
referendum with the local community and gaining excellent evidence in
support of the position that he puts forward. I agree that 98% is
startling, but it indicates the huge strength of support in the local
community for having ownership in some form of the port of Dover. Given
the lengths to which he has gone to register that community support, I
hope that the Minister will listen to what he has to say.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What is
really powerful about this case is not just the level of community
engagement and endorsement, but the further lengths to which he has
gone to make this proposal stack up. The first of these is getting the
users of the port involved as well as other agencies so that it is not
just the community but it is backed up by other organisations
locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11101183000194">&#160;</a>
