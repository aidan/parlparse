<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I should like to clarify the question that I put to the Minister this morning. We were talking about staff, their terms and remuneration, and we agreed that staff would probably be seconded to the new development agencies from three principal bodies: government offices, English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission. Because those are all government agencies, their employees have civil service terms and conditions and work under the same framework of remuneration. Will RDAs be agencies in the way that English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission are agencies, and will their staff enjoy civil service pay and conditions in other words, will they be civil servants? If they will be, we know exactly what they will be paid because that is public knowledge, and we know that the chairman is likely to be paid the same as a chairman of the Environment Agency or English Partnerships. But will other staff be employed on other than civil service contracts? Is it intended that the RDAs will eventually employ people in their own right and, if so, will those people be employed as civil servants? It would be very helpful to have an answer to that and I am sure that it need not detain the Committee for long. Having clarify my question, I hope that the Minister can clarify his answer.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning </B>(Mr. Richard Caborn): It is nice to see you this afternoon, Mr. Benton. Welcome to the Committee. It has been running extremely smoothly, except for one or two Opposition Members, but I think that they are coming to heel.
<P>
I must inform the Committee that I have to see the Prime Minister at half-past 5, so I shall be absent for 35 or 40 minutes later this afternoon.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) asked some very important questions, as did the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) just before lunch, and they are being considered.
<P>
Regional development agencies will take over functions on 1 April 1999 from three organisations: government offices in the regions, English Partnerships, and the Rural Development Commission. They will need staff to carry out those functions. It makes sense for those staff in government offices, English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission to move to the RDAs to ensure a continued and seamless delivery of those functions. The precise arrangements for moving those staff are in the process of being worked out, in conjunction with the three organisations, the trade unions and staff.
<P>
Elsewhere in the Bill, we included provisions ensuring that if staff are transferred to RDAs, they will be transferred on their existing terms and conditions, and with their continuity of employment. They will therefore not be disadvantaged.
<P>
As the right. Hon member for Skipton and Ripon said, this means that the RDAs will inherit staff on a range of different terms and conditions. That is part and parcel of setting up NDPBs in this way, as he will know. In time, of course, the RDAs may wish to harmonise their terms and conditions. In doing so they will go through the usual consultation processes with staff. The RDAs will be also be required to agree with the Secretary of State certain matters, as described in the financial memorandum, such as the pay and grading system, and a job evaluation scheme; this is the means of providing the control to which the amendment of the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) alludes.
<P>
NDPBs, such as English Partnerships and the Environment Agency, have, of course, successfully handled this process of accommodating staff who come from several different organisations. We are not advocating something new here that is untried and untested.
<P>
There is scope for use of transfers, as described, or secondments. The final arrangements have not been made. We are still consulting those concerned, and we should like moves to be voluntary. We will do our best to accommodate the views of staff, but we must ensure that effective programme delivery continues and that RDAs have sufficient staff to continue the functions which they inherit from other organisations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cheadle asked about pensions. If staff transfer to RDAs and become employees, they will not lose existing pension entitlements. Pension entitlements will be preserved. RDAs will be required to provide broadly comparable pension schemes, as certified by the Government Actuary's Department. It is important to remember that staffing issues created by the establishment of a non-departmental public body which takes over functions from existing bodies is nothing new. English Partnerships and the Environment Agency are two good recent examples.
<P>
I assure Opposition Members that I discussed staff arrangements with English Partnerships, a relatively new body, when I visited various regions. It said that they had evolved into an acceptable way of working. Indeed, some people said that they would not want to return to their conditions of work as civil servants.
[Mr. Richard Caborn]
<P>
We have a tried and tested formula. It is right that questions be asked. I hope that my statement will satisfy Opposition Members and, more importantly, the many thousands whose jobs will be disrupted. I hope that I have been able to inject some certainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> At lunchtime, I took the precaution of phoning English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission about their regional offices. I was told that all the people who worked for them were civil servants. They have the civil service statute and receive civil service pay rates. Will the people who work for RDAs be civil servants? Will they be on the civil service pay scale or, even if they are seconded, not be on it? RDAs have the right to set their own pay rates which might differ across the country. Will their employees cease to have the statute of civil service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> As far as I understand it, NDPBs do not carry civil service conditions. Conditions could be better. I spoke to people at English Partnerships I do not think that it would be right to give names who said that they believed that their structures were better than those when they were civil servants. They are not on civil service grades. They went into English Partnerships on civil service grades, but they are not on them now, nor are they tied to them. They believe that the flexible arrangement for their conditions is a better model. If I am wrong, I shall let the committee know it is an important, non-debating point. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to let me know where his information came from, it would help us to put out the correct story.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> This is not a political argument. We have hit a point of fact on which we are not clear. If the Minister were to investigate and write to members of the Committee on how he expects the situation to develop in the three parent bodies who will donate staff, I am sure that he will satisfy that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): I thank the Minister for his response on pensions. I am sure that it will be of some reassurance, especially for those working on the Urban Regeneration Agency.
<P>
The Minister will recall that I was given the impression that people working for the Urban Regeneration Agency are to have no choice whether they move. That is why their terms and conditions are so important. When similar agencies were established, was it common for specific staff to be mentioned in the explanatory notes memorandum? We return to the issue of complusion. Page 5 of the explanatory memorandum states:
"Staff working in the Urban Regeneration Agency, the Development Commission and government departments working on the programmes which will pass to the agencies will be expected to move to employment with one of the agencies."<P>

<P>
I may be misreading it, but that sounds like complusion to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We will clarify those matters, but my understanding is that staff are expected to move to one of the agencies. As I said in response to earlier questions, we want this to be a seamless process so as not to lose the tremendous skills and expertise of those who work in the Urban Regeneration Agency and other agencies, many of whom are proud of the work that they do.
<P>
It is not in the Government's interest to wave a big stick and use complusion; that it not the way to get the best out of people. We shall hold normal discussions and negotiations, which we hope will enable people with expertise to develop their skills within the RDAs. I think that "expected" is the right word, as it does not spell out complusion; the normal course of negotiations, through trade unions and other channels, will be used to ensure that the transfers are as seamless as possible. English Partnerships is not the first example of this: the Environment Agency and a number of other non-departmental public bodies have been set up and have worked smoothly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo: </B>(South Suffolk): I, too, welcome you, Mr. Benton, as chairman. I would also like to agree with the Minister's comment that the Committee is proceeding smoothly. If I may use his words, the only occasional difficulties have been caused by one or two Labour Ministers.
<P>
The value of the amendment is being recognised. It exposes some areas where Labour and Opposition Members are trying to clear up doubts. Those doubts are of great concern to the employees of the three bodies that are to be subsumed, in due course, into the RDAs. Those individuals will no doubt pay close attention to the Minister's comments.
<P>
So that the Minister covers all the questions that we have raised when he responds in writing, or in whatever form seems to be most effective it would be helpful if I summarise the position. RDAs will have some staff of their own who will be directly recruited, presumably on terms settled by the RDAs and a second category of staff seconded from other agencies, of which the Minister has mentioned three. Will those staff be paid directly by the other agencies or by the RDAs? If they are to be paid by the RDAs, will they be paid according to the pay scales and terms and conditions set by their previous employer? If so, is there not a possibility which I think my right honourable Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon was trying to get at that two people could do the same or similar jobs while being employed on different terms and conditions, as a result of coming from a different component part of the RDA? I would be interested to know whether the Minister thinks that that is a satisfactory position, and whether he can confirm that that will be the position; but it appears to be the logical position according to what the Committee has been told so far. If that is the position, will the Minister tell us perhaps we could have this information rather sooner than the other how long he thinks that it would be appropriate to maintain such a position?
<P>
Would it be right for an RDA, which would presumably try to devolop a distinct identity reflecting the region that it represents, to persist with a situation in which two people doing the same or similar work were being enployed on different terms? Is it the Government's intention to establish a degree of integration in the pay and conditions of all employees of RDAs, regardless of the bodies for which those employees originally worked? If so, it would be interesting to know how quickly the Government intend to achieve such integration. If that is not the Government's intention, it seems to me that the pay and conditions applicable to RDA employees will be in a frightful muddle. I cannot imagine that that will be helpful in ensuring the success of the RDAs.
<P>
The information that we seek is important because staff will have to consider soon perhaps even now whether they wish to move; as my honourable Friend the Member for Cheadle pointed out, some are being asked, or even compelled, to do so.
<P>
Certainly, they will want to consider what the future holds. To know that their current pay and conditions will continue indefinitely is one thing. Knowing that there will be a process of integration and that pay and conditions may change means that they want to know how soon that will happen and what the effect will be.
<P>
Those points lead directly to questions about the staff of the Rural Development Commission. Since the Government announced the RDC's dismemberment before Christmas, there has been concern among the staff about their futures. My honourable Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) raised the matter on Second Reading, when he said that the staff had
"expressed grave concern about their jobs. They are worried because they have heard nothing about their future, whether it be with the RDA or on the dole." [Official Report, 14 January 1998; Vol, 304, c. 380.<P>

<P>
He was referring particularly to the East Anglia RDC office in his constituency.
<P>
<H5>4.45 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister was not able to give a detailed answer to my honourable Friend's concerns on 14 January. Can he tell us now what the position is for RDC staff? Will all of them be re-employed by the relevant RDA? On what terms will they be re-employed? Does he acknowledge that not to offer employment to some RDC staff would quite aside from the question of compensation be another example of how RDA concerns will be primarily urban rather than rural? That will be another indicator of the significance that the Government attach to the rural role of the RDAs.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify a couple of points that I raised when I moved the amendment. What proportion of RDA staff may be recruited from outside the agencies to which he has referred? Can he confirm that positions to be filled by such staff will be filled by open recruitment?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful rather than to score political points. I shall respond in kind.
<P>
In the case of English Partnerships, it took two or three years to harmonise staff who came from various departments. That worked extremely well. It was the same with the Environment Agency. Several non-departmental public bodies have been staffed from various organisations civil service and others and have been integrated.
<P>
There will be a period during which people will be on different levels of pay. It depends where they came from. EP will continue to deal with much the same as it did at regional level, as will the RDC in its regional development role and the civil servants from the local government office. There is plenty of precedent to show that NDPBs have evolved successfully.
<P>
Secondment has been mentioned. History showed that not many secondments happened, although secondment was available for people who wanted to transfer. In the main, people transferred to English Partnerships and the Environment Agency in the job that they had been doing. It is common sense to say that to move people who are not all civil servants on their existing terms and conditions from three, four or five different organisations into just one will mean differences in wages and conditions. That organisation will evolve naturally and through negotiation and good will to become one organisation. English Partnerships took about three years to arrive at that position.
<P>
I was surprised by the statement of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds on Second Reading. We have gone to great lengths to meet the various organisations, including English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and I visited all the regions and asked the relevant government office for the region to ensure that staff were available. To the best of my knowledge, that process was applied in all the regions. I must put on record the letter that I sent in response to the hon. Gentleman. It states:
"I am sorry you felt, as you said in the debate on 14 January, that the Rural Development Commission (RDC) staff in East Anglia had not been kept informed about their future leading to the establishment of the Regional Development Agencies ... I am assured that meetings at local level, chaired by RDC officials, are being held regularly. In addition, staff in the region were invited to a meeting" <P>

<P>
I should stress that all staff were invited 
"On Monday 5 January 1998 in Cambridge, led by Angela Eagle, to question her on our RDA policy. I am told that 14 out of the 20 regional staff attended the meeting. Those unable to attend were subsequently briefed in full by the Regional Manager. This meeting was part of a tour of all the regions by myself and Angela, which I referred to in the debate.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I agree it is important during this period of change that staff are kept informed of developments. Staff are understandably concerned about their futures, and we have ensured that information is passed on as soon as practicable."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot think of another Department that has consulted in that way. If the Conservative Government had done so, some of the problems that we currently face would not have been created. The six staff who did not attend the meeting were contacted by their manager. Our approach which we adopted in the nine English regions involves a reasonable standard of good relations with staff.
<P>
We have given commitments about the transfer of RDC staff in the regional offices who are engaged in regeneration work, and we shall say where those in the national RDC will be placed when we have completed the Government's comprehensive spending review. We discussed that with the chairman and the chief executive, and the staff have been informed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the fact that he envisages a two or three-year period for the integration of the pay and conditions of the staff who will join the regional development agencies, and[Mr. Yeo]
for explaining the process already vouchsafed to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds that his Department adopted to keep Rural Development Commission staff informed.
<P>
However, I retain considerable concern about the fact that, even at this stage, he is not able to give any assurance about the proportion of RDC staff who are likely to lose their jobs. That is a cause of great anxiety for the individuals concerned and for those of us 
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I must make the situation absolutely clear to prevent scaremongering. It is not right to use people's employment and livelihoods as a debating point. There are plenty of other matters that we can discuss in order to try to score a few points here and there. I must make it perfectly clear that all the RDC staff all of them who are working on regeneration will have a job with a regional development agency. We shall make a decision on the national headquarters staff when we receive the comprehensive spending review, which we hope will be completed as quickly as possible. Those who work in the regions are guaranteed to move with their terms and conditions as of today or when they are transferred to a regional development agency. I do not think that it is incumbent on the hon. Gentleman to try to make political capital out of people's job security. I have genuinely tried to answer his questions. As I said in a letter to his hon. Friend, we have been around the country. We want to ensure that those assurances are given and adhered to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It does not become the Minister to accuse me of trying to make political points. I am worried about the future of the RDC, which his Department has proposed to dismember. As someone who wants to defend its interests, it is reasonable that I should make inquiries about what arrangements he proposes to look after its staff. That is an entirely proper thing for the Opposition to do. I find it extraordinary that the Minister regards it as political point scoring. I am merely expressing my anxiety about these people's futures and about the future role of the RDC after almost a century of valuable work.
<P>
However, we have extracted rather tortuously from the Minister an assurance that was not previously available. He has given an assurance that the jobs of RDC staff working on regeneration programmes in the regions will be protected 
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> And conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B>  and conditions. That is a welcome statement, for which I am grateful. I hope that the Minister will at least acknowledge that it was his ministerial colleague's original statement in December that raised those anxieties.
<P>
From what the Minister has just said unless there is a further shift in position it is nevertheless true that he cannot tell the Committee what proportion of the staff at national level, working, presumably, for the RDC's headquarters, will retain their jobs. In order to minimise the period of uncertainty that they face, and so that we will know by how much his Department is downgrading the efforts put into the work of the RUC, will he tell us when he expects the comprehensive spending review to have reached a sufficiently advanced stage to be able to end the uncertainty that now hangs over those headquarters staff?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> As I said, we have told the RUC that we will accelerate the comprehensive spending review and answer those questions as quickly as possible. We will not move anyone until towards the back end of this year to set up the shadow boards. It will not be until 1 April 1999 that they become legal entities and staff are legally transferred. We have a lead time in order to accommodate all the changes in a proper, civilised way. As promised, we will consult the new chairman of the Rural Development Commission and keep him abreast of all discussions that are taking place within the Government so that staff are fully informed. I cannot give an exact date; as I have said, we are accelerating the comprehensive spending review to resolve those issues as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> So there is not even a target date inside the Department that the Minister could share with the Committee, whether it be June or September? Quarter three was given this morning as a sort of parameter for the appointment of RDA chairmen. Is there no internal timetable that can be exposed in any way at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> As I said, we are accelerating the comprehensive spending review. As soon as that has reported, we shall ensure that the RDC knows exactly what the outcome is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Although the answers are no doubt intended to be helpful and clarifying, some obscurity remains. In the light of that and of the fact that we may want to return to the matter on Report I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 25, line 5, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) Any officers and employees appointed under sub-paragraph (1) may join a trade union.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple, small amendment that makes it explicit and clear that all employees, whatever conditions they may ultimately be employed under, will be allowed, if they so wish, to join a trade union.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Angela Eagle): I add my welcome, Mr. Benton, to you in your first sitting as Chairman of the Committee? This is our first afternoon sitting, but I am sure that during the proceedings that lie ahead we shall see much more of each other.
<P>
Before replying to the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) on amendment No. 38, I welcome the rightful and belated concern of members of the official Opposition for employment rights. It is a pity that they did not take more account of such matters during their 18 years in Government.
<P>
It is obviously right that staff employed by the RDAs should be entitled to be members of a trade union. As an active trade unionist of many years' standing, I suggest that everyone in the workplace should join a trade union and become active in its deliberations. I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows that the law already provides protection for those who wish to join a trade union and participate in its activities against any discriminatory action by employers. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sets out several specific rights: in particular, a right not to be dismissed or otherwise discriminated against on the grounds of trade union membership, a right not to be refused employment on the grounds of union membership, and a right not to be excluded from a trade union. I assure the Committee that RDAs will be covered by those provisions. It is unnecessary to put them in the Bill because they are general and apply in workplaces everywhere. We agree with the principle that trade union membership should be actively encouraged, but is is not necessary to put that in the Bill.
<P>
I reinforce what my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning said during our previous debate. Negotiating with trade unions and representing staff will be one of the main ways in which we make the transition from existing bodies to the new RDAs. Hopefully that will be done on an individual basis and with as much agreement as we can obtain.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's statement in amendment No. 38 that trade union membership is a good thing and should be encouraged. We agreed with that but see no need to repeat in the Bill a general right that already applies throughout the economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I welcome the Under-Secretary's assurance. We are aware of the general provision to ensure that people may join trade unions, but she will be aware that that is denied in some areas. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that it is stated explicitly that employees may join a trade union. Following our earlier debate, it is clear that negotiations with trade unions to harmonise certain conditions of service will be essential.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 25, line 19, after "7.", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(A1) A member of a regional development agency shall disclose his interests on his appointment and there shall be a public register of these interests.
<P>
(B1) A member of a regional development agency shall disclose new interests which arise during his membership of the agency and these interests shall be added to the public register.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No 45, in page 25, line 43, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) Where a disability is removed in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) the Secretary of State shall write to the Agency to explain his reasons.".<P>

<P>
No. 41 in page 26, line 2, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(8) The Secretary of State may be order determine classes of interest which shall be disclosed under this paragraph.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> There can be little doubt that RDAs will discuss a broad range of subjects during their deliberations, business and other subjects, and it is essential, particularly as they cover such large geographical areas, that individual board members' interests are clearly known. On bodies with smaller geographical areas, such as councils, individuals' interests are easily identified, and even then are sometimes contained in registers. However, as the RDAs will be so large and will have such serious issues to discuss, interests of every possible nature must be declared. I am sure that they will be, if the correct selection of chairmen and board members is made, but it needs to be seem to be done and, especially in this day and age, a public register of those interests should be open to all. I am thinking particularly of business people who may come to the RDA with their own business plan, perhaps in regard to major investments by their business. They will want to be able to discuss the plans confidentially with the RDA and be aware of any interests that may preclude members from entering into the discussions.
<P>
It is important to make the definition of "interest" clear. Amendment No. 41 would allow the Secretary of State to define the interests. It could be argued that it might be difficult to check that members were declaring their interests. Members might argue that they did not know what counted as interests without guidance from the Secretary of State.
<P>
There are sensible amendments that are in line with the accountability and openness that the new RDAs should have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> This group of amendments is concerned with disclosures of interests, an important subject in relation to the Bill, first becasue of the Government's stated wish to include people from a wide variety of backgrounds on RDA boards, a wish that we share. It is likely that some board members will have declarable interests that would be covered by amendment No. 39. The amendments are also important because of the decisions that RDAs may take on matters with potentially considerable commercial significance. Therefore, the need for as much openness and clarity about RDA members' interests is clear, and I have a great deal of sympathy with the thinking behind amendment No. 39. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response, particularly if he chooses to reject the amendment.
<P>
I want to touch briefly on amendment No. 45 which stands in my name and that of my honourable Friend the Member for Cheadle. Paragraph 7(5) allows the Secretary of State to set aside the requirement for RDA members to withdraw from discussions or from votes on matters where they have a declarable interest. That is quite a sweeping power and clearly the potential for abuse is great. Given the record of some local councils in the last few years I am not surprised that concern might be expressed outside the House if, regardless of the fact that a particular board member had a commercial interest, the Secretary of State could decide not to require him to stand aside from the discussions.
<P>
If my amendment were accepted, the exercise of that power would at least be subject to some restraint. If the Secretary of State knew that his reasons for allowing someone with a declarable interest to take part in the decisions would be published it might concentrate his mind. It would certainly reduce the risk of any abuse of this power to an acceptable level. I hope that the[Mr. Yeo]
Minister will consider both amendments sympathetically. It is difficult to see how they do anything other than strengthen the Bill and build into it some safeguards of integrity in the way that RDAs are operated.
<P>
<B>Mr Caborn:</B> The amendments deserve a serious response which I hope I will give them. The provisions governing members'interests set out in the schedule follow similar provisions in other Acts setting up non-departmental public bodies or NDPBs, for example, most recently, the Environment Act 1995 which set up the Environment Agency. The approach has not been to spell out in the legislation a great deal of subordinate detail. As regards member's interests we have spelt out how RDA board members should deal with their interests in relation to the formal proceedings of the RDA that is at meetings at which decisions are taken.
<P>
We would not propose to spell out any more in the Bill. However, we support the purpose of amendment No. 39: that each RDA should establish a public register of interests, that board members should disclose interests to be recorded in that register and that it should be kept up to date. We will do that in guidance given to RDAs under the powers contained in clause 31.
<P>
We envisage that each RDA will be required to adopt a code of practice, which will have to be published and which will be based on the guidance of codes of practice for board members of public bodies published by the Cabinet Office in January 1997. We all know why that guidance was issued then. We do not need to rehearse that. After those few unfortunate experiences we now have cross-party support for the way that people in public positions should conduct themselves. There is agreement about that code of practice.
<P>
Appointment letters for board members will also draw attention to the code as well as members' responsibilities in registering their private interests. The code, which together with further guidance from my Department will be the basis for the RDA's own codes of practice, emphasises the need for board members to avoid, and be seen to avoid, conflicts of interests. It sets how that should be avoided, including the maintenance of a register of interests.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 would enable the Secretary of State by order to determine classes of interest to be disclosed. That provision is not necessary, in view of the powers available in clause 31. However, we accept that the RDAs will require guidance on the nature and extent of the interests that should be declared. That will be provided as it has been to other non-departmental public bodies sponsored by my Department.
<P>
In conclusion, we support the sentiments behind the two amendments. I assure Opposition Members that the RDAs will be required to maintain a public register of interests and will be subject to guidance on what should be disclosed. However, those details do not need to be included in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 45 would require the Secretary of State to write to the agency explaining his reasons if he were to lift a restriction set out in the members' interests paragraphs of schedule 2. I assure hon. Members that in all but the most extraordinary circumstances the Secretary of State would inform the agency of his reasons for removing a disability. However, we should not want to fetter the Secretary of State's discretion in this by giving him a duty to disclose the reasons. There might be a perfectly legitimate reason for not wanting to do that. I therefore urge hon. Members not to press the amendments.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. However, a couple of points need to be pursued further. He referred to the Environment Act 1995, which would have been drafted in the era before the establishment of the Nolan committee. I am not sure that it is therefore a particularly useful in this context to argue that the previous inclusion of an item justifies its inclusion in the present Bill. Attitudes towards matters such as disclosure of interests and the possibility of conflicts of interest have, as the Minister implied, evolved. Perhaps they continue to evolve, as we may learn from the Paymaster General in due course.
<P>
The Minister said, with reference to amendment No. 45, that only in the most extraordinary circumstances would he expect the Secretary of State not to write to the RDA to explain why he had removed a disability I think that that is the phrase used in paragraph 7(5) of schedule 2. It would be helpful to the Committee if we could envisage those circumstances. Clearly the Minister has envisaged them; otherwise he would not have referred to them in his response. Will he clarify what extraordinary circumstances would justify the Secretary of State in not explaining his reason for permitting someone with an interest to debate and vote on the relevant matters alongside people with no such interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I cannot bring to mind any specific circumstances, but I think that the hon. Gentleman, who has been in the House for many years, would agree that some of the extraordinary events in the House and some hon. Members's conduct suggest a need for measures such as we are considering, to protect the public. We are following that course in the best interests of open government, and to ensure such protection. I repeat that the power that he is concerned about would be used only in extraordinary circumstances. I am sure that he would agree that in 1983, when he and I entered the House, we should never have believed some of what has since happened involving people in public positions. Such matters had to be dealt with. We will pursue the general consensus that has derived from the clear 1997 Cabinet Office code. We will ensure that the Bill includes safety valves in case they are needed. We shall act responsibily on that basis.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I fully acknowledge the force of what the Minister says. It is exactly because my amendment would move matters further in a direction that accords with his views that I find it surprising that he should use that argument to reject it. It is precisely because it is difficult to foresee these things that it would be helpful for the Bill to make the necessary provision. That is why I am disturbed by a provision that in today's climate it might have been different five or even three years ago gives complete discretion to one individual. The Bill allows the Secretary of State to appoint people to a board that may make decisions far more commercially sensitive than anything that a Member of Parliament is likely ever to be involved with. The Secretary of State can, without explanation and even without informing anyone apart from the person concerned, say, "Never mind that you have a big commercial interest at stake while others who do not have that interest may be able to approach the subject dispassionately. I, as Secretary of State, consider that you, who are probably my friend in some sense, can of course go ahead and do something that would not be acceptable under normal procedures for local councils, other NDBPs or Ministers."
<P>
I am not saying that the Secretary of State's discretion should be fettered. However, when the Secretary of State choose to use his discretion presumably for a very good reason he should tell the RDA what the reasons are. That is not an excessively onerous requirement. I do not even suggest that the Secretary of State's advice would have to be made public, although that would be desirable. I want the advice to be available to the RDA, so that it knows where a member of the board comes from when that member has an interest in a matter and would normally have to stand aside. The Secretary of State will be saying that it is okay for him not to do so and should say why.
<P>
I am reinforcing what the Minister has said about openness, correctness, propriety and integrity. In what circumstances could a Minister exercise discretion without telling anyone why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We must be clear on what the amendment seeks to do. The amendment is not needed. We envisage that the Secretary of State would write to the board member involved, but he would probably write a guidance note, too. These things are not as black and white as the hon. Member for South Suffolk thinks. The Secretary of State would write to the board member, but would not make that public. That is the right way to proceed. The amendment is not necessary, for the reasons that I gave on amendments Nos. 39 and 41.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> If the Secretary of State is going to write only to the board member, it is right to seek to amend the schedule. The other board members need to know. Ideally, the public should know. The public are to be denied information. I have heard what the Minister has said about openness and accountability. I would like to believe it, but his reluctance to accept the amendment makes me question his determination to pursue those goals.
<P>
The Minister has exacerbated my anxiety by saying that the Secretary of State need write only to the member. The RDA board needs to know why a member with a declarable interest is being allowed to do what would not be allowed if he were a councillor, a Minister or a member of another board. I do not want to amend the Bill so that the Secretary of State cannot exercise discretion, but when he exercises an extraordinary power he should explain why. The Minister cannot explain the circumstances in which such discretion should be kept secret. I am, to say the least, unconvinced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> The three amendments hang together well. As the hon. Member for South Suffolk has said, they provide a certainty and openness that is perhaps more necessary today than it was in the past.
<P>
Perhaps such provisions should appear in all Bills dealing with this type of public body. I accept that the Minister will ensure that codes of conduct and guidelines are issued to set up a public register on disclosure of interests and so on. However, it is necessary to make the provisions more explicit. They should not just imply what is to happen.
<P>
The amendment is so important, bearing in mind everything related to Nolan, that I shall press it to a vote. We must not merely expect that justice will be done and that interests will be declared; we should have an explicit provion to that effect in the Bill. The interests that should be declared and how they are to be declared should be made clear. If the Minister wishes to provide a disability, the reasons for that must be made known. Otherwise, the suspicion will be that decisions were taken for the wrong reasons, by the wrong people and at the wrong time.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> These amendments follow on from the previous group. Amendment No. 54 would increase the public's access to board and sub-committee minutes, although it recognises that matters of a sensitive commercial nature should be excluded, as they are elsewhere in the Bill. The board would presumably decide what it could disclose and what was of a sensitive nature. I hope that the amendment will be accepted I cannot see any objections to it. 
<P>
Amendment No. 71 relates to clause 7, which will require RDAs to formulate strategies, to keep them under review and to refer to them when exercising their functions. Businesses, individuals and organisations, which have to develop their own structure plans, need to know about an RDA's strategy in an area of business or in a geographical area, and they must ensure that their plans are in line with that strategy.
<P>
The amendment would require public consultation when decisions about strategies are made. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the strategy, any reviews, and results of all assessments"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be publicly available. An RDA's organisation and the strategies that it adopts should be made public. Organisations, businesses, and individuals might spend considerable sums of money only to find that their goals run counter to an RDA's declared intentions. It is only right to make an RDA's strategy known before any such expenditure is undertaken. That will help commercial enterprises and businesses either those in a region or those considering investing in it to promote that RDA's objectives. If they did not know of the relevant strategy, they might be working counter to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I support amendment No. 51, which relates to schedule 3. Schedule 3 involves the transfer of ministerial powers, which we shall discuss in more detail later. I am once again concerned about the Secretary of State's almost unfettered ability to transfer his powers, which are subject to parliamentary scrutiny, to unelected bodies, whose accountability has rightly been described as inadequate. The exercise of those powers gives rise to concern.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 would require information requested by the Minister from RDAs in connection with the transfer of property to be made public. We have heard much about the Government's enthusiasm for greater openness. In the light of that enthusiasm, it is difficult to see what possible objection there could be to the publication of that information. I am sure that the Minister would not wish to defend an element of secrecy. The amendment would not threaten the exercise of powers, although it might be desirable if it did. The amendment would give the Minister a chance to demonstrate whether the claims of open Government made in the Committee and elsewhere are worth anything.
<P>
I should like to draw a distinction between my amendment, which requires the publication of information that has been requested by the Minister, and amendment No. 54, tabled by the honourable Member for South-East Cornwall, which requests the publication of the minutes of proceedings of RDA boards. That is a separate issue, and I am sure that the Minister will deal with it separately.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 raises a third issue. I am concerned that it would make the operations of the RDA more difficult. I doubt whether that is its intention, but it could be its effect. I am not certain how well that amendment would work unlike amendment No. 51 which would be in the interests of RDAs and those who want to scrutinise the relationship between RDAs and central Government.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> There is no disagreement between us about the principle of more open and transparent government, and the determination of the Government to put that principle into practice in a meaningful way. There are, however, more ways of proving the worth of our commitment than simply accepting amendments.
<P>
The honourable Member for South-East Cornwall persists in trying to put the entire rulebook governing how RDAs and their executives should behave into primary legislation. That is not the function of primary legislation. Many of those details will be covered in guidance, which has more flexibility and can be changed. As the honourable Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) said, times have changed when it comes to declarations of interest. We will be able to update guidance without the need for primary legislation. Guidance creates a more flexible way in which to respond to changes in society. I ask the honourable Member for South-East Cornwall to bear that in mind when he tables amendments not everything has to be included in the Bill.
<P>
The amendments deal with the way RDAs make information available to the public. The honourable Member for South-East Cornwall thinks that the most sensible way of covering that is to include it in every Bill. The proposals in our White Paper, "Your Right to Know", will provide an overarching statute that will establish the principles and the direct rights to know, policed by an independent commission and checked by the courts, to create the most powerful tool for establishing open government that the country has ever seen.
<P>
In order to put that new Bill on the statute book, deliberate and smaller attempts to ensure public access to information, such as the hon. Gentlemen is trying on, must be removed from the statute book, so that they can be incorporated in the Overarching Bill. At the last count, about 200 statutes were being examined in order to make people's right to know accessible and simple so that everyone can understand and be familiar with their rights. We do not want to keep adding such amendments to each particular Bill when we are in the process of preparing an overarching Freedom of Information Bill. I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear that in mind as he contemplates further amendments.
<P>
Moreover, it is not useful to include in primary legislation comprehensive rule books and procedural niceties for whatever bodies are under discussion in this case, RDAs. There are more flexible and useful ways to do that.
<P>
In addition, the Bill is meant to bring about a decentralisation of power from national government to the regions. In amendment after amendment, the hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that the national Government should decentralise, but should put minutely in the Bill all kinds of guidance and requirements under which the new bodies will have to operate. We believe that, within the framework that we have set out in the Bill, which will be reinforced by guidance from Ministers, RDAs should be left to develop their own ways of working. The principles of propriety, openness and transparency will apply.
<P>
I emphasise that we remain committed to ending secrecy and to increasing openness. We have made proposals in our White Paper, "Your Right to Know", for legislation that will give everyone a legal right to see information held by national Government and regional and local government, and by some other organisations working on behalf of the Government.
<P>
However, we recognise as I am sure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall will when he gives the matter some thought that some information should not be made publicly available if to do so would harm personal privacy or national security or reveal internal discussion of Government policy, or if it concerns law enforcement. Our proposed Freedom of Information Bill will meet the spirit of the amendment, while allowing sensible discretion and the protection of individual privacy.
<P>
In the interim period, before the Bill reaches the statute book and as RDAs move forward, we have what we were left by the previous Government what I call the Tory settlement on freedom of information, which is a start. Under schedule 7, RDAs will come under the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and will therefore be covered by the code of practice on access to Government information, which applies to all bodies so designated. The code preserves confidentiality only when disclosure would not be in the public interest, would breach personal privacy or would involve the confidences of a third party.
<P>
Some of the information with which we are dealing, which RDAs will be required to provide to Ministers, may be information that relates to staff. It would be inappropriate to make public such personal information. Although RDAs may give the Minister information that does not relate to staff for example, information about assets amendment No. 51 does not make any distinction, and would require all information to be made public, regardless of what it consisted of. That is too wide ranging.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, who tabled amendment No. 71, that regional strategies will be made widely available. Indeed, I do not see the point of having a regional strategy if it is kept secret. I am not sure how it would be developed, or how support stakeholders' for it would be secured, if it were kept secret. I suspect that amendment No. 71 deals with an impossibility: all regional stakeholders would have to be signed up to the strategy, and would probably have helped to develop it. They would have to be committed to achieving the objectives set out in it. Similarly, regional development agencies may choose to publish information about any reviews or assessments of the strategies, but we do not believe that specific provision is necessary in the Bill to require RDAs to make strategies and information relating to them publicly available. However, we would expect them to do so and will give guidance to that effect.
<P>
In the unlikely event that an RDA fails to act reasonably in making available, for example, the minutes of its meetings or information relating to the formulation or review of its strategy, the Secretary of State will be able to rely on his general powers under clause 31 to issue guidance and directions to the RDAs to publish such information.
<P>
In view of the existing safeguards, the Government's intentions on freedom of information and the forthcoming legislation, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> May I press the Under-Secretary a little further on the sort of information that Ministers may require RDAs to provide under paragraph 12 of schedule 3? I was slightly confused about which amendment the Under-Secretary was referring to, but I think she was referring to my concerns about information relating to staff. I was not suggesting that information on staff should be conveyed in a way that might cause difficulty. I want to concentrate on her objection to making information public.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I thould that I had made it clear that I object not to as much information as possible being made public but to the method by which both Opposition parties are trying to make that a requirement in the Bill when we are moving towards an overarching right to freedom of information throughout all Government Departments, organisations that support and work for the Government and public sector[Angela Eagle]
organisations. Freedom of information legislation will introduced shortly and we do not believe that detailed provisions requiring disclosure should be included in each and every Bill that comes before the House. If the hon. Member for South Suffolk reads the White Paper, "Your Right to Know", which is currently being consulted on, he will see that it suggests considerable powers of access to all sorts of information which, as he rightly says, should be available.
<P>
The amendment refers to "all ... information" and that could include information on staff and their personal privacy. Such information will be excluded from the freedom of information legislation and is traditionally excluded that the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration a system that was set up by the previous Government and which preserves confidentiality only when disclosure would not be in the public interest, would breach personal privacy or would breach the confidence of a third party. Those are the sorts of information we would expect the RDAs not to disclose. In all other areas in which freedom of information is relevant, we would expect the RDAs to be open and transparent.
<P>
If an RDA behaves unreasonably, general powers exist under clause 31 for the Secretary of State to issue guidance and force it to make such information available. Given the expressed desires of Ministers in the Committee, the commitment of the Government as set out in our manifesto to legislate on freedom of information, and the move towards more open government, we expect that the RDAs will do as a matater of course most of what is requested in the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her further explanation. I shall be interested to see how the proposed legislation on freedom of information will work in respect of RDAs. In the light of what she has said, I will not press amendment No. 51.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I appreciate the Under-Secretary's advice, but I have to say that, whatever we are considering at present, we are setting up another quango. I know that there are references in Bill to regional chambers and other future developments, but at the end of the day we are still setting up a quango. Perhaps some of our amendments, which may be somewhat detailed, have been tabled in the light of fairly recent experience and in the light of a freedom of information Bill that is yet to come. Although I am grateful that such a Bill is to arrive shortly, it is not on the statute book yet, and we must consider the Bill in the light of the current situation.
<P>
I appreciate that the Under-Secretary requires as much flexibility as possible, but the kind of flexibility that we are discussing seems to be to allow for reverting to keeping things secret, for preventing public disclosure, or for reducing the amount of openness. Unless, that is, the flexibility is required to allow for proceeding in a way other than that proposed by the amendment.
<P>
I appreciate that we are discussing decentralisation, and part of the decentralisation process is to enable the regions to participate fully. The regions need as much information as possible to participate in that decentralisation. There is, of course, lots of sensitive information. Such information passes through unitary authories and councils every day of the week and the Committee will discuss all sorts of matters relating to staff when they consider part II of the Bill; that is taken as read. Nevertheless, information needs to be clearly available for anyone who has discussions with an RDA; they should have equal access to any information or strategies, especially if those strategies change. Problems are sometimes caused by people having an understanding of a strategy or an objective that is a year or two out of date. That causes such people to proceed with the wrong premise.
<P>
I nevertheless accept the Under-Secretary's comments. Perhaps we are being over-sensitive in seeking to ensure that any new quango that is what we are setting up fulfils certain new criteria. In the spirit of the Under-Secretary's remarks, and especially in the light of the imminence of an overarching freedom of information Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> It might be helpful if I explained that when the Committee is discussing a group of amandments, only the first amendment of that group is formally before the Committee. Therefore it is not necessary for Members with later amendments to "move" or "withdraw" them. If a separate vote on a grouped amendment is desired, this should be requested when the group is under discussion. Separagte divisions are, of course, at the discretion of the Chairman.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Second schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> This is a substantial schedule, which covers more than three pages of the text of the Bill. It contains many aspects that we have not debated under amendments. I would therefore like to make one general point in respect of the whole schedule. It is a point that is similar to the concern that I expressed when we debated whether clause 2 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Just like clause 2, schedule 2 greatly extends the power of the Secretary of State. There was a brief discussion in the last debate about the alleged decentralising nature of the Bill but it actually gives more power to the centre in Whitehall. I say Whitehall advisedly because the detailed powers which the schedule bestows on the Minister could not possibly be exercised individually by the Secretary of State himself or herself. They would be more than a full-time job, even if the Secretary of State had nothing else to do. 
<P>
The schedule gives the Secretary of State completely unfettered discretion over the pay of RDA board members. That is in itself an enormous power. It gives him a similar unfettered discretion over the pensions which may be paid to board members. Indeed, Labour Members who perhaps fear for their majorities in three years' time may one day be the interested recipients of such pensions if they are lucky enough, having left the House, to be appointed to an RDA board.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> You'll abolish them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> That is quite possible. I was coming to the payoffs. The schedule also gives the Secretary of State unfettered discretion over the size of pay-offs to be given to those RDA board members who may lose their jobs and fall out of favour. We have no restrictions on the amounts that will be paid or the circumstances of the payment. Those decisions remain entirely within the ambit of the Secretary of State.
<P>
But it does not end there. The Secretary of State appoints the first chief executives of the regional development agencies. He also retains a veto over appointments that are subsequently made to the post of chief executive of the RDAs. That is a particularly intriguing power because the Secretary of State appoints all the board members, so to retain a power which requires those board members to consult him about their choice of chief executive seems from the outset to imply a certain lack of confidence in their judgment and a certain lack of trust in their wisdom.
<P>
It goes much further than that. Under the schedule the Secretary of State becomes the ultimate authority on the question of members' interests. He determines whether those interests prevent them from taking part in the decisions of an RDA even on matters where their interest may be directly affected. It could be said that the schedule establishes the Secretary of State as a sort of one-man, all-purpose Nolan committee for regional development agencies. Potentially that is quite an arduous job. The Secretary of State will therefore exercise enormous control over all these aspects of RDAs.
<P>
As with clause 2, the schedule does not sit easily with the claims that the Bill is about giving power to the regions. It is not. It is about setting up bureaucratic, potentially expensive quangos. Furthermore, and putting it more strongly, there still appears to be some uncertainty about the precise terms and conditions on which members of the board will be appointed and, perhaps more importantly in the long term, on which the staff of the RDAs are to be employed. 
<P>
All those matters will be resolved at the centre. They will be received in theory by the Secretary of State but in practice by his officials. This measure has been sold to the public as one that transfers power to the regions but it is difficult to see how that claim can possibly be substantiated in the light of the schedule. I therefore hope that before the Committee agrees to allow the schedule to stand part of the Bill the Minister will explain how she reconciles the claims that have been made with the aggregation of power to the centre.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Maria Eagle.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That is my sister, Mr. Benton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I think that she is in Belfast on a visit with the National Audit Office. She is an extraordinary woman, but I do not think she could be in two places at once.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk clearly has a certain view about the effect of the Bill, but it is one that I barely recognise from the facts in the Bill, and the Government's stated aim of decentralising power to the RDAs and their activities in decentralising power to the Welsh and Scottish nations. The hon. Gentleman will have to suspend his disbelief, but I do not recognise his description of the Bill in this debate.
<P>
We must ensure that in the first period of evolution we keep a handle on certain matters. RDAs will have broadly similar powers to the Welsh and Scottish development agencies, which were set up in 1975 and have been pretty successful. They will also have extra matters to take account of, such as sustainable development, one of the five main aims and activities of RDAs in the English regions. But will they receive most of their funds from the Government in the initial period prior to any developments that arise from future related legislation.
<P>
<H5>6 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important that the RDAs remain properly accountable to Ministers for the public money that they spend. If the provisions were not set out in the Bill, the hon. Member for South Suffolk, as a fellow ex-member of the Public Account Committee, would be the first to complain about the lack of financial accountability in the Bill. He is not doing so, because the accountability is in the Bill. Opposition Members would rightly complain if we had not kept this overarching power or RDAs to be accountable to Ministers and open in the way in which they carry out their duties.
<P>
These are standard controls for all NDPBs, with which the previous Administration are familiar, as they helped to create then and used them regularly during their 18 years in office. The schedule takes account of the transitional arrangements involved in moving from one institution to another, which Opposition Members are familar with, because they oversaw many such transitions.
<P>
Therefore, there is nothing unusual about the scope of Government guidance in the Bill. I do not recognise the hon. Member for South Suffolks' obsession with the Secretary of State having unfettered discretion as there is financial accountability to the House of Commons, all Ministers are accoutable to the House for the decisions that they take, against a background of much more open government than we have had in the past. The Secretary of State has the powers to ensure that public money is spent properly and he is accountable to the House, but we want to allow the RDAs as far as possible to make their own way in the regions and, within the structures that we have set out, to allow the ordinary NDPB's structures to do the job for which we are creating them.
<P>
The Secretary of State will have considerable flexibility in deciding how to exercise control. We have made it clear that we want to give the RDAs as much freedom as possible consistent with giving the regions greater responisibility. We want to ensure that they regularly consult the regional chambers and do a great deal of work with all the stakeholders in the region to establish their legitimacy. We will check in their annual reports, as we do with all NDPBs, that they are doing that job. They will create their own regional strategies that is decentralisation. They will have Whitehall's role in the single regeneration budget challenge fund, which is being transferred to them that is decentralisation. They will have English[Angela Eagle]
Partnerships' approach to regional matters, which is being transferred to them that is decentralisation. The Government have said that they will take advice from RDAs on the important programmes on skills and training that is decentralisation.
<P>
I commend the schedule to the Committee. I do not recognise the caricature of it portrayed by the hon. Member for South Suffolk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I was interested in the Minister's response, but I do not accept that I caricatured the schedule. I simply drew attention to those parts of it that increase the powers exercised by the Secretary of State. It is a matter of fact that he will exercise powers that he does not currently have. To that extent, the Bill will take power to the centre.
<P>
The Minister's claim that the schedule followed legislation introduced in the past 18 years by the previous Government was particularly intriguing. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon may have a better memory than me but, when some of that legislation was introduced, I do not recollect the then Opposition spokesmen saying, "Gosh! This legislation is a wonderful decentralising measure." That was not the principal theme of their responses.
<P>
I am glad that there has been a belated conversion and recognition of the merits of much of what the previous Government did. It is better late than never. None the less, it is a remarkable U-turn even by parliamentary standards for the Minister to say that the Bill is a good, decentralising measure because it follows the example of legislation enacted previously. The Conservative Government were constantly accused of doing what this Bill is designed to achieve to enhance the role of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Minister did not respond to my fear that the powers that the schedule bestows on the Secretary of State are so great and so detailed that it would be impossible for anyone to take more than the most fleeting interest in the exercise of any of them. The Bill will create bureaucratic and unaccountable quangos and the only line of accountability goes through the Secretary of State. As no other route is envisaged, it means I case no aspersions on those involved that the powers will be exercised by civil servants. It is not merely a centralising Bill that will create an unaccountable body, but one that will give such wide and detailed powers to the Secretary of State after all, he is elected and accountable to the House that bureaucrats will have to exercise them. That is deplorable and against the tenor of the Government's justifications for the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 2, line 17, after "4", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) A regional development agency shall have the primary objective to further the achievement of sustainable development."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall take the following amendments: No. 60, in page 2, line 17, after "following", insert "additional".
<P>
No. 20, in page 2, line 26, leave out from "Kingdom" to end of line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Amendment No. 55 would make sustainable development, however that may be defined, the main purpose of an RDA. We have spoken much about development and sustainability, and the Government"s proposals for RDAs offer an important opportunity to put into practice their commitment to sustainable development. Indeed, the Bill may set a precedent for future legislation in many ways. Consequently, it is vital to make the provision as strong as possible.
<P>
Achieving sustainable development is an overriding Government commitment. The Deputy Prime Minister said that RDAs will operate:
"In a context that protects the environment and promotes sustainable development" [Official Report, 3 December 1997; Vol. 302, c.358.]<P>

<P>
The amendments are intended to strengthen the Bill to ensure that that commitment is fulfilled. Giving the RDAs a separate purpose of contributing to sustainable development will not necessarily ensure that that is their over-arching objective, influencing the way in which they carry out their functions, whether of economic development, regeneration or fostering competitiveness or employment. There is a danger that the sustainable development purpose will be seen more as a bolt-on extra than as a new approach to development.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman seen the White Paper "Building Partnerships for Prosperity", which sets out at page 17 five specific objectives of the RDA, which are of equal importance? It lists:
"1. Economic Development and Social and Physical Regeneration
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Business Support, Investment and Competitiveness
<P>
3. Enhancing Skills
<P>
4. Promoting Employment
<P>
5. Sustainable Development".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that context, how on earth can the hon. Gentleman describe sustainable development as a bolt on extra?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I was just coming to that point. I was about to say that the Minister may argue that no weighting or order is given to the five functions of the RDAs which she has just listed and that sustainable development would therefore be just as important as the RDAs' other functions. I should be happy to accept that, but it would be interesting and informative to know how the Minister would ensure that the RDAs would fulfil their sustainable development duty, particularly in relation to their other purposes. Will she assure the Committee that the RDAs will operate within an over-arching concept of sustainable development which would be a new approach to development generally instead of treating it as a bolt-on extra? The approach needs to be like the writing going through a stick of rock it should be all the way through.
<P>
An assurance needs to be given that sustainable development will not be put to one side at the moment of difficulty. I have already alluded on other occasions in Committee to the reality of difficult decisions, particularly in initial periods of an enterprise. It is to be hoped that as sustainable development takes hold, those decisions will present less of a problem, but initially it may be very difficult to make decisions to bring about progress in economic development in certain sensitive areas.
<P>
The Minister will know that I represent a constituency in Cornwall with real economic problems but also of real beauty. It is often difficult to arrive at sustainable development in its truest sense. It is difficult, while trying to bring about new economic development to produce jobs, to ensure the protection of the environment and make certain that the place in question remains one that people can visit.
<P>
The amendments would strengthen the Government's existing commitment to sustainable development in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I do not wish to cast a pall of scepticism over the proceedings, but when I hear the phrase "sustainable development" I occasionally feel a temptation to reach for my red felt pen. I want to know what that marvellous mantra means. It is easy to make it one of the cardinal virtues. Everything that we do will have sustainable development attached to it. My party is as much to blame as anyone. We have produced this out of a hat and think that if we recite abracadabra we will be all right. The question is: what does it all add up to at the end of the day?
<P>
I know that the Minister will point out the list of objectives on page 17 of the White Paper. I have read it carefully. It is titled:
"The Objectives of the RDAs".<P>

<P>
The first is:
"Economic Development and Social and Physical Regeneration".
<P>
Is that designed to produce sustainable development? Is not the regeneration of city centres a form of development that we wish to sustain?
<P>
The second objective is:
"Business Support, Investment and Competiveness".<P>

<P>
Is not that part of achieving sustainable development? The "third is "Enhancing Skills". We hope that that will enable people to get better jobs and move on as technologies change. The fourth is "Promoting Employment", which meet the same point. The final objective is "Sustainable Development", an abstract that has been given some physical characteristics in its own right. Either sustainable development is printed all through the rock, or it is merely an expression without a great deal of content.
<P>
We all differ in what we mean by sustainable development. The honourable Member for South-East Cornwall was kind enough to allude previously to some of the work that I did when I was responsible for the south-west. In Cornwall, sustainable development would be immensley helped by building more roads. Many roads there just come to an end. Dual carriageways end in a single carriageway or a railway bridge and one thinks that one has come to the end of the world. One spends most of one's time sitting in a traffic jam. Building more roads would help Cornwall, as, while we are on the subject, building more bypasses would help my constituency. When we get the famous integrated transport policy, which appears to consist largely of putting up petrol prices, I hope that the Government will bear those points in mind.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I approach this matter with a scepticism born of being a journalist who comes from Yorkshire. What does it all add up to? The Deputy Prime Minister could probably give several definitions, although I am not sure how compatible they would be or whether any of them would be understandable.
<P>
We must treat this matter seriously by saying that RDAs should try to reach a sustained level of improvement of the quality of life in the regions. That would mean sustainable development; none of us wants unsustainable development. Any jobs that boost an area such as Cornwall will be welcome; it may be better to have them for a few years than not to have them at all.
<P>
We need to cut through the garbage and the almost religious verbiage that hangs around this idea, and ask what it means. Why is objective five necessary in the White Paper? The objectives can be summed up as trying to achieve sensible forms of development that will last and that will bring people permanent benefits. We should say just that, rather than adding a sustainable development objective as if it were a new chapter from Mount Sinai.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right honourable Friend tempts me down some unplanned routes. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will respond to his demands for a definition of sustainable development, but my right honourable Friend will acknowledge that some forms of employment generation are unsustainable in the long term. That does not necessarily mean to say that those jobs are wrong, but if employment is, for example, dependent on depletion of limited resources in a particular region, it is clearly unsustainable and it could be argued less desirable than employment that is more likely to continue in the longer term. No doubt the Under-Secretary will respond to that point.
<P>
As a Conservative, my view of sustainable development has always been that it is a matter of living off the interest rather than the capital that should be handed on to future generations. Each generation can consume the world's interest, as it were.
<P>
These amendments are among the most important that the Committee has debated so far. All of them, especially amendment No. 20, go right to the heart of the matter. Is the Bill, and are RDAs, about sustainable development above all else? As my right honourable Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, if sustainable development is to have any meaning at all, it has to transcend other objectives. Is the inclusion of sustainable development in the five aims listed in the White Paper merely a few fine words that the Minister thought would be helpful? Narrow economic definitions of growth, and hence development, which have been used extensively in the past have included unsustainable development.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of our difficulties in attempting to move towards a more sustainable economy and way of living is the tendency of social sciences, such as economics, not to take proper account of wider issues when they express success-failure, profit-loss? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I have some sympathy with that view. One of the deficiencies of economics has been that its measurements have been easily quantifiable. I recognise that trying to find measurements to take account of concepts such as sustainability is not easy, but such measurements are important. The danger has been that we have examined economic progress in too narrow a way. Efforts are increasingly made, both in the political and the academic worlds, to find ways in which we can take account of sustainability. I wish the Government every success in continuing the work started by the Department.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 55 and 20 have similar objectives. They are I am sure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall will agree a genuine attempt not to hamper the work of RDAs or to wreck the concept of RDAs, even for those of use who do not think that it is helpful to cover the whole of England with them. The amendments are an attempt to improve RDAs, to strengthen their epiphysis so that sustainable development is enshrined, without qualification, as one of the key aims, if not the key aim, of the Bill. 
<P>
Reading the White Paper, one might have assumed that the Bill would enshrine sustainable development in the way suggested by the amendments. In addition to the five aims listed on page 17 of the White Paper are, on page 39 at the start of chapter 8, two important sentences:
"RDAs will place the principle of sustainable development at the heart of their programmes. To ensure this, the Government will give them a specific statutory objective of furthering the achievement of sustainable development".<P>

<P>
I think hon. Members would agree that that could hardly be plainer. The Bill, which was published only a few days after the White Paper, does not reflect that statement.
<P>
I wonder what went wrong along the way in that short period between the publication of the White Paper, which included a commitment in terms acceptable to Opposition Members, and the publication of the Bill. I must say my right honourable Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon might share this view that perhaps those two sentences in the White Paper rang a few alarm bells elsewhere in Whitehall.
<P>
I may detect the dead hand of the Treasury at work. To do the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions justice, I cannot believe that, left to its own devices, its wording of the Bill would have been so feeble.
<P>
If someone wants to enlighten us, I am sure that the Committee will undertake to keep anything said about the Treasury entirely confidential. We would understand. There are sometimes difficulties in persuading other Departments, especially the all-powerful Treasury, which is by far the most influential Department in Whitehall. Its tentacles reach far and wide. 
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall and I are seeking to improve the Bill and to assist the Ministers, which we have previously done on some but not, I acknowledge, all occasions. The Ministers should explain to their colleagues in Whitehall especially to those in the Treasury how much pressure has been applied on them in relation to this important matter. They should be aware of the arguments that are employed in favour of the amendments, which would strengthen the future workings of RDAs. They should also appreciate the feebleness of the arguments that the Department has suggested, no doubt at the request of the Treasury or perhaps at the request of the Department for Trade and Industry I know which of the two Departments I regard as the greater foe. I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall and I will help the Ministers in their interdepartmental negotiations.
<P>
On this issue, I appeal to Labour Members. There could not be a more honourable group of amendments for those who wish to break their duck and vote against the party line. What a noble cause in which to demonstrate their willingness to press their Government and what an opportunity to show independence and courage. I am sure that at least one Labour Members will seize that opportunity. He or she may have a sufficient sense of history to appreciate that many future political leaders have been, early in their career, at odds with their party leadership.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not done very well, has he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister tempts me to explain further. Shortly before I joined the Government, I opposed the Conservative Government's proposals to introduce the community charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We have five minutes tell us about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I shall, very briefly. There was a significant rebellion, which was led by my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) and which was supported by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir G. Young) who then represented Ealing and Acton and by me. The three of us trooped into the Lobby possibly with the Minister, who was in the House at the time-in opposition to a short-lived and much-regretted policy. The consequences of our action was that within a matter of months perhaps even weeks all three of us found ourselves in office. I merely refer to that to tempt Labour Members to do the same. If they think that their careers will be advanced by slavish adherence to untenable clauses 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is all very interesrting, but the hon. Gentleman must restrict his remarks to the amendment and leave for another occasion the benefit of his advice to Labour Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Benton, for your guidance. I had been momentarily encouraged by the fact that for the first time in the Committee's four sittings some Labour Back Benchers seemed to be showing some interest in our proceedings. Never mind; they can resume whatever work they were doing.
<P>
Last week, the Minister spoke more than once of the value that he attached to consultation. I must return to that increasingly familiar theme to support my amendment. This morning he seemed slightly wary about being reminded of responses to the Second Reading he was less reluctant to acknowledge the virtues of consultation. He referred to three organisations that I have previously mentioned the National Farmers Union, the Consortium for Rural TECs and the Council for the Protection of Rural England. It is important to remind him and the Committee that on Tuesday last week he made particular play of the attention that he paid to the views of English Nature. In doing so, I think he was responding to my earlier comments that day when I quoted the views of English Nature which had stated in response to the consultation paper:
"we were disappointed to see the promotion as sustainable development figure so slightly in the consultation paper. If sustainable development is at the heart of all areas of Government thinking, then sustainability principles must underpin the work of any Government body, particularly one responsible for promoting economic development." [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 27 January 1998; c.5.]<P>

<P>
in response the Minister claimed:
"we take seriously the results of our consultations. When serious matters are raised we consider them".<P>

<P>
He continued:
"The hon. Gentleman raised a pertinent point about English Nature. We included the results of our consultation in the Bill." [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 27 January 1998; c.9.]<P>

<P>
Well, some of it perhaps, but not all of it. I suggested in response that the Bill did not go very far in meeting the aims which English Nature had suggested should be enshrined, but the Minister said last week, perhaps reassuringly, that
"It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman" <P>

<P>
meaning me 
"cannot accept that, in the consultation process, we took on board many of the ideas and thoughts of English Nature. If it wants to submit further ideas to develop the concept that we are putting forward, we shall always listen." [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 27 January 1998; c.11.]<P>

<P>
That was a helpful assurance and since English Nature is the statutory adviser on many subjects relevant to the Bill, I am glad that the Minister recognises that and is willing to listen to its advice.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The comments that I have just read out were made by the Minister on 27 January. Only a week earlier, English Nature wrote to one of the Minister's officials on that very subject. Its letter is relevant to our debate. It states:
"I am writing to express our serious concerns about the treatment of sustainable development in the recently published Bill for the establishment of Regional Development Agencies. However, we are concerned that, in its present form, the Bill fails to deliver the Deputy Prime Minister's clearly and repeatedly expressed intentions as regards the environmental responsibilities of the new Agencies."<P>

<P>
That is pretty clear. The letter continues:
"When presenting the White Paper to the House on 3 December 1997, the Deputy Prime Minister assured the House that the RDAs will operate `within a context which protects the environment and promotes sustainable development'. This reflects the Government's commitment to place the environment at the heart of Government policy. However, we were surprised and disappointed that these strong commitments were weakly transcribed in the Bill itself... Sustainable development is fundamentally about an holistic approach which integrates three strands: the social, economic and environmental. The strategic policy formulation and day to day decision making of the RDAs must reflect and be informed by all of these strands. The present wording marginalises what should be central to the business of RDAs and is therefore inadequate. In the light of these apparent inconsistencies we strongly advise that the Bill be amended so as to considerably strengthen the responsibilities of the RDAs in this regard."<P>

<P>
For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Benton, let me make it clear that I have not read out every sentence in that letter.
<P>
I have read what I consider to be the relevant sentences. I am happy to make the full text available to any hon. Member who wishes to see it.
<P>
Members on both sides will agree that that document is important and contains unequivocal advice. A Government as committed as this one to open government and we have had strong assurances from the Under-Secretary that that commitment will soon be honoured in law will be glad that I have brought that letter to the Committee's attention.
<P>
As the letter relates to clause 4, I thought that I should make the Committee aware of it now rather than later. It contains utterly unequivocal advice from the Government's statutory adviser, a source that the Minister has said that he listens to and heeds, and from which, he assured us a week ago, he is willing to take advice.
<P>
I entirely agree with the advice in the letter, as do many organisations. I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily by referring to advice from other bodies from which I have quoted already, but I challenge the Minister to find a single sentence in the responses to his consultation from any organisation quoted in chapter 8 of the White Paper that contradicts the view of English Nature or which supports the idea that sustainable development, included as one of the five main purposes of clause 4, should be qualified in the way that the Bill qualifies it. Nor one organisation that the Minister thought worthy of quotation in chapter 8 would have recommended the qualification that he has included in the Bill.
<P>
That qualification is worded as follows:
"where it is relevant to its area to do so."<P>

<P>
Will the Minister tell us when it would not be relevant to an area to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development? When does sustainable development cease to be relevant and another form of development become necessary? Would it be so in Sheffield? Would it be so in Wallasey? Where would it be so?
<P>
The Government have resisted all previous efforts to build adequate reflection of environmental concerns into the Bill. They must know that clause 4 is crucial. It defines the purposes of the RDAs. If the Committee agrees to clause 4 unamended, many individuals and organisations will be rightly dismayed. That would be a victory whether for the treasury or the Department of Trade and Industry for those whose heads are firmly in the sand and who have not recognised that if we are to discharge our duty as politicians in this generation, now is the time to make an unqualified commitment to sustainable development.
<P>
Three of the other RDA purposes listed in clause 4 are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) to further the economic development and the regeneration of its area,
<P>
(b) to promote business efficiency, investment and competitiveness in its area,
<P>
(c) to promote employment in its area."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those purposes are in the Bill without qualification; no reservation has been placed on them. Nothing says that[Mr. Yeo]
they may not be appropriate to promotion of competitiveness in a particular area or part of an area. Only sustainable development has that qualification attached, a revealing distinction that is wholly unwelcome and unnecessary. It should be removed. I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept my amendment.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have had an interesting debate, despite the sceptical attitude of the hon. Member for South Suffolk to the Government's commitment to sustainable developmewnt, about which I hope to reassure him. I believe that there is widespread agreement among hon. Members that the furtherance of sustainable development is a desirable aim.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked philosophically even religiously, when he mentioned Sinai and various mantras what sustainable development was. He will remember from his time at the Department that work goes on all the time to develop sustainability indicators and ways of measuring sustainability. He will know that that work progresses and is becoming more sophisticated. However, he will also know that it is a complex area to try to measure.
<P>
We all have a reasonable idea of the meaning of sustainable development, but might not be able to define it in great detail. Indeed, its definition may change over time as new technologies and methods are discovered, as new problems facing the world, such as global warming, are identified, and as we try to think about how to deal with problems as a world community as well as a national community, and through the European Union and other international forums in which we are active.
<P>
The right hononourable Gentleman will also know that in 1994, the previous Administration created what they called the "UK sustainable development strategy". I assume that they had some views about what sustainable development was, how to develop it and how to begin to measure it. I assume that he remembers them.
<P>
We shall announce a fresh look at our sustainable development strategy tomorrow and we shall consult to see whether we might change it to reflect not only the new Government's political principles and political differences from the previous Government, but some of the other developments that have taken place since 1994.
<P>
We believe that our vision of sustainable development should be based on four broad objectives. I shall not go into detail, but it should be based, first, on social progress, which recognises the needs of everyone, secondly, on effective protection of the environment, thirdly, on prudent use of natural resources and, fourthly, on the maintenance of high and stable economic growth and employment.
<P>
I suspect that those objectives could be condensed into the phrase used by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, based on economic concepts, namely trying to live on the interest of capital rather than using it up. That is another way to express our vision.
<P>
I suspect that there are as many ways of expressing the principles of sustainable development as there are members of the Committee, indeed probably more. We could have an interesting philosophical or even religious, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon proffered argument about precisely what those meanings are.
<P>
Given our White Paper and the provisions in the Bill, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall will recognise that sustainable development is one of the five primary aims of RDAs, which will all be of equal importance. It is not a bolt-on extra and cannot be caricatured as such.
<P>
Moreover, we wanted to move away from the idea of environmental protection only, which was the phrase most obviously associated with the duties of the Welsh and Scottish Development Agencies. We believe that the idea of sustainable development covers considerably more and takes many more things into account. The phrase is therefore a more accurate representation of the aims that we want all RDAs to put at the centre of their activities.
<P>
We take sustainable development very seriously. We are establishing RDAs in order to meet the economic deficit faced by the English regions and to give them the same opportunities to improve competitiveness as currently exist in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We recognise, however, that economic growth cannot be achieved without regard to the needs of sustainable development. In the medium term, economic growth may not be desirable, even if it is desirable in the short term. Increasingly, post-Kyoto, there are international obligations that we must meet. The Government also have manifesto commitments that they are determined to meet. That is why we have stressed in our White Paper "Building Partnerships for Prosperity" the importance of policies which combine environmental, economic and social objectives; policies that pursue jobs, competitiveness and social progress in a sustainable environment.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill, unlike earlier Bills, puts a sustainable development purpose on an equal footing with the agencies' economic purposes. That is a significant development for which I hope Opposition Members will give us credit. We have specifically chosen to say that the relevant purpose will "contribute to the achievement of sustainable development" rather than relating it to the improvement of the environment or to furthering the improvement of the environment. In the Scottish Enterprise and Welsh Development Agency legislation, the relevant purpose was framed in terms of improving the environment, but we felt that policy thinking had moved on and become more sophisticated in the intervening 25 years, as has our understanding of the issues that need to be considered by the RDAs. It is far more appropriate in the 1990s that an economic develpment agency's objective should be to contribute to sustainable development, which will encompass relevant environment and quality of life issues.
<P>
In a sense we are seeking to integrate into economic theory issues of sustainability which have been so lacking since the development of classical economic theory in the 19th century. I suspect that at least we agree across the Committee on the fundamental point that economists and social scientists should begin to take on board sustainability in the theories that they develop to give us the tools to measure how we are doing.
<P>
The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"contribute to the achievement of sustainable development"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
seems to us to be more appropriate in the Bill than "furthering the achievement of" sustainable development. The RDAs will need to work within the national policy framework they cannot have their own independent sustainable development policies rather than setting their own independent agenda. They will have the freedom to decide their strategy for the region within the national policy framework, and we will give them guidance on this aspect of their work. However, we expect RDAs to work with central Government, who will take the lead in developing wider, international policy thinking, in the same way as we will expect RDA's skills strategies to be consistent with national policy on skills development.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk argued in relation to amendment No. 20 that, by definition, sustainable development has a wider relevance than to regional areas. I think that we would all accept that. The sustainable development purpose requires RDAs to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom and is not restricted to the region in that sense. Inherent in the provision, there is scope for cross-regional co-operation in furthering the interests of sustainable development. Moreover, I am advised that there is no reason why an RDA should not be concerned with matters that have an impact outside the UK. For example, it might wish to concern itself with reducing CO2 emissions. That seems to me to be a matter of relevance to its area which would contribute to sustainable development in the UK, and we would not rule out that activity. There may be unnecessary concern about that.
<P>
Opposition Members appear to be arguing that RDAs should be doing things in the name of sustainable development which have no bearing on their role as regional development agencies. It would not, in the Government's view, be right for RDAs to spend time and money on activities which might arguably contribute to sustainable development in the UK, but have no relevance to the region. Taken to the extreme, that would allow an RDA to gallivant around the world discussing worthy issues simply for the sake of doing so.
<P>
Our objective is to give RDAs a meaningufl role, which will be taken seriously in all aspects of decision making and which strikes the right balance. RDAs will need to demonstrate in their strategies what they are doing to contribute to sustainable development and to encourage others to do so, and they will need to demonstrate in their day-to-day work that they are making a real contribution.
<P>
We believe that the sustainable development purpose as drafted encapsulates the balance that RDAs should strike. I do not accept that it would unreasonably limit their activities or that, as the hon. Member for South Suffolk claimed, it is weak and worthless. We need to ensure reasonable limitations on what RDAs may do, in the interests of public accountability, given that they will be economic development agencies funded, for the most part, from the public purse. The basis on which this provision is drafted mirrors that on which the other purposes are framed. In all cases, relevance to an RDA's area is the basis of its activities, subject to the caveats that I raised in responding to the debate.
<P>
It follows in reponse to the English Nature point that we do not accept the proposition in amendment No. 55 that RDAs' primary purpose or objective should be to further the achievement of sustainable development. We want to ensure that proper weight is given to sustainable development issues, and we have put the sustainable development purpose on exactly the same footing as the economic and social purposes. That is where the balance must be found. We do not consider it appropriate for an economic development agency to be required to treat sustainable development as it primary purpose.
<P>
Against this backround, I would urge the hon. Members not to press the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The length of the Minister's reply and the fact that she so faithfully reproduced her briefing note suggests that she is in some difficulty. I am tempted to wonder, as the Minister has just come from meeting the Prime Minister, what his perspectives on sustainable development are. Perhaps I may be told outside the Committee Room.
<P>
I want the Minister to deal with two specific problems and I want the Committee to return to consideration of the decisions that people will have to take. They will not consider such matters in the abstract. Let is consider a region with which the Minister and I are both familiar our home region. The hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) will have an interest in the matter too. One of Yorkshire's great lacks is a major industrial estate. It has nothing to compare with Trafford Park. The obvious and sensible place to put such an estate is the area around Doncaster, where the A1, M1 and M18 meet. Land is available for development there. Would a decision by the regional development agency to construct a major industrial estate there, putting in the necessary road system to service it I know that there are rail links, but roads would be needed too fall within the Ministers definition of sustainable development? That is the sort of practical decision that people will have to take.
<P>
Would the Minister describe the construction of terminal 5 at Heathrow as sustainable development? I am anxious to find out the reason for the little phrase:
"Where it is relevant to its area to do so".<P>

<P>
I am not persuaded that a provision deterring Yorkshire and Humberside from reaching environmental agreements with Mongolia solves the problem.
<P>
I can envisage developments that any regional development agency might want to undertake. The Government have talked about the need to accelerate planning and have cited terminal 5 as a reason for that. I recall a decision that had to be taken, when the old Department of the Environment was responsible for such matters, about the development of Felixstowe docks. That was in people's economic interest but it had[Mr. Curry]
an environmental impact including in the Thames and on the Kent coast. Dock facilities were needed to tackle heavy unemployment in the region, but then promoters immediately ran into problems from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds because a certain area of mud flats would be taken up.
<P>
In what circumstances would it not, under clause 4(1)(e), be relevant to an area to pursue a policy of sustainable development? There is no point in saying that the requirement for sustainable development must permeate the spirit of the whole Bill if there is a get-out. I know that the Bill has been drafted with care. Parliamentary draftsmen have crawled all over it because that is what happens so it ain't there by accident. It is not purely a precaution. The only reason that Ministers give is that we do not want to deal with Mongolia. I do not know what benefits might accrue to Mongolia or the United Kingdom but I do not see any prospect of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional development area goind to Mongolia in search of environmental agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caburn:</B> That is exactly what we included the provision for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That is curious, and it needs clarification. If that is indeed the reason, my scepticism about the project is reinforced. Will the Minister answer my points about the practical questions that board members will deal with? What is the test? What willthey apply to it? What will the chaplain to the board, to resume my metaphor, say when it requires his imprimatur to say that this is sustainable development?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Both the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall have asked how RDAs fulfil their duties in this area. It is for the RDAs to decide. We will monitor their progress in these areas, but the Bill is a decentralisation of power and we will not be overprescriptive at national level as to how that power is exercised within the strategic framework that is set up and created in the Bill.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is an experienced former Minister and he knows that he must not ask me to comment on issues such as terminal 5, which may well come to the Department for a final decision. As he well knows, there is absolutely nothing that I can say about planning matters like that. But, to take his point about a potential development in an RDA, it would be a matter for the RDA where that might go, bearing in mind the guidance or directions which we will have issued, its own strategy that will have been developed for it, and the local planning authorities. The matter will ultimately be decided on the merits of the case. I hope that with those reassurances the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
