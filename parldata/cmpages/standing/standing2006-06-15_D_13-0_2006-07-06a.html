still not be possible to deal with the large number of consolidation
clauses, which will have to be dealt with at some point. We would have
preferred to have had the chance to come back after the summer recess
to consider them and to consult on them externally. However, we are

Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I was speaking to
amendment No. 148 to clause 142, and I was saying that we found it
illogical that different parts of the country should be able to have
different policies on whether children&#151;people under the age of
16&#151;could be directors. The Government might have an explanation
of why the provisions are necessary, and I would be grateful to hear it
if it exists.</div> <a name="06070724000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
to amendment No. 150. Clause 144 provides that existing directors under
the age of 16 will cease to be so on enactment. We think that the
clause is quite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 500</div>harsh, in so far as it is retrospective, and such legislation is
normally unfair on people who are affected. I can see why we should
change the law from now on, but I can also see why the average under
16-year-old entrepreneur might feel aggrieved that their officer roles
will be snatched away from them bythe Government. Our
compromise is that if the Government have appointed a natural person
over the age of 16 to be a further director, the director who is under
16 years old should be able to remain in situ. That is simply
realistic, rather than mums and dads being put in as directors while
the founding 15-year-old entrepreneur is still there pretty much as a
shadow
director.</div><a name="06070724000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070724000518"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): Will my hon. Friend
comment on the retrospection and whether he is aware that Companies
House is geared up to monitor the provision? Presumably, it would be a
requirement to show on the register that a director had ceased to be a
director on a particular date, given that those people would already be
shown by virtue of the filing of form 288 to be a director in the first
place.</div><a name="06070724000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000519"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I think
that the way in which the provision will work is that they will
disappear as directors on the day concerned. The Bill covers his point,
but it does not cover the basic unfairness, as those who are already
directors might have obligations. We are assuming that such companies
do not do anything, but they might be successful and have made
commitments and entered into contracts. People might have relied on
those young people&#146;s words as directors and suddenly to snatch
that all away could put a section of the community into a highly
embarrassing
position.</div><a name="06070724000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
like to hear the Minister&#146;s views, but we are strongly in favour
of amendment No. 150.</div>
<a name="06070724000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000520"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
shall deal first with amendment No. 148. It is our view&#151;in a
sense, what the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said confirms
that it might also be his view&#151;that someone who happens to be
under the age of 16 who has done something that is found to be unlawful
should face the same possibility of criminal action as anyone else. If
the hon. Gentleman believes that really talented young entrepreneurs
who are effectively acting as directors should not be subject to the
criminal consequences of their actions&#151;that would be the result
of removing subsection (5)&#151;it would be somewhat inconsistent. It
is our view that we should not provide any exemption from the
possibility of criminal prosecution of those aged under 16 who act as
directors.</div> <a name="06070724000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions for directors now under the age of 16 will obviously have to
be dealt with through the transitional provisions; we can make
sensible, practical arrangements. However, there may be exceptions,
which is why we have left ourselves a little leeway. For example, a
charitable company associated with youth work may be an exception to
what must be regarded as a sensible general
rule.</div>
<a name="06070724000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000521"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister speaks of exceptions, but the Bill
already provides for individual exceptions, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 501</div>so would the Department be lenient or accepting of those under the age
of 16 who are currently directors who want to stay on as
directors?</div><a name="06070724000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000522"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> On the whole, the matter is better dealt with under
the transitional arrangements. I am being passed helpful bits of paper
as I speak. We will consider that point. If it makes sense to make
transitional arrangements, we will do so.</div>
<a name="06070724000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">When considering the provisions
of the clause, we wondered whether it would be sensible to permit all
existing under-age directors to continue in office after the Bill
becomes law. Some are extremely young, although given the parliamentary
question that the hon. Gentleman asked and his research into the
question, he probably knows that. Odd though it may seem to some
Members, it has become fashionable to give directorships as christening
presents. However, although perfectly sensible and practical
transitional arrangements could be made to fit individual
circumstances, a blanket agreement that those under the age of 16 who
are currently directors could continue would be wrong.</div>
<a name="06070724000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendment No. 149.
Clause 143(4) allows regulations making exceptions to the under-age ban
to vary in different parts of the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman
asked why that is so. We believe that it is proper to provide for the
differences in law on age in the various countries of the UK. Like the
hon. Gentleman, I think it unlikely that we will ever have to take
advantage of the provision, but it is better to have it in the Bill
rather than to find that what we want to do is outside the
legislation.</div>
<a name="06070724000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000523"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We know that the provision is irrelevant to
Scotland, because there are no Scottish under-age directors. We are
talking about England and Wales&#151;I am not sure about Northern
Ireland. Will the Minister please explain which parts of England and
Wales might have a habit or custom of having directors under the age of
16?</div><a name="06070724000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000524"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It is right that currently there are not any in
Scotland, which has different age provisions for all sorts of legal
permissions necessary to take part in certain activities or to access
services. However, the provision should be in the Bill. It is highly
unlikely that we would ever want to use it, but it is better to have it
in there so that if we did want to use it we could regulate from
it.</div><a name="06070724000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000525"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To deal with the last point first, the
Minister&#146;s position on amendment No. 149 confounds me. No
examples have been given in the notes, by her today or in the Lords
debates of why one part of the country should need under-age directors.
I see no justification for making them under-age; I am rather in the
dark on that one. I admit that it is perhaps not the most important
issue in the Bill, but one wonders why it is there in the first
place.</div><a name="06070724000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000526"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> In
case.</div><a name="06070724000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000527"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In case&#151;that ancient remark of the civil
servant.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 502</div><a name="06070724000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having heard the
Minister&#146;s comments, amendment No. 150 appears to deal with a
more important issue. We are assuming that young people will not have
serious companies. In relation to another amendment, I asked,
&#147;Could that apply to individuals or groups of people?&#148; In
response, the Minister gave the example of schoolchildren becoming
directors as part of a project. That might be an example of where group
provisions would be useful. That was not what I was getting at,
however. I was talking about an individual under the age of 16 who sets
up a company. Will they be able to approach the Department of Trade and
Industry and present a fair case for their business and directorship?
If so, will the Secretary of State hear sympathetically their case for
why they should be a director? They should be given a sympathetic
hearing.</div> <a name="06070724000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the past
200 years people under 16 have been allowed to be directors&#151;and
suddenly we are saying that they cannot be directors. I accept that in
future they should not be, but those who are directors now should be
able to remain so. We could be affecting young people&#146;s dreams
of setting up a company or their livelihoods. For all we know, many of
the companies involved could be successful, from which the individuals
derive an income. So we could be taking away somebody&#146;s ability
to earn a living. Historically, many of our most successful
entrepreneurs started at school or university, or while employed and
working second jobs.</div>
<a name="06070724000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has not
appreciated the seriousness of my point. It is all very well for her to
say that the issue will be covered in transitional provisions, but that
is not good enough. We would like provisions in the Bill for young
people who are currently directors. That is why I shall be pressing
amendment No. 150 to a
Division.</div><a name="06070724000477"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

considerations, but we view the exceptions as classes rather than
individuals. That is where we differ from the hon. Gentleman. We may
want to make exceptions among classes, hence the power to do so. I gave

and is trading as
such.</div><a name="06070724000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
oddity, in that in the House of Lords&#151;I am sure that the hon.

anybody under 18 becoming a director. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Under 80.&#148;] Under 80! Anyway, there

<a name="06070724000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">One has to take a sensible
decision. The Committee can vote if the hon. Gentleman so wishes, but I
have assured him that we will consider transitional arrangements and
ensure that we do not catch anybody who is currently a director. We
will make some sensible, practical arrangements to deal with them. We
will consider classes&#151;companies such as the one in my example
exist&#151;but not individuals. In that context, this is a sensible
way forward. On the whole, we want those who are under 16 to be putting
their energy, vigour,

Minister confirm that the clause could be used to cater for individual
circumstances rather than classes of people? I believe that we have
already had an answer to that. Secondly, to what extent will the
Minister be open-minded about granting waivers in respect of classes?
We note the negative resolution procedure, but would a less formal
administrative mechanism be more appropriate, and could such a
mechanism be introduced by
regulation?</div><a name="06070724000062"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000551"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in
clause 145, page 64, line 37, leave
out from first &#145;made&#146; to end of line
38.</div><a name="06070724000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea behind
the clause is certainly sound. The bad old practice of grouping
directors together and having them voted through en bloc, normally at
the AGM, is not good corporate governance practice. Votes should be
taken individually on each director. Having separate resolutions also
gives shareholders the chance to ask questions concerning each
director.</div><a name="06070724000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an age in
which institutions are quite properly taking more of an interest in
making recommendations based on each director, and often related to the
independence of non-executive directors, single resolutions certainly
make sense. However, I note from the second half of subsection (1) that
the old provision for bloc voting is to remain, subject to the
condition that the company has voted for it. I am surprised that that
provision has been carried over into the Bill. Will the Minister please
provide an example of when that might be
necessary?</div><a name="06070724000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000552"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If I may, I shall turn that question back on the
hon. Gentleman. The provision simply takes from section 292 of the 1985
Act. To the best of my knowledge, that provision has not caused any
problems. If he has a good reason for changing it, I shall listen. But
if it ain&#146;t broke, why fix
it?</div><a name="06070724000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000553"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I tried to explain that, effectively, it is a
redundant provision. We do not see it used any more&#151;at least I
have never seen it used. Will the Minister say when it would be used?
Certainly, it goes against all general views on corporate governance.
That made me think that as we reconsider the Companies Bill every 20
years, it might be worth removing the
provision.</div><a name="06070724000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000554"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The provision allows flexibility for companies
because the agreement must be unanimous, not by majority. The
counterview is that if we remove that flexibility, regulatory
Government diktat would increase. So we have left it as it
is.</div><a name="06070724000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000555"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000558"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 270 is a technical amendment and
is needed because the register of directors&#146; residential
addresses required under clause 150 is not open for inspection as
required by subsections (3) to (5). It is therefore designed to delete
the reference to clause
150.</div><a name="06070724000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 459
came from the Law Society. Whereas a company&#146;s registers of
members and debenture holders may be kept at an address other than its
registered office, its register of directors must be kept at its
registered office. It has been pointed out that it is common for a
private company to employ a single, combined register book containing
all those particulars. If that is maintained by a company&#146;s
professional advisers, the company is obliged to have its registered
office at their address rather than at its head office. We have
previously recommended that the register of directors should be
permitted to be kept at another address, provided that it is within the
jurisdiction in which a company is registered and that notice of the
address is given to the registrar of companies. Clause 212(2) is a
reasonable model and we suggest that clause 147 be amended in line with
it.</div><a name="06070724000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that in
clause 153 it is made clear that the director notification provisions
apply to shadow directors. Unless I have missed the provisions, I
cannot see that the Bill makes specific reference to alternate
directors in that regard. That deserves inclusion, if only 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 506</div>to clear up confusion. The current state of the law is that when a
person appoints someone as their alternate to pitch up at a board
meeting under a company&#146;s articles, he is technically required
to file form 288 notifying Companies House of that fact. That can be
more trouble than it is worth, especially as many people are appointed
as alternates for only one board meeting or on an ad hoc basis. Each
time the alternate is appointed, a form is supposed to be sent to
Companies House, and after each board meeting a further form should be
sent to notify Companies House of the termination of the alternate
status.</div> <a name="06070724000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
those provisions are so unworkable that they are practised more often
in the breach than in the observance. To clarify the matter we propose
amendment No. 367, which states that if an appointment as alternate is
for less than one month, no forms have to be filed. That would tie in
with what is meant to be a deregulatory Bill. Whether or not
notification is to be made of the appointment of an alternate, will the
Minister advise me whether it needs to be written into the register of
directors?</div><a name="06070724000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause
150 stand part, the question how best to protect the home addresses of
directors has been an important issue&#151;we previously discussed
the personal details of shareholders&#151;not least for directors who
have been targeted for abuse by economic terrorists. Although the
Opposition believe in robust scrutiny in corporate governance and value
transparency, we are particularly concerned that a suitable balance be
struck and that directors in charge of companies engaged in potentially
controversial but lawful activities are protected, as is their right
and our duty. I have been in touch with Lord Sainsbury on the matter
for a number of
years.</div><a name="06070724000478"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="06070724000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Out of
necessity, the approach has evolved over the past few years. Following
the last change in regulations, it is possible for directors to
approach the DTI to request that they can use a service address. For
everyone else, the home address is still to be used. However, the
approach in the Bill has been changed so that directors will have the
presumption of using their service address, provided that they give
details of their home address for a second, private
register.</div><a name="06070724000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative Opposition generally support this approach as a sensible
way forward. However, it is fair to note that a limited number of
concerns have been raised, mainly by lending bodies that are concerned
for the implications relating to abuse by fraudulent people. Indeed, my
noble Friend Lord Hodgson raised those very points in some detail in
Grand Committee. We have received a note from the Finance and Leasing
Association, and it is important to take a balanced approach and to put
its views on the
record:</div><a name="06070724000114"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
most controversial aspects of the reforms from an FLA perspective are
clauses 217-225 around Confidentiality of Directors&#146; Home
Addresses. Our position here has differed significantly to the one set
out by opposition
parties&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06070724000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
being very fair
here&#151;</div><a name="06070724000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;calling for
a right for directors to have their home address kept confidential from
the public record, and for a service address to appear on the public
record instead.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 507</div><a name="06070724000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">Such a proposal would have
significant consequences for the corporate lending and financing
sectors, by limiting a lender&#146;s ability to verify
directors&#146; details against the public record.</div>
<a name="06070724000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">The details of this are set out
below...We noted concerns raised in the Official Report on
proceedings during Committee Stage of the Bill about the possibility of
disclosure of personal details held by the registrar to
&#145;bogus&#146; CRAs.</div>
<a name="06070724000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">Like the Minister, we
appreciate these concerns, but would like to take this opportunity to
provide some contextual information that we hope will acknowledge and
explain further the restrictions and safeguards that surround the
Bill&#146;s proposal for access to director information and the
purposes for which this information is used by lenders.</div>
<a name="06070724000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">Following a number of high
profile cases, procedures were put in place for directors within high
risk businesses and industries to apply to the Secretary of State to
exclude their home addresses from the public register.</div>
<a name="06070724000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Bill proposes a less
onerous regime where any director can choose to give a service address,
in addition to their personal home address. The service address will
appear on the public register and a separate restricted register of
protected addresses will be created.</div>
<a name="06070724000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">Under the terms of the Bill as
drafted, clause 220(3) allows for the disclosure of the protected
register to CRAs. Further, clause 220(3) will enable the Secretary of
State to make supplementary regulations to specify how data may be
disclosed and used. The incorporation of these provisions followed
discussions between industry stakeholders and DTI.</div>
<a name="06070724000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">We understand that disclosure
will be facilitated in a similar way to that adopted under section 114
of the Representation of the People Act (England and Wales) (Amendment)
Regulations 2001 which provides for the sale of the electoral register
to CRAs licensed under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and registered with
the Office of the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000560"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Possibly. That sentence continues by referring
to</div><a name="06070724000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intervention from the
Office of the Information Commissioner. Both a full and edited
electoral register were established. The full register was created from
the annual canvass and is updated monthly on the basis of a rolling
register. The edited register is made up of the records of those
individuals who have not opted out of their data being used for any
purpose.</div> <a name="06070724000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">Restrictions
on the supply and use of the full electoral register resulted in only
credit reference agencies engaged in the business of providing credit
reference services being authorised to purchase the full register. In
turn use of that register was restricted to:</div>
<a name="06070724000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">Vetting applications for credit
or applications that can result in the giving of credit or the giving
of any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in relation to the giving of
credit:</div> <a name="06070724000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">Meeting any
obligations contained in the Money Laundering Regulations
1993...or any rules made pursuant to section 146 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000(c); and Statistical analysis of credit
risk assessment in a case where no person whose details are included in
the full register is referred to by name or necessary
implication.</div> <a name="06070724000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">There
are three major CRAs providing consumer information and five major CRAs
providing commercial information to lenders and, in the area of sole
traders and small and medium sized enterprises, there is considerable
overlap between consumer and commercial activity.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 508</div><a name="06070724000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">CRAs provide information to
lenders about businesses and those responsible for them. The
information that they provide is a combination of public and privately
shared data. Traditionally, this information has been provided to
enable lenders to make decisions about advancing credit, to confirm
identity for the prevention of fraud and money laundering, fraud
prevention and investigation and for debtor
tracing.</div><a name="06070724000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">One important
source of the information used is the directors&#146; data from
Companies House. This can be combined with other information to enable
lenders considering doing business with an organisation to check the
individuals responsible for its running. A key element of this check is
access to the home addresses of directors to verify and cross-check the
identity of an individual across different
databases.</div><a name="06070724000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">We are
concerned that the removal of the provision to permit the disclosure of
the protected register to CRAs is likely to have significant and
un-intended consequences for
lenders.</div><a name="06070724000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">Unscrupulous
and disqualified directors may be encouraged to abuse the restricted
register to avoid financial responsibilities, commit fraud, and obtain
access to goods and services that would normally not be granted and to
create fictitious identities. In turn lenders and other commercial
organisations will face heightened risk and will become reluctant to do
business with companies or individuals with whom they are unfamiliar
unless further checks can be undertaken. New start-ups and particularly
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to whom our members provide finance
are likely to find access to credit restricted as a result, all of
which will serve to restrict growth and competition. Failed and
disqualified directors will be able to conceal and disregard existing
liabilities and bad debt and resume trading to the detriment of other
businesses and the finance
sector.</div><a name="06070724000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">In order to
mitigate these consequences it is important that the new public
register of directors&#146; addresses specifies whether the disclosed
address is a director&#146;s home or service address. The protected
register of directors&#146; home addresses must continue to be made
available, in full, to certain authorised organisations for certain
specific and limited purposes on condition that they use the
information in specified ways for particular purposes only. This will
safeguard lenders&#146; access to the information they need when
assessing whether to advance a loan and in helping applicant
identification.</div><a name="06070724000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">CRAs
have ensured that robust systems exist to manage access to the data
contained within the electoral register and ensure that it is only
supplied and used in accordance with the regulations. The recently
published Electoral Administration Act 2005 empowers individuals deemed
to be at risk to apply for anonymous registration in order to prevent
their personal information from being published on the public
register.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall return
to that point.</div><a name="06070724000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FLA
continues:</div><a name="06070724000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department for Constitutional Affairs has also consulted with CRAs to
ensure that access to personal data is maintained in a way that
safeguards the identity of the individual while promoting financial
inclusion.</div><a name="06070724000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">We
therefore strongly believe that the provisions of the Bill as drafted
provide a practical and sensible set of arrangements providing for the
continued functioning of the market whilst also putting in place the
necessary safeguards to prevent
abuse.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
a well-considered letter and it deserves to be mentioned. The
Government will get about half way to providing what the FLA wants, but
will the Minister discuss its concerns generally? It would be good to
have that on the
record.</div><a name="06070724000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether the
provisions will work is yet to be seen, although we think that they
will help. However, various issues need to be addressed now to tighten
up their effectiveness. One is the need to enable directors to remove
prior notifications of their home address; otherwise, the proposals
will be useless if a director moves home. In the Lords, the Government
resisted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 509</div>our proposal on that on the basis that the costs were too great. I found
out through tabling a written question that it costs about &#163;40 a
go.</div><a name="06070724000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers also
said that as people can access details on the internet in any event, we
should not bother to deal with the issue now. We disagreed with that
position and were pleased that the Government seemed to have changed
their mind in the final stages of consideration in the
Lords.</div><a name="06070724000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is part of
a letter sent to me by Lord Sainsbury, who
wrote:</div><a name="06070724000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
regards historic information, the Bill&#151;as

under which addresses can be removed from the public record held by
Companies House. We intend to consult over draft regulations later this
year so that they can be brought into force at the same time as the
provisions providing protection for all directors&#146; home
addresses.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is all
well and good, but we do not understand why it cannot be done now in
the Bill. We agree that if there is a cost, it should be borne by the
director concerned. Furthermore, we will later move amendments Nos. 258
and 279 to clause 225(2)(b). That clause interacts with clause 741,
which aims to ensure that when it is considered appropriate for old
Companies House records to be removed, the registrar must do
so.</div><a name="06070724000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a further
issue of wider access to directors&#146; home addresses via the
internet, which was discussed in the Lords. Gone are the days when we
just threw up our hands and said, &#147;That&#146;s on the web, so
there&#146;s nothing to be done about it.&#148; It is clear that
the vast majority of directors&#146; addresses on the web are
accessed via the electoral register, and we must deal with
that.</div><a name="06070724000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a letter of 9
May to Lord Sainsbury, I

is what the FLA picked up

department assessed how useful these provisions would be to deal with
the problems set out in this letter, e.g. as regards the level of proof
of violence that would need to be given to the

Sainsbury, replying on 8 June,
said:</div><a name="06070724000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
asked about directors&#146; addresses on the electoral register.
Anonymity is to be granted to those whose safety would be at risk if
their name or address were to appear in the electoral register. The
Department for Constitutional Affairs advises that decisions have not
yet been taken on the evidence that will be required for a person to be
granted anonymous registration, but the key will be in meeting the
&#145;safety test&#146; as set out in clause 10 of the Electoral
Administration Bill. This test is satisfied if the safety of the
applicant for an anonymous entry or that of another person of the same
household would be at risk if the register contains the name of the
applicant or his qualifying
address.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not totally convinced that the Government have yet given the issue the
attention required or that they have considered closely enough the
provisions of the Electoral Administration Bill in terms of protecting
company directors in the context of this
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 510</div><a name="06070724000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">When do the Government expect
decisions to be taken on the evidence that will be required for a
person to be granted anonymous registration and what will the threshold
be? The Minister might have to come back to me on that
matter.</div><a name="06070724000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is a
major concern for many embattled company directors. It is a serious
issue for the stability of British business and the welfare of many
directors and their families. I hope that the Government listen to
their great need and come back to us on the matter.</div>
<a name="06070724000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge the efforts of
Lord Sainsbury, one of the few members of the Government who has
consistently been brave enough to stand up for directors and
shareholders who have been terrorised and who has paid attention in the
past five years to the Opposition&#146;s calls for protection for
company directors and
shareholders.</div><a name="06070724000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that the Bill has been greatly improved by various amendments
made in the other place, but it is not quite there
yet.</div>
<a name="06070724000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000561"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That was a long speech on clause stand part. I want
to return to the amendments. I thank the hon. Gentleman for picking up
an incorrect cross-reference, and we are therefore happy to accept
amendment No. 270.</div><a name="06070724000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 459, the hon. Gentleman makes a good case for companies
having the option of keeping their registers of directors wherever
their register of members is kept available for inspection, although he
will agree that it must be in the same jurisdiction as the registered
office and that it must be notified to the Registrar of
Companies.</div> <a name="06070724000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
relaxation that the hon. Gentleman suggests should equally apply to
matters such as plc registers of secretaries and to registers of
authorised signatories for those companies required to keep them. The
requirement should not be considered in isolation; there is also a
right for members to inspect records of resolutions and meetings under
clause 341. There is a right for members to inspect directors&#146;
service contracts and qualifying third-party indemnity provision under
clauses 213 and 220. There is a right for members and creditors to
inspect instruments creating charges and a public right to inspect
registers of charges under part XII of the 1985 Act, which is to be
restated.</div><a name="06070724000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
possible places for the inspection of the various records and registers
vary. We must minimise the likelihood of records being sent all over the place, possibly discouraging inspection by those who want to exercise that right.</div><a name="06070724000479"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="06070724000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000562"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister has just hit on the point. The
procedure can be used to discourage inspections by having people go to
different parts of the country to see different
registers.</div>
<a name="06070724000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000563"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman and the Law Society have made a
sensible proposition. All that I would say to him is that we need some
time and would like to table an amendment on Report that gives
companies the option of keeping their register of directors either at
the principal place of business or at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 511</div>the same place as their registers of members, but we want to include
conditions that protect those who wish to inspect registers and other
records and registers available. I hope on that basis that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="06070724000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 367 appears to be
deregulatory, relieving the company of the obligation to enter an
alternate director&#146;s particulars on the public record if his or
her appointment is of minimal duration, but I am sure the hon.
Gentleman would accept that there could be a serious problem with such
an exemption. However long or short a time someone is appointed for,
they have duties as a director for the period when they act as such.
That is the current law, which the Bill retains. Under the amendment
some appointments would become invisible. On that basis, it would be
better not to accept it. I accept that bureaucracy is involved in
complying with the 100 per cent. record, and if we can think of a
better way of reducing the bureaucracy but maintaining the record we
should adopt it. We will certainly consider that, but at present for
completeness and consistency, we need to reject amendment No.
236.</div><a name="06070724000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now speak
to the Government amendments. On introduction in another place the Bill
provided for a system whereby any director could apply to have his or
her home address on the protected record. It was argued that that would
leave many directors exposed, and we were persuaded that it would be
better if all directors were to provide both a service address for the
public record and their home address for the protected record. We
tabled amendments based on a scheme suggested to us by the Association
of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which we will consider later
when we reach chapter 8 of this part.</div>
<a name="06070724000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">To keep things as simple as
possible for companies and their directors, the Bill permits both that
the service address be given as the company&#146;s registered
address, and that the home address be noted as being the same as the
service address. That means that it would be possible for the record of
a director&#146;s residential address held at Companies House to be
changed automatically if the company were to change its registered
office, whether or not the director had in fact moved.</div>
<a name="06070724000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, as the record of
the residential address is not public, such errors would not come to
light until an enforcement agency, for example, needed to use it. That
would probably be a common problem, for as we all know, many companies
on start-up have their registered homes at a director&#146;s home but
latergrow out of that arrangement. The Government amendments
address that problem while still keeping things as simple as possible
for both companies and directors. Amendment No. 365 provides that a
director&#146;s residential address may be stated to be the same as
his or her service address only if the service address is not the
company&#146;s registered office.</div>
<a name="06070724000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 366 requires that
with any notification of a change in the director&#146;s service
address there must also be either an accompanying notification of a
change in the residential address or a statement that there is no
change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000564"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Perhaps I missed it, but will the Minister
explain what evil the amendment is trying to put
right?</div><a name="06070724000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000565"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The evil is that someone may need to track down
directors through a home address, which would not be clear under the
current provisions. In the example I gave of someone starting a company
from their own home and then moving elsewhere, without the amendments
there will be no way of tracking that change of
address.</div><a name="06070724000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made a lengthy contribution. We will return to some of those
issues on clause 226. He talked about issues relating to clause 225. It
all comes up in chapter 8 when we talk about directors&#146;
residential
addresses.</div><a name="06070724000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000566"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If we get
there.</div><a name="06070724000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000567"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We will see how we do; it is up to the Opposition.
I will study the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. If any issues
arise on which it is necessary to write to him, I will do so.</div>
<a name="06070724000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 150 was introduced on
Report in the Lords as part of package of amendments to provide
protection for all directors&#146; home addresses. Clause 223
provides that the information on those registers is protected. Clause
224 provides that, except with the consent of the director concerned, a
company may use a director&#146;s home address only in order to
communicate with him or her. It also provides that it may disclose
those addresses only under a court order or in compliance with a
requirement to notify the registrar of companies. Clause 150 is
therefore an essential part of that rather bigger package for
protecting directors&#146; home addresses.</div>
<a name="06070724000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his acknowledgment&#151;it was not apparent in our
earlier discussion of privacy and the difficulties that individuals
face&#151;of the role played by my colleague Lord Sainsbury. He has
done an enormously difficult job of taking forward many of these
provisions incredibly well and
bravely.</div><a name="06070724000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000568"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We have made some progress this afternoon.
Amendment No. 270 is to be accepted. I think that the Minister took the
point on amendment No. 459 that there should be the ability to check
registers in the same place. If that is not the case, there could be
the possible evil of companies splitting up their registers to make
inspection difficult and an obstacle rather than helping people. I
appreciate that the Minister will respond to that amendment on
Report.</div><a name="06070724000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
was not so sympathetic towards amendment No. 367. Put simply, if I am a
director and I cannot make a board meeting and I want to send my
alternate, I send a one-line letter to the company saying &#147;I
appoint X as my alternate.&#148; X goes along to the board meeting as
my alternate and that appointment could then be finished. I could make
the appointment for a longer
period.</div><a name="06070724000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000569"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If the hon. Gentleman were unable to make a board
meeting and somebody went in his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 513</div>place to make the argument that he would have made, that person does not
necessarily have to be an alternate to be able to contribute and speak
in the consideration of a particular issue at a directors&#146;
meeting.</div><a name="06070724000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000570"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Perhaps the Minister could explain in which
capacity such a person would
go.</div><a name="06070724000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000571"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> They would go as a member, presumably. I do not
know whether they would be a particular office holder. People talk at
directors&#146; meetings and participate in the deliberations without
necessarily being a director. The hon. Gentleman might have done this
himself. A solicitor might well take part in a directors&#146;
meeting, giving advice to the
directors.</div><a name="06070724000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000572"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister is missing my point. I am not
talking about a confrontational situation where solicitors are needed.
I am simply saying that articles will provide for alternates. If I am a
director and I cannot make a meeting, I might want to send my
alternate.</div><a name="06070724000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000573"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am not talking about situations of conflict.
Somebody who is not a director, viz. a solicitor, might give perfectly
consensual advice on a decision discussed at a directors&#146;
meeting.</div><a name="06070724000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000574"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I see where the Minister is coming from, but I
am making a different point. I am talking not about someone being
invited to a board meeting to give advice but about someone acting as a
director&#146;s alternate and therefore having that director&#146;s
vote and going to the meeting in his
place.</div><a name="06070724000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000575"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The point that I was making was that if a director
is ill for a meeting&#151;that was where we started this
exchange&#151;and is therefore unable to present a report, that
report could be given as advice from a finance director, solicitor or
whatever without that person necessarily having a vote. I am told that
many companies&#146; articles permit their directors to appoint
somebody in their stead. There may be restrictions and conditions, but
they do not affect the basic position that in law anyone occupying the
position of a director is a director, whatever their title, howsoever
they were appointed and even if they were not. That person is a de
facto
director.</div><a name="06070724000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000576"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes, articles normally provide for a director to
appoint someone in their stead&#151;an alternate director. As the law
stands, a form 228 must technically be filed if an alternate is
appointed even for a single board meeting. That is hugely inconvenient
and, as far as I can see, unnecessary. I still think that that is a
relevant point. Is the Minister saying that under the new provisions
the equivalent of a form 288 will not have to be filed in any
event?</div><a name="06070724000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000577"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No, I was saying that we ought to consider whether
we can simplify the notification procedures in any way, taking the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that they are bureaucratic. I have just been
told that the first company law directive requires that all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 514</div>directors be notified, which constrains our ability to be flexible in
the way that the hon. Gentleman
wishes.</div><a name="06070724000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000578"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I assume that &#147;all directors&#148;
includes alternate directors, although the Minister did not say so.
Assuming that it does, there might be a problem. I appreciate her
taking the point and saying that she will look at the bureaucracy. I am
making a point of bureaucracy rather than one of grand
principle.</div><a name="06070724000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 365 seems sensible and I have made the points that I
wanted to make on clause 150 stand part. I hope that the Government do
not see this debate as the end of the game or believe that
consideration of the provisions stops here. There is more to do to

of provisions to shadow directors</div>
<a name="06070724000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000579"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 157, in
clause 153, page 68, leave out line
7.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 515</div><a name="06070724000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have been raised about
the level of knowledge that might pertain to a shadow director. For
instance, if I control 100 per cent. of a company and appoint some
friends to be directors when in all but name I am calling the shots and
running the company, it is clear that I am a shadow director. Clearly,
it is also right that I am bound by clauses 147 to 149 and the
registration provisions in clause 150.</div>
<a name="06070724000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reality, however, whether an
alleged shadow director controls the company is often confusing. For
instance, it might depend on the extent of the influence exerted. A
bank, through its financial covenants, might call the shots to the
extent that it comes to be seen as a shadow director. In such a
situation it might be that the shadow director honestly has no idea
that he, she or it is a shadow director. The question then is whether
such a person should have the same liability as a normal director who
fails to register
particulars.</div><a name="06070724000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, recent case law seems to state that even when it is decided
that someone is a shadow director, it does not necessarily follow that
they should have the same duties as a normal director. That is an
important new point that has come out of a recent case. I would like to
go into that in a little more detail. I am afraid that it is not the
most straightforward of topics.</div>
<a name="06070724000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">A de facto director is a person
who acts as a director without having been appointed validly, or at
all. They owe director&#146;s duties to the company in relation to
which they perform those functions. That is the old common law
position. A shadow director is a person in accordance with whose
directions or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to
act. Professional advisers acting in that capacity are generally
excluded from the
definition.</div><a name="06070724000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court
of Appeal made the following statements about the statutory definition
of a shadow director: that the definition should not be strictly
construed; that the purpose of the legislation was to identify those,
other than professional advisers, with real influence in the company's
corporate affairs, but this influence did not have to be over the whole
field of its corporate activities; that whether a communication was to
be classified as a &#147;direction or instruction&#148; had to be
objectively ascertained by the court in the light of all the evidence;
that non-professional advice might come within the statutory
definition; that a person could still be a shadow director even though
the board had not adopted a subservient role to him or had not
surrendered its discretion; and that shadow directors are subject to
specific statutory obligations and duties&#151;including those
imposed under the Companies Act 1985 and the Insolvency Act
1986.</div> <a name="06070724000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
development came in the Ultraframe case of 2005. U Ltd&#151;the
claimant&#151;and B Group, of which F was the majority shareholder,
were business competitors. A dispute arose between them concerning the
ownership of businesses in the field of conservatory roof design and
manufacture. The dispute focused on the operations and transactions of
two companies&#151;N Ltd and S Ltd&#151;which had been set up some
years ago and were now insolvent and controlled by U Ltd. F had been
appointed a director of S Ltd in October 1999, but was never appointed
director of N Ltd. U Ltd contended that F was a shadow or de facto 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 516</div>director of both S Ltd and M Ltd from about October 1998 on the basis
that F, among things, attended board meetings of both companies; told
the directors ofS Ltd that he wanted the location of the
company&#146;s business to be moved; was the sole signatory to S
Ltd&#146;s bank account from November 1998; stated in a letter to his
solicitors dated February 1999 that he was &#147;now running the
company&#148;; granted leases to S Ltd in March 1999 on which there
were no real arm&#146;s length negotiations over rent or other terms;
made a decision to change S Ltd&#146;s supplier of components; became
company secretary of S Ltd; and took debentures over N Ltd and S Ltd in
anticipation of supplies of materials and financial
support.</div><a name="06070724000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to considering F&#146;s status within N Ltd and S Ltd, the court also
considered, among many other things that hon. Members will be pleased
to know I will not go into, whether as a shadow director F owed
fiduciary duties to S Ltd and N Ltd. It held that F had become a de
facto director of the companies from January 1999, when he had at least
an equal voice to that of their de jure directors in important business
decisions and was part of the corporate structure of governance. F had
not become a shadow director of either company before he became a de
facto director, because the board was not &#147;accustomed to
act&#148; on his instructions or directions before that
time.</div><a name="06070724000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court also
made the following points on shadow directors: that in most cases, it
is unlikely on the facts that a person will be simultaneously a shadow
director and a de facto director, although he may be both in
succession; that in determining whether someone has become a shadow
director it is necessary to look at all the various matters
cumulatively; that a person at whose direction a governing majority of
a board is accustomed to act is capable of being a shadow director; and
that unless and until a board does something in conformity with a
putative shadow director&#146;s directions or instructions, the
question of shadow directorship does not arise. It pointed out that the
mere giving of instructions does not make someone a shadow director,
and that it is only when instructions are translated into action by the
board that that question can
arise.</div><a name="06070724000183"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000580"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> The hon. Gentleman
is obviously aware of Mr. Justice Lewison&#146;s views as he has just
been setting them out. He must also be aware of Mr. Justice
Toulson&#146;s views in Yukong Line of Korea Ltd. <i class="I">v.</i> Rendsburg
Corporation Investments of Liberia, which seem to conflict with those
views. Is he suggesting that it is the job of the Minister to resolve
that conflict? He is aware thatMr. Justice Toulson and Mr.
Justice Lewison appear to have different views.</div>
<a name="06070724000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Ultraframe case it was
held that the mere fact that a person falls within the statutory
definition of a shadow director is not enough to impose on him the same
fiduciary duties as are owed by de jure directors. However, Mr. Justice
Toulson proceeded on the basis that a shadow director could be in
breach of fiduciary duties as a director. Is he suggesting that the
Minister should resolve, here and now, the difference between those
views on the obligations of shadow
directors?</div><a name="06070724000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000581"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am saying that the Bill should take on board
the latest case that has been held.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 517</div><a name="06070724000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point on the Ultraframe
case, and in some ways the most important, is that the court held that
the mere fact that a person falls within the statutory definition of
shadow director is not enough to impose on him the same fiduciary
duties to a company as are owed by a de jure or de facto director. It
was decided that the indirect influence exerted by a shadow director
who does not deal directly with, or claim the right to deal directly
with, a company&#146;s assets will not usually be enough to impose
fiduciary duties on him, although he will be subject to the statutory
duties and disabilities that the Companies Act 1985 creates. The case
is stronger where a shadow director has been acting throughout in
furtherance of his own, rather than the company&#146;s interests.
However, in a particular case, the activities of a shadow director
might go beyondthe mere exertion of indirect
influence.</div><a name="06070724000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
probing basis, amendment No. 157 suggests that shadow directors should
not therefore have to register their details. I will be interested to
hear the Minister&#146;s view, but as I said to the Solicitor-General
we feel that the clause does not have the adaptability required
following the Ultraframe
case.</div><a name="06070724000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000582"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I have nothing much to add to the learned debate
between the hon. Member for Huntingdon and the Solicitor-General except
the more important point about what the law in this case is about. Does
the law wish to discourage people from acting as shadow directors or is
it simply trying to deal with the fact that sometimes people are shadow
directors? That is the more fundamental conflict of opinion than the
difference of opinion of the judges in those two cases.</div>
<a name="06070724000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has always seemed to me that
the status of shadow director is an unfortunate one which the law
should try to discourage in the first place. If someone acts in a such
a way that other people are accustomed to do what they say, an
important part of the transparency that is part of company law is lost.
Difficulties arise not just in regulation, but in terms of investors,
creditors and people who deal with the company knowing who is running
the company and what their interests and intentions are. My
view&#151;I recognise that there are others&#151;has always been
that the purpose of the law is to set up a penalty to discourage the
status of shadow director coming into being in the first place. I
oppose the amendment because it would make life easier for shadow
directors.</div><a name="06070724000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000583"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The Lib Dems want to knock them out, the Tories
want to conceal them and we are finding a third way through it all. I
listened with interest as a non-lawyer to the hon. Member for
Huntingdon. I would simply draw his attention to our definition of
shadow director in clause
234:</div><a name="06070724000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person in
accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the
company are accustomed to
act.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The complex case he
took us through&#151;I am told that the judgment runs to 750 pages
and I cannot claim to have read it&#151;does not undermine that
definition.</div><a name="06070724000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000584"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister will therefore be grateful for my
very brief synopsis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 518</div><a name="06070724000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000585"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> When I read <i class="I">Hansard</i> I will reflect on
that.</div><a name="06070724000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is our view that the case in no way undermines that. There is nothing
intrinsically nefarious about shadow directors. What would be
suspicious is if their identity were concealed. Therefore, it is
essential that the identities of those who control companies in the
terms laid out in the Bill should have their record in the public
domain. On that basis, I should be grateful if the hon. Member withdrew
his amendment and accepted our proposition. The only thing that I have
been told is that our wording is not brilliant so we will bring forward
an amendment on Report to toughen it
up.</div><a name="06070724000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000586"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister prepared to say in what way her
wording is not quite
right?</div><a name="06070724000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000587"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Apparently the wording does not quite meet the
intention, which is that a shadow director be treated as a director for
the purposes of the company&#146;s requirement to keep a register of
its directors and a register of its directors&#146; residential
addresses. The particulars of a director must be entered in a
company&#146;s register of directors and the power to make
regulations amending these particulars is a requirement that the
company notify the registrar of companies of any change in its
directors&#146; particulars. I am no drafter, but I am told that the
drafting does not make that abundantly clear. When looking again at the
clause when the amendment was tabled, our lawyers felt that it needed
slight redrafting to meet the intent. There is nothing further than
that.</div><a name="06070724000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000588"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If nothing else, I am pleased to have enabled
the Minister and her Department to look again at the clause. If a
redraft is to come out of that I am sure it will be of benefit to the
Bill as a whole. By the way, if the Minister wants full citations in
future, I would be delighted to
oblige.</div><a name="06070724000481"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06070724000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Cambridge said that the law should discourage shadow directors.
Shadow directors exist. We might not want them to, but they do. I gave
examples of some earlier. Let us consider a bank that has no intention
of being a shadow director, but which through its covenants can force a
company to go down certain routes. At some point, a court will decide
that the level of control is such that the bank has become a shadow
director. In fact, a bank will do everything it can to avoid becoming a
shadow director because it will not want the obligations. Banks are
terrified of that situation arising; a lot of lawyers&#146; time has
been spent on ensuring that they are not shadow
directors.</div><a name="06070724000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
is not about what we want to happen; it is about what happens as a
result of how people act. Our amendment was simply trying to reflect
that. I shall look carefully at the Minister&#146;s comments on what
will happen at a later stage; I hope that they address my remarks on
drafting. However, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070724000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000589"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in
clause 155, page 69, line 7, at
end insert</div><a name="06070724000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;or require
that the meeting be adjourned to a date not earlier than 14 days after
his representations have been
circulated.&#146;.</div><a name="06070724000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled by Lord Freeman in Grand Committee in the Lords,
and I have to say that it deserves further consideration. Company law
changes because the requirements of companies&#146; shareholders and
other stakeholders change over time; it is not a static process. The
concept of shareholder democracy is one advance that has had the full
support of those on the Opposition Benches. It means strengthening the
power of institutional shareholder
activism.</div><a name="06070724000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
provisions were adopted many years ago, but it is important to note
that in the United States shareholders still cannot vote on directors,
let alone on a simple majority. So, the provisions are still
far-thinking, and certainly were when they were put in place. In
practice, however, those statutory provisions have been little used,
although their presence should not be underestimated, particularly as
they provide for the ability gently to persuade directors to go at the
appropriate time, with the nuclear option of a resolution available if
required&#151;if the director refused to
go.</div><a name="06070724000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shareholder
activism, however, is becoming more attractive to institutional
shareholders as generally it gets plaudits from the media and smaller
investors for delivering value to shareholders. One institutional
investor employee whom I spoke to recently explained that investors who
take a proactive approach invariably receive higher returns than those
who do not. I do not have any statistical analysis with which to back
that up, but it seems to point towards increased shareholder activism.
We welcome that.</div><a name="06070724000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">If,
however, powerful shareholders are to be given the power of the order
of the boot&#151;a good thing&#151;it is important that, at the
same time, the director concerned has the right to defend himself. As
Lord Freeman pointed out, in practice, the director might not have
access to the share register and no means by which to explain his
position to other
shareholders.</div><a name="06070724000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
effect, there could be a rather dirty power fight in the company, and
the Bill provides that if the director&#146;s representations are not
sent out to shareholders, he has the right to have them read out at a
meeting. But as anyone who has operated in this area knows, very few
shareholders normally turn up to general meetings, preferring normally
to vote by proxy&#151;by post&#151;before the meeting. That means
that the aggrieved director would be reading out his representations to
a meeting where most of the people had already voted, if there were
many people in the room at
all.</div><a name="06070724000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems
unfair, and the amendment attempts to right the wrong by stating that
in such circumstances the director should have the right to prevent a
vote from being taken at a meeting and to have the meeting adjourned
until such time as his submissions have been circulated to the
membership, which would not be earlier than 14 days after
circulation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 520</div><a name="06070724000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord McKenzie said in the Lords
that that was not relevant as that provision was not much used in
practice. That response is inadequate. I have said why I think that the
previous practice is not an indicator of what is likely to happen. Lord
McKenzie also said that the amendment could be used as a delaying
tactic. I am not sure I understand that, and I would be grateful if the
Minister explained what he was getting
at.</div><a name="06070724000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider the
balance in terms of rights to get rid of directors and
directors&#146; rights to defend themselves not quite struck. The
amendment would address the
imbalance.</div><a name="06070724000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070724000590"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b>: I have some sympathy with the amendment, but
there is a slight difficulty with it on which I would appreciate
comment from the hon. Gentleman&#151;the power it would grant to the
agreed director who asked for an adjournment would come in not only
when the company had been in default in failing to circulate the
director&#146;s case, but when the documentation had merely arrived
too late.</div><a name="06070724000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">My slight
worry is that such lateness in arrival might, in certain circumstances,
be the fault of that director. For example, that person might fail,
perhaps deliberately, to put enough stamps on an envelope to ensure
that it arrived too late. That is an example of a delaying tactic that
might be used.</div> <a name="06070724000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully agree with the idea of allowing an adjournment when it is the
company&#146;s fault that the information has not been circulated,
but not in other circumstances. While I am on clause 155, may I make a
small clause stand part point, which has been irritating me ever since
I read the clause? The clause is entitled, &#147;Director&#146;s
right to protest removal&#148;. That is not English; it is American.
It should read, &#147;Director&#146;s right to protest against
removal&#148;. At some point, can that be
changed?</div><a name="06070724000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000591"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000592"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I have listened to the hon. Member for Huntingdon
and I have read the Lords debate. I have to say that I am not persuaded
by his arguments in this instance. We have just heard from the hon.
Member for Cambridge that lawyers are the best people at thinking up
delaying tactics. Whether it is putting second-class stamps on letters
or putting No. 11 Downing street instead of No.
10&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Or the other way round. One can think
of endless delaying tactics that might be employed by people wishing so
to do.</div><a name="06070724000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Lord
McKenzie said in the House of Lords, there are safeguards. This is a
power that, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon has accepted, by its very
existence acts an incentive for such issues to be settled outside a
meeting of shareholders. The director has the right to be heard orally
or to have his or her representations read out at the meeting, if he or
she cannot be there. The clause should stand as it is, although as an
aside to the hon. Member for Cambridge, as I hate Americanisms too, I
shall look into the matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000593"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Member for Cambridge makes a fair point
about documents arriving too late. If the delay was the fault of the
director or if there was evasive action on their part, we would
contemplate changing the drafting of the amendment to accommodate that,
so that it would not apply in such
circumstances.</div><a name="06070724000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000594"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman must recognise that once that
point is conceded, one ends up with such a complicated procedure that
it is a nightmare to administer, with all sorts of people challenging
aspects of it in
litigation.</div><a name="06070724000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000595"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is not the case at all. The procedure could
be kept pretty straightforward. The Minister does not appreciate the
reality of the situation, in that there will normally be a
huge disparity of firepower between the director and the institutional
investors. The delaying tactics that the director is likely to use are
probably less than those that an aggressive shareholder could use. The
firepower of the aggressive hedge fund that takes a stake in the
company but then wants to sack the whole board and put its own people
in place will be a lot greater, in terms of spending power and having
PR people on board, than that of the average director. The purpose of
the amendment is to address that
disparity.</div><a name="06070724000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000596"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I accept the picture that the hon. Gentleman paints
of the situation that could arise, but I am not sure that his mechanism
would in any way alter it. Nothing that he has suggested would militate
against a majority of shareholders passing a resolution to sack a
director, which would happen
anyway.</div><a name="06070724000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000597"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am certainly not trying to stop the enshrined
right of members to get rid of directors&#151;quite the opposite, as
I thoroughly approve of it. At the same time, however, the director who
is under attack must have the right to defend him or
herself.</div>
<a name="06070724000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000598"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the question
is one of fairness? In the issue of default, if a company has either
deliberately or negligently failed to send out a statement, there
should be at least some protection for the director in the
circumstances that he has described, given that shareholders might not
turn up to a general meeting, because the facts will have been
presented to them in a particular way, which could be corrected by a
statement. That goes to the fundamental issue of fairness, which he is
trying to
address.</div><a name="06070724000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000599"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000619"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000620"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 10, chapter 2,
&#147;General duties of directors&#148;. These amendments are more
technical in nature than the next group under the clause, which will
enable more of a stand part debate. They have been suggested by the Law
Society. Lord Freeman proposed an amendment to remove from subsection
(2) the statement that clauses 161 and 162 should apply to a former
director in the same way as to a current director. Lord Goldsmith
responded that the clause was valuable as it would inform directors of
their liability and allow the courts to adapt the provisions to the
fact that former directors are no longer serving in that role. With
respect to the Attorney-General, I cannot see how that will make things
clearer or how it will not lead to a lot of court cases requiring
interpretation. The deletion of the last two lines of subsection (2),
as proposed by amendment No. 160, would cut out repetition and reduce
the room for conflicting
interpretations.</div><a name="06070724000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 164, I note a briefing included in the June issue of
<i class="I">PLC Magazine</i>, which states:</div>
<a name="06070724000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clauses 156 to 163
codify directors&#146; duties by introducing a statutory statement of
duties that will replace existing common law and equitable rules. The
codified duties will apply to all the directors of a company, including
shadow directors. However, as shadow directors are not in the same
position as actual directors, the application of the duties to shadow
directors apply only to the extent that the corresponding common-law
rules or equitable principles so
apply.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
their explanatory notes, the Government state that clause 156(5) means
that</div><a name="06070724000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where a common law
rule or equitable principle currently applies to a shadow director, the
statutory duty replacing that common law rule or equitable principle
will apply to the shadow 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 523</div>director (in place of that rule or principle). Where the rule or
principle does not apply to a shadow director, the statutory duty
replacing that rule will not apply
either.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members can
see from that short explanation that this is a complicated matter. The
Attorney-General accepted in the other place that the law on the duties
of shadow directors is uncertain and should be allowed to develop. How
he jumped from saying that, which to my mind acknowledges that the
matter is best left to common law, to saying that there should be
codification, I still do not understand. The traditional view, which
the Law Society believes correct, is that duties do not apply to shadow
directors. Subsection (5) crystallises the uncertainty, and any
prospect of the law being developed by the courts could therefore be
ruined. Perhaps the Solicitor-General could elaborate further on the
Government&#146;s
position.</div><a name="06070724000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070724000621"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): I wish to
follow up what my hon. Friend has said, as I too was somewhat perplexed
by the clause, which implies that the duties of directors are those
that are already established in common law and therefore in the
jurisprudence. That seems to contradict the purpose of clause 158, to
which we will come shortly, which defines in statute the principles on
which the duties of directors are based and to which directors must
have regard in the performance of their duties and
responsibilities.</div><a name="06070724000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
explained on Second Reading, there is unfortunately a difference
between my hon. Friends and me on this subject. I believe that the Bill
is a definite improvement and reform of the law. We have taken the word
&#147;reform&#148; out of its title today, and rightly so. However,
we want to feel that we are reforming and improving the law, and I
believe that it is definitely reformed and improved by removing the
area of legal doubt that exists at present and replacing the vague
reliance on common law with statutory rules for
directors.</div><a name="06070724000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
the case, why does the Bill state in clause 156(5) that the rules of
common law apply? I am particularly mystified by subsection (3), which
states:</div><a name="06070724000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
general duties are based on certain common law rules and equitable
principles as they apply in relation to directors and have effect in
place of those rules and principles as regards the duties owed to a
company by a
director.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000622"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman, but I believe that he is directing his remarks to the next
group of amendments, to which we will in due course come but on which
he cannot expatiate
now.</div><a name="06070724000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000623"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am sure that you are right about that, Mr.
Bercow. I may attempt to catch your eye
later.</div><a name="06070724000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000624"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Amendment No. 164 raises an important point and
shows how difficult it is to draft statutory clauses that are meant to
facilitate the interaction between statute law and common law. I would
like the Solicitor-General&#146;s comment on one aspect of the
clause. As I mentioned earlier, my view on the whole is that the law
should not encourage the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 524</div>relationship of shadow director to a company, because of the problems
that it causes with transparency and the extra difficulties for people
who are dealing with the
company.</div><a name="06070724000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that arises concerns the intention of subsection (5). Is it to freeze
the law as it is now in respect of applying directors&#146; duties to
shadow directors? On one reading, it is, as the present tense is used.
The clause states
that</div><a name="06070724000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the corresponding
common law rules or equitable principles so
apply&#148;,</div><a name="06070724000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">which seems to
imply that it is how the law works now rather than how it might develop
in future. I do not know how it will develop in future. It might
develop in a direction that I would wish, or in one that the hon.
Member for Huntingdon might wish, but I would not like to exclude any
development in either
direction.</div><a name="06070724000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000625"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the
aim is to ensure that the law can continue to develop. There is some
imprecision about the present law, particularly in the area of shadow
directors. We touched on that in reference to a couple of cases. We are
seeking to enable the common law and equitable principles to be
included so that the courts can apply them and ensure that they are
able to develop in future as circumstances change, and that the case
law that has applied until now can continue to apply. We certainly are
not setting anything in
stone.</div><a name="06070724000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
160 applies to former directors and amendment No. 164 to shadow
directors. I shall deal with former directors first. The amendment
would remove a useful sentence that explains how the two general duties
will apply to former directors. Essentially, those two general duties,
as set out in subsections (2)(a) and (b), will apply to former
directors as they do to current ones. Those duties are:</div>
<a name="06070724000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to avoid conflicts of
interest&#148;</div><a name="06070724000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="06070724000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
to accept benefits from a third
party&#148;.</div><a name="06070724000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, those
duties apply in the same way as they do to directors, but only in
respect of the matters listed in subsection (2). So a former director
remains under a duty to avoid conflicts of interest, but in relation
only to the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity of
which he became aware when he was a
director.</div><a name="06070724000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The former
director will be able to take advantage of all the exceptions set out
in clause 161 so that the duty is not infringed if the matter has been
authorised or</div><a name="06070724000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the
situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a
conflict of interest&#148;.</div>
<a name="06070724000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, the duty not to accept benefits
from third parties continues to apply to former directors</div>
<a name="06070724000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as regards things done or omitted
by him before he ceased to be a director.&#148;</div>
<a name="06070724000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that duty does not continue to
apply to former directors in respect of benefits conferred because the
person was once a director of a company. That way, legitimate benefits,
such as a pension payment, are not caught. Of course, former directors
may be held liable for breaches of any of the general duties committed
when they were directors.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 525</div><a name="06070724000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hope that those rules will
enable us to preserve some of the flexibility that the courts currently
have to take into account the fact that duties are applied to people
who are no longer directors of a company. The courts need to preserve
flexibility when they interpret and apply those duties and should not
be constrained to apply the general duties to former directors in
exactly the same way as to those currently serving as directors. There
is therefore an element of adaptability in the way in which those
various duties can
apply.</div><a name="06070724000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">A former
director is in a different position. For example, he might not be
attending board meetings and so will not be up to date or have access
to the books and records of the company. The courts might wish to apply
the duties in a way that acknowledges that a former director does not
have the same powers as a director or the same access to information
and knowledge about the affairs of the company, particularly the
current and future affairs, which might have been planned and discussed
at board meetings. So that part of the clause contains an element of
adaptability. The
words</div><a name="06070724000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to any
necessary adaptations&#148;</div>
<a name="06070724000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">ensure that the courts are able to look
at the circumstances of each
case.</div><a name="06070724000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall turn now
to amendment No. 164, which deals with the general duties applied to
shadow directors. The amendment deals with an area in which the law is
less than clear, as I have indicated already. We have mentioned in
passing the Ultraframe and Yukong Line cases. One or two cases were
thought to support the view that some of the general duties apply to
shadow directors, but a more recent case&#151;the Ultraframe
case&#151;suggests that that might not be so, or that under certain
circumstances a person might not be aware that they should be complying
with the provisions when they act as a shadow
director.</div><a name="06070724000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
case indicates that the fiduciary duties might not also apply to shadow
directors. It is not yet clear whether that was always the case;
sometimes the law says that things were always the case, even though
they have changed. The duties or at least some of them may apply to
some shadow directors, depending on the
circumstances.</div>
<a name="06070724000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="06070724000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting that
the law is unclear on this subject, the Government have a choice. Do we
say, &#147;The common law rules and equitable principles apply to
shadow directors, and that should be replaced by an entirely new set of
statutory obligations.&#148;? We have taken the view that,
particularly in this case, we will allow the common law and equitable
principles to develop, and the courts can consider particular
circumstances. It is very rare in practice for such cases to come
before the courts, and we are not going to jump in and try to impose a
view.</div><a name="06070724000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that
background, subsection (5) is not designed to resolve the uncertainty
surrounding the application of the common law rules and equitable
principles to shadow directors. In our view, it is right to leave this
undeveloped area of law to the courts, at least until such time as a
body of law becomes established, which may then be suitable for
codification.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 526</div><a name="06070724000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5) is designed to
allow the law in this area to develop. It does not set the current
uncertainty in stone, as I said to the hon. Member for Cambridge. In
determining whether the general duties should apply to shadow
directors, the courts may take into account not only existing case law
on the application of the common law rules and equitable principles,
but any future cases in this
area.</div><a name="06070724000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5)
is intended to be broadly neutral, but if it were absent from the Bill,
as the amendment suggests, there would be greater uncertainties. To the
extent that the common law rules and equitable principles apply to
shadow directors, it would become unclear whether they were to continue
to apply or whether the general duties were to apply in their
place.</div><a name="06070724000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although there
is a lack of clarity at the moment, not including this subsection would
produce greater uncertainty. Including it shows the direction in which
Parliament wishes the courts to go: applying the developing common law
rules and equitable principles as they do now into the future. I hope
that, on that basis, the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="06070724000279"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000626"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On amendment No. 160, I hear what the Minister
says. I still think that the wording in the Bill is otiose and that the
phrase</div><a name="06070724000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to any
necessary
adaptations&#148;</div><a name="06070724000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">might be
confusing, but it is not necessarily damaging, so I will not take that
amendment any
further.</div><a name="06070724000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 164, the more I hear of this application of law for shadow
directors, the more doubtful I become as to the provisions of the
clause. The Solicitor-General says that the law continues to develop,
but the fact remains that many people argue that these provisions are
stopping it developing as it should, rather than being neutral, as he
suggested.</div><a name="06070724000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
agree that the law in this area will develop and I think that we all
agree that none of us knows exactly how it will develop, so why not let
it develop under the common law, as it is happily doing at the moment?
That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and
Stamford (Mr. Davies), who veered slightly into another debate, but I
feel&#151;apologies,Mr. Bercow&#151;that his core point is
relevant to this
debate.</div><a name="06070724000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000627"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I do have a serious point on this issue and I
wonder whether my hon. Friend can help me. I understand that he does
not really approve of clause 158 and we will reach that debate in due
time, but supposing that clause 158 is adopted by the House and becomes
part of the law, does he not agree that if there are statutory duties,
they should apply equally to shadow directors as to directors who are
not shadow
directors?</div><a name="06070724000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
separate regimes would not make sense, as the purpose of the Bill is to
ensure that shadow directors face the same obligations as real
directors and that making oneself a shadow director rather than getting
oneself elected to the board if one controls a company is not a way to
avoid those
obligations.</div><a name="06070724000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000628"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, which
we discussed in the previous debate. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 527</div>The issue is the extent to which shadow directors are similar to real
directors. There seem to be different interpretations of that point,
which put them into a different category from normal directors.
However, he makes a fair point. His description of our position on
clause 158 was not quite right, but I will save that for the debate on
that clause. I have concerns about the amendment, which has not been
fully thought
through.</div><a name="06070724000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000629"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If this offers further reassurance to
the hon. Gentleman, we have been looking at this. Companies Acts have
developed in such a way that where rules are to apply to shadow
directors, it is stated that they shall so apply. If we removed that
and allowed the common law to develop without any reference in the
statute, it would be contrary to how things have been done in the
past.</div><a name="06070724000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts might
take judicial notice of that, and they may well conclude that there was
therefore an intention that Parliament should not apply those rules to
shadow directors. If we did not have this provision, which would be
removed by amendment No. 164, we would risk creating greater
uncertainty. The hon. Gentleman and I both intend much the same thing.
We want to allow the common law and equitable principles to develop,
but if we do not refer to it, the courts may well be put in a position
of great
uncertainty.</div><a name="06070724000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000630"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General is correct; we both want
the common law to develop the principle. The question is whether tying
it down in this way will hinder that. I have my doubts. However, he put
his case eloquently and it deserves further thought from our side. We
may well come back to this on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06070724000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000632"></a>The

following amendments:</div>
<a name="06070724000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 162, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000633"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to a different aspect of the clause.
These amendments are probing, so this will be more like a stand part
debate.</div><a name="06070724000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now enter
the grey area of directors&#146; duties. The more I look at these
provisions in the round, and the more that everyone else looks at them,
the murkier they seem. In Grand Committee in the Lords, Lord Freeman
set out the Opposition&#146;s general philosophy succinctly, and we
shall be taking the same line. He
said:</div><a name="06070724000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
total agreement on these Benches to the proposition that directors of a
successful company&#151;and, hence, successful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 528</div>for the shareholders&#151;should take into account the long term. You
cannot plan a successful company by looking at short-term gain and
short-term popularity, be it on the stock market or in the eyes of
members of the company. There is also total agreement that good
directors and good boards should take into account the interests of
employees, customers and the environment, and it goes without saying
that conflicts of interest must be guarded against and prevented. So
there is agreement on this side of the Committee on the general
approach.</div> <a name="06070724000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">How those
aspirations are framed in statute is extremely important. We are moving
on from a system of self-regulation in a free capital
market&#151;which is absolutely vital&#151;to one where the duties
of directors are sought to be laid out in a very precise form. Noble
Lords on this side of the Committee will argue that three important
tests must be met and we are testing the language of the Bill against
those three tests. They are not exclusive, but they are important. The
first is: does the Bill increase the prospect of vexatious litigation?
Secondly, do the provisions increase boardroom uncertainties to the
extent that too much time is wasted and too much bureaucracy is
involved in the interpretation of the law? Finally, do these provisions
decrease the flow of talent to all companies, whether public or
private, large or small?</div>
<a name="06070724000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">These perfectly legitimate
concerns have been presented to us&#151;and, I am sure, to other
noble Lords&#151;by the Confederation of British Industry, the
Institute of Directors, the Association of British Insurers, the Law
Society, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
and many others. We have to be careful. It is our duty to ensure that
the language of the Bill&#151;which, I hope, when amended, will
become an Act&#151;will establish a corporate law which is discharged
by directors of companies in the most efficient and fair manner. We do
not wish to jeopardise the great virtues of an efficient capital
market, which rewards entrepreneurship and success and penalises
failure.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6
February 2006;Vol. 678, c.

put.</div><a name="06070724000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">To start the ball
rolling, I shall give the views on subsections (3) and (4) of Patrick
Mitchell and Carl Powlson, of the City law firm Herbert
Smith:</div><a name="06070724000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
sections appear to us to be fundamentally inconsistent. On the one hand
section 156(3) states that the general duties are to have effect
&#145;in place of&#146; the relevant common law rules and equitable
principles. On the other hand, section 156(4) states that the new
codified duties should be interpreted and applied having regard to the
pre-existing common law rules and equitable principles. This, coupled
with the fact that the codified duties are phrased using different
terminology to the existing common law directors&#146; duties, means
that there is uncertainty as to the extent to which the new duties
replicate, replace, or apply in addition to the pre-existing common law
directors&#146; duties, or whether they are to apply in conjunction
with them. In reality therefore, it is perhaps difficult to see how the
codified duties will be more accessible or comprehensible (indeed
arguably they could prove to be more uncertain and more
complex).&#148;</div><a name="06070724000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
one way or another, we will be speaking about this matter for a very
long time, but I think that that comment is a good start. It succinctly
puts across one of the core problems with clause 156, and indeed with
later clauses in this part. The duties are to be based on common law
rules and equitable principles, which will
be</div><a name="06070724000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;interpreted and
applied in the same
way&#148;.</div><a name="06070724000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
amendments Nos. 159, 161 and 162, the Law Society has recommended
amending subsection (3), which it believes is confusing as it implies
that common law rules and principles will apply even after the Bill
comes into force, despite its then saying that the general duties in
chapter 2 will replace those rules and principles.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 529</div><a name="06070724000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">A briefing note by the
<i class="I">Solicitors&#146; Journal</i> develops the point further by noting
that the courts will still have to have regard to existing case law,
which will inevitably have to be developed in the future. That clearly
indicates that the duties in chapter 2 are not comprehensive and
exhaustive, but are either a starting point or a staging post,
depending on one&#146;s point of view.</div>
<a name="06070724000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for amendment No. 163, the
Law Society has recommended omitting subsection (4) as not all the
duties have a corresponding rule or principle, as shown, for example,
in clauses 162 and 163. In some cases, the new statutory duty is
clearly based on a particular rule or principle, yet the wording has
been changed so that the duty is different, as shown, for example, in
clauses 159 and 161. In such cases, it is hard to see how subsection
(4) could be used.</div><a name="06070724000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are probing, as we want to enable the Government to explain
their position. We still do not think this is the right way to go about
things in relation to the clause. This has been constantly shifting and
uneven ground before the Bill was published, when it was published and
during consideration in the Lords. As the Minister will have seen from
the vast majority of the many expert briefings produced following those
debates in the other place, we have not yet reached the position we
want on these proposals, and I look forward to hearing his
views.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000634"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend went over some of the ground that I
was going to cover. In fact, I was about to go over it when you rightly
pointed out that I had mixed up two sets of amendments, Mr. Bercow.
That is a terrible offence, and I am sorry about it. The mischief is a
matter of apparent contradiction of
text.</div><a name="06070724000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)
speaks of the new rules, which we will come to in clause 158, as
having</div> <a name="06070724000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;effect in place
of those
rules&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06070724000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is to
say, the common law rules. However, subsection (4) refers to exactly
the same general duties that are about to be enunciated in Bill, as
against the existing common law, and says that in interpreting those
general duties</div><a name="06070724000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regard
shall be had to the corresponding common law
rules&#148;.</div><a name="06070724000484"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06070724000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">By my reading,
those two phrases are contradictory in the guidance they give to the
public, the citizen, directors and, potentially, the courts. The
phrase</div><a name="06070724000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have effect in
place of&#148;</div> <a name="06070724000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">surely means
that we are drawing a line and saying that the courts should ignore
what has gone before&#151;the common law and the
jurisprudence&#151;and start again, with clause 158. That is how I
interpret those words. To have effect in place of something else means
that the effect of the something else is abolished and we are starting
from scratch, with what we are setting out. However, the sentence in
subsection
(4)&#151;</div><a name="06070724000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regard shall
be had to the corresponding common law
rules&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06070724000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">means
exactly the reverse. It means that, in interpreting the new rules, we
can look back at the old ones.</div>
<a name="06070724000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, under
subsection (3) it would not be possible to pray in aid the previous
jurisprudence when doubts might arise over the interpretation of the
new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 530</div>general principles that we are about to enunciate. However, in blatant
contradiction to that, the courts are told in subsection (4) that it is
indeed possible to pray in aid the previous jurisprudence. That is just
bad drafting. It might be that I am particularly stupid and that no
other human being will ever be confused by that wording, although I
have some doubts about that, as others could fall into that trap. It is
dangerous for Parliament to send ambiguous signals of that
kind.</div><a name="06070724000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course we all
hope that clause 158 is drafted in such a way as to make the new
general principles as unambiguous as possible&#151;that, in my view,
is the purpose of having the new statutory principles&#151;and to
remove to the greatest extent possible the scope for legal uncertainty
of that kind and, therefore, for legal costs and everything that flows
from that. That is our hope, but there will always be an area of
doubt&#151;there always is in human affairs. We can be certain that
somebody will wish to litigate on some aspect of the legislation, so it
is very important indeed that the general framework that the clause
establishes for clause 158 should be in no way ambiguous. I fear that
the clause might be worse than ambiguous, however; it might actually be
contradictory.</div><a name="06070724000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000635"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. There is a
difficulty. The clause appears to contain a contradiction, saying on
the one hand that we are passing new duties in place of the law, and on
the other hand by saying that we can refer back to the pre-existing law
in interpreting those duties. There is an added complication in that
lawyers tend to think of the common law as still existing in some
ghostly way even if a statute has been introduced in that area, so that
if that statute were repealed, the common law would spring forth anew.
Some people might even think that the common law has developed in the
period between the statute coming into existence and being
repealed.</div><a name="06070724000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000636"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> What the hon. Gentleman, as a distinguished
professor in law, is saying is that some lawyers do not think that
Parliament ought to exist at all. They think that whatever Parliament
does they can safely ignore it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is with
us in saying that that is not the case and certainly should not be
so.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000637"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The relationship between this place and the
courts has always been complex. There was an idea among judges for
centuries that, as they used to say, statutes in derogation of the
common law should be construed strictly; in other words, they would do
what we said, but only to the minimal level to which they were
required.</div> <a name="06070724000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether it would be possible to state what clauses 156 and 158 are
trying to
do.</div><a name="06070724000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000638"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It might be useful if the hon.
Gentleman let us have his view on how duties may flow from common law
and equitable principles and then be enshrined in statute using the
case law from those common law and equitable principles in the
interpretation of that statute. If that is the case, it is clear that
the new duties, as set out in a statute, might have effect &#147;in
place of&#148;; however, it is equally 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 531</div>consistent that in interpreting those general duties a court
&#147;shall have regard to&#148; the case law that precedes
it.</div><a name="06070724000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000639"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Solicitor-General anticipates, in part, a
possible interpretation of the subsections that I was about to propose.
It was clear throughout the company law review, and in the Law
Commission&#146;s report on the same matters, that the statutory
statement of directors&#146; duties was intended to reflect a refined
version of where case law has got to. Because part of our intention in
passing the statute is to put into statutory form what already exists
in some other form in case law, it would be legitimate to refer back to
existing case law, because that would tend to clarify, rather than make
more confusing, what we are doing. That is consistent with what the
Solicitor-General said. Because the origin of many of the duties in the
statute is in common law, being able to refer back to those common law
principles and cases would make the statute clearer, rather than less
clear.</div><a name="06070724000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, another intention of the statute is to clear up particular areas
of case law where there is ambiguity, difficulty and confusion.
Eventually, we will get to clause 222 on ratification, which is a
notorious area of difficulty and confusion in the law. In that clause,
as in some of the clauses that we are about to consider, there is an
element of clearing up existing problems. Presumably, in those
cases&#151;I advance this as a possible interpretation&#151;the
Government intend, and are asking Parliament to intend, that it should
not be right for judges to go back to those old cases and so reproduce
all over again the difficulties that Parliament intended to resolve. We
therefore have a two-stage effect: in the first stage, we move from
case law to statute; in stage two, we can refer back to case law, at
least where it helps to clarify, but not where the effect would be in
the opposite direction.</div>
<a name="06070724000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000640"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful to the
Committee and is offering an interpretation that may or may not be
consistent with the text before us, but does he not agree that there is
a real problem, given that the text before us goes along one of the
routes that he describes in subsection (3), but says exactly the
opposite in subsection
(4)?</div><a name="06070724000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000641"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates my next remark
perfectly. If I have given a correct, or nearly correct, version of
what the Government intend, the remaining question is how that fits
with the wording of subsections (3) and (4). Will the Solicitor-General
explain how the intention of Government&#151;and Parliament&#151;to
do that very thing would be realised by the wording before us? The hon.
Member for Grantham and Stamford makes the important point that, on the
face of it, the subsections do not allow that to
happen.</div><a name="06070724000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000642"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> To deal with the point raised by the
hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Cambridge, our intention
is that the principles and duties that apply to directors will flow
from the common law and equitable principles and that they will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 532</div>be set out clearly in statute so that a member of the public wishing to
know what they are will be able to see them. However, because many of
those duties have flowed from the common law and equitable principles
and there is case law, when interpreting those duties it will be
appropriate, where applicable, for the courts to have regard to that
pre-existing case law.</div>
<a name="06070724000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is therefore right, and
properly drafted in subsection (3), that the duties
will</div><a name="06070724000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have effect in
place of&#148;</div><a name="06070724000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">the existing
principles. That is the correct wording, which means mean that the
duties will have effect in place of some general duties that were
framed in various cases. We are bringing those duties together and
codifying them so that everyone can clearly see them without having to
refer back to a bundle of cases. However, when in due course the courts
arbitrate a dispute between people about how the duties should be
applied, as subsection (4) states, they will be able to have regard to
previous case law where applicable.</div>
<a name="06070724000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no problem with the
drafting. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is agitated by it,
but I do not think that a judge will be. A judge will know exactly
where we are coming from.</div>
<a name="06070724000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments provide a good
opportunity to look at broader circumstances and issues. The Law
Commission noted in its report on formulating a statement of duties
that the general duties of directors
are</div><a name="06070724000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fundamental to the
relationship between a director and his
company&#148;.</div><a name="06070724000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree, and
we welcome the detailed scrutiny that the clauses had in another
place.</div> <a name="06070724000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well
help if I provide a short history so that the Committee knows where the
proposals have come from. It is only fair to say that from the 1920s
onwards there have been differing views on the desirability of setting
out in statute any general statement of directors&#146; duties.
Members who wish to know more about the historical background will no
doubt be delighted with the helpful summary in part 13 of the Law
Commission&#146;s joint consultation paper entitled &#147;Company
Directors: Regulating Conflicts of Interests and Formulating a
Statement of Duties&#148;&#151;and fascinating stuff they will find
it.</div> <a name="06070724000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Back in 1926 the
Greene committee suggested:</div>
<a name="06070724000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To attempt by statute
to define the duties of directors would be a hopeless
task.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Cohen
committee made recommendations in 1945 on the financial relations
between companies and directors, but expressed no view on
directors&#146; duties. In 1962 the Jenkins committee recommended a
non-exhaustive statement of the basic principles underlying the
fiduciary duties which a director owed to his company. That
recommendation was to have been implemented by clause 52 of the
Companies Bill of 1973, but it got lost in the changes caused by the
1974 general
election.</div><a name="06070724000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Labour
Government&#146;s Companies Bill of 1978 contained a longer statement
of directors&#146; fiduciary duties and provided that it would take
effect in place of any other rule of law stating those duties, although
without prejudice to any remedies available for a breach of duties. The
Bill fell at the 1979 election and was reintroduced by the incoming
Government at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 533</div>end of 1979 without the statement of general fiduciary duties. Meanwhile
other common law jurisdictions, such as Australia and New Zealand,
proceeded with a partial codification of duties. In 1997 the Government
asked the Law Commission to consider the case for statutory statements
of duties owed by directors to their companies under the general law,
including their fiduciary duties and duty of
care.</div><a name="06070724000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="06070724000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its report
the Law Commission recommended that there should be a statutory
statement of a director&#146;s main fiduciary duties and his duty of
care and skill. The company law review supported the Law
Commission&#146;s recommendation that there should be a legislative
restatement of directors&#146; general duties, although it was
doubtful about the case for leaving the field open to judges for
development of new general principles. Instead, the company law review
recommended that the restatement be treated as exhaustive. It set out a
trial draft statutory statement of directors&#146; duties in its
consultation document, &#147;Modern Company Law for a Competitive
Economy&#151;Developing the Framework&#148;, and a revised
statement of directors&#146; general duties appeared in its final
report. </div><a name="06070724000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
statement was intended to reflect the current state of the fiduciary
duties in common law. Other parts of the statement were intended to
make changes to the law. In July 2002 the White Paper
&#147;Modernising Company Law&#148; agreed that directors&#146;
general duties to the company should be codified in statute, largely as
proposed by the company law review, but without the inclusion of any
duties in relation to creditors. A revised version of the statement was
published in March 2005 in the Government White Paper on company law
reform. The latest version containing some revisions now appears in the
Bill.</div><a name="06070724000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
useful, given the points raised by the hon. Members for Huntingdon and
for Cambridge, if I explain why the Government believe that there are
arguments for a clear codification of the duties. I should like to
explain why I believe that the Law Commission and the company law
review were right to recommend that there should be that statutory
statement of duties.</div>
<a name="06070724000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Commission noted that
the law in this area should</div>
<a name="06070724000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aim to educate and inform
directors and not merely impose liabilities on
them&#148;.</div><a name="06070724000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">This area of law
is therefore important. It ought to be accessible; it ought to be
comprehensible; and it ought to be clear to directors and advisors. The
singular benefit of codifying is that there is no longer a need to roam
over the vast array of authorities in order to discover what the law
really is and to carry out a textual analysis of what the judge really
meant. It is important that directors can see what their main duties
are. Directors&#146; general duties lie at the heart of company law
and it is simply not acceptable that they are treated as some sort of
arcane law, accessible only to specialist lawyers who know the case
law. That is the main reason why codification is
necessary.</div><a name="06070724000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000643"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Solicitor-General is making an excellent case
for subsection (3). The trouble is that he seems to be making a case
against subsection (4).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 534</div><a name="06070724000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000644"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I cannot see how on earth that is the
case. I have said right from the beginning that our objective is to use
the law as it has developed to inform us as we set out the duties, so
that directors know when they begin their job what those duties and
obligations are. Then, when it comes to a dispute, the courts can look
at the duties and inform themselves from subsection (4) about previous
case law and how it applied to those duties. They will thus be better
informed about how they can resolve the
dispute.</div><a name="06070724000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
expect the average director who is not a lawyer to be particularly
interested in subsection (4). He will want to go to the later clause
and ensure that he knows what those duties are. If he is a former
director or a shadow director, the provisions will obviously apply to
him too. Subsection (4) gives judges the ability to say that Parliament
wants them to look at case law, where it applies to the general duties
set out in statute, and to use that case law to inform how they
interpret the issues in dispute before them.</div>
<a name="06070724000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is perfectly straightforward
and simple. In practice, it may be perfectly simple for a judge, but
that does not necessarily mean&#151;and nor need it mean&#151;that
it is perfectly simply for the layman. As far as the layman is
concerned, the lay director needs to know what his general duties are
and to whom he owes them. That is what we are setting out in statute.
If they have a problem with that and an argument or a dispute arises,
can they go to a judge and can their lawyer advise them about what the
judge is likely to do about it? My lawyer can go to the case law and
say, &#147;Well, this case law applied to that duty, so looking at
the way in which the case law developed in recent decades I suggest
that the judge is likely to do
this.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000645"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In practice, people will not read the provisions
and then go to their solicitor to hear about case law. They will still
have to go to counsel, as they always had
to.</div><a name="06070724000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000646"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The former will be the case if a
dispute arises. We are doing two separate things. First, we are
ensuring that the lay director is able to know what his duties are.
Secondly, if there is a dispute within the company about those duties
and how he or someone else on the board interpreted them, that dispute
can be resolved by the courts or is likely to be resolved by the
courts. It may well be that because previous case law is not entirely
clear on a particular point the matter will have to go to court and new
case law will have to develop. However, in developing that new case
law, previous case law may be used to inform it. Subsection (4) makes
it clear that that previous case law can be used and that a judge can
have regard to it when seeking to resolve the
issues.</div><a name="06070724000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000647"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I understand what the Solicitor-General is
saying. The difficulty is that the clause does not distinguish between
those bits of case law that are legitimate to use under the Bill and
those parts that are not. There is nothing in the Bill that says which
parts of the law are being reformed. For example, in existing case law
some cases make a distinction between a disability and a duty.
Consequences flow in different ways from disabilities and from duties.
As drafted, the provision makes no reference to the concept of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column534" />Column number: 535</div>disability; it is all about duty. There is no concept of a director not
being able to produce a certain legal effect. It is all about having a
duty not to act in a particular way or to act in a particular way. The
problem is that, as it stands, the clause does not refer to that
particular reform&#151;and it is a reform&#151;so it is unclear
whether case law should or should not be referred
to.</div><a name="06070724000343"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000648"></a>The

that might come before the courts. It tells the judge that when looking

various issues that we shall come to in due course, some of the issues
will have case law attached to them and some will not, or some will
have case law that deals with a specific aspect but not all of it.

common law rules or equitable principles, and regard shall be had to
the corresponding common law rules and equitable principles in
interpreting and applying the general
duties.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the judge
knows that, where it is relevant, he can go back and look at the case
law and apply it. It will not always be applicable and the choice is
whether we go through the background of the case law and somehow try to
squeeze it into a clause that states what the judge has, and has not,
to have regard to&#151;but we are not doing that. We are saying that,
by and large, judges are sensible people&#151;note that I include a
caveat, as all good lawyers do&#151;and able to look at the case law
and determine what is, and is not, applicable. That is a perfectly
sensible approach.</div><a name="06070724000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the process of codifying directors&#146; duties, we have always been
intent on setting out a clear list so that directors will know what
their job is, what their duties are and what they are supposed to be
about. If they read the statutory statement, they should know where
their obligations lie. When a dispute arises, they can go to the
courts, as they normally would. We are not trying to rewrite everything
or, as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford fears, starting from
year zero. We are not trying to do that. Subsection (4) makes that
clear, which is why it is important that it remains in the
Bill.</div><a name="06070724000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principal
argument against codification is that there might be a lack of
flexibility. That is why, in line with the Law Commission&#146;s
recommendations, we sought to draft the various duties in broad and
general language. We also chose not to attempt codification in areas
that are not clearly settled, such as the duties that may exist towards
creditors in the run-up but before the onset of insolvency. We have not
sought to create new law in respect of such
issues.</div><a name="06070724000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second
argument against codification is that the statement could lead to
uncertainty about the extent of the duties&#151;hence we are using
subsection (4) to inform the courts and ensure that we do not get
unnecessary uncertainty. There will always be some uncertainty, as the
duties must be developed in the future, but we are helping judges and
directors to know what their main duties are and then giving them the
right to refer to the case law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 536</div><a name="06070724000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3) explains the
origin of the general duties set out in the statutory statement. It
tells the courts that each general duty is derived from an existing
common law or equitable principle and that the statutory statement
replaces the common law or equitable principle. It makes it clear that
the statutory statement does not create new duties in addition to those
that exist under the common law. Instead, any common law rule or
equitable principle applying to directors and covering the same subject
matter is replaced by the statutory
statement.</div><a name="06070724000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
deletion of subsection (3) would remove that useful information from
the Bill. In particular, deleting the second half of the subsection, as
amendment No. 159 proposes, would risk making directors subject to two
overlapping regimes&#151;one under the common law and one under
statute&#151;thereby creating additional burdens on directors. That
would lead to complete confusion, which is why we feel that it would be
inappropriate.</div><a name="06070724000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) directs the courts to interpret and apply the statutory statement
using common law and equitable principles. It helps to preserve the
flexibility of the courts as to how they interpret and apply the
general duties in response to the broad range of different
circumstances that may come before them. It achieves the right balance,
making a clear and accessible statement of the duty without creating
rigid rules and losing the flexibility that the courts need to develop
this area of company law. That is why the general duties are expressed
in such general terms and why subsection (4) tells the courts to treat
the duties as general
principles.</div><a name="06070724000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
should continue to refer to existing case law on the corresponding
common law rules and equitable principles, except where it is obviously
irreconcilable with the statutory statement. The rich body of case law
on and wisdom about the general duties may continue to be used. No one
would benefit from abandoning the wisdom accumulated over several
centuries&#151;we do not propose to lose
that.</div><a name="06070724000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4)
also acknowledges that the common law rules and equitable principles
applying to directors did not develop in isolation. Although it might
be said that the unique position of directors results in certain rules
derived from aspects of trust and agency law being applied to them in a
distinctive manner, the rules are still very much manifestations of
wider principles. The statutory statement replaces the common law rules
and equitable principles that apply to directors, but the rules and
principles will continue to apply to trustees, agents and other
fiduciaries.</div><a name="06070724000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06070724000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4)
enables the courts to continue to have regard to developments in the
common law and equitable principles applying to other types of
fiduciary relationships. That should enable the interpretation and
application of the statutory statement to keep in line with relevant
developments in the law as it applies
elsewhere.</div><a name="06070724000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
deletion of that subsection would therefore remove important guidance
for the courts on how the general duties are to be interpreted and
applied. It would stifle development and constrain the courts.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 537</div>I cannot believe that the hon. Member for Huntingdon would seek to
stifle and constrain the courts in that way. It would lead to a lack of
predictability, and a narrowness and inflexibility that would go
against the broad thrust of our aims, which I think people
support.</div><a name="06070724000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
162 would not improve the drafting of the Bill. The general duties are
indeed based on common law rules and equitable principles applying to
directors. Once the general duties come into force, those will no
longer apply to the directors, as subsection (3) points out&#151;the
general duties will apply in their place.</div>
<a name="06070724000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4) points the
courts towards the existing law, and those common law rules and
equitable principles, but the law must be able to continue to develop
after the duties come into force and the relevant case law should also
take them into account. Subsection (4) provides for an evolving and
flexible interpretation and application of the duties by requiring the
courts to treat the statement of general duties as if it were common
law. It also enables the courts to have regard to developments in the
common law rules and principles as they apply to other fiduciary
relationships.</div> <a name="06070724000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that we have a clear view of where we want to go. Opposition
Members are right that there is not clarity on every issue, but such
clarity is not in the law at the moment. Other than seeking to invent
it, or to impose a new version, we will be best placed by using what we
have got and codifying the directors&#146; duties to enable the
courts to use case law in order to interpret them where applicable.
That will ensure that courts can resolve easily issues that arise in
disputes between companies and within
companies.</div><a name="06070724000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that, with those observations, hon. Members will not press their
amendments to a
Division.</div><a name="06070724000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000649"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General for fully setting
out the position. It has given all parties further information with
which to consider the issue at a later stage.</div>
<a name="06070724000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall go over the debate and
pick up on the points as I heard them. First, my hon. Friend the Member
for Grantham and Stamford made an excellent contribution. We might not
agree on all aspects of this part, and that might well be the case with
later clauses, but on the matter before us we are in full agreement.
His analysis of subsections (3) and (4) was very good. He also unlocked
the door to the inconsistency in the approach of the
provisions.</div><a name="06070724000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge built on that and gave an astute analysis of the
possible complexities arising from the application of the provisions.
The Solicitor-General said that people should be able to know what
their equitable duties are and so they should be set out in the Bill. I
think that that is more of a clause 158 debate. The point is that there
are hundreds of equitable common law duties and to place just some of
them in statute would be misleading, rather than of help. However, I
shall go into that in more detail
later.</div><a name="06070724000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General said that matters would be resolved and interpreted
more easily by having such information in the Bill. It is a point of
principle for him on which he is relying. I remain of the opinion that
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 538</div>will not be the case and that arguably the position will be more, not
less, confused, unless an unnecessary degree of rigidity could be
introduced. The fact remains that there is a large and growing body of
evidence and opinion that the clause is inconsistent, will change the
law and will lead to significant revised interpretation of court cases.
Many people are saying that and I am left wondering why the Government
are not taking note of the advice that they have received. The answer
probably lies somewhere in the length of the Bill&#146;s gestation,
which over eight years means that the Government have dug themselves
into a set position.</div>
<a name="06070724000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000650"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is difficult given the concessions,
including the hard-won concession on even the title of the Bill, to say
that we have dug in on anything.</div>
<a name="06070724000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000651"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman voted for
it.</div>
<a name="06070724000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000652"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman put so persuasive a
case that he even got my support. I am living proof that there is
nothing dug in about our view of the Bill; we are seeking to go about
it in a sensible and reasoned way, and we have done that on this
clause.</div>
<a name="06070724000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000653"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General for reiterating
his position, but as far as we are concerned the clause is not going to
benefit anyone. That is ultimately our position. It is not going to
benefit companies, shareholders or stakeholders. It creates the
likelihood of increased uncertainty&#151;the no gain&#151;so why
bother? The question is how we take the issue forward at this stage on
the basis that we will be looking at how things develop on
Report.</div> <a name="06070724000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
make a point and we think that the clause&#146;s weakest link is
subsection (4). On that basis, I will ask the Committee to vote on
amendment No.163. I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No.

Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) and for Brent, East (Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000675"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause, based on the existing equitable
principle, creates a duty that directors
must</div><a name="06070724000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;act in accordance
with the company&#146;s constitution, and...only exercise powers
for the purposes for which they are
conferred.&#148;</div><a name="06070724000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">A report
provided by Linklaters said that the use of the
words</div><a name="06070724000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;purposes for which
they are conferred&#148;</div><a name="06070724000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">could
create problems, as the purposes could be
unclear.</div><a name="06070724000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070724000676"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is right that the clause codifies
the general duty of a director to act in accordance with the
company&#146;s constitution and to exercise powers for proper
purposes. If the duty were left out of the statutory statement of
duties, it would remain part of the common law, and that would do
nothing to improve the accessibility of the general duties.</div>
<a name="06070724000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">To determine the purposes for
which a power is conferred, the articles are an obvious starting point,
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 540</div>it is from those that directors derive most of their powers. Typically
in practice, the powers granted to directors by the company&#146;s
constitution are drafted in general terms and do not precisely state
the purposes for which they are to be exercised. The courts have
explained that the process is not an exact one, involving the laying
down of precise limits beyond which directors cannot pass. Instead, if
a particular exercise of a power is challenged, the courts will
determine the substantial purpose for which it was exercised, and reach
a conclusion as to whether that purpose was proper or not. The case of
Howard Smith Ltd. <i class="I">v. </i>Ampol Petroleum Ltd. is the key one in this
area.</div><a name="06070724000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">In doing that,
the courts will necessarily give credit to the good-faith opinion of
the directors and respect their judgment on matters of internal
management and, indeed, how the company engages in external operations.
The courts will take into account the nature of the power and the
business practice. That having been done, the ultimate conclusion has
to be the side of a fairly broad line on which the case falls. That is
typical of the courts&#146; approach to corporate disputes, giving
due respect for directors&#146; business judgment and not making a
close examination of their actions in favour of a more broad-brush
approach, so that the directors can have an element of freedom of
judgment in how they make a
decision.</div><a name="06070724000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
whether a power has been exercised for a proper purpose is a question
of law, and the directors&#146; opinion of the propriety of their
action is not conclusive. For example, a purpose may be improper even
if the directors consider that it is in the best interests of the
company. I hope that that explanation deals with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
concern.</div><a name="06070724000404"></a>
