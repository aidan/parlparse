                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Sheridan. What a pleasure it is

Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 11
proposes to address the issue of the efficacy and efficiency with which
applications for a national insurance holiday should be processed. It
is  a simple and, I think, perfectly formed amendment, and
given our discussions in the evidence session, it is also entirely
unobjectionable. During those discussions, the assistant director of
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, Mr Mitha, was quizzed about
not just the volume of applications that had so far been made, but the
trajectory, given that 400,000 applications are eventually expected. It
was clearly felt that HMRC potentially had the capability to process
any applications and inquiries within a relatively short space of time.
Nevertheless, I, in my humble experience, and many hon. and right hon.
Members will know—from the processing of passports or Child
Support Agency casework, on which we have had cause to make inquiries
in the past—that, from time to time, the best intentions of
Departments can sometimes fall short of the reality. Therefore, we feel
that it is prudent to ensure that a gold standard of service can be
achieved by HMRC in respect of this particular national insurance
holiday.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
suggests that HMRC should aim to process all applications within a
three-month period. Mr Mitha
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

would be disappointed if we were not able to turn them around far more
quickly than three months.”—<em>–</em>[<em>Official
Report, National Insurance Contributions Public Bill Committee, </em>2
December 2010; c. 28,

                        </p>
                        <p>Given
that businesses themselves are quite wary of the bureaucracy involved
in dealing with Government, the form-filling processes can make them
feel as though they are being distracted from their core activities.
The amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to rise to the
challenge and fly the flag of efficiency on behalf of his Department,
and accept the fact that businesses want speedy processing of
applications.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course, it
would be good practice to give a verbal undertaking. If the Minister
wishes to set out the convention that he will guarantee that all
applications are processed within a three-month period it would go some
way towards addressing our concern. However, it would be far better to
enshrine the matter firmly in legislation so that the standard is
clear. Let us call it a citizen’s charter in the best traditions
of the former Prime Minister, John Major. I not talking about a cones
hotline but proposing that a commitment to the rights that businesses
can expect should be contained within the Bill. It would be good
practice and would set expectations. As students of management theory
know, it would be a SMART initiative—specific, measurable,
achievable, realistic and
targeted.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000026">&#160;</a>

Friend’s amendment. Does he agree that if the proposal is not
accepted, some of the attraction of the scheme to small employers might
be lost? Indeed, delaying employing new people could mean that the

                           </strong> Indeed. There are already worries that the target
of 400,000 applications may be quite ambitious, especially given that
we have had only 1,000 applications to date. If the current trajectory
were to continue, it would mean only about 80,000 applications over the
course of the scheme, which would be woefully short of the ambitions
that Ministers have enunciated, so it is an important matter. There are
no costs associated with the amendment, so I can see no reason to
resist it, and it would give a clear target for all those involved in
the administration of the scheme to focus
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p>During
the evidence session, I recall hearing that HMRC’s national
insurance complement has 3,000 or so staff, and 240 of them—I
may be wrong on the figures, but it was roughly that
proportion—would be set aside for undertaking the national
insurance holiday. I calculated that that was some 6%. My maths is not
that acute this morning, but to set aside 6% of the current national
insurance team is quite a chunk of the work force. My anxiety is,
therefore, that redeploying those individuals 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 135<a class="bkMark" name="Column135">&#160;</a>
                           </div>may have an adverse affect on other elements of national insurance
processing activities for either employers or
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the evidence session, officials were upbeat about that impact, as I
would expect them to be; most senior managers tend, quite successfully,
to gloss over the impact of redeploying staff. Those on the front line,
however, know full well that one could not magic away that number of
staff without having an effect on some other part of the national
insurance system. I must, therefore, press the Minister to tell the
Committee in more detail from which tasks those staff will be drawn.
Will a particular unit of activity in the national insurance team be
closed down, diminished or halved, or will the pool of 240 staff be
accumulated by skimming a couple of dozen here or there from different
tasks across the
organisation?<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause sets out our anxieties about the adverse effect on the
administration of other national insurance processing tasks and seeks,
therefore, to ensure that the scheme will be administered by additional
employees. That is an important task and could merit the assurance that
there will be additional staff, so as not to diminish the work of the
rest of
HMRC.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">More
generally, we have already had a few doubts. I do not want to use the
word “sophistry”, but I suspect that there is anxiety in
the trade unions representing HMRC staff and others, who feel that
although there have been reductions in the head count across HMRC in
many different ways, announcements have proclaimed that extra
investment or extra head count will be dedicated to particular tasks,
without making it clear from where the resources will be found. For the
sake of clarity, openness and honesty, it is important that the
Minister tells us from what other tasks those staff will be drawn. If
he can assure us that they will be additional staff, that would be
satisfactory. That is the purpose of new clause
5.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000034">&#160;</a>

vast majority of applications are submitted online, so the initial
checks are automated. That means employers receive an immediate
response confirming whether they are eligible for the scheme on the
basis of the information provided. If the employer is eligible, they
can start withholding employer national insurance in respect of
eligible employees. HMRC has processed approximately 1,100 successful
applications since the scheme started and has rejected a further 54, as
we have already heard.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Luton North is right to say that substantial delays in
processing would be a disadvantage to the scheme, unless there were
very good reasons for it, such as doubt over the application. Only a
couple of days ago, hon. and right hon. Members argued that we should
delay implementing the scheme altogether until Royal Assent. I take the
hon. Member for Nottingham East’s point, but the amendment does
not add anything to the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 5
seeks to ensure that staff administering the holiday will be additional
employees. The hon. Member for Nottingham East is concerned that HMRC
employees should not be taken away from their existing work to
administer the holiday. The implication of the new clause is that a
team of 240 people should be dedicated to that specific task, but the
proposal is unnecessary. Concerns about administration are unfounded.
HMRC is able to administer the holiday without adversely affecting
other activities. The staff needed to administer it will be from a
range of areas, such as compliance, customer contacts and operations,
so HMRC will use existing staff with expertise in those
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">HMRC has
devised new processes for dealing with the holiday, and staff have been
trained in them. Incorporating additional steps in day-to-day
caseworking means that it has not been necessary to employ new staff.
That is the best use of HMRC resources and provides flexibility to
allocate more resource to the holiday as the need
arises.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000041">&#160;</a>

providing to the Committee by giving at least a broad indication of
where the 240 staff will come from; he mentioned compliance and
customer contacts. Could he expand on what “compliance”
means? Obviously, there are tasks to be done to ensure that businesses,
employers and employees comply with the law on the collection of tax.
If fewer staff are dedicated to that activity, will it have an impact
on revenue, for
example?<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000042">&#160;</a>

evasion and criminal fraud, and dealing with avoidance. We will
strengthen capability in those areas, which will involve expanding the
number of staff and promoting greater use of technology. Over the
four-year period, we believe that we will be able to strengthen
substantially the compliance capability of HMRC, including any issues
related to this particular holiday. For the reasons that I addressed in
earlier debates, we do not see that as likely to be a problematic area,
but we will monitor
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000043">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East. I am not convinced by the
Minister’s suggestion that this will not have much of a resource
implication for HMRC. I am plainly in the minority, but I am concerned
about the cut in HMRC’s headcount given that we have such a vast
tax gap and that a substantial number of billions of pounds have simply
not been collected because of a lack of
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
recent weeks I have spoken to the representative of the senior officers
of HMRC in the Palace—I have to declare an interest, although
not a pecuniary interest, because I am a member of the Public and
Commercial Services Union support group within the House. I believe
that there must be a resource implication, and I do not think that is a
bad thing. This is a good scheme and it should be
resourced.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
suggestion that I have, which I made at the public evidence session, is
that increasing the number of tax inspectors would be a tremendous
benefit in bringing in more revenue. Tax inspectors collect many times
their own salary. It depends on the tax: for VAT it is relatively low
at only five times their salary, but for income tax, and particularly
for corporation tax, we are talking many millions of pounds and a
multiple of many times the salary of an individual tax officer. An
increase in the number of tax officers would bring in more revenue,
which would more than cover the additional resource cost of the scheme
and which could be used in other areas of public
spending.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has twice said that he is pleased that I am in favour of a
tax-cutting scheme. I am one of those people who want to see employment
generated, and, unusually, this is a scheme designed specifically to
generate employment. So, in that sense, it is very good. Given
£1 billion to spend, however, I would want to find a way to
maximise the employment generation potential of that sum, and it might
be that some other scheme would promote more employment. I want to see
not either/or, but both. For the benefit of the economy and of us all,
we need to generate much more employment—unemployment is now at
2.5 million.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If we bring
down unemployment, all of our problems will begin to disappear,
particularly the deficit problem about which the Government are so
concerned. I am primarily concerned about unemployment, and this scheme
is about reducing unemployment. My suggestion for increasing the number
of tax officers would also reduce unemployment, both directly, because
more tax officers are appointed, and indirectly, because it would make
possible the generation of employment elsewhere in the
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000050">&#160;</a>

the spending settlement for HMRC, over the spending review period
£900 million will be focused on specific areas in which HMRC
believes it can significantly increase its yield. That will involve
employing more tax inspectors in particular areas. I also note the hon.
Gentleman’s argument that lowering the amount of
employer’s national insurance contribution that needs to be paid
is likely to create jobs. That, if I remember rightly, is a somewhat
different position from the one his party took at the general
election.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000051">&#160;</a>

conditions and the activities to which staff are allocated. One
question that needs to be asked, which perhaps can be answered on
another occasion, is whether all those who are going to be redeployed
and transferred will be on a different contract or will retain their
present contractual arrangements, albeit in a different line of
activity. I presume that it will be a redeployment scenario and they
would not be laid off and rehired again on lesser terms. Those are
important issues that we can raise on another occasion, as they matter
to the people who will administer the scheme. I am glad we have had the

                           </strong> This is a simple set of points. The clause deals
with the retention of records by those making applications under part 2
of the Bill. As I understand it, it is designed to ensure that the
burden of retaining records is fairly light touch, but it is still
quite a long clause. There are no explicit penalties for failure to
retain records, although I assume that the reference  to
schedule 4 of the 2001 regulations means that the suite of penalties
that might apply in other cases will not apply in this case.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000059">&#160;</a>

that the wording of subsection (4) means that electronic records are
sufficient. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that and
also explain why the period of three years has been chosen for the
retention of records. Many companies may find it slightly inconvenient
to retain records for that length of time. Obviously, we want to strike
the balance so that there is good record keeping but the requirement is
not burdensome for businesses, because there are costs involved in the
administration of the paperwork involved in those schemes. If the
Minister could clarify those points, I would be
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000060">&#160;</a>

schedule 36 to the Finance Act 2008 that enable HMRC to check tax
compliance, and it extends the powers in that schedule to enable HMRC
officers to check compliance with the holiday legislation. That is
rather similar to the debate—perhaps the word debate exaggerates
the brief discussion that we had—on penalties on Tuesday
afternoon. Essentially, the arrangements that apply for record keeping
generally will apply in this context, as far as the NICs holiday is
concerned. What we are careful to do in subsection (3) is ensure that
the general NICs record-keeping requirement proposed for employees does
not overlap with the requirements in relation to the NICs holiday in
the clause. As far as any penalties are concerned, the general regime
applies to national insurance contributions. There is not, therefore, a
separate regime.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000061">&#160;</a>

There are financial penalties for failing to keep records. On the hon.
Gentleman’s specific point, electronic records can be sufficient
and there is no need to keep paper records. As for the time period, it
is always the case that there is a need for a time period in which to
keep records that apply to the scheme. The EU state aid rules set a
maximum amount that can be received over a three-year period, and that
is why we have a three-year period for the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000063">&#160;</a>

sure that I am not alone among hon. Members in having constituents come
to me with problems with HMRC, and indeed other institutions, because
of a failure to keep records or bad advice from bookkeepers

                           </div>or even, sometimes, accountants. I am concerned on this point because
instructions about record keeping should be precise so that small
business people, who are not necessarily sophisticated in
administrative matters, know what they must do to keep proper records.
I hope that HMRC will ensure that its records are correct, too. Again,
I am sure I am not alone in having had a ping-pong exchange of
correspondence in the past with constituents with small businesses and
HMRC over a disagreement about information about something that has
happened where proper records have not been
kept.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000068">&#160;</a>

share his concerns about ensuring that the right type of record-keeping

the Opposition during the lengthy debates that we had on the subject.

new businesses may be tempted to pursue avoidance arrangements, and
essentially it warns them off doing so. It is a strange clause, and I
have never seen one drafted in such terms before: is it a standard
form? It simply states that anybody who is considering doing anything
that may avoid compliance with the rules on these arrangements needs to
beware. The clause lacks clarity, which makes me slightly anxious. The
Bill does not specify whether a court or HMRC will be the judge of what
is, or is not, an avoidance arrangement. Who will be the defining
arbiter in such
cases?<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000075">&#160;</a>

businesses that are undertaken through a franchise arrangement is not
properly described in the legislation or explanatory notes. A new
start-up business may seem an easy concept to imagine, but many firms
purchase a franchise as a way of starting up their entrepreneurial
career. One need only look at websites advertising the sale of
franchises to see the sort of business opportunities that are available
to new start-ups. The other day, I googled retail and food franchises,
and there were franchises for sale for Burger King, McDonald’s,
Smoothie Fresh, Shakey’s and Perfect Pizza—should any
hon. Members wish to start up a new business in that line of work. It
occurred to me that there is a risk for a new start-up entrepreneur who
may go down the franchise route and fall foul of circumstances in which
the business could be described as an existing line of business and,
therefore, it may not be classified as a new start-up. I would be
grateful if the Minister could address the scenarios relating to

Gentleman queries the type of clause and its mention of “main
purpose”, which is essentially a test of whether the arrangement
is artificial. During his sabbatical from the House, it became
increasingly common for clauses along these lines, which ask what the
main purpose of the activity was—if it was avoidance, that
activity would be ineffective—and the clause is therefore not
particularly unusual. It is right that we prevent the situation where a
person enters into artificial transactions that are aimed primarily at
qualifying for the holiday rather than genuinely carrying on a
business. If we did not do so, the cost could be considerable without
achieving any of our policy objectives. We hope that we do not have to
use it at all, but we recognise that this relief is valuable, and we
need to ensure that it is targeted in the normal way. If we need to use
it, we are likely to discover that through normal compliance
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000079">&#160;</a>

appeal to an independent tribunal, if the business does not agree with
HMRC’s decision. I note that he has been looking at websites for
Burger King franchises and so on, and I am sorry if that indicates that
the hon. Gentleman is making another career change. Although not
everything has gone as well as he might have liked over the past few
months, that would be a pity and a great loss to the House. I can
assure him, however, that if a genuinely new business is set up under a
franchise it would count as a new business for the purposes of the
holiday. I hope that my remarks satisfy the hon. Gentleman and that
they will dissuade him from setting up a Burger King, whether it is in

avoiding excessive claims. It emphasises the importance of proper
record keeping, so that small employers do not inadvertently, or
possibly deliberately, claim more cuts than they are entitled to. We
debated the problem of part-time employees in a previous sitting, and
one can imagine all sorts of complications at local level with
companies starting up, closing down and starting up again. That happens
frequently in the small business field, particularly in construction,
as I know from my own constituency. Again, precise records need to be
kept so that there is no doubt and so that small business people do not
fall into a trap where they might be prosecuted for tax
avoidance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
two new clauses are designed to prompt the Minister to report on
aspects of the scheme, and to give him the flexibility to look at
varying it if the take-up is not what he has suggested. New clause 1
suggests that it would be in everybody’s interests if we set a
budget for the scheme, as I have said in previous sittings. The budget
should be known before the scheme commences and it should be adhered to
for the scheme’s duration.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has helpfully indicated that he expects the budget to be £940
million over the three years of the scheme, but that is a Treasury
projection of the possible expenditure on the scheme. As we discussed
earlier, that projection could be underspent or overspent. In a time of
fiscal tightening and economic difficulties, it is important 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 143<a class="bkMark" name="Column143">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that the Treasury sets a figure for the total amount of money to be
spent on the scheme and that it is published beforehand, so that the
excellent Treasury forecasts on the likely expenditure are not
overshot.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have served on a number of Committees over the past few weeks and, on
the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill Committee only
two weeks ago, the Financial Secretary argued that we should save
£500 million on child trust funds because the country cannot
afford them. On this Bill, we will spend an estimated £940
million over three years, but that is an open-ended commitment. If the
scheme takes off and there is a massive pick-up in the regions outside
London, the south-east and east, there might be an additional cost over
and above the £940 million that the Treasury would have to
absorb.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Treasury forecasts for HMRC are fairly
accurate—we may undershoot or overshoot—but we are being
asked to legislate and give authority to an open-ended scheme. Given
the fact that the scheme will attract excellent publicity, that HMRC
will work hard on it, and that we have appointed 240 extra staff to
administer it, it is perfectly possible that the scheme will take off
and that we might spend £1.3 billion in its three years, rather
than £940 million. That would be a £400
million liability on the Treasury, but it is not considered relevant to
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be helpful to state in new clause 1, as we have done for other
Government schemes, “Here is a pocket of money. It’s
worth £940 million, that’s our benefit. It does not now
cover London, the south-east and the east because we discarded that. It
covers the other regions of the United Kingdom. It will operate for
three years, but if the scheme runs out of money, it runs out of
money.” We would then know exactly what it is.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There may be
a perverse effect. If the scheme has a fixed budget, and people know
that, it might generate greater interest and speedier take-up because
it is time-limited. The previous Government introduced the car
scrappage scheme, which had a fixed budget and we knew what it would
cost before it started. It drove forward the sale of cars because
people knew that the money would run out quickly. Instead of
undershooting on the cost of the scheme, fixing the amount of money
beforehand would ensure that the total amount was spent in the three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000095">&#160;</a>

the moment, I do not know, and the Minister cannot tell me today, on 9
December 2010, whether at the end of the period, on 5 September 2013,
we will have spent £600 million on the scheme, or £1.3
billion.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000096">&#160;</a>

carefully to the right hon. Gentleman’s argument, but I do not
understand something that he has just raised. He said that by 2013 the
Government will have spent £600 million on the scheme, but is
not the key point that renders the new clause inappropriate that we are
discussing a tax cut, not a spending project? It is different from the
car scrappage scheme or other spending projects. It is a tax cut, and
in this country tax cuts are organised through the tax code and people
adhere to it. How much tax is raised is a consequence of the tax code,
rather than being limited or schematic.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000097">&#160;</a>

for the Treasury to put forward what it expects to raise in taxation.

matter for many hours—the key issue on which the hon. Gentleman

shed some light on why it is necessary to set some parameters for the
scheme, which is essentially what the new clause would do. I am
grateful to the Minister for finally responding to my concerns about
the evidence base for the policy, but his letter raises more questions
than it answers, not least because it says that the Government cannot
quantify either the cost to the Exchequer or the net benefits. Would it
not be wise to set some parameters and say that they believe that the
tax cut will have an equivalent cost of £940 million, but that
they cannot be sure so that will be the maximum benefit or cost that
they are looking for? The alternative, as he said, is that they may not
lose anything, but they may gain something—they simply do not
know.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000101">&#160;</a>

am flexible about this, but the key point is that I want the Minister
to be able to tell the Committee and the House that an element of

drives forward applications, or at least enables the Minister, at the
end of the scheme, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow said,
to stand up on 5 September 2013 and say what the net cost of
the scheme has been. In new clause 1, which would require a total
budget to be determined for the scheme, I am trying to persuade the
Minister to indicate now the limits of the scheme, so that we can drive
it forward and assess its net cost to the Exchequer, and the public at
large.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000102">&#160;</a>

reasons that have been discussed. In new clause 1, I am

Minister set out the parameters on Report. If I were in the Government,
I would want to know what the net cost of the scheme will be at the end
of three years, and I would want to budget for it. However the net cost
is determined—the hon. Member for West Suffolk has experience in
these matters—it is important that it is set out. The scheme has
the potential to be an unending commitment, depending on its

matters are involved. If individuals are employed under the scheme,
they will pay income tax; therefore, there will be different aspects
across the Treasury as a whole. However, at some point, the Minister
needs to set out what he believes the net costs of the scheme will be.
Not paying national insurance for new employees will result in a loss
of revenue for somebody, and therefore we need an assessment of the

creation of new jobs and getting people into work. Having a review

the new clause. I simply want to get from the Minister the net cost to
the Exchequer at the end of the period. Can we set it now so that we
know exactly what it will be? Indeed, there may be a net
benefit—but at least we would know what it was. Having a
time-limited funding element rather than simple timed funding might in
itself drive forward the success of the scheme for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000111">&#160;</a>

                           </div>much has been spent, in how many constituencies, where the businesses
are, how many people are affected and what is the outcome of the
scheme. It might save the Minister a great deal of red box
time—many questions to be answered on many issues—if he
simply says, “Yes, I will publish the information to show
exactly what is
happening.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000112">&#160;</a>

happen to know the constituency of Delyn reasonably well—very
well, in fact. In my constituency, one business might avail itself of
the scheme during the three-year period. It might employ one person.
Next door, in the constituency of Alyn and Deeside, there might be
10 businesses employing 10 people as a result of the scheme.
We need that information so that we can assess where the scheme has
been
used.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000113">&#160;</a>

to the Tatton experience, nobody in Tatton may take up the scheme, but
lots of people may do so in Manchester, Central, which is not too far
away. It would be helpful to know how the scheme operates in practice.
Every hon. Member would want to know how the scheme is undertaken,
particularly given that the Minister has said that he seeks to use it
to support certain objectives, such as helping areas facing challenges
because they are affected by public sector job
losses.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000114">&#160;</a>

all the funding ends up being spent in the county of Cheshire alone,
the scheme will not have been of benefit. We need to know factual
information across the board, because that would

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would help to have the information. Whether or not the Minister
provides it in response to new clause 1, it would be useful for him to
agree today to publish the impact of the scheme annually, by

(c) provides not for a commitment from the Minister, but for him to
consider whether he should re-apply the scheme by employment sector,
rather than by geographical region. He would make that assessment as
part of the assessment of the scheme. When he and the Treasury and HMRC
assess the scheme, they might see that certain regions were not using
it as the Minister hoped they would. He might want to encourage new
businesses to commence in areas, even—dare I say it?—in
the London, south-east and east region, with particular employment
shortages in new businesses. Unlikely though it seems, there might be a
need—for example, in London—to promote the interests of
plumbers, electricians and other small new businesses. The Minister
might want to consider applying the scheme by employment sector, rather
than by geographical region.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000120">&#160;</a>

would not commit the Minister to do anything other than assess the
scheme after six months from Royal Assent. The new clause asks him to
do so to see whether he should widen its application to existing
businesses either employing fewer than 20 employees or having a
turnover of less than £500,000 per annum. If we take that with
new clause 1, the Minister can set an overall budget. The application
of the scheme to existing employers or businesses with a turnover of
less than £500,000 would allow the Minister to extend on a
regional basis it in the event of low turnout or take-up elsewhere. He
said that 1,100 people are taking the scheme up. If there was a lower
turnout, under new clause 6 he could examine whether the scheme should
apply to existing
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My contention
is quite simple. The Minister should publish a budget—show the
success of the scheme on a factual basis, by publishing that
information. He should take a power to himself to consider applying the
measure to individual sectors, even if he does not necessarily use that
power, and he should take the power to consider applying the measure to
new businesses, even if—again—he does not necessarily use
that power. He would then have the powers, in case he needs to use
them, to ensure the success of the scheme as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000127">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The new clauses are motivated by a commendable wish

                        <p class="tabbed">First, as I
explained in the evidence session, there is no budget for the scheme,
as such. Businesses can be confident that there is no budgetary
constraint and that the holiday will continue as proposed, regardless
of how many applicants there are. It is very important that we offer
that certainty. As I said on Tuesday, if a business found that suddenly
the holiday was no longer available because the budget had been used
up, that would damage employers’ confidence in the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
right to highlight the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West
Suffolk that this is, after all, a tax cut and not an item of spending.
Moreover, it is worth putting this tax cut into context. We are talking
about £940 million over the course of the next three years. That
is not insubstantial, but we have to put that in the context of the
fact that the Government raise approximately £50 billion a year
through employers’ national insurance contributions. The
estimate of £940 million has been scrutinised and
verified by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility and it
means that we will raise £940 million less than we would
otherwise have raised.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has been
asked what would happen if the take-up is enormous and we have far more
businesses taking this measure up in respect of far more employees.
That scenario would suggest that we would have identified a successful
dynamic effect and, as a consequence, more people would be in
employment and paying income tax, employees’ national insurance
contributions and VAT. It would also suggest that the Burger King
franchise in Nottingham being run by the hon. Member for Nottingham
East was doing extremely well and that he was employing more
people—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Laughter.</em>
                           <em>]</em> It would actually be a
good thing for the Revenue if take-up were enormous. So the suggestion
that enormous take-up would somehow  cause great difficulties
for us is not correct. The expected costs of the scheme were set out in
the policy costing documentation in the Budget
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000132">&#160;</a>

my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn on the Front Bench has said.
However, it is much more likely that there will be an underspend rather
than an overspend. It is my belief that the Government’s policy
will lead to a serious downturn in the economy, because of savage cuts
in public spending, and an increase in unemployment, which will affect
the ability to generate more jobs. So making the scheme more generous
and applicable to the areas that are currently excluded might be
necessary to help generate more employment in the economy when we enter
a serious downturn.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000133">&#160;</a>

the passing of time will make no difference to the policy objective of
targeting support on those considering setting up new businesses. Nor
will it make a difference to the objective of targeting assistance on
those countries and regions most dependent on public sector employment,
as opposed to “employment sector” as suggested
by new clause 1. Indeed, it is unclear what is intended by
“employment
sector”.<a class="bkMark" name="10120938000136">&#160;</a>

HMRC’s published literature and web-based guidance contains
website links to information relating to part 2 of the Bill on the
duration of the holiday. I assure him that the new clause is
unnecessary, as HMRC’s published literature and web-based
guidance already contains website links to information relating to part
2. Let me further assure him that this guidance will be maintained for
the duration of the holiday. I hope that reassurance will persuade him

flagging up to potential new businesses the availability of the

in the current arrangements for national insurance paperwork. With the

franchise he wishes to establish. I thank Opposition Members for the
thoroughness of their scrutiny. I note that all the Back Benchers among
them came from Luton or London. There was a time when my party seemed
somewhat focused on the south-east of England but, at least in this

will take the points that have been made in Committee and reflect on
them. We have made them not to create a political divide but to say
that there are ways in which he can devise a scheme that will,
hopefully, benefit more people and succeed in the objective of creating
employment. I give notice to the Minister that we will return to some
of these matters on Report, especially the exclusion from the measure
of London and the south-eastern and eastern regions. Between now and
the festive season, I hope that the Minister will read the excellent
coverage of these matters in <em>Hansard </em>and reflect on
