proposed [this day]: </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="06071217000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071217000382"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): Mrs.
Humble, may I say what a pleasure it is to sit under your discipline
this afternoon for the second part of my speech?</div>
<a name="06071217000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was explaining that I have
deep reservations about schedule 7. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Minister will take away my reservations and consider amending the Bill
on Report. My objection is that the schedule incorporates a pointless
acronym into law. It not only incorporates it but repeats it, so that
in my view those who wrote this part of the Bill are guilty of a serial
offence.</div> <a name="06071217000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
dreadful habit of Whitehall to turn everything into acronyms. The issue
is important, because language and communication are important. An
acronym can do two things: it can damage communication because the
acronym label is not comprehensible and does not mean anything, and it
can exclude those who are not anoraks.</div>
<a name="06071217000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone who has served, as I
have, at DEFRA and DTI will know that it is possible to have whole
sentences that contain few words and little meaning because acronyms
are used all the time. When I was given responsibility for chemicals,
it took me a little time to adjust to the fact that the CIA that was
referred to in the Department was the Chemical Industries Association.
I think it is right to say that the Federation of British Industries
changed its name to the Confederation of British Industry to escape
association with an American institution. It is certainly not always
clear whether one is talking about the Food Standards Agency or the
Financial Services Authority when the initials FSA are used. The tin
lid was put on all that for me when I heard officials describe the
rural affairs forum as &#147;the RAF&#148;. I made the point at
that stage that although the rural affairs forum was an important way
of communicating with rural communities in England, we did not intend
to bomb anyone into submission in the course of our
deliberations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 202</div><a name="06071217000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this Bill, which is in other
ways such an excellent piece of legislation, we have the dreadful
acronym habit of Whitehall being incorporated into primary legislation.
It is an absolute outrage. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my
point and cleanse the Bill with amendments on Report.</div>
<a name="06071217000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exclusive language is damaging,
and we now have the initials used in schedule 7. I had something of a
battle to persuade officials that community interest companies should
not be called CICs, because the word CIC does not communicate anything
whereas the title community interest company tells one exactly what it
is. It would be simple for my hon. Friend to introduce an amendment
into paragraph 1 of schedule 7, in page 114, line 30, to delete
&#147;a &#145;CIO&#146;&#148; and to insert &#147;an
incorporated charity&#148;. We would then all know what we meant by
the term, and the label on the bottle would be clear. In the age of the
computer, it cannot be claimed that typing the term &#147;an
incorporated charity&#148; is onerous compared with using
initials.</div> <a name="06071217000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to delay the Committee on this point, but I do not believe that it
is trivial. The Government have done a good job in making available
different models, such as the community interest company and the
incorporated charity. Those two options are available for organisations
that want to pursue worthy purposes but want the protection of
incorporation, apart from industrial and provident societies and the
other options. To have that range of options and refer to them simply
so that people can make decisions based on the best model for them to
deliver the value-led outcomes that they want to achieve will be a
major step forward. I hope we can take that step forward with clarity,
and not with an acronym settled into primary legislation. I regard that
as an outrageous proposition and the one defect in an otherwise
excellent Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will have
sympathy for the fact that, as a Welshman, I am trying to protect the
English language from this outrageous
intrusion.</div>
<a name="06071217000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071217000383"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): It is nice to see you in the
Chair presiding over us, Mrs. Humble. I have some sympathy for what the
right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) said
and was rather looking forward to his pronouncing the words in the
proposed new section 69C(4)(a) of the Charities Act 1993, as I suspect
that he is the only member of the Committee who could do so.</div>
<a name="06071217000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Member might be
rather exaggerating the threat contained in schedule 7, because
although it provides for added flexibility in exactly which
incorporated status a charity might adopt&#151;I hope that every
member of the Committee would welcome that&#151;as I read it, it does
not oblige them to use the letters CIO. In fact, the precedent is for
limited company status, which many charities&#151;certainly all the
major ones&#151;have adopted without having to use acronyms such as
plc, Ltd or anything else in their notepaper or elsewhere. That has not
proved much of a limitation, so although I share the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s dislike for acronyms where clear English will do,
the injunction to charities that adopt CIO status to call themselves
charitable incorporated organisations rather than CIOs should
remain.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 203</div><a name="06071217000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071217000384"></a><b class="B">Peter
Bottomley</b> (Worthing, West) (Con): I agree with the right
hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. We could take the
polysyllabic sludge of &#147;charitable incorporated
organisations&#148; and say that we do not need the word
&#147;organisation&#148;, because it is implied by
&#147;incorporated&#148;, and that we should substitute one
syllable in &#147;charitable&#148; to make it
&#147;charity&#148;. What is proposed is absolutely
straightforward&#151;Dorothy Sayers would have approved of
it&#151;so I hope that the Minister will take the wording away and
bring it back changed.</div>
<a name="06071217000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000385"></a>The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>
The passion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth was clear for us all to see. If our proceedings were being
covered by &#147;Today in Parliament&#148; or &#147;Yesterday in
Parliament&#148;, he would deserve to get on with the speech that he
delivered, which was entertaining and informative.</div>
<a name="06071217000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are good reasons to be
sympathetic to my right hon. Friend&#146;s view. The Government come
up with lots of incomprehensible acronyms and other phrases that mean
nothing to members of the public. However, &#147;incorporated
charity&#148; does not work, because there are other non-CIO forms of
incorporated charity, namely the industrial and provident societies,
and friendly societies, which are incorporated charities&#151;to use
the term of art&#151;but will not necessarily apply for the status
that we currently call CIO.</div>
<a name="06071217000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am tempted to say that anyone
with good ideas should send them on a postcard to my right hon. Friend
over the summer. We have been aware of the problem, but we have not
found a better alternative. However, Members of Parliament get a long
summer break, and although I do not promise to devote the whole of mine
to thinking of an alternative formulation, we will apply our minds to
see whether something can be done about the dreaded
acronyms.</div>
<a name="06071217000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000386"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> During the summer break, will the Minister also
turn his mind to a word that appears right at the beginning of the
Bill, which is &#147;institution&#148;, of which I am not sure I
have found the definition? I think that I know what it means, but if
there is a definition, perhaps the Minister could point it out.
&#147;Institution&#148; is an acceptable word, but it would be
lovely to know precisely what it
means.</div><a name="06071217000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000387"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My list of summer tasks is growing, although in
the meantime perhaps the hon. Gentleman can tell us what he thinks the
word means.</div>
<a name="06071217000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000388"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I think that I will not do
so.</div><a name="06071217000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000389"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I gather that &#147;institution&#148; is
defined in clause 76(5), which
says:</div><a name="06071217000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In this
Act &#145;institution&#146; means an institution whether
incorporated or not, and includes a trust or
undertaking.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06071217000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000390"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Does that also include all the other
organisations that would otherwise be included in the incorporated
charities that the Minister has talked
about?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 204</div><a name="06071217000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000391"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman asked that
question. I think that the answer is
yes.</div><a name="06071217000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000392"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> In view of the Minister&#146;s generous
undertaking to think about the matter during the summer, I can respond
only by offering to enter into correspondence with him to see if we can
find a solution and protect the English language. I am grateful to him
for his response and I shall not press the clause to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000395"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is a great pleasure to see you in the
Chair this afternoon, Mrs. Humble. Once again, the sun is shining and
everyone is happy. They will be happier still to know that I shall not
go into great detail about amendments Nos. 112 to 121. I had a word
with the Parliamentary Secretary over lunch and he persuaded me that
the amendment was not necessary because it was not possible to have an
incorporated organisation such as a charitable incorporated
organisation&#151;in deference to the right hon. Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth&#151;that did not have members. I hope that he will
say a few words in explanation of that position, as a result of which I
shall not press the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000396"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> This is an incredibly complicated issue and
members of the Committee will be pleased to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 205</div>know that I shall not read out the 20-minute speech that I had prepared
on the subject. Suffice it to say the problem is that, under English
company law, there is not a company that does not consist of members.
Trustees control and manage the charity under a CIO and members
essentially form the charitable incorporated organisation. Although
there is some sympathy with the intention behind the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments, it is difficult&#151;as our discussion
made clear&#151;to achieve what he seeks. There needs to be both
trustees and members, although it is not particularly elegant in law.
In light of the undertakings, I am happy to continue to discuss matters
with him and any other representatives that he considers have important
views on the matter, so I hope that he is willing to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000397"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for
Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) is right to have understood whatever was
said outside the
Committee.</div><a name="06071217000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise an issue about the Charity Commission. Let us suppose that an
incorporated charity had trustees with, say, two members and those
members died. Would it be open to the Charity Commission to appoint
people to be members so that the charity could continue or would the
charity be dissolved? Again, the Minister might want to respond to such
a question by correspondence. Such a thing is not likely to happen, but
we always need to know what would happen in those
circumstances.</div><a name="06071217000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000398"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is an important question. What happens in
such circumstances would be governed by the constitution of the
charitable incorporated organisation. It would need to appoint new
individuals to the organisation in the usual
way.</div><a name="06071217000064"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000402"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Those same conversations over lunch revealed that
the proposals in amendments Nos. 167 to 169 are a part of general
charity law that does not need to be repeated. However, amendment No.
166 poses something of a quandary.</div>
<a name="06071217000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Committee members know from
the previous debate, a charitable incorporated organisation has both
trustees and members, and those members are akin to members of a
company. In company law, a member of a company can be of any age,
although I understand that the Company Law Reform Bill will change the
minimum age for membership of a company from birth to 16. However, the
minimum age at which a person can be a trustee of a trust, let alone a
charitable trust, is 18. Amendment No. 166 proposes that 18 should be
the minimum age for being a trustee of a charitable incorporated
organisation. There is some question about whether that is appropriate,
given that a charitable incorporated organisation is a corporation as
well as a charity. However, I hope that the Minister will take the
issue away and think about it over the recess. Perhaps he will come up
with a proposal on Report that commands general
confidence.</div><a name="06071217000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000403"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman has, conveniently and
usefully, drawn a genuine dilemma to our attention. Since the Bill was
drafted&#151;many moons ago, it seems now&#151;the Company Law
Reform Bill has stipulated that directors of companies can be as young
as 16. However, in charity law, trustees must be 18. That poses a
dilemma for us all. CIOs are charities rooted in some of the benefits
of company law, but their reform lies in charity law. We shall take the
issue away, think about it and report back to hon.
Members.</div><a name="06071217000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071217000404"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): As the
Minister knows, I raised in the House the issue of people with learning
disabilities acting as trustees. I should like to link that with what
we are discussing. Is there not a rationale for having different
categories of trustees, and not only allowing people aged 16 to be
trustees but introducing a category between a member and a trustee,
particularly for charities that represent young
people?</div><a name="06071217000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071217000405"></a><b class="B">Helen

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000407"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> This issue is highly problematic for charities
working with young people which want young people to have a voice in
how they are run. However, the case in respect of young people is
different from that of people with learning disabilities. It is
possible to insert people in advisory panels and management committees
at a level below that of the trustee board, to avoid giving them the
full legal responsibility of trusteeship. I just offer that
thought.</div><a name="06071217000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000408"></a>Edward

Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): I ask my hon.
Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to bear in mind that the single
biggest group of people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 207</div>involved in volunteering activities are aged between 16 and 24. To my
mind, to exclude them seems to move away from natural
justice.</div><a name="06071217000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000410"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I may cause some alarm among my officials by
saying this, but perhaps my hon. Friends are giving me the idea that we
should strike a blow for 16 to 18-year-olds and move more generally
towards 16-year-olds being eligible to be trustees. I throw that out
not as a proposal, but more as a
thought.</div><a name="06071217000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000411"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The way that my hon. Friend is engaging with the
issue and responding on his feet to hon. Members&#146; comments is
encouraging. I know from my previous incarnation that one of the
reasons for the age change in the Company Law Reform Bill and accepting
that we should choose the age of 16 was that we wanted to encourage a
spirit enterprise and responsibility among young people. However,
enterprise can be delivered through charitable organisations as well,
and we also want to promote the spirit of charity. Perhaps we might
consider a safeguard that protects the charitable institution but
allows young people a genuine vehicle through which to engage in such
activities. I encourage my hon. Friend to explore
that.</div><a name="06071217000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000412"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for
pointing that out. I warm to the idea the more we discuss
it.</div><a name="06071217000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000413"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I encourage the Minister to warm to it some more.
I am not sure that many safeguards are needed beyond those that already
exist in the process of becoming a trustee in the first place, either
by election or by peer group acceptance. I encourage him to move from a
thought to a
proposal.</div><a name="06071217000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000414"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am grateful for the degree of consensus that
we seem to be developing on the issue. I do not know whether
Conservative Front-Bench Members share that
enthusiasm.</div><a name="06071217000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
advised that young people and others can participate through advisory
councils without becoming legal trustees. Perhaps that answers the
point made by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James
Duddridge), but it does not answer the question whether 18 or 16 is the
right age for trustees, and whether there is not a case for bringing
the Bill into line with the precedent set by the Company Law Reform
Bill. As the Committee has developed that thought collectively, I shall
take it away and think about it during the summer. I hope that the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000415"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It is important to place on record that the
Company Law Reform Bill has raised the age at which one can become a
trustee, thereby&#151;to follow the logic of the right hon. Member
for Cardiff, South and Penarth&#151;excluding under-16s from
participation in enterprise rather than enabling those between 16 and
18 to participate.</div> <a name="06071217000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that a compromise will be achieved, but I have concerns about
the consequences of such a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 208</div>compromise on the other responsibilities of people aged 16 to 18. One of
the responsibilities of trustees is personal liability, which might not
be appropriate for those aged 16 to
18.</div><a name="06071217000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000416"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I had planned to quote from this later on, but
&#147;Responsibilities of charity trustees: a summary&#148;, a
document published by the Charity Commission dated 18 January 2002,
says:</div><a name="06071217000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
cannot be a charity trustee if you are under 18 years of age (unless
the charity is a registered
company)&#148;.</div><a name="06071217000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
therefore possible to be a charity trustee under the age of 18 anyway,

accurate.</div><a name="06071217000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000417"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000419"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000420"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Amendment No. 129 is unnecessary, so we are making
considerable progress on the schedule, but I think that amendment No.
36 is necessary. Proposed new section 69D of the 1993 Act will create
no fewer than 37 new criminal offences. Subsection (1) will create
eight offences affecting various people,
including</div><a name="06071217000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
charity trustee...or a person on the CIO&#146;s behalf who
issues or authorises the issue of any

pom, tiddley pom. There are other measures as well, making eight
offences. We then go on to subsection (2), in which there is the
opportunity for another 28 offences to be created. Subsection (3)
creates one further offence. The commission has the power to warn,
advise or remove anyone who does any of those things anyway.</div>
<a name="06071217000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was struck by the findings of
the Joint Committee, which states in its report
that:</div><a name="06071217000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Considerable

to volunteering and make it more difficult to recruit
trustees...The Committee are concerned about a blanket imposition
of a criminal penalty for breach of trust...We conclude that cases
should only be pursued where a trustee acts dishonestly...We
consider that the imposition of a criminal penalty would be
counterproductive and recommend that the Bill should impose a civil
penalty without leaving someone with the stigma of a criminal
conviction.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
huge number of offences have been created in a huge number of areas in
a vast amount of legislation in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>recent years. The Charities Bill should not be another vehicle for the
creation of such offences. I agree with the Joint Committee that people
are put off becoming trustees if they fear that a slip can lead to
criminality or even prosecution. They may succeed in demonstrating that
it was a slip and that they are not guilty, but they face the
heartache, distress and disruption of their lives that results from
facing a potential criminal charge. That is not something that we
should do as lightly as it appears to have been done in the proposed
section.</div><a name="06071217000098"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000421"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I confess that I am slightly puzzled by the
amendment. The raft of new offences described by the hon. Gentleman are
merely the equivalents for CIOs of parallel offences for companies. Any
charity that is moving from company to CIO status will not be subject
to more offences, risk of heartache, distress or other problems induced
by the risk of criminality because they were liable for those very
same, or parallel, offences under company law. The only possible
circumstance in which the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns might be
relevant is one in which a charity that was not previously a company
applies for CIO status. However, it is merely being saved the more
onerous burden of company law. Although I am sure that the amendment is
well intentioned, it does not seem to be justified and interferes with
the CIO status as a less burdensome alternative to company
status.</div> <a name="06071217000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman did not mention amendment No.129, which is grouped with
amendment No. 36.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000422"></a>Mr.

what the word &#147;body&#148; means? It appears in this
subsection.</div><a name="06071217000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000425"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> No, is the answer to that, but I will endeavour
to do so in due course.</div>
<a name="06071217000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal with the
substantive points made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. If I may
so, the hon. Member for Cheltenham spoke particularly eloquently in his
explanation&#151;more eloquently that I could. The new section
replicates for charitable incorporated organisations offences that
exist for charities that register under company law. The hon. Gentleman
talked eloquently about the risks that people might fear, but I assure
him that we are simply reproducing sanctions that already exist for
charities under company law. Even for charities section 5(5) of the
1993 Act already provides that an offence regarding the signing of a
document is a level 3 offence, which is the same as that under proposed
new section 69D of that Act.</div>
<a name="06071217000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I understand what the
hon. Gentleman is getting at, I assure him that a new set of draconian
powers is not being taken. The provision simply reproduces the
proportionate and sensible offences that already exist under current
law in return for the duties and privileges of being connected with a
charity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000426"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I cannot say that I am satisfied with that answer.
My argument was well set out in the quotation from the Joint
Committee&#146;s report. It is hoped that many charitable
organisations that are currently unincorporated will transfer and
become CIOs and that some companies may become CIOs. That may impose
onerous responsibilities on the trustees of charities. I have no doubt
that they already have onerous responsibilities, but that is no excuse
for perpetuating them. We ought to be considering how to make the lives
of trustees easier, not more difficult.</div>
<a name="06071217000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not find an answer to the
point that the Charity Commission can intervene if a trustee or a
charity acts unlawfully.</div>
<a name="06071217000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000427"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have great respect for Bircham Dyson Bell,
which is associated with Fight for Sight, a charity of which I am a
trustee. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of its
opinions is still a bit wide of the mark. For instance, if the
provision did not exist, what would the hon. Gentleman suggest should
happen to an organisation that pretends to have CIO status? It seems
that it would escape sanction.</div>
<a name="06071217000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000428"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> If an organisation misrepresents itself,
presumably it does so for a purpose. Usually, that purpose is to obtain
some pecuniary advantage; it is not done entirely by accident, and if
it is, the organisation is unlikely to be prosecuted. We have to look
behind the action.</div> <a name="06071217000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the whole, the problem is not the trustees. In the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s example, the problem is that the people concerned
are not trustees, or they are trustees of an organisation that is not a
CIO. If a charity has not become a CIO, the commission will be able to
intervene to correct it; and if it is not a charity but it is
representing itself as one, the fact that it is likely to have an
ulterior motive can easily be demonstrated.</div>
<a name="06071217000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand why the Minister
does not wish to accept the amendment. The provision is a continuation
of existing regulation, and some might describe it as over-regulation.
It underlines the need to be a little more sensitive to the needs of
lay people who become trustees.</div>
<a name="06071217000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is the will of the
Committee, I shall not press the amendment to a Division, but I believe
that we should consider every opportunity to deregulate and encourage
people to take on such responsibilities. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000431"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> This is another group of amendments that have
benefited from our lunch hour. We did not get anything to eat, but we
made some progress. It is fair to say that we established that
amendments Nos. 37 and 29 are not important enough for me to press to a
Division. However, amendments Nos. 38 and 39, and perhaps Nos. 123 and
124 because they form part of the same general argument, illuminate a
problem.</div> <a name="06071217000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">When an
unincorporated organisation sets out to become a CIO, the process is
usually that the CIO is established. The unincorporated organisation
then hands over its assets, but what happens to its liabilities?
Liabilities can be handed over only with the approval of the creditor.
It is unlikely that the creditor would agree to transfer a debt from an
unincorporated organisation, the trustees of which are individually
liable for the full sum, to a body that has limited liability. We are
left with the original charity with its liabilities, but no assets and
the CIO with its assets, but no liabilities and no way of moving the
liabilities to the CIO. That will not encourage bodies to transfer from
being unincorporated organisations to being CIOs. Amendments Nos. 38,
39, 123 and 124 attempt to deal with the issue in different ways and I
invite the Minister to look at the problem to see if he can come up
with a
solution.</div><a name="06071217000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000432"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised a point of genuine
difficulty because the Government are keen to encourage the use of the
CIO and that partly will be about unincorporated charities moving to
take advantage of the limited liability and the other positive aspects
of becoming a CIO. However, there is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 212</div>question that we face the barrier that the hon. Gentleman set out rather
clearly.</div><a name="06071217000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
provision in proposed new section 69O to make the process of conversion
as easy as possible but, as the hon. Gentleman says, it requires the
setting up of a new organisation, the termination of the existing
organisation and a transfer of the assets and liabilities, and that
depends at least on authorisation from the people to whom those
liabilities are owed. It is a problem to which a solution has not been
found so far in the long and winding road under the Bill. Again,
without wishing to ruin my summer completely or that of my officials
who are working on the Bill, we shall keep looking at such matters and
will respond positively to any ingenious suggestions that are made.
With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000433"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful for that reassurance. Indeed, I am

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000436"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> This is a series of short amendments to clarify
the position of paying trustees. They have special responsibility to
safeguard a charity&#146;s assets. I welcome the statement by the
noble Lord Bassam in Grand Committee in another place. He confirmed
that the Government
were</div><a name="06071217000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;trying to preserve
the essence of the voluntary principle of
trusteeship&#148;</div><a name="06071217000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">and he said
that the conditions of payment to a trustee
were</div><a name="06071217000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;designed to ensure
that it is proportionate, protects against conflicts of interest and is
in the best interests of the charity.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 16 March 2005; Vol. 670, c.
GC515.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 213</div><a name="06071217000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 30 would simply require that any agreement about payment should be
made &#147;in advance&#148; of that payment being made or, indeed,
the work being undertaken for which the payment might be made. That
seems a sensible principle and is, I believe, one of the proposals of
the Joint Committee, at paragraph
259.</div><a name="06071217000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 31
would exclude charities from employing their own trustees. It is one
thing to have a short-term relationship with a trustee who is perhaps
doing a little plumbing for the benefit of the charity; it is another
thing entirely to have a trustee as a permanent or, indeed, temporary
employee of the
charity.</div><a name="06071217000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 32 to 34 deal with unmarried partners or, as I put it, people in a
relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership. There are now
many relationships that are not recognised by law, but which will have
an influence that might be perceived as inappropriate when it comes to
the appointment of people to do jobs, to work for charities and so on.
The amendments are designed to deal with
that.</div><a name="06071217000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000437"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman was admirably brief; I shall
be slightly less brief in trying to answer his questions, but I will be
as brief as I can. On amendment No. 30, to clause 36, I understand that
there are two aspects to his concern. First, he is worried that there
would not be an agreement in place when the payment was made and
therefore the agreement would be made retrospectively. Secondly, he is
worried that there would not be an agreement in place when the service
was provided and the agreement would be made
retrospectively&#151;after the service was provided. I think that
those are his two
concerns.</div><a name="06071217000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
first with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first concern, which relates to
the principle that the agreement needs to be in place before the
payment is made. I can certainly reassure him on that point, because
clause 36(2)
states:</div><a name="06071217000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
conditions A to D are met in relation to remuneration within subsection
(1), the person providing the services...is entitled to receive
the remuneration out of the funds of the
charity.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition A is
that there is an agreement set out in writing, so I hope that that
avoids the problem that he is getting at, which involves a payment
being made and an agreement being agreed post hoc&#151;after the
event.</div><a name="06071217000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
worry&#151;which the hon. Gentleman may not have had&#151;is also
covered, because the clause refers to an agreement under which the
relevant person</div><a name="06071217000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is to
provide the services in
question&#148;,</div><a name="06071217000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">which suggests
that the agreement has to be made before the services are provided. I
hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman on that
point.</div><a name="06071217000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 31, I think that we have the same end in view, but I advise the
hon. Gentleman that taking out the
words</div><a name="06071217000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or under a
contract of
employment&#148;</div><a name="06071217000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">would get
charities into precisely the pickle that we do not want to get them
into, which is that, under the clause, services can be provided that
are contractual services. The
words</div><a name="06071217000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or under a
contract of employment&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 214</div><a name="06071217000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">are in this clause, covering the
remuneration of trustees providing services, precisely so that it will
not be about contracts of employment. I hope that that explanation
satisfies the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06071217000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="06071217000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that his interesting point about cohabiting
couples or people is not immediately obvious in the Bill. However, I
hope that he will be satisfied on reading new section 73B(6) of the
1993 Act in tandem with paragraph 171(5) of schedule 8 of the Bill,
which would add paragraph 2(3) to schedule 5 of the 1993
Act:</div><a name="06071217000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where two
persons of the same sex are not civil partners but live together as if
they were, each of them shall be treated for those purposes as the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000438"></a>Mr.

but not with people of opposite

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000439"></a>Edward

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000440"></a>Peter

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000441"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I do not believe that it deals with that
eventuality. If I endeavour to take this away and scrutinise whether it
is about cohabiting partners of opposite sexes, I hope that the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight will be satisfied and will ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000442"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary referred earlier in
his remarks on amendment No. 30 to something that I fear happens from
time to time in voluntary organisations. Sometimes somebody does a
piece of work that needs doing and then says, &#147;Hey, you ought to
pay me for that!&#148; Voluntary organisations can be run in such an
informal way and that can lead to some considerable dispute. It is
worse still when such a dispute involves a trustee: first, he will know
the other trustees pretty well and, secondly, he is not entitled to the
money. That is the point that I was endeavouring to clarify, because I
do not think that it is dealt with. Such a situation could be set out
in writing subsequently and, therefore, condition A could be met
subsequent to the work being
done.</div><a name="06071217000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether the Minister is inclined to intervene to correct me, but that
was my concern. I accept that there is a requirement that the matter
should be set out in writing before the payment is made, but is there a
requirement for it to be set out in writing before the work is
undertaken?</div><a name="06071217000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister has no other light to shed on this matter, I shall withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000443"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I have some light to shed on cohabitation. Let
me correct the record on that before I return to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. Schedule 5(2)(2) of the 1993 Act is the
saviour on this matter, because it
says:</div><a name="06071217000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For the
purposes of paragraph 1(e) above a person living with another as that
person&#146;s husband or wife shall be treated as that
person&#146;s
spouse.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am reading
from page 115 of Jean Warburton&#146;s text and commentary, for those
hon. Members who wondered. I believe that that schedule also covers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 215</div>cohabitation and children, including a stepchild and an illegitimate
child, so there is reassurance on that
point.</div><a name="06071217000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the original amendment, the key
part of clause 36(3) defines the
condition</div><a name="06071217000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;under
which the relevant person is to provide the services in
question&#148;</div><a name="06071217000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">regarding the
agreement. That suggests that the agreement needs to be in place before
the services are provided. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06071217000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000444"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000445"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> In the past some charity trustees have been
remunerated. A good example is the Wellcome Foundation, which disposes
of very large sums of money and which requires dedicated trustees who
can give a great deal of time. When I became chairman of the council of
the Church of England Children&#146;s Society some 23 years ago, my
predecessor had been remunerated, but a special meeting had been
required to allow that. I hope that trustees may have such arrangements
made in appropriate circumstances, but that such special circumstances
are not very frequent. If people start to believe that there are many
situations in which trustees ought to be remunerated, that is an issue
to which Parliament should return. I hope that it will be possible to
monitor what has happened with reasonable accuracy as part of the
five-year review, so that the House can revisit the
issue.</div><a name="06071217000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000446"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman: trusteeship is
a voluntary activity and trustee status is important and valued by many
trustees around the country. There should be an exception in cases of
obvious need, but the exception must not become the rule. I hope that
there are enough safeguards in the Bill to ensure that that is the
case.</div><a name="06071217000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000450"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Amendments Nos. 28 and 122 might simply arise from
further misapprehension as to the position of a charitable incorporated
organisation. New section 73D does not appear to provide for a trustee
or an auditor of a charitable incorporated organisation to be relieved
from liability&#151;in other words, to be insured&#151;which I
believe is the purpose of the clause. That is the purpose of amendment
no. 28.</div><a name="06071217000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
38 goes in the same direction. The Charity Law Association has said
that:</div><a name="06071217000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Charity
Commission has power to relieve charity trustees and
auditors&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071217000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">of

the Court power has not been extended to allow for the relief by the
Court of charity trustees of a Charitable Incorporated

contrast, the court has already power to relieve trustees and company
directors of corporate charities under the Trustee Act 1925 and the
Companies Act
1985.</div><a name="06071217000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000451"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am impressed by the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight&#146;s search for loopholes in the legislation, and I am quite
impressed that the Government are still finding one or two typos in the
legislation, despite 70 hours of parliamentary scrutiny, and scrutiny
by some of the most eminent charity lawyers in the land. One of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s two amendments may deal with a loophole, but
not amendment No. 28. I cannot understand why the additional power is
needed for charitable incorporated organisations, as all charitable
incorporated organisations are charities. By definition, therefore, the
powers set out in new section 73D of the Charities Act 1993 will also
apply to charity incorporated organisations, and they will not have
different books to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 217</div>be audited. As far as I can tell, amendment No. 28 is unnecessary, but I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments on
it.</div><a name="06071217000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Isle of Wight may well have found a loophole with amendment No.
122. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments on it, because at
the moment the commission seems to be the sole holder of the power to
relieve trustees and auditors from breach of trust or duty on the part
of CIOs. The courts may well have been missed out of that process. I
view that amendment
sympathetically.</div><a name="06071217000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000452"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I shall speak to amendment No. 132. Clause 38
is about the power of the commission &#147;to relieve trustees,
auditors etc. from liability for breach of trust or duty&#148;. It
says:</div><a name="06071217000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;After section 73C
of the 1993 Act (inserted by section 37 above)
insert&#151;</div><a name="06071217000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">73D Power to
relieve trustees, auditors etc. from liability for breach of trust or
duty&#148;</div> <a name="06071217000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not expect
the Minister to be able to give a detailed response, and it would not
necessarily be proper for him to do so, but it is proper for me to
raise these issues in Committee and to expect to a response, in time,
from Government. &#147;Government&#148; includes Law Officers, the
Department for Work and Pensions, which is responsible for the Health
and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and the Minister&#146;s
Department, which has responsibility for
charities.</div><a name="06071217000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern
is relatively narrow; it is about trustees of unincorporated charities.
If I described a situation in less detail than I might, it is because I
am describing circumstances in which it is probable that there will be
a prosecution. There is no prosecution at the moment, so I am within
parliamentary conventions, but I do not want to go so far as to
prejudice in any sense what might properly follow. Also, if I may
interrupt myself, when I was Minister in the Department of
Employment&#151;with responsibility for legislation on health and
safety at work and for the Health and Safety Commission, which
supervises the Health and Safety Executive&#151;almost my first
responsibility was to go to a residential property in Putney that was
the site of a gas explosion, in which people had died. When people ask
me whether I am aware of what happens when unauthorised work or
incompetent work takes place in relation to gas, my answer is yes, I
do. I met the survivors and relatives of those who died.</div>
<a name="06071217000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there has been an apparent
breach of health and safety regulations, the Health and Safety
Executive has various responsibilities. The people who do not live up
to their responsibilities are liable to prosecution. It is quite
possible that an incorporated body would be liable to prosecution, too,
in certain circumstances. The Health and Safety Executive is open about
its procedures and codes, and I pay tribute to it for that. In a letter
of 10 July to those of us who do some research on the subject, Geoffrey
Podger, the chief executive, lays out what is available&#151;and it
is well known, in any case&#151;so I pay tribute to the HSE for
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div><a name="06071217000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is open to the Health and
Safety Executive&#151;it may, in a sense, be its
responsibility&#151;to consider prosecuting not only the workers and
those who supervise them, but the body that is in effect the employer.
Were a charity to be incorporated, individual trustees would not be
open to individual prosecution unless they had done something so
negligent or so deliberate that they opened themselves up to that
possibility. Normally, it would be an incorporated body that would be
exposed to the risk. There are a large number of unincorporated trusts
around the country. Many of those trustees would probably understand
that they could be regarded as employers. They might think that they
have a chief executive and that the chief executive is the person who
provides the employment role, but in fact the trustees do. If the
charity is incorporated, they are exposed to risk.</div>
<a name="06071217000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I think that
amendment No. 132, having two points, properly comes under clause 38.
The first provision that it would insert
is:</div><a name="06071217000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(7) Any
prosecution of a trustee of an unincorporated charitable trust under
section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (c.37) shall
require the consent of a law officer and the Charity Commission and
must satisfy the public benefit
test.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Podger helpfully points out that the Attorney-General would have the
power to discontinue an action by directing that a nolle prosequi be
entered</div> <a name="06071217000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in any
proceedings upon indictment at any time after the bill of indictment is
signed and before judgment but not before the bill of indictment has
been preferred. The effect is to put an end to the prosecution but it
does not equate to a discharge or an acquittal and the accused can
still be re-indicted.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071217000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">He advises me by extension that the use
of the power is rare and that it is up to me if I want to pursue the
matter with the
Attorney-General.</div><a name="06071217000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Graham
Zellick, former vice-chancellor of the university of London, made a
similar point in a letter to a law officer, saying that a prosecution
by the Health and Safety Executive is not currently a matter for the
Attorney-General but deserves consideration in the future. The
Attorney-General has power to halt prosecutions, and the particular
matter that I am concerned about has been drawn to his
attention.</div><a name="06071217000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Graham
Zellick and I are trustees of a trust that had almshouses. With the
Charity Commission&#146;s permission, we sold the almshouses and put
the money into another charity, and homes are now provided to twice as
many people. The events that took place did not take place in one of
the homes that we as trustees had effectively helped to
fund.</div><a name="06071217000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
Charity Commission&#146;s leaflet &#147;Responsibilities of Charity
Trustees: A Summary&#148;. I emphasise that it is a summary, and so
would the Charity Commission if it had the chance. The leaflet, CC3(a),
is dated January 2002, and
says:</div><a name="06071217000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If your
charity needs to employ staff, you should give each employee a proper
contract of employment and a written job description making clear the
extent of his or her authority to act on your
behalf.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
charities with which I am mainly involved&#151;those associated with
the drapers&#146; livery company&#151;go through a risk assessment.
Each year, we review our responsibilities to see whether any changes
are necessary with the help of our staff. One of the issues with
almshouses is breach of regulations. Under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 219</div>&#147;Almshouses: Health and Safety&#148; in the risk assessment,
the consequences of failure to comply with legislation are a risk
of</div> <a name="06071217000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Death or
permanent disability, significant harm or lasting
effects&#148;</div><a name="06071217000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">and could
involve</div><a name="06071217000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Moderate

pm</div><a name="06071217000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not one of
the trustees involved in the incident about which I shall not go into
great detail to put it in a roundabout way, but I could have been. In
some sense, perhaps I should have been. I believe that if trustees
openly and explicitly approve health and safety procedures that
include, for example, giving the instruction that any gas work be done
by a Corgi-registered gas fitter, reasonably practical measures have
been taken. If it then turns out that work within the organisation is
done by someone who is not a Corgi-registered gas fitter, the only way
that the trustees will know that is if they are actually present to
supervise the work or when an employee gives an instruction to someone
not qualified to carry it out. I do not believe that that falls within
what is reasonably practical.</div>
<a name="06071217000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not asking the Minister to
respond to that, but I hope that what I have said will be shared, if
necessary by a case conference, with the Attorney-General, a Minister
responsible for charities, a Minister from the Department for Work and
Pensions, someone from the Health and Safety Executive and, I hope,
someone from the Health and Safety Commission as well. In my view, if a
charity explicitly approves a method of working that is required by law
and safe and it then does not happen, the fact that there are
unincorporated trustees should not make it open to prosecution unless
there is a special reason.</div>
<a name="06071217000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could read out the whole of
Geoffrey Podger&#146;s helpful letter, and there is other
correspondence but I do not think that the Committee needs to be
troubled with it. However, I will make the information available to
anyone who is interested in it. I hope that, if I withdraw the
amendment, which I think it would be proper for me to do, perhaps we
could go a stage further on Report and get a co-ordinated Government
view on the issues that I have been
raising.</div><a name="06071217000197"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000453"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I understand and am sympathetic to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument, but could he tease out for us why this
case is different from cases involving corporate
manslaughter?</div><a name="06071217000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000454"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> The police have decided that there is not a
case for manslaughter, so there is no question of corporate
manslaughter. It is not a case of manslaughter, whether by a corporate
or unincorporated body&#151;that is not in the field. There is no
question of special treatment for unincorporated trustees, as it has
been decided that there can be no prosecution for manslaughter. I hope
that that answers the hon. Lady&#146;s question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 220</div><a name="06071217000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second part of my amendment
is that the Law Officers should have the power under the 1993 Act or
the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to stop the prosecution of
a trustee of an unincorporated charitable trust if it is in the public
interest to do so. I have no doubt that every unincorporated trust in
the country will be tempted to turn itself into an incorporated trust
as more publicity becomes available on the issue that I have raised. I
do not know how many of them there are, but the Minister may know.
Perhaps when we return in the autumn, we can have a discussion about
that.</div> <a name="06071217000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be that
charitable trusts would all be wise to incorporate, but it seems that
there must be a shorter way of ensuring that justice is available on
behalf of society and the victims&#151;there certainly have been
victims. It should be open to the Health and Safety Executive to make
proper decisions on prosecutions. I am not in any sense suggesting that
its approach is improper&#151;rather the reverse. I recognise its
validity, which is open and clear, but it is not just I as a Member of
Parliament or as a trustee but Parliament and the Government as a whole
who must ensure that potential injustice is
avoided.</div><a name="06071217000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000455"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sympathetic to what the hon. Member for
Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) said, and I hesitate to question his
judgment in an area in which he is obviously expert and experienced. Of
course, he is right that there are many unincorporated trusts and that
they are an important part of the voluntary and charitable
sector&#151;a sector within a sector. Indeed, I can think of a good
example in my constituency. The Charles Irving Charitable Trust
celebrates the flamboyant and liberal life of Charles Irving, a
predecessor as MP for Cheltenham. The trustees of that body do nothing
more risky than meet to dispose of the moneys in its bank
account.</div><a name="06071217000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems a
strange response to the genuine problems that the hon. Gentleman
identified to introduce a loophole in the law that will then apply to
all unincorporated charitable trusts whether or not they have a serious
problem of risk. I cannot quite work out why he believes that CIO
status is not sufficient for the unincorporated trusts that he
described, why they should be so afraid of incorporating&#151;in a
sense, the purpose of establishing the new status is to provide a less
onerous form of incorporation&#151;or whether the current liability
that he describes is such a deterrent to forming or running
unincorporated trusts, as there are many vibrant unincorporated trusts
today.</div><a name="06071217000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
thought that a charity that owns almshouses or other physical property,
and which would obviously have a higher level of risk, probably should
be a limited liability company or a CIO. In effect, what the hon.
Gentleman is doing through his amendment is advising them not to
incorporate and then introducing a complicated exemption for them in
law. That is not in the spirit of the Bill, which is trying to move
towards more transparency and more simplicity. I would welcome the
Minister&#146;s thoughts, as I might be misreading the situation
unfairly.</div>
<a name="06071217000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000456"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I am not suggesting anything other than if the
prosecution of an unincorporated charitable trust under health and
safety provisions is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>being contemplated, it should require the consent of a Law Officer and
the Charity Commission and must satisfy the public benefit test. It is
not a loophole. If the Charity Commission, the Law Officer and the
public benefit test were satisfied, the prosecution would go ahead.
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked whether it would make sense for
people to be incorporated. The answer is clearly
yes.</div>
<a name="06071217000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000457"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> If the hon. Gentleman is right that in such
circumstances it would be sensible for those companies to be
incorporated, I am still not quite sure why the amendment is absolutely
necessary. I take his word that he is absolutely sincere in thinking
that it is and look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>
<a name="06071217000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000458"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Let me deal first with amendments Nos. 28 and
122, and then I shall come to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member
for Worthing, West. Full marks to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight in
one sense, and the hon. Member for Cheltenham in another.</div>
<a name="06071217000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 28 is unnecessary
because the provision already exists. CIOs will be charities and
therefore the trustees and auditors are already included in the power
of the commission to relieve from liability for breach of trust or duty
under clause 38. However, as spotted by the hon. Member for Cheltenham,
amendment No. 122, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight, identifies a gap in the legislation even at this late stage. We
shall come forward on Report to remedy that gap. I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment, because he has drawn our
attention to an important issue.</div>
<a name="06071217000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now deal with amendment
No. 132. Obviously, I shall start by saying that I am unable to comment
on any specific case, and I know that the hon. Member for Worthing,
West would not expect me to. My comments will be a little more general.
As a relatively junior Member of the House, I thought that the hon.
Gentleman spoke incredibly passionately and eloquently about the
subject of the amendment.</div>
<a name="06071217000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall take the matter away,
think further about it and talk to colleagues in government. The
material part of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is subsection
(7) rather than subsection (8). As he says, the little-known&#151;at
least to me&#151;procedure of nolle prosequi allows the Law Officer
to stop proceedings on indictment. A public interest test is at least
implicit, if not explicit, in that.</div>
<a name="06071217000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should take on board the
points made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham about subsection (7), as
the new form of CIO is designed precisely to provide limited liability
and those other aspects that are currently available only in company
law. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Worthing, West spoke eloquently
about some of the risks facing trustees of unincorporated trusts. The
best I can do is, as he says, not give a specific answer on the spot. I
think that he has had a response from the Charity Commission, and that
at least shows the seriousness with which it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>taking the issue and contains specific responses. I shall take the
matter away and communicate further with
him.</div>
<a name="06071217000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000459"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon.
Member for Cheltenham. I want to correct something that I said that was
wrong. It was not the police who decided not to pursue manslaughter
charges but the Crown Prosecution Service. I want to correct
that.</div> <a name="06071217000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
rightly reminded me of the helpful letter from Andrew Hind, chief
executive of the Charity Commission. I do not want to give an
unbalanced impression of that letter, but it is worth putting one
sentence on the record. He
states:</div><a name="06071217000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
share your concern that facing liabilities such as this may deter
people from becoming trustees of charities that run undertakings such
as the Whiteley Homes
Trust.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="06071217000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
interested to know whether the charity commissioners, when reviewing
their own health and safety at work responsibilities and risk
assessments, include as explicitly as the trustees of the Whiteley
Homes Trust did a requirement that gas works should be done by
CORGI-registered fitters. I should be interested to know whether the
management board of the Minister&#146;s Department or that of the
Department for Work and Pensions, which is responsible for the Health
and Safety Commission, have done a risk assessment that includes a
statement that gas works should be done by CORGI-registered fitters. I
should also be interested to know what steps have been taken&#151;or
what reasonably practicable steps will now be taken&#151;to ensure
that those measures and agreements are undertaken as they should be. I
shall not press the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000460"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks,
although I do not have specific responses on the procedures that he
raised.</div><a name="06071217000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000461"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I welcome the words of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham on amendment No. 122. He quite rightly said that amendment
No. 28 is unnecessary, but I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
words on that amendment and for his award of full marks, which should
go to the CLA&#151;which I always think of as the Country Land and
Business Association, rather than the Charity Law Association, with
which I am sure hon. Members are familiar, but there we
are.</div>
<a name="06071217000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000462"></a>Alun

of acronyms means that the Country Land and Business Association still
calls itself the CLA, even though it is has inserted the word
&#147;Business&#148; in its title.</div>
<a name="06071217000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000463"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Absolutely&#151;some of us also have
difficulties with CSAs, which are variously the Child Support Agency
and children&#146;s services authorities.</div>
<a name="06071217000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Worthing, West certainly has a point. I look forward with interest to
the response that the Minister will bring forward at a later
stage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div><a name="06071217000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000464"></a>Peter

be not be regarded as political pressure, but as a search for what is
right.</div><a name="06071217000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000465"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000466"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in
clause 40, page 40, line 19, leave
out &#145;(or any of the
purposes)&#146;.</div><a name="06071217000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is really quite a simple amendment, which invites the Minister to say
why he is happy that a charity that has, say, four purposes should be
permitted to transfer its property to a charity that might have only
one of those four purposes. In the general interests of ensuring that
the donor&#146;s wishes are applied where reasonably practicable and
where there is nothing to suggest that any of the four purposes are not
practicable, it is odd that proposed new section 74(4)(b) of the 1993
Act should say</div><a name="06071217000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or any of
the purposes&#148;.</div><a name="06071217000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I propose
the deletion of those
words.</div><a name="06071217000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000467"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman may have slightly
misinterpreted the purpose of the
words</div><a name="06071217000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or any of the
purposes&#148;.</div><a name="06071217000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">By my reading,
the purpose of those words is to allow, for example, the transfer of
property from a charity with a narrow purpose to a much larger charity
with a number of purposes, one of which might be applicable to the
charitable purpose for which the property was given or is owned.
However, more than one of its purposes might be applicable. The clause
introduces an entirely sensible flexibility into the process, so I
oppose the
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000468"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight for tabling his amendment and I shall try as best I can to
explain the clause&#151;although, as a health warning, I should say
that it is not easy to explain.</div>
<a name="06071217000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">My key response is to suggest
that new section 74A of the 1993 Act must be taken with new section
74B. In other words, for the property to be transferred, the charity
trustees of the transferor charity must be satisfied that that would
further the purposes for which the property is held. In other words,
the trustees must believe that the transfer will further and transfer
the purposes for which the gift or the assets were originally
put.</div> <a name="06071217000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can best
explain the effect of the amendment in the following way. Suppose, for
the sake of argument, a charity had purposes A, B and C and thought
about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div>transferring property to one that had purposes B, D and F. Under the
clause as it stands, the first charity could decide to transfer the
property or asset to the second charity because it had purpose B. The
second charity would not share all the first charity&#146;s purposes,
but the two would have a purpose in common.</div>
<a name="06071217000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the amendment were made, the
transfer would not be possible because the purposes of the charity to
which transfer was to take place would not be substantially similar to
the purposes of the transferring charity or any of the purposes,
because purposes B, D and F of the second charity would not be the same
as A, B and C, or as A or B or C. That explanation is incredibly
convoluted, but it is the best that I can do. I give way to the hon.
Member for Cheltenham, who I hope will simplify the
explanation.</div><a name="06071217000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000469"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am impressed by the Minister&#146;s attempt at
numerology. However, would a concrete example be a charity established
for the benefit of elderly people in the UK that was trying to transfer
to, for instance, Help the Aged, which is established for the benefit
of elderly people in the UK and overseas? One of the purposes would be
applicable, but not both. Flexibility on the number of purposes would
be relevant in such a
case.</div><a name="06071217000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000470"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Brilliant&#151;I give the hon. Gentleman full
marks for making the point much better than I could have done. On that
basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000235"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000471"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am certainly intrigued. The point made by the
hon. Member for Cheltenham was exactly the same as the one he made
earlier, but it was not the same as the Minister&#146;s point. I
think that the Minister said that if a charity was established for the
relief of poverty among elderly people in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight
and Sussex, it would be fine to transfer the property to a charity
whose purposes were to relieve poverty among elderly people in
Hampshire, Surrey and Kent. The Minister accepts that. If the Minister
now says that the hon. Member for Cheltenham was right and he was
wrong, I shall be prepared to withdraw my
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000236"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000474"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b><b class="B"> </b>Now I am going to cause confusion by
saying that how the hon. Gentleman just put it is correct. Now that I
think about it, the problem with the example given by the hon. Member
for Cheltenham is that the whole purpose of his first charity was
subsumed in part of the purposes of his second, so it did not accord
with my example. However, the example given by the hon. Member for Isle

mine.</div><a name="06071217000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000475"></a>Mr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 225</div>Friends who represent Hampshire&#151;and I have forgotten the name of
the other place&#151;would not be happy because their elderly people
would be deprived of the charity&#146;s benefits.</div>
<a name="06071217000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my example, the
charity&#146;s purposes are three-fold, that is, it covers Hampshire,
the Isle of Wight and Sussex. Under sub-paragraph (4)(b) any of those
purposes will do&#151;the Isle of Wight is in there, so stuff those
in Hampshire and Sussex. If that is what the Government mean&#151;but
I am prepared to give way to the hon. Member for Cheltenham who has no
interest in
this.</div><a name="06071217000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000476"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister was correct in pointing out the flaw
in my earlier, perhaps simplistic, example. In the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s example, if the property was in the Isle of Wight
and had been given by the donor for the benefit of the relief of
poverty in the Isle of Wight, it would happily transfer under the
clause and have difficulty transferring if the amendment were
made.</div><a name="06071217000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000477"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It would, but that does not meet the requirements
set out in sub-paragraph (4)(a), which states that it must
be</div><a name="06071217000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expedient in the
interests of furthering the purposes for which the property is
held&#148;</div><a name="06071217000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">to transfer it to
be &#147;any of the purposes&#148; of the transferor
charity.</div> <a name="06071217000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can only
repeat the example. Let us say that the property is money rather than
real property. It is held for the benefit of pensioners in those three
counties and is transferred to a charity that only has the interests of
pensioners in one of those counties. The Isle of Wight Society for the
Blind is a good example of a charity to which to transfer their
property. The benefit is being reduced by two-thirds&#151;rather more
given the relative populations of the three counties. Two-thirds of the
prospective beneficiaries are cut off from
benefit.</div><a name="06071217000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000478"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sorry to be picky, but surely that would
fail test A, so it would not actually
apply?</div><a name="06071217000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000479"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I accept that would fail test A. In that case, I
still do not understand why it is possible for there to be one purpose
in common. If the hon. Member for Cheltenham&#146;s thesis is right,
one purpose is okay. However, if the Minister&#146;s thesis is right,
then one purpose is not
okay.</div><a name="06071217000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000480"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> This is a shadows and fog debate. We should step
outside of the ivory tower for one minute. There is a context to the
provision. It is about charities whose gross income in the last
financial year did not exceed &#163;10,000. Transfer requires a
two-thirds vote of the trustees and it has to further the purposes for
which the property is held by the transferor charity.
</div><a name="06071217000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Isle of Wight is incredibly ingenious, as he has proved in this
Committee, and he has managed to think of an example. However, I do not
quite see why anyone would set up a charity for the three purposes that
he described. If they did, why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 226</div>would they want to &#147;stuff&#148;&#151;as he so eloquently put
it&#151;the people of Hampshire by transferring the money
elsewhere?</div><a name="06071217000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am all in
favour of intellectual and abstract debate. However, on this occasion,
I think that the clause is fine. We can trust the trustees of those
small charities to make the right decisions and I suggest that we move

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000484"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Amendments Nos. 41, 42 and 43, taken together,
would mean that the period required for a charity to change its rules
was the period set out in the Bill or the period set out in the rules
of the charity, whichever was the greater. That is for the avoidance of
doubt. Amendment No 126 to clause 42 specifies that that action cannot
be backdated. We will shortly find out whether that is part of general
charity law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 227</div><a name="06071217000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 125 to clause 42
is another of those for which I am indebted to the Charity Law
Association, which tells me that it assumes that the intention behind
clause 42 is to allow unincorporated charities to change anything in
their governing documents other than those things that would affect the
way in which the charity deals with its property. I am told that that
more or less mirrors the power of amendment enjoyed by charitable
companies.</div> <a name="06071217000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
association welcomes that aim, but does not consider that the current
wording offers such a broad power. It has been suggested that the
wording allows charities to change pretty much anything, because the
word &#147;trusts&#148; is as defined in the Charities Act 1993.
Section 97 of that Act states that</div>
<a name="06071217000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;trusts&#148; in relation to a
charity, means the provisions establishing it as a charity and
regulating its purposes and administration, whether those provisions
take effect by way of trust or
not&#148;.</div><a name="06071217000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to say
that the definition is broad enough to cover all aspects of a
charity&#146;s governing document, but that proposed new section 74D
does not apply to all a charity&#146;s trusts.</div>
<a name="06071217000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection 2(a) and (b) of the
proposed section 74D restrict the application of the section in such a
way that it will not apply to administrative provisions that are not
connected either to powers exercisable by the charity&#146;s trustees
or procedures to be followed. For example, it will not allow trustees
to change provisions on the minimum number of trustees. Arguably, it
would not allow them to change provisions about the quorum for trustee
meetings, as it is unclear whether that falls within the term
&#147;procedure&#148;. The provision would add a new subsection
(3), applying to all provisions relating to the execution of the
trusts. This is sufficient to widen the power to cover areas missed by
the existing wording without enabling trustees to make changes to the
way the charity can use its property.</div>
<a name="06071217000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000485"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendment No. 102 would amend proposed new
section 74D(4)(b) of the 1993 Act. At present, the new subsection (4)
provides that</div>
<a name="06071217000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any resolution of the
charity trustees under subsection (2) must be approved by a further
resolution which is passed at a general meeting of the body...by a
decision taken without a vote and without any expression of
dissent.&#148;</div><a name="06071217000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
unusually high test of consent. A number of examples spring to mind
when that might be difficult to achieve. A Quaker meeting is an obvious
one. Another is when there has been debate and discussion, and dissent,
but a consensus is reached with the resolution not being put to a vote.
In that context, I shall not press the amendment to a Division, thereby
illustrating that it is possible to have debate and dissent but to
achieve a resolution that is perfectly satisfactory to all concerned.
It seems like a sensible, almost drafting amendment that would remove a
strangely strict test of consent from subsection
(4)(b).</div><a name="06071217000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary&#146;s response to
many of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. I
am sympathetic to amendment No. 41 because the trustees of a charity
have a drastic power. We are discussing a charity that holds no
designated land. It is neither a company nor an incorporated body and
its gross income in its past financial year was less than
&#163;10,000. In effect, therefore, the charity trustees may resolve
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 228</div>replace any or all of the purposes of the charity with other purposes.
That is a drastic step and, even for a small charity, it is important
for safeguards to be in place. Amendment No. 41 would provide a
safeguard for the notification of members within the minimum period of
28 days. That is sensible and it would make a good improvement to the
clause.</div><a name="06071217000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
125 would add the execution of the trusts to the modifiable powers of
an unincorporated charity. I shall not pass judgment on that, but will
await the Parliamentary Secretary&#146;s remarks with interest.
Amendment No. 42 also seems sensible. It would ensure that all members
have been notified of the meeting at least 28 days in advance. It is
consistent with the other amendments. I also support
it.</div><a name="06071217000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000486"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> The Minister will note that, under amendment
No. 42 to which the hon. Gentleman just referred, mention is again made
of the word &#147;body&#148;. I should be glad to receive a
response about
that.</div><a name="06071217000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000487"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Let me start by answering the question about the
word &#147;body&#148;. A &#147;body&#148; is distinct from a
person and could either be a corporate body or an unincorporated
body.</div><a name="06071217000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000488"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Will the Minister care at some stage to share
with us how it differs from
institution?</div><a name="06071217000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000489"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I will definitely at a later
date.</div><a name="06071217000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn now
to the amendments, starting with Nos. 41, 42 and 102. Amendment No. 41
tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight would place a decision
about replacing any of the charities&#146; purposes on the membership
of the charity, if it were a charity with membership. I am not sure
that that is necessary. In fact, it is not. The duty of the charity and
the responsibility for its administration rests with the trustees. It
should be their decision and, at least, two thirds of the trustees must
vote for a resolution. Secondly, the trustees must satisfy themselves
that it is in the interests of the charity to proceed with such a
resolution. In any case, the two-thirds majority reflects the 1993 Act.
I do not believe that it is for us in the House to say to charities
throughout the country that are, at present, governed by their trustees
that it is now for members to make the decision. That would be a
substantial change. It would be an imposition from the House on those
charities, whatever the nature of their procedures, that the membership
should
decide.</div><a name="06071217000274"></a>

of democratic membership organisations. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] If the

governing instruments of a charity are generally the memorandum and

organisation, those documents may well give sovereign 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 229</div>power to the membership that may comprise people who elect the trustees.
That does not take away the trustees&#146; responsibilities, but it
does give, in some sense, sovereign power to the membership. For a
democratic membership organisation, this seems a perfectly reasonable
amendment.</div><a name="06071217000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071217000491"></a><b class="B">Tom

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000492"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000494"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> Given the scenario that the hon. Member for
Cheltenham describes, if a membership organisation took a decision that
was challenged legally, it would always be the trustees or the
directors who were responsible for defending that challenge, not the
membership as a whole. Is that not
correct?</div><a name="06071217000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000495"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is certainly my understanding. I know that
the hon. Member for Cheltenham is a great expert, but I just point out,
by the way, that Liberal Democrats should be careful what they say
about membership organisations. I believe that they did not know the
addresses of any of their members when their election took place.
Anyway, members almost never have voting rights over the matters
covered by proposed new section 74D(2). Members vote to elect trustees
and for similar purposes, so this does not usurp membership rights.
However, if the hon. Gentleman has information that contradicts that, I
will happily give way to
him.</div><a name="06071217000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000496"></a>Martin

trustees. Clearly, that is not so.</div>
<a name="06071217000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may answer the
intervention from the hon. Member for High Peak, of course a resolution
by the membership binding the trustees has to be in order; it has to be
within the bounds of charity law itself. Therefore, I suppose that it
would be the legal officer&#151;the company secretary or the CIO
secretary&#151;who would be responsible for defending such a
resolution in the case of it being challenged. However, the purpose of
the amendment is not to usurp the rights of trustees. It seems to me
that the purpose is merely to insert a provision that ensures that the
membership is consulted.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 230</div><a name="06071217000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000497"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I do not think that the provision is about the
membership being consulted. The amendment
states:</div><a name="06071217000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the rules of the charity provide that its members have the power to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000498"></a>Mr.

not being perfectly drafted. It
states:</div><a name="06071217000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the rules of the charity provide that its members have the
power&#148;.</div><a name="06071217000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, there
is no intention to usurp the power of trustees in that
respect.</div><a name="06071217000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
always remember that there are two kinds of member. There are
membership organisations, which may be unincorporated and which have
members, and the rules may provide that those members have a right to
vote. There are also incorporated organisations, of which the directors
are members. There may be as few as two. However, in either
circumstance, it does not seem unreasonable that where members have the
power to vote, they should be provided with the power to vote, and we
are just giving them time to vote in our proposed new subsection
(8A)(a). I forget exactly what the purpose of our proposed new
subsection (8A)(b) was, but it was not intended to usurp the power of
charity trustees. It may well be that my amendment is defective in that
respect and I will have to think about it a bit more before I wind up
on this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000499"></a>Edward

but let me move on. Amendment No. 42 also specifies a minimum period of
28 days for unincorporated charities to provide notice of a general
meeting at which a resolution modifying the powers or procedures of the
charity is to be considered. Again, however, it is not for us in this
House to impose on organisations the notice period for a general
meeting. The commission&#146;s model governing documents for
unincorporated associations suggest a notice period of at least 14 days
to members and trustees, unless all agree to a shorter notice period.
However, the period may vary from one organisation to the next, so, in
the interests of flexibility, I am not persuaded by amendment No.
42.</div><a name="06071217000362"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

misplaced, and I shall try to explain why. As drafted, clause 42 allows
for a resolution to be approved by a decision taken at a general
meeting without a vote and without any expression of dissent. However,
the key point is that clause 42 allows for dissent in the debate, even
though it requires a decision

Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): If I understand clause
41 correctly, we are talking only about where an organisation&#146;s
gross income in the past financial year did not exceed &#163;10,000.
The figure of &#163;10,000 recurs throughout the Bill as though it
describes a small charity, but it almost seems to have been plucked out
of thin air. If in the previous two years a charity had raised
&#163;1 million but then stopped fundraising, it would still fall
under that category. The issue relates to the earlier question about
auditing. Perhaps the Minister could reflect on that point and consider
whether &#163;10,000 is a catch-all amount or whether more
consideration should be
given.</div><a name="06071217000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000501"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The problem is that we have to draw the line
somewhere, although I am happy to consider the issue again. No doubt
when we consider the threshold in the Bill, that will be raised again,
as the hon. Gentleman makes an important point. However, I am aware
that time is marching on, so let me make
progress.</div><a name="06071217000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 43 stands in the name of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. I
confess that we do not totally understand the nature of his amendment,
because it is not wholly clear what is meant by &#147;whichever is
more onerous&#148;. I do not know whether I missed that in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks, but perhaps he would like to explain it to
us.</div><a name="06071217000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000502"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It simply meant that the charity might have
already set out procedures that require more than a two-thirds majority
or something else, in which case it would seem reasonable for the
charity to adhere to those
procedures.</div><a name="06071217000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000503"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That might indeed be reasonable, but proposed
new sections 74D(4)(a) and 74D(4)(b) of the 1993 Act are relatively
onerous procedures as they stand. I am not sure that we necessarily
need more onerous procedures than those.</div>
<a name="06071217000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000504"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> If I understand amendment No. 43 correctly, the
hon. Member for Isle of Wight is not proposing to make any procedures
more onerous than they are already. He is in fact doing the
reverse&#151;he is trying to prevent the Bill from making procedures
that are less onerous than those that the charity has set itself under
its own rules, terms and conditions. However, I am not sure that
amendment No. 43 makes that entirely clear, so perhaps the general
point could be considered, rather than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment as drafted.</div>
<a name="06071217000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000505"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I shall endeavour to take the point away and
consider it, in order that we can make further 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 232</div>progress. Let me now turn to amendments Nos. 125 and 126, on both of
which I hope that I can offer satisfactory
reassurance.</div><a name="06071217000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s wish for trustees to
make suitable modifications to the powers and procedures of the
charity. He named a couple of specific issues about which he was
concerned, and I am assured that those that he named come within
subsections (2)(a) and (b) as inserted by clause 42, and that the
amendment is therefore unnecessary. I think that the hon. Gentleman was
advised on this by the CLA, but I can give that assurance. He raised
the issues of changing the quorum level and of changing the number of
trustees. I am pretty certain that those are already covered under
subsections (2)(a) and (b) too. If they are not, we shall obviously
seek to do something about
it.</div><a name="06071217000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 126
addresses the problem of ensuring that, when trustees have made a
resolution, the date on which the resolution takes effect cannot be
earlier than the date of the resolution. We agree that that is a
necessary condition, but there is a common law rule that new rules of
unincorporated associations cannot be made retrospective in the absence
of an express power to that effect. We want to check that it is
sufficient, however. If it is not, we shall propose an amendment, and I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the point. With that, I
hope that he will withdraw his amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000506"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> With the Minister&#146;s assurances of both
kinds&#151;that my amendments are defective, where they are
defective, and that they are useful, where they are useful&#151;and
with my gratitude that he has indicated he will examine the issues, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000509"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> May I use this opportunity to follow what the
Minister said about the Society of Friends&#151;the Quakers? He
helpfully observed that, in new section 74D(4)(b) as proposed to be
inserted in the 1993 Act by section 42, the
words</div><a name="06071217000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decision taken
without a vote and without any expression of
dissent&#148;</div><a name="06071217000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">are taken to
mean that if a body&#151;including the Society of Friends&#151;took
a decision after discussion, without a vote and without dissent, that
would have the same effect as if the resolution had been passed by two
thirds of the members entitled to vote and attending. Will the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 233</div>Minister consider over the summer whether there ought to be a general
provision so that, instead of having to put such provisions into all
sorts of legislation, there would be a catch-all that would operate in
situations that would affect organisations such as the Society of
Friends? Alternatively, could he ask the Society of Friends whether
there are other provisions&#151;perhaps for incorporated charities
rather than unincorporated ones&#151;that it might be helpful to
duplicate?</div><a name="06071217000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000510"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am certainly happy to consider that. However,
is the hon. Gentleman saying that we should have a provision in the
Bill that would affect other pieces of legislation? Have I understood
him correctly?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 234</div><a name="06071217000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071217000511"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I am not trying to draft the thing off the top
of my head. What I had in mind was to say that in cases where a
recognised charity&#151;I use the word &#147;recognised&#148;
imprecisely&#151;does not take formal votes, but where there is a
requirement for a vote such as the one in the provision that I cited, a
decision taken without dissent would be regarded as
equivalent.</div>
