</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remaining provisions of the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 91 to 97; Clauses 100 to 107; Clauses 19 to 24; Schedule 1; Clause 30; Clause 88; Clauses 79 to 86; Schedule 6; Clause 87; Clauses 98 and 99; new Clauses, Clause 108; Schedules 7 to 10; new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The motion will defer consideration of clause 108 until the Committee has considered new clauses. On Tuesday, my hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, tabled a number of Scottish amendments. They included a group relating to the calculation of release dates when two prison sentences are imposed on separate occasions and the second is imposed before the first has expired. There are equivalent provisions for England and Wales, about which I wrote to the Committee on 23 May and which we debated on Tuesday.
<P>
The Scottish amendments have a consequential amendment in clause 108 and would probably have been grouped with the other amendments to that clause. According to the timetable that has been agreed through the usual channels, we would have reached clause 108 this afternoon. The disadvantage of that would be that the Committee would have little time to consider the amendments before they were debated. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) knows, the Government have gone to some trouble to avoid giving the Opposition too little notice of such matters. We do not wish to bounce Opposition Members into a consideration of amendments without their having a proper opportunity to study them.
<P>
It has been our practice to give the Committee a week to consider new Government amendments and we wish to continue to do that. We therefore propose that clause 108 should be considered after new clauses. The order of consideration was drawn up to ensure that all the Scottish amendments could be taken in one block. Our proposal would not alter that, but it would mean that the new Scottish clauses on sentence calculation would be taken shortly after existing Scottish amendments. That would allow members of the Committee to consider the amendments in good time.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I listened carefully to the Minister's statement about the order of consideration and I have no observations to make on the matter.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remaining provisions of the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 91 to 97; Clauses 100 to 107; Clauses 19 to 24; Schedule 1; Clause 30; Clause 88; Clauses 79 to 86; Schedule 6; Clause 87; Clauses 98 and 99; new Clauses, Clause 108; Schedules 7 to 10; new Schedules.<P>

<H4><center>Clause 91</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to release short-term prisoners on licence</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 200, in page 77, line 46, leave out `three' and insert `six'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 201, in page 78, line 36, leave out `three' and insert `six'.
<P>
No. 202, in page 78, line 37, leave out `30' and insert `60'.
<P>
No. 203, in page 78, line 36, leave out `four' and insert `eight'.
<P>
No. 204, in page 78, line 38, leave out `four' and insert `eight'.
<P>
No. 205, in page 78, line 38, leave out `eight' and insert `sixteen'.
<P>
No. 206, in page 78, line 39, leave out `one quarter' and insert `three eighths'.
<P>
No. 207, in page 78, line 40, leave out `eight' and insert `sixteen'.
<P>
No. 208, in page 78, line 41, leave out `60' and insert `30'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We deal now with provisions relating to the release of prisoners on licence, subject to home detention curfew. That is a matter on which the Opposition will have some observations to make.
<P>
Clause 91 provides for the release of prisoners on licence, with certain exceptions, and clause 92 provides for the inclusion of curfew conditions under such licences. It may therefore be convenient to discuss the two matters together.
<P>
Prisoners who may be released under such conditions are those serving short-term sentences, as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1991. These are sentences of three months or more, but of less than four years. Prisoners will be eligible to apply for release on licence, subject to home detention curfew. If successful, they will be at liberty, but subject to a curfew, for part of the time that they would have spent in custody.
<P>
Amendment No. 200 would restrict eligibility for release on licence to short-term prisoners serving six months or more rather than three months or more, as specified in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 201 to 208 would restrict the periods that could be spent by prisoners on licence in home detention subject to a curfew The Opposition understand that that curfew will be operated electronically.
<P>
The amendments reflect our anxiety that the arrangements for early release through tagging will create too large a difference between the nominal length of the sentence and the period that prisoners spend in custody. Sentences will not mean what they say. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, prisoners serving sentences of three months or more, but less than four years, are automatically released on licence at the halfway point of their sentence.
<P>
Release on home detention curfew will be added to release on licence. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, a prisoner sentenced to six months' imprisonment which is the maximum sentence that the magistrates court can impose for a single offence is eligible for release after three months.
<P>
Under clause 91, a prisoner will be eligible for release after serving a quarter of his sentence. That means that a prisoner sentenced to six months' imprisonment will spend only about six weeks in physical custody. The Minister of State confirmed that in a letter, which was most helpful in disclosing the Government's intentions; but our opinion of those intentions is a different matter altogether.
<P>
We think the provision for early release is unlikelyto engender public confidence in sentencing. The Government profess to set great store by such confidence. The Committee will remember from earlier debates that confidence in sentencing is a great objective of the sentencing advisory panel to be created by the Government.
<P>
How will public confidence in sentencing be enhanced when the public discover that prisoners sentenced to six months' imprisonment will spend only six weeks in custody? The public will come to the conclusion that sentences do not mean what they say. They will not be impressed by arguments advanced by the Government in support of early release from sentences.
<P>
At Home Office Question Time, the Home Secretary spoke of giving prisoners time to prepare for their release. That is rather strange, when prisoners are already released at the halfway point of their sentences. As they spend such a short time in prison, they are more likely to spend time preparing for imprisonment. Is not half of the sentence long enough for prisoners to prepare for release?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> The hon. Gentleman has indicated his anxiety about early release of prisoners. He would not want to be accused of having double standards, so perhaps he will comment on the early release of 500 prisoners by the previous Home Secretary. When the Conservatives changed the parole rules and secured the early release of thousands of prisoners in 1987, there was no tagging or other protection for the public. If the hon. Gentleman seeks to condemn the Labour Government, will he also condemn the previous Home Secretary and the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister and his officials have undertaken a deep trawl in search of examples. I was not a Member of Parliament at that time, neither was the Under-Secretary. [Interruption.] No, I was not a Member of Parliament in 1987. It is easy to find historical examples, but I compare the Bill with the practice of honesty in sentencing that the previous Government began to adopt at the end of their term of office. The Minister will not get around questions about honesty in sentencing by trawling for past incidents.
<P>
The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 provides for increasing honesty in sentencing by making sentences correlate more with the length of time spent in custody. Time spent in custody should bear some relation to sentences. The Under-Secretary's trawl for previous examples did not justify the Home Secretary's reason of giving prisoners longer to prepare. He will have to provide a better defence than that for the Home Secretary's reasoning.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's explanation sounds like a hastily invented rationale for a decision that was made for other reasons, which are probably linked to public spending other examples of that have been found during our proceedings and perhaps the problem of prison overcrowding. If we can move from honesty in sentencing to honesty in policy making, perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us whether overcrowding is part of the policy reason for the clause. We could then have a frank discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain the previous Government's failure, when he was a Member of Parliament, to make proper provision for prison places for people who needed to be detained? The incoming Government had to find an extra £43 million, for which the previous Government had not budgeted, to build two new prisons. We were prepared to do that. The hon. Gentleman talks about protecting the public, but he was not prepared to provide the means of achieving it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are used to the Government's reflex action of referring to the previous Government every time they are asked about their policies. It would have been valuable to have had a grown-up discussion about policy making and prison overcrowding. The Under-Secretary said nothing of substance; he simply made another party political broadcast in response to a serious point from which we could perhaps have progressed to common ground. I hope that the Under-Secretary's next contribution will be better than his previous intervention, which did not do justice to the debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The important point is that the hon. Gentleman suggests that the Conservative party would protect the public more than the Government would. I shall deal with the points about the orders when I reply to the debate. However, throughout the debate, the hon. Gentleman has applied double standards. He tries to present the Conservative party in a light that the facts do not justify. The previous Government made no provisions for dealing with the prison population; we had to find£43 million for that. The hon. Gentleman must acknowledge that if his points are to have any integrity.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps we should return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Indeed. I was trying to ascertain the real reason for the provision so that we could have a sensible discussion.
<P>
The amendments would increase the length of time that prisoners spend in physical custody to make sentences correspond more with time spent in prison.
<P>
I infer that tagging will be used in the way that the clause suggests to tackle prison overcrowding. If so, the Government should consider a different way of dealing with the problem. Instead of simply using home detention curfew to solve the problem, they should have considered increasing the confidence of sentencers in home detention curfew as an alternative to sentences of imprisonment at the lower end of the scale, rather than going for blanket eligibility for all prisoners sentenced for three months up to four years. That would have been better. We think, and this is perfectly consistent with what the last Government did, that home detention curfew can play a role in sentencing.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Minister, I do not want to go through a deep trawl of what people have said in the past, but only a very shallow trawl would be needed to find plenty of quotations from Labour spokesmen up to the fairly recent past condemning home detention not just in practice, but in principle, as a way of dealing with prisoners. That part of the Labour party has now been purged, and there was also the purge in the Home Secretary's Second Reading speech.
<P>
I will not go over old ground, but we have always thought that home detention curfew electronic tagging has value as a sentence in its own right. It has taken time to get it right and to get the technology working as well as one would want it to work to give sentencers the confidence that it can be used, but it is being used by sentencers now. In areas where it has been available on a pilot basis as an alternative to sentence it has been successful. I speak from memory but I think that that is in Norwich, Reading and Manchester. The Government are now seeking to contract for electronic tagging to become available throughout the country, thus implementing the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.
<P>
Sentencers who have used electronic tagging have expressed confidence in it. I visited Manchester fairly recently to see the electronic tagging scheme being used by Securicor. The figures I was quoted showed that the magistrates court there had made considerable use of it. That use could be extended throughout the country. That may be a better way to encourage sentencers' confidence in home detention curfew as a high-tariff sentence, possibly in combination with other sentences.
<P>
It would make much more sense for home detention curfew to be used as a sentence in its own right and passed by the courts than for, as the Government propose, prisoners to be eligible for an early release through home detention curfew, irrespective of what the sentencers have passed. That will worry not just the sentencers, but members of the public. It will do no good for public confidence in sentencing if it is discovered that a prisoner who had been sentenced to six months, two years or three and a half years is out and about in a very short time. He may be out and about in the neighbourhood and we know what problems that can cause.
<P>
Our other concern is that the Government are casting the net rather wide. We are talking about sentences from three months to four years which can cover some fairly serious offending. We shall turn in debates on later amendments to prisoners who are in custody for some serious offences in that range. With certain exceptions, they will all be eligible for this early release, perhaps with different types of assessment. That is going about it in the wrong way. In the end, the public will conclude that sentences do not mean what they say. The amendments would make things a little better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. I have examined the clause and amendments carefully and I think that it is important to consider the big picture. My hon. Friend was right to remark that sentences should mean what they say. Increasingly now, sentences mean no such thing. I remarked a day or so ago on the wording, issued by the Judicial Studies Board, that must now be used when sentencing prisoners. It is something of a mouthful. It is important for the public to have confidence in the sentencing process. I am not certain that they will when the clause becomes law.
<P>
The key question to be considered is the clause's background. The clause in effect provides for the relevant prisoners, after serving the requisite period of a sentence, to be let out and to be subject to a curfew thereafter. The background to that proposal is either one of compassion a Government desire to release more prisoners so that they can return to society to fulfil and improve themselves or of facing the hard-nosed, practical problem of prison overcrowding. I suspect that an honest answer to the question why the clause is proposed would be that there are too many people in prison and something must be done about it. Instead of "Release and recall of prisoners"	, the clause heading might well be "Release and recall of prisoners due to too many in prison"	.
<P>
I recognise that the fact that too many people are in prison, given the places available, was a problem for the previous Government as well as the present one. I recall that Lord Hurd, who at the time in question was Home Secretary incidentally, I think that the date of 1986 or 1987 given by the Under-Secretary was right effectively indulged in what might be called an executive decision to release, to make prisons slightly less crowded. I think that that is what the Minister was referring to earlier. Perhaps he could confirm it with a nod.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> indicated assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> It was a practical reaction to overcrowding in prisons, and since then more prison places have been created by Conservative Governments. However, it would not be right to say that there are enough places to cope with all those being sent to prison.
<P>
I guess that the prison population stands at 63,000 or 64,000, or thereabouts, and it is about to rise. I should be interested in the projections of the number of people in prison in 2000. On present trends I should imagine that the number can only rise. That is a pity not only in principle it being no great thing to have people in prison if it can be avoided, although some must go there but in practice, because it is very expensive. It would be helpful to know the likely numbers of prisoners and places.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary also comment on existing overcrowding in prisons? It would be helpful if we knew, in debating early release, how many prisoners are confined in too small a space. I would also be grateful to hear the up-to-date figure of how much it costs to keep an adult prisoner in prison for a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting contribution, but will he tell us his thoughts on the problems that could arise as a result of prisoner overcrowding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Terrible problems. The first is the sheer inhumanity of it: overcrowding people too much is not humane and it is not right. Many further problems arise consequentially lack of discipline among inmates, bad behaviour and a lesser chance of a prisoner leading a fruitful life that might produce a mature and better behaved person on release. Huge dissatisfaction among prison staff is another problem because they have to cope with all the problems of overcrowding.
<P>
I make the point in a non-partisan way: all Governments have to grapple with those problems. To that extent I understand the purpose of the clause, which is a reaction to a practical problem rather than a statement of principle on the merit of early release of prisoners. The clause is attending to a practical problem.
<P>
I am worried about sentencing in the magistrates courts. Let me take a rather extreme example. Effectively, the chief stipendiary magistrate of this country will be able to send an offender to prison for a maximum of six weeks, and it is understandable to think that that is not enough. I may have misunderstood I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but it seems that someone sentenced in a magistrates court to six months' imprisonment will have to serve one quarter of it, or six weeks, which then becomes the maximum that can be imposed for any sentence by any magistrate. That is a problem.
<P>
I have felt for some time and I believe that the Government are beginning to feel it that because of the cost of dealing with cases in the Crown Court, there may in years to come be an alteration in the jurisdiction of magistrates courts. Many people have argued that stipendiary magistrates and perhaps magistrates should have increased jurisdiction and increased sentencing powers. "Keep more cases down below"  on expense grounds seems to be the philosophy and if that means altering the jurisdiction and sentencing powers of lower courts, so be it. If that happens and it would certainly save time and money it will not be five minutes before we have to consider the issue again and amend the provisions.
<P>
Does six months mean six weeks? I think so. Does four months mean serving a quarter of that? That is a specific question. Again, I believe that it does. Subsection (4)(b) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for a term of four months or more"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the requisite period is "one-quarter of the term"	. Hence only one month of a four-month sentence is served. Does it follow that for a three-month sentence, 30 days has to be served, or am I muddled? Subsection (4)(a) states that for a sentence of three months, the requisite period is30 days. I may not have read the provision carefully enough, but it seems that a three-month sentence means serving 30 days and a four-month sentence means serving 30 days. If anyone can tell me that I am wrong, I will be very pleased to hear it. If I am right, one can imagine the scene when a magistrate at Bow street court sentences two defendants in the dock. He may say, "Smith, you have behaved disgracefully. You will go to prison for three months and will serve one month. Brown, you have behaved even more disgracefully. You will go to prison for four months, but you will serve one month as well."	 I may have misunderstood the provision, but it is interesting that a three or four-month sentence may boil down to the same thing.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the Minister also tell us the effect of a two-and-a-half-month sentence? How long will a person serve if he is sentenced to two and a half months in prison? Before long, a magistrates court will sentence someone to that term in prison. Am I right in assuming that, under the law as it will stand, that person will serve one and a quarter months? If so, a person serving a two-and-a-half-month sentence may serve more time than someone sentenced to three or four months. That would be ludicrous. It would result in advocates in the courts urging the bench not to pass a short sentence or two and a half months, but a longer one of three months.
<P>
It is readily understood that our prisons are extremely crowded. However, I remind the Minister of the need for the public to be confident in our sentencing process and of the need for prisoners and the public to understand what sentencing means. It is not a sound principle to tamper with sentences to achieve a desired practical result if the sentencer finds that he is guided by what is deemed to be politically expedient rather than by what is necessary to fit the crime.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough):</B> It might be helpful to deal with the history of electronic tagging. It goes back a long way to the previous Government's Green Paper "Punishment, Custody and the Community"	, which was published in July 1988. It suggested electronic tagging and pilot studies.
<P>
The criminals who took part in the pilot projects said that they preferred tagging to custody even though they felt that it was quite demanding. As a result of the pilot study, section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided for electronic tagging. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, the Labour party fiercely opposed tagging at all stages during the passage of that Bill. It was therefore interesting to hear the present Home Secretary stand that policy on its head in a statement to the House. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Tagging has a key role to play here. If prisoners who are serving short-term sentences are tagged towards the end of the custodial period of their nominal sentence, they can be given the opportunity to structure their lives more effectively and be swiftly brought back to prison if they breach the tagging conditions."	 [Official Report, 20 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 454.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Was that a conversion on the road to Damascus, or a conversion on the road from the Treasury? I suspect that it was the latter.
<P>
For understandable reasons, the Labour party was strongly and ideologically opposed to the principle of criminals having bits of electronic gear attached to them. That was its traditional stance. However, the Labour Government's policy on prisons is now in deep trouble. They promised that they would be tough on crime and were strongly, ideologically and rigorously opposed to the privatisation of prisons. At every step of the way, the Labour party said in the strongest terms that it was outrageous and wrong for the state to contract out its duty to lock people up.
<P>
Labour members of the Committee remain supine while their own Government introduce electronic tagging not for the good reason of helping the convicted criminal, but to save money and carry on the previous Government's policy of building and running privatised prisons.
<P>
The Minister is buried deep in his notes and he knows that there is no answer to my argument. He knows that the Government have stood completely on their head and that the clause has nothing to do with preparing criminals for life outside prison but everything to do with saving money. To that extent, it is a disgrace. The Opposition will repeatedly bring that fact to the public's attention. The public are increasingly aware that sentences do not mean what they say and they are angry about that.
<P>
In previous debates, I alluded to the extreme complexity of sentencing policy and of the guidelines imposed on judges. They make it virtually impossible for criminals or the public to understand what is going on. However, the public are increasingly aware of the fact that criminals are set free halfway through short sentences. They know that criminals do not serve the nominal period.
<P>
Someone can be sentenced to a mere four years for a serious crime, which deeply alarms the public. After two years, that person is let out of prison, and the Bill will shorten that period to 22 months. I suspect that the time served will become even shorter in future. Someone committing a serious crime may be sentenced to four years, but may be sent home after 22 months. He is able to start wallpapering and painting his home and enjoying himself in his own surroundings. If anyone thinks that that is an adequate deterrent, the public will be outraged. They will be even more cross when they discover that the clause has nothing to do with preparing defendants for life outside, but has everything to do with saving money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. By pointing to the fact that the Government may shorten the period served even further, he has drawn our attention to the power that the Secretary of State may take upon himself under subsection (5). He can amend "the requisite period"	. The Minister will no doubt confirm that that will enable him to shorten the periods still further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There is no doubt that the clause is dangerous. The Labour party did not come clean with the electorate and the Government do not have enough money to run the prisons. All the gimmicks in the Bill are designed to hide that fact. it merely carries on the work of the previous Government with the addition of a few gimmicks that will make no difference at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> As the hon. Gentleman is talking about coming clean, will he tell us how far the previous Government came clean about the number of prison places that they had available to implement their policies? When we came into office, we announced an additional £112 million for next year to make up the deficit that we found. The previous Government made no provision for protecting the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister is leading with his chin. He knows that our plans were perfectly sensible and that they relied on the provision of additional private prisons, which the Labour party rigorously and ideologically opposed. That is why it had to perform a U-turn when it came to power. However, it should have seen the problems coming, and it would have been more honest to have told the public about them earlier.
<P>
I do not know whether the Minister saw "Newsnight"	 a couple of days ago. Various reports slated his policy on prisons and private prisons. If I were a member of the Labour party with a record of traditional Labour beliefs, I should be very worried about what was going on in privatised prisons. However, of course, the Labour party will not say anything at the moment, but keeps quiet because it is under the control of the Treasury.
<P>
I am concerned about risk assessment. It is pretended that the prisoners concerned will receive a proper assessment before they go home. I wonder how rigorous it will be. The Home Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Prison Service will in each case conduct a risk assessment. If the prisoner fails it, he or she will continue to serve the sentence in prison until its halfway point, as now."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder how many prisoners will fail that test; very few, I suspect. The Home Secretary also said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the monitoring will be provided by private sector contractors, and there will be an invitation to tender in due course."	 [Official Report, 20 November 1997, Vol. 301, c. 455.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend made an intriguing point about how many prisoners would fail the risk assessment test. Does he agree that the numbers passing or failing would be bound to be dictated by practical considerations? The message would go out that it was necessary for 30 per cent. of the prisoners to be removed from the prison, and that they should pass the test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I hope that the Minister will speak in some detail about the level of the prison population, the number of prisoners who might be released and the savings that might accrue to the Treasury. As we now know that the provision is all about saving money, I hope he will come clean.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We envisage that between 45 per cent. and 60 per cent I suppose the working figure would be about half of the relevant prisoners would pass the test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, in a written question, recently asked
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"how many prisoners (a) are currently eligible for release on home detention curfew and (b) will be released following (i) a standard assessment and (ii) an enhanced assessment."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister of State, Home Office, who has responsibility for prisons, answered:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The latest estimate indicates that, were the scheme in force, around 7,200 prisoners would currently be eligible for home detention curfew, subject to their passing a risk assessment... All eligible prisoners will have to be considered under the standard assessment"	. [Official Report, 1 June 1998; Vol. 177, c.57-58.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should still like to know how much money is being saved.
<P>
We now know what companies have been shortlisted to provide the services. They are General Security Services Corporation, Securicor, Premier Prisons and Group 4. That is ironic when one thinks of all the attacks that the Labour party made on companies such as Securicor and Group 4 and the abuse to which those companies were subjected. Now the Home Office, under the management of the new Labour party, has shortlisted them. Honourable Members should listen to the language that is being used by the Home Office about this:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Companies from a wide range of relevant sectors including the security, telecommunications and electronics industry, were invited to consider the business opportunities created by the increased use of tagging."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The business opportunities! We are talking about locking people up, and the Labour party dresses up the issue in the language of business opportunities. How low it has sunk. How much lower can it get in overturning everything that it has ever believed in?
<P>
I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine):</B> I shall try not stray too far into some of the areas of discussion that the Committee has touched on so far, which may not be quite specific to the clause although it was no doubt worth trying to get away with some of the interesting political points that were made.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will provide some clarification of matters. It is likely to create confusion in the public mind if some prisoners serve more time in prison than others who have been given long sentences. If that anomaly has crept into the measure, it would be worth attending to.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking has, perhaps, fallen into the trap that awaits all of us in politics when we think about public perceptions of how crime is dealt with, of perceiving sentences only in terms of going to prison. Our debates do not always put across the fact that a sentence often means more than just going to prison. Someone serving less time physically in prison is still serving a sentence.
<P>
It may be possible in presenting the sentence in court to put across the wider implications. For example, it could be stated: "You are sentenced to four years in prison. However, if certain conditions are met, that sentence will be achieved by you being in prison for two years but subsequently being on licence for a certain period."	 The public will not then be so affected by the headlines, often leading to a sense of betrayal that someone has not received the sentence that he should have. If the full details were read at the time, the message could be conveyed effectively and the consequences of the sentence spelt out.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important not to get into a bidding war and escalating prison numbers. Apart from the practical issue of whether sending offenders to prison is the most effective use of the finite resources that are available to protect the public and reduce crime, we need also to consider whether it is the most effective way of ensuring that individuals do not re-offend. The best way of breaking the cycle of crime, reducing the threat of crime and dealing with the problems faced by the state and individuals is to deal effectively with reoffending.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should tell the Committee that because we have ranged quite widely already, I do not propose to have a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am grateful for that, Mrs. Michie. The hon. Member for Hertsmere certainly ranged widely in his suggestion that the main issue was danger to the public. Danger to the public is a serious matter. However, we should ask whether the Conservatives have ever been serious about it. Crime remains high and during 18 years of Conservative government crime doubled. Moreover, crime victimisation levels in England and Wales during that period were the worst of 18 industrialised countries and under the Conservatives Britain became a much less safe place in which to live.
<P>
I have already mentioned that the present Government will have to find an extra £112 million next year because the previous Government failed to provide enough prisons. Conservative waffling rhetoric about locking up criminals is hollow. When they were in power they did not provide enough prisons. In 1987, the Conservative Government changed parole rules and secured the release of thousands of prisoners without thought of protecting the public. At least this Government will be making provision for tagging. It is also worth reminding the Committee that the previous Home Secretary, who spoke much about honesty in sentencing, presided over the release of 500 prisoners by mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Did not my right hon. and learned Friend the previous Home Secretary also preside over falling crime figures year on year? The crime rate dropped consecutively for four or five years.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Conservatives presided over a doubling of the crime figures. It depends on how much responsibility the hon. Member for Woking is prepared to accept for that. I note that during the years in which he was in Parliament, the crime figures were rising.
<P>
The key issue in protecting the public from crime is how we can best reduce reoffending. The noble Lord Hurd, a former Conservative Home Secretary, said in a lecture of 19 November last year:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Virtually all prisoners come out of prison. The public safety is put at risk if on release they are even less qualified to get a job and lead a law-abiding life than when they are convicted Security is not just a matter of walls and wires."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As with all good sermons, let me take that as my text for today. As well as being tough on crime and criminals, we must tackle the causes of crime. Former prisoners are less likely to offend if they are settled in work or are actively seeking work. That is why our welfare-to-work programme includes options for young people to work or train. Ex-offenders will be encouraged to become involved in that scheme. They are less likely to offend against their fellow citizens if they are given hope for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I think that the Minister makes a mistake in moving away from prison places and prison overcrowding. He is trying to put a moral gloss on a policy decision that was taken on different grounds.
<P>
The Minister wishes to link this matter to being tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. When the Labour party used that slogan, it should have had the honesty to say that it would introduce the policy of releasing prisoners who had served a quarter of their sentence. People would have been surprised to hear that that was being tough on crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The public wanted to know that a Labour Government would reduce crime and tackle it effectively. The previous Government did not do that. They presided over a period of waffle and empty hope. They did not deal with offenders and the underlying reasons for offending behaviour.
<P>
The present Government have two reason for introducing the orders. The Conservatives have posited that our priorities are prison numbers and prison places. However, in reality, our twin priorities are reducing crime and protecting the public.
<P>
Typically, criminals lead disordered and irresponsible lives. They are often poor at making sensible decisions about their future and that of their families. They do not have to make decisions in prison or get to grips with their disorderly lives. The prison system makes decisions for them and imposes order upon them. On release, prisoners suddenly have to make decisions about what to do with every moment of the day. They must decide whether to drift back into crime and rejoin the company of criminal associates or whether to bring order into their lives.
<P>
The criminal justice system must aim to punish criminals. It must also confront them with the reasons for their offending behaviour and make them change it. Prison imposes a straitjacket on criminals. Removal of that straitjacket often returns them to a disorderly life style. Strict controls in their home environment forces criminals to change their behaviour, ensuring their compliance with a demanding set of rules. Those controls force order into life outside prison. Having learned self-discipline, as opposed to acquiescence in prison discipline, offenders are more likely to carry that conduct into the period following the curfew, thus reducing their propensity to offend.
<P>
There is no guarantee that criminals will not re-offend. However, we seek to avert an unacceptable risk of that. We believe that the benefits of obligatory self-discipline will contribute to reducing crime and to protecting the public. The threat of swift imprisonment will deter criminals from failing to structure their lives effectively and from breaching the curfew.
<P>
Research on the first year of trials shows that criminals and sentencers regard tagging as a severe restriction. Following the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Conservatives appeared to proceed slowly with tagging. Trials were announced in Norfolk, greater Manchester and Berkshire, and were extended to other areas of Britain. However, sentencers were cautious in their approach to tagging. In the first year, 83 orders were imposed. In the second year, that relatively small number rose to 375. There are two key reasons for that. I confess that I was one of those who was suspicious about the quality of the equipment and whether it would work, but sentencers are now increasingly convinced that it can work and can deliver a strong penalty for those who are subject to it. They are using it as an alternative to prison.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that it should be possible to impose curfews. We are looking at that through the pilot scheme and at a roll-out programme for curfews as a sentence, but the introduction of tagging to create discipline in the transition from prison to freedom will create a level of self-discipline which will protect the public from reoffending. The prime reason that we are introducing the new order is that the current provisions do not seriously address that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister's defence of electronic tagging is noble. We agree with everything he says on that point. Will he therefore give a commitment on behalf of the Government that a prisoner will be let home on curfew with tagging only after a careful assessment and only on the basis that he himself will benefit, and not as a result of a general policy to release prisoners early in order to reduce the prison population?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I give a complete undertaking that there will be no quotas of prisoners to be released under the provision. The objective is to have a proper assessment of the acceptability of the implementation of these provisions. We are making sure, unlike previous Conservative Governments, that there will be no unacceptable risk to the public, and there will be clear tests. The hon. Gentleman raised it in his usual rather truculent manner, but risk assessment is an important matter which I want to deal with in some detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister just said about quotas. Have the Government given any estimate of the numbers they think will be released on electronic tagging?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should point out that an amendment on risk assessment is coming up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is not about risk assessment but about electronic tagging.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I appreciate that, but we have been talking quite a bit about risk assessment. Perhaps we can remember that we will have a debate on that in a few minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Michie. Perhaps the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) will bear with me if I leave until later our discussion of the way we will carry out the risk assessment. I shall return in a moment to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
It is right to confront the issue of the prison population. No Government should be as irresponsible as the previous Government were about prison overcrowding. They did not make proper provision. We want to ensure that there is proper provision and have therefore found an extra£112 million for the next financial year to deal with it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking quite rightly set out a number of his concerns about overcrowding: its inhumanity, the lack of discipline and bad behaviour it produces, the reduced chance of prisoners leading a fruitful life in future and the dissatisfaction among prison staff. I agree with the hon. Gentleman. All those problems are caused by overcrowding. Overcrowding in prisons does not reduce crime but can contribute to it. The previous Government's failure to deal effectively with anticipated prisoner numbers was a dereliction of duty they failed to protect the public.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</b> Will the Minister predict when the Government will have tackled the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government have just announced a prison-building programme, which will deal with much of the anticipated increase in the number of prisoners. We shall not easily reach an ideal position. Indeed, that would probably be one in which no one was in prison.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Is that a Labour promise or pledge?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, but if we could prevent people from offending, we would not need prisons. As long as people offend, we need prisons. Prisons must have constructive regimes, which will enable people to cease their offending behaviour, but protecting the public is the main aim.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> In the light of history, projections and demographic studies, has the Home Office assessed the likely demand for and supply of prisons? When are the two likely to meet at a point when there will be no overcrowding?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As I have just told the hon. Gentleman, we are able to make further provision, but long-term provision forms part of the comprehensive spending review. I cannot provide an ideal answer, because everything is relative. If a specific amount of prison accommodation were provided, some people would continue to find it inadequate and claim that we should go further, until we had provided the sort of luxury in prisons that my constituents would probably not support.
<P>
In the past year, the prison population has increased by 9.5 per cent. from 57,707 on 27 March 1997 to more than 65,330 in May 1998. The latest projection suggests that the prison population will increase to 66,000 by September 1998, to 71,800 by September 1999, and to 82,800 by 2002. The figure varies from day to day, but the current prison population is approximately 65,000.
<P>
The aim of the prison system is twofold. First it aims to punish. The previous Government believed that tagging was a restrictive and constructive punishment, and we have been convinced that we should support it. Secondly, prison aims to protect the public by reducing the likelihood of reoffending. Imposing self-discipline encourages a more orderly life and reduces offending. Failure to tackle overcrowded prisons will be at the expense of constructive prison regimes and the improved prospects of resettlement. The hon. Member for Woking ably identified the fact that failure to deal with overcrowding was dangerous to the public.
<P>
Amendment No. 200 would not allow prisoners serving sentences of between three and six months to qualify for home detention curfew. That would exclude many lower level offenders, who would have most to gain from home detention curfew. That is paradoxical. Criminals whose main problem is lack of self-discipline, and who commit crimes as a result of a disorderly lifestyle, often receive lower sentences. A three-month threshold maximises the impact of the home detention curfew and ensures coverage across a range of prisoners who have most to gain from the discipline of a demanding curfew. Less than three months would create an imbalance between prison and curfew. Ensuring that those serving more than three months could be included in the regime will give the public added protection because for at least a month such prisoners will be subject to a rigorous regime, which would impose self-discipline. Their re-offending would be curbed by prison discipline and by self-discipline.
<P>
Prisoners serving three months will be eligible for only two weeks on tag. There must be a minimum cut-off point to ensure that the curfew has some benefit. A period of 14 days will enable some impression to be made on the individuals who are subject to that sentence; fewer than 14 days would have no great impact on them. For those sentenced to three months, but less than eight months, the period of home detention curfew will be less than two months, and will be calculated according to a tapering scale.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 201 to 208 would redefine "the requisite period"	 to be spent in custody before Home Office detention curfew. They would dilute the effectiveness of the curfew; some offenders would not be given the opportunity offered by the Bill to benefit from such a curfew.
<P>
The Bill strikes the right balance between custody and curfew, maximising the effect of both, with one complementing the other to provide a transition between prison and freedom. It provides a proportionate approach by imposing a period of self-discipline and by balancing the length of sentence between time spent in custody and time spent under curfew.
<P>
The Government's provisions are tapered and balanced, and will impose home detention curfew regimes that range from two-weeks to two-months. The amendments are unbalanced and arbitrary, and would produce some strange results. A sentence of six months would result in a one-month detention curfew; a sentence of seven months would increase that period to 1.5 months, but a sentence of eight months would result in a reduction to one month under curfew. A sentence of 12 months would lead to1.5 months under curfew and a sentence of 14 months would result in 1.75 months. However, for some reason, the curfew periods would then be reduced: after sentences of 16 or 20 months there would be only one month under home detention curfew. That is a bizarre process.
<P>
The amendments would be damaging. The Government believe that persons serving sentences of more than eight months need about two months during which the self-discipline of the tagging regime will be imposed. The Opposition's amendments do not propose any similar period. The public will be safer if self-discipline is imposed, because criminals will be less likely to re-offend. The amendments would remove the ability to impose two-month periods of self-discipline on those at the more serious end of the offending scale, serving prison sentences of more than eight months. That is a grave indictment of the amendments.
<P>
I realise that the hon. Member for Hertsmere does not have the resources to evaluate in detail the impact of the amendments on the home detention curfew. The amendments would have a damaging effect on public safety, although I know that that is not his intention. Indeed, the Opposition want to increase the length of prison sentences.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere seems to accept the imposition of periods of home detention curfew. However, the amendments would produce arbitrary and uneven results, such that the curfews would have almost no practical benefits. I therefore ask him to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
I hope that I have covered most of the issues raised by hon. Members. The hon. Member for Gainsborough made a serious point about risk assessment, which I will deal with later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, but I probably missed his answers to my questions. Perhaps I did not. However, I shall repeat the points that I made and the Minster can tell me if I am wrong.
<P>
Under the Bill, a four-month sentence will mean that a prisoner serves one month and under a three-month sentence he or she will also serve one month, but would serve more than one month under a sentence of two and a half months. That seems ludicrous, and I asked if that was correct. Will the Minister confirm that?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes the presumption that the home detention curfew is not a part of the punishment or of the retribution. The curfew contains a punishment factor, but will also operate to change the person's offending behaviour. It is therefore part of the whole process of the sentence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking sees prison as the only part of the process 
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman interrupts again, let me deal in more detail with the point that he made.
<P>
Under the amendments that the hon. Gentleman supports, it would appear that those serving between four and six months will serve longer than the 60 days requisite period that is imposed on those serving six months. Will he confirm that? The amendments would have almost the same impact indeed, possibly a more serious impact on periods of imprisonment that he alleges would occur under the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Unlike the Minister, I have to deal with the real world. Let me offer the Committee an example. The Minister can tell me whether it is correct. If I am wrong, I shall apologise unreservedly to the Committee.
<P>
A chief stipendiary magistrate who is hearing a case involving three defendants would have to say, "Smith, you are sentenced to three months"	 
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith</b> rose <P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I cannot give way because I am intervening.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> You are speaking!
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Am I?
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> In that case, I give way.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman might consider another name for his fictional defendant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Indeed.
<P>
The magistrate has to impose a sentence. There are three defendants before him and he has to tell them how long they will spend in prison. It would be ludicrous to say to defendant A, "You will go to prison for three months, but you will serve 30 days. Defendant B, you will go to prison for four months and you will serve 30 days. Spot the difference. "As for defendant C, you played the smallest part in this crime and of the three criminals you are undoubtedly the least culpable. For that reason I shall sentence you to two and a half months in prison. However, you must understand that you will spend longer in prison than the other two defendants."	
<P>
I hope that that example has made my position clear. Will the Minister tell me if I am correct?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</b> Let me deal with one of the examples given by the hon. Member for Woking. A person serving two and a half months will be liable to serve about37 days; a person serving three months will be liable to serve 45 days, but may or may not be liable for release on home detention curfew after 30 days. Many such prisoners will not be released on curfew. The Government estimate that that will be the case for about 50 per cent. of prisoners.<P>
<P>
The Conservative amendment creates anomalies that go well beyond the hon. Gentleman's examples and takes us right into the area of the ludicrous. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the real world by the Conservative proposals would take us into an entirely unreal and bizarre world.
<P>
A home detention curfew should have a minimum period for it to be of benefit. If the curfew is to tackle self-discipline I note that the hon. Member for Hertsmere and other hon. Gentlemen have not gainsaid the issue it must have a minimum period. Otherwise it will not work. If we want a regime that benefits the public and we want the home detention curfew to prevent reoffending by imposing self-discipline, the Conservative amendment would prevent us from achieving those objectives.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I now understand the Minister's point. It makes more sense because it is now clear that a sentencer will have to tell the first defendant that he has behaved disgracefully and that he is by far the more guilty: he will therefore have to serve two and a half months. Yet the second defendant, who played only a small part in the crime, will have to go to prison for three months.
<P>
Cannot the Minister understand the complete illogicality of his position? He must take the proposal away; he has made a hash of it. He knows as well as I do it is no good to keep going back to the Conservative days that if a person sentenced to three months serves 30 days and a person sentenced to two and a half months for playing a lesser part has to serve more than 30 days, the world has gone mad. The Minister must take the provision away and reconsider it, which is all that we are urging.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has it wrong. I do not need to go back to the previous Conservative Government to examine their proposals. I have only to examine the amendment proposed by the Conservative Front Bench and highlight the anomalies that they produce.
<P>
The home detention curfew will protect the public far more than would the proposals of the hon. Member for Woking, who wants to disallow the period that we need to ensure that the home detention curfew operates effectively. If he has his way, we will not be able to impose the self-discipline that we need to impose and the likelihood of reoffending will be increased. The hon. Member for Woking would create far more anomalies than will anything proposed by the Government. Above all, he would undermine the proper protection of the public by failing to allow the orders to be imposed for a sufficiently long period.
<P>
Opposition Members should examine their proposals more carefully and ensure that they mean what they say. They cannot seriously be committed to the proposals in the amendments and I ask them to withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Not having faced an English court I hope that I shall never have to I wonder what exactly a sentencer could say in that context. Could the various elements of the sentence and particularly the fact that the licence and the home curfew are an essential part of the penalty be explained clearly and effectively by the sentencer?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The answer is yes, but it may be difficult for the court to do so at the point of sentencing. As the previous Government found, calculating periods of detention involves the difficulties of assessing the impact of remand periods and the time held in police stations. It is not a straightforward matter for magistrates or judges to work out the figures accurately when they impose a sentence.
<P>
In January, the Lord Chief Justice introduced a sentencing guideline in which he sought to clarify the way in which judges and magistrates impose sentences. It was designed to make them, in so far as they are able, say exactly what will happen. However, in some cases it is not possible for the judge or magistrate to be entirely accurate. We may have certain hopes, but we are dealing with matters of justice and we must get them right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been an interesting debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran (Beverley and Holderness):</B> It has been a real debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Indeed, it has.
<P>
The argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking was not advanced as part of our general case for sentences to mean what they say. He sits in the courts, has great practical experience and sees the problems every day of the week. His case was based on that experience.
<P>
The Minister cannot satisfactorily leave things as they are. The Government's steamrollering tendency means that they ignore every constructive piece of advice and practical criticism and pass bad legislation as a result. I hope that this will not be an example of that.
<P>
The Minister cannot leave things as they are, because we have not heard a satisfactory answer to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Woking made about the ridiculous consequences that will follow when magistrates have to sentence offenders with different degrees of culpability. The offender with the least culpability will spend the longest time in prison. I tell the Minister gently that it is not adequate to make party-political points on such an important practical matter that will cause problems in the courts.
<P>
The world will not come to an end if, just for once, the Minister were to say that he will reconsider the problem and put it right on Report. I shall give way to the Minister if he is prepared to tell the Committee that he is willing to reconsider now that he has heard the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. It may have been the first time that the problem has come to his attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has obviously not been listening properly to the debate. I spelt out on several occasions the difficulties that the amendments would cause. I made it clear that for many people the home detention curfew will not be available as a sentence. Therefore, the cases that he described will not arise.
<P>
In those cases when a home detention curfew is available, it must be regarded as part of the sentence. The hon. Member for Hertsmere, but not the hon. Member for Woking, was in the House of Commons when the previous Government introduced the idea of tagging as an alternative to a custodial sentence. They believe that tagging would have an effective place in the sentencing regime.
<P>
We shall ensure that tagging has an even more effective and rigorous place in the sentencing of defendants. We should not make a totem of the length of time spent in prison. The objective of prison and the tagging regime is to punish and reform, and both sanctions will be in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was hoping for understanding from the Minister. Instead, we heard a large helping of party-political propaganda. That will not do.
<P>
The Minister made a fresh point about some prisoners serving the sentences of two and a half, three and four months to which my hon. Friend the Minister for Woking referred. I have cast my eyes quickly over the excluded categories mentioned in the Bill, and it looks unlikely that any of those prisoners will come into those categories. I have not given it considered thought but it does not look as if it will cover prisoners who have received an extended sentence or who have been returned to prison under a hospital order.
<P>
The Minister will know that all other prisoners who are not excluded are eligible for release, subject to a risk assessment. It is quite likely that prisoners who are serving sentences of a few months at the lower end of the scale are just the sort who will be eligible for home detention curfew. The Minister has made the position worse instead of better. This is the difference between government and turning everything into a party political slogan. When a practical problem arises, Governments must respond rather than run the risk of passing bad law that will cause endless problems for the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Am I right in thinking that it would be quite easy for the Government to resolve the dilemma by removing from subsection (1) the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for a term of three months or more"	?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not saying that they should do that but there must be ways of resolving the problem. It is not an impossible dilemma.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I am prepared to compartmentalise this matter, setting it aside from the other points that I am making in the interests of being constructive and of good government. So far the Minister has offered us nothing. He has not conceded that there is a problem and that he will take it away and examine it. He has not even said that he will look at it again. We have just been given a blamket steamroller, backed by party political propaganda. That is just not good enough.
<P>
I do not want to be unkind to the Minister but I warn him that this matter will come back to his door as his ultimate responsibility. I give him a final chance to give us a little more: he cannot leave things as they stand. This is a serious matter which victims and courts will be extremely concerned about. Magistrates will find it frustrating. I give way to the Minister in the hope that we shall at last hear some reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is just playing games. He suggests that all sorts of things will happen which will not. Can he not see that in the example given by the hon. Member for Woking, some people will get the home detention curfew and will remain on that curfew, subject to a very rigorous regime, long after the person who is released on the lower sentence is free and subject to no such regime? The imposition of the sentence will last for the full period. It will just be a sentence of home detention curfew as well as imprisonment.
<P>
I heard what has been said by Opposition Members. We always listen to them with great care. The hon. Member for Woking has tried on a number of occasions to be constructive in the way he puts things. I shall look again at what he says. But I give no undertakings; I think that we have probably got it right here. I will consider his points but I do not accept his conclusions. The outcome of this debate has been that we will look at the way in which this mechanism operates. I hope that he and his hon. Friends will accept that the home detention curfew will impose a level of self-discipline which will, in the long term, reduce offending and safeguard the interests of the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On that note we will leave the well justified point of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking.
<P>
Moving on to the principle of tagging, we are trying to express with these amendments our concern that sentences should mean what they say. We do not need moral lectures from the Government about the value of tagging. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made an excellent contribution reminding us of the history of tagging. The Government chose to go into that by introducing examples from the past, and it has rather backfired on them. I noted that in his response to my hon. Friend the Minister was careful to say that he was one of those who had doubts about the practicality of tagging. He did not join the ranks of those in his party who opposed it in principle. No doubt all the time that Labour spokesmen were opposing it in principle he was one of those quietly working behind the scenes.
<P>
Even if that was the Minister's position, had we listened to all that was said by the Labour party in opposition about the technical problems of tagging we would never have arrived at the position where the relevant technology has been improved and properly piloted, and is available to use.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister would be wise not to try to intervene, because my next question, which was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, concerns who will carry out tagging. We know that it will be undertaken by private companies. That is something else that was pioneered by the previous Government. The Government are in the interesting position of having criticised the use of private companies to transport prisoners, whereas they now employ those companies for the same purpose and intend to extend their involvement to electronic tagging. I shall not invite a response to what I have said, as I am sure, judging by what the Minister has said, that he was not one of the Labour Members who leaped up and down on the Floor of the House of Commons a few years ago to ask the then Government how many prisoners had escaped from Securicor at Doncaster, or whatever the case was. Therefore, I shall not embarrass him further on the matter.
<P>
Sentences should mean what they say. We have agreed all along that tagging should be available as a sentence for courts to impose not as a way of freeing up prison places after the sentence has been imposed. It is sheer nonsense to talk about giving prisoners the chance to prepare themselves for release through tagging. If the Government seriously considered that the reason for what they are doing, they would have released prisoners at the half-way point as at present and imposed tagging as well, as a condition of supervision. We know that it is not the reason; it is a bit of add-on gloss from the Government. We know the real reason.
<P>
The Government have gone about this business in entirely the wrong way. The public, who are the important people in this matter, will as a result lose confidence in sentencing. Whatever the technical points raised by the Minister, the amendments demonstrate our belief that sentences should mean what they say. We do not want to lose the public's confidence on the issue, and I shall therefore press the matter to a Division.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and subject to a risk assessment carried out by the Prison Service'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment, which would include in the Bill a requirement that prisoners eligible for release on license through tagging should be subject to a risk assessment. We know that the Government intend that to happen and that they have produced a draft risk assessment for home detention curfew. However, we must consider whether the Bill should include a requirement for risk assessment. That gives us an opportunity to examine a worrying matter.
<P>
Earlier, we discussed the sort of prisoners who serve sentences of more than three months and less than four years. That category includes some serious offenders for example, sex offenders who have committed offences against children, and offenders who are serving sentences for rape or attempted rape. The latest figures show that 1,500 prisoners are serving sentences of more than three months and less than four years for serious indictable sexual offences.
<P>
When the Home Secretary announced the Government's policy on home detention curfew last year, we pressed the Government about sex offenders. After we had asked questions and made inquiries, the Minister of State, Home Department announced earlier this year that sex offenders would be released on home detention curfew only in exceptional circumstances. That was a departure from the Government's original position of not treating sex offenders differently. Since the announcement on 31 March, we have received a draft copy of the risk assessment for home detention curfew. The document has underlined our anxieties about sex offenders.
<P>
The draft document states that sex offenders are to be released on home detention curfew only in exceptional circumstances, but it does not define exceptional circumstances. What are they? The Minister with responsibilities for prisons said, in reply to a question from me, that sex offenders would be eligible to apply for release on home detention curfew, subject to assessment, in the same way as other prisoners. Will sex offenders be eligible for early release under enhanced assessment procedures?
<P>
The draft copy of the guidance on release on home detention curfew states that prisoners will be divided into two categories: those who receive a standard assessment, and those who receive an enhanced assessment because they are considered to pose a greater risk. The governor will deal with the second category. Will sex offenders be eligible for release, subject to an enhanced assessment 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Sex offenders?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the same criteria apply to sex offenders and to other prisoners who receive an enhanced assessment? Will additional criteria apply to sex offenders? If so, the Government should explain them to the Committee.
<P>
Prison governors will have to decide whether to release sex offenders. They have been told to release them only in exceptional circumstances, but those circumstances have not been defined. Governors and the public will want to know the criteria. I hope that the Minister will give a considered response.
<P>
If the Government have proposed the release programme to alleviate prison overcrowding, they should examine the categories of prisoners that will be eligible for release. The safest course is not to make sex offenders eligible for release under the home detention curfew. Such releases may be possible for other prisoners, but not for sex offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises some important points. We share his concern about sex offenders, and we have considered the way in which they may or may not come under the provisions of the home detention curfew.<P>
<P>
It must be appreciated that the term sex offender covers a wide range of offences. I emphasise that serious or dangerous sex offenders will not be eligible of release under the home detention curfew. More than 97 per cent. of the rapists in prison at the end of April were serving sentences of four years or longer. Therefore, they would not be eligible under the scheme. In addition, any sex offender given an extended sentence under the Bill's provisions will not be eligible, either.
<P>
The number of remaining sex offenders is small and prison governors will place them on home detention curfew only in exceptional circumstances and following the most careful scrutiny. That overrides the general presumption in favour of using the curfew Governors will certainly take into account the views of the probation service when it is involved in supervising the offender in the community. The assessment will take into account the nature of the offence, the level of risk posed by the offender and the proposed supervision arrangements.
<P>
Let me deal with the type of case raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere when he asked what would be acceptable. We have given the matter a great deal of thought because we want to get it right. First, the criteria must be that the offender does not pose a risk to the public. If there is any suggestion that he might pose an unacceptable risk to the public, he will not be considered for a home detention curfew.
<P>
Secondly, the offender must have addressed his offending behaviour in prison. For example, he might have been subject to a sex offender treatment programme.
<P>
Most important, we shall consider the way in which an offender might benefit form being released straight into a treatment centre. In such cases, the curfew will ensure that he or she stays with the treatment during the period of the curfew. That will be a condition of it. If offenders fail to comply with that condition, they will return straight to prison.
<P>
We may require an exceptional, rigorous regime for the tiny percentage of sex offenders who need treatment. There is an argument in favour of that. Only in such cases will we be disposed to consider a sex offender for the curfew. However, serious sex offenders will not fall into that category.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am listening carefully. The Minister knows that there is a difference between describing such an example and producing guidelines outlining what constitutes an exceptional case. Why could not such an example be given in the guidance provided to governors for risk assessment? Examples are not mentioned in the guidance, so will the Minister identify them?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> These are draft guidance documents, as is written clearly and in big letters on the copy that the hon. Gentleman in front of him. They are in draft because we want further consultation. I take the hon. Gentleman's good point that it would be useful for the example that I quoted to be put into the guidance. We will seriously consider that constructive suggestion. The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked me to accept his constructive suggestion and on this occasion I shall certainly do so, and decide whether it would be appropriate to follow it through.
<P>
Governors will be given further guidance as a result of the Prison Service order later this year. That may be a more appropriate context in which to accept the hon. Member for Hertsmere's suggestion. We all accept that it is a serious issue and that we must get the provisions right. There may be a small minority of specific types of sex offender who do not pose a danger to the general public and who may, by the nature of the curfew, be prevented from presenting a danger to anyone. In those circumstances it may be appropriate to apply a home detention curfew. However, we want to ensure that that occurs only in the most exceptional cases.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It seems that the debate has rightly centred on sex offenders. I may have misunderstood the Minister's promise in the previous debate, but I had hoped that he would be able to share with the Committee his thoughts on the important matter of risk assessment for the majority of offenders who are not sex offenders. I hope that you, Mrs. Michie, with your usual kindness, courtesy and latitude, might allow the Minister to deal with the issue now. I am advised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere that it would not be out of order to debate risk assessment in general terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It would not and I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding me to deal with the general issue of risk assessment as well as with the amendment. Let me deal with the amendment first and then move on to risk assessment in general.
<P>
Our first priority is to protect the public. The Home Secretary has already said that no prisoner will be placed on home detention curfew unless he has passed the risk assessment. The draft version of the risk assessment document has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and I believe that copies have been sent to all members of the Committee. We expect to issue the guidance in a final form to prison establishments in October, and we will place copies of the final guidance in the Libraries.
<P>
Assessment of a prisoner's suitability will be determined by prison governors on behalf of the Secretary of State, and it must take several consideration into account. As well as an assessment by the Prison Service of the potential risks presented by the prisoner and the potential benefits of the curfew, the views of the probation service as to the suitability of the home address will also be taken into account.
<P>
The amendment would require the assessment to be carried out by the Prison Service, but in fact the assessment might involve several organisations. I have already mentioned the probation service, and doctors might want to make a contribution. So it would be wrong in principle to require the assessment to be carried out by the Prison Service alone. Probably the most effective means of making the assessment would be by seconded probation officers working on behalf of the Prison Service.
<P>
The Bill puts a responsibility on the Secretary of State to decide whether to place a prisoner on home detention. He is accountable to Parliament for any such decision. We have provided details of the criteria that we propose to use in making that decision. The Opposition amendment adds nothing to those criteria and will be unnecessarily restrictive, limiting our ability to use information from various sources including the probation service and medical sources.
<P>
I turn to the point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough about the operation of risk assessment. Prisoners will not be released unless they have passed the risk assessment carried by prisons in accordance with guidance. Home detention curfews should be part of prisoners' custodial sentences, and so the guidance contains a presumption in favour of release.
<P>
Eligible prisoners will be placed under a home detention curfew, unless there is an unacceptable risk to victims or to the public. Other factors that will affect eligibility for a home detention curfew include a pattern of offending that indicates an unacceptable risk of reoffending during the period of home detention, and probable failure to comply with the conditions of the curfew. Such failure may have many causes: for example, the offender may have a drug habit and has such a disordered life that he is unlikely to comply with the order. The lack of a suitable address from which to operate the home detention curfew is another factor affecting eligibility for the scheme.
<P>
We must be honest about the high recidivism rate of people who have served prison sentences. That rate is about 50 per cent. of adult males. We cannot promise that everyone on a home detention curfew will be law abiding. However, the self-discipline that is imposed by the home detention curfew will probably change offenders' behaviour so that they are less likely to offend. We must implement controls for managing that risk so as to effect a structured transition from prison to freedom.
<P>
There will be a standard assessment of the prisoner's ability to comply with home detention order. Prisoners will be excluded from assessment if they are subject to section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, or are liable to deportation. Violent offenders and sex offenders sentenced to extended sentences under clause 55 will also be ineligible. Prisoners who have breached a home detention curfew in the past, prisoners who have been recalled for breaching a parole licence condition and those who have been sentenced to custody for failure to return from temporary release will not be eligible for a home detention curfew.
<P>
So there will be strong deterrents against non-compliance. Prisoners can be pulled back immediately as soon as the police receive a report of offending behaviour. In addition, those who break a home detention curfew know that they will never again have the option of being subject to such a curfew.
<P>
The standard assessment test will be carried out by seconded probation officers responsible for risk assessment in prison. They will receive reports from prison staff who are in daily contact with the prisoner and from the home probation service. The prisoner will be referred to the governor for release on home detention curfew unless he or she is identified as requiring consideration under a subsequent enhanced procedure.
<P>
Under the enhanced procedure, the prisoner will be considered by a board composed of the governor, a member of the through-care team normally a seconded probation officer and, usually, a member of the prison staff who has daily contact with the offender. There will be a two-stage process. First, the standard assessment and, secondly, the enhanced assessment if there is any doubt that the person would not benefit from a home detention curfew.
<P>
The governor will make the final decision on all cases, whether subject to standard or enhanced assessment. However, in many establishments, it might not be practical for the governor to consider all the cases. The governor might then allocate them to a senior grade governor, with at least a grade 4 qualification, to ensure that the proceedings are carried out to the highest standard. There are a number of controls and there is also the safeguard that the Home Secretary is eventually answerable for these matters.
<P>
The Government hope that the assessment procedure will be accepted by the House of Commons. We wanted to issue the proposals at an early stage, so that during the next few months we can consider the views of hon. Members and others. The hon. Member for Gainsborough rightly asked how we would assess the risk. If he examines the document carefully, he will find that is has been thoughtfully prepared and that the process will produce a home detention curfew system that does not result in an unacceptable risk to the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his careful and courteous response. However, I am still a bit worried. Perhaps I misheard him, but I thought that he said that there would be a presumption in favour of release into home detention curfew. He is nodding, so I was not wrong. I had not heard those words used before and I am anxious about them.
<P>
As we know, half of all criminals go back inside. They work things out carefully and know exactly what goes on. They know that when they are sentenced their porridge will be only half of the time imposed by the judge, if it is a fairly short sentence. Under these proposals, they will soon realise that it will not even be half of the time; generally, they will be released two months earlier.That will soon become the norm and will be known about. That is rather dangerous. it will chip away further at the time actually served by the prisoner in relation to the sentence passed by the judge.
<P>
Of course, home detention curfews and electronic tagging might be useful. I accept what the Minister said about the draft document and the care that will be taken in setting up the procedures. I do not argue about that. there might be prisoners who would benefit from the curfews; for example, those who are not hardened criminals but who have great difficulty in coping at home, or who need some type of treatment. However, in our debate today the Minister said for the first time that there will be a general presumption for release. That worries me. The criminal classes will know about that presumption and that they will be kept in custody only if there is a good reason against their release for example, that they have no home to return to. However, I suspect that there will be very few cases in which there will be no home to return to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has made an important point. Does he think that there is a comparison to be made with bail procedures, where there is a presumption to bail except for certain exceptional categories?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I was about to make that precise point. There is now a general presumption for bail. It is difficult not to get bail, however serious the case. I do not like the term "general presumption"	. There is a general presumption that a defendant will get bail, that an offender serves only half the sentence, and that, two months before half the sentence has been completed, the offender will be released.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman reads too much into my earlier comment. I said that 50 per cent. of prisoners in the categories that we discussed may qualify, but the guidelines are clear. Paragraph 5 of the draft risk assessment states:<P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Prisoners should normally be released on HDC unless there are substantive reasons for retaining the prisoner in custody until his or her automatic release date. These reasons must fall under one of the four headings below:
<P>
an unacceptable risk to the victim or to members of the public"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if such a risk exists, the prisoner will not be released 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a pattern of offending which indicates an unacceptable risk of reoffending during the home detention curfew period;
<P>
a probability of failure to comply with the conditions of the curfew; or
<P>
lack of a suitable address for HDC."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Good conduct may bear no relation to the risk that the prisoner presents to the victim or the public. The points that the hon. Member for Gainsborough made are covered in the guidelines. I have said nothing new, and nothing that he would not have known, had he read the document.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We are in danger of going round in circles, but the criteria that the Minister quoted also apply to bail, which is not supposed to be granted if the defendant poses an unacceptable risk to the public. Yet bail is granted in the majority of cases, and defendants know that. We accept that offenders who pose an obvious danger to the public will not be let out of prison. Therefore, there is no point in the Minister quoting from the draft document. He has not dealt with the point.
<P>
The majority of offenders will not present a danger to the public and will have a home. There is a general presumption in favour of allowing the criminal to be filtered back into society. Therefore, it will become widely known that offenders will be released two months before they have served half their sentence. The Minister may deny that, but I have made my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not quite made his point. He claims that the measure is similar to the Bail Act 1976. However, section 4(1) of that Act creates a legal presumption in favour of bail. The Bill makes no legal presumption in favour of granting an HDC licence. All the relevant factors will be taken into account, especially the risk assessment. There will be no unacceptable risk to the public. Any offender who presents such a risk will not get an HDC licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I share the anxiety of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough about the word "presumption"	, and the possible introduction of something new. I am most worried about sex offenders, and I am grateful for the Minister's comments. However, I do not sympathise with his point that, some sex offenders pose less of a risk than others. It is difficult to predict risk for that category of offender. All sex offenders who will be eligible for tagging in exceptional circumstances will also be required to register under part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. In reply to a written question, the Minister with responsibilities for prisons said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My right hon. Friend has also decided that prisoners serving between three months and four years who are required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 should not be tagged on home detention curfew, save in exceptional circumstances."	 [Official Report, 1 June 1998; Vol. 313, c. 57.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is all-party agreement on the Sex Offenders Act 1997. Anyone who is subject to its provisions is a serious offender, and constitutes a risk. When an offender is required to register under part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, the apparatus of that Act comes into play. Members of the public would think it a little rum if all those requirements were made of prisoners because of registration under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 if, at the same time, they were eligible albeit in exceptional circumstances for early release from prison.
<P>
I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the curfew. I was slightly, but not greatly, more satisfied by what he said about that. For the first time, he gave us examples of what exceptional circumstances might be. I accept that the guidance is a draft document, but it goes into some detail. When it was published, we expected much clearer guidance as to what exceptional circumstances might be. In the light of the Minister's remarks, I appreciate that there may be some changes to the document. I suggest that it defines tightly what exceptional circumstances might be in the case of sex offenders. We are not looking just for examples, but for tight definitions that make it clear that sex offenders will be released only when they fall into definite categories that are set out in the guidance.
<P>
Those circumstances must be clear to the board and the governors who have to make decisions under the enhanced assessment procedure. If sex offenders will be released only for treatment, let us have that definition in the guidance. Otherwise, they should not be released. Any other exceptional circumstances should also be defined. We do not want to leave a gap that might result in a risk to the public.
<P>
I have outlined our concerns. We want the guidance to contain tight and clear definitions that prison governors and others find workable. Although considerable concerns remain, I do not propose to press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not propose to repeat our earlier arguments to support these important amendments. The fundamental point underlying them is that there should be openness about the operation of release on home detention curfew. Amendment No. 214 would require publication of the guidance on early release. Amendment No. 211 would require a court, when passing sentence on an offender eligible for early release, to state the minimum period that the offender will spend in custody. It would also require the victims of offences to be given information about release dates. Amendment No. 198 would require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on the working of the home detention curfew after two years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> On amendment No. 214, we believe that it is right to make public the criteria that are used by the Prison Service to assess the suitability of prisoners for the home detention curfew. We have done that.
<P>
It is unusual to give such guidance a statutory basis without any overriding reason. There is no overriding reason that should change the practice that Conservative and Labour Governments have followed in the past. This is a new procedure and it would be beneficial to retain the flexibility provided by non-statutory guidance, which can be amended in the light of experience.
<P>
Amendment No. 211 is unnecessary. Sentencers will refer to the effect of home detention curfews in their comments in court. I have already mentioned the guidance on practice from the Lord Chief Justice that requires a court to do as much as it can, but I have pointed out the problems of being too specific.
<P>
Under the victims charter, victims can expect the police to keep them informed of developments in their case. That includes the final result of any trial. Ways of achieving that commitment are currently being piloted. We do not want to disturb existing arrangements until the results of pilot studies have been thoroughly evaluated and discussed with Victim Support. Not all victims want to be informed of when an offender is to be released. Introducing a statutory duty to inform victims who may not wish to be informed may be unhelpful to them.
<P>
On amendment No. 198, we will be evaluating many aspects of the impact of the home detention curfew. That is likely to include an evaluation of its effectiveness in terms of the number of breaches, its effects on the prison population and, in the longer term, its impact on offending rates. Research will be made available in the usual way through parliamentary questions or the release of Government reports. We hope to produce the first evaluation within two years. The amendment would produce an unusual, binding requirement, which we consider unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore be disposed not to press the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not entirely convinced, but to make progress I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 78, line 42, leave out from beginning to end of line 6 on page 79.
<P>
I think that I may have inadvertently given a preview of the amendment, which relates to subsection (5), in a previous debate. I would like answers to two points.
<P>
Subsection (5) would extend eligibility for release through home detention curfew to young people aged under 18 serving a sentence of detention and training. My hon. Friends and I would like to know where that fits in with what the Government told us in an earlier debate about the need for compartmentalised sentences for those young people The Government argued that the sentences available for them should increase in two-month gradations up to a period of two years so that they could be sentenced to two, four, six or eight months, and so on because they would be undergoing training and it would be wrong to pass sentences of intermediate periods. If training and education can be provided only according to those timings, how would early release through home detention curfew fit in?
<P>
We should also like to know whether subsection (5)(b) means that the period in which prisoners can be released can be extended, so that they can have even shorter sentences. Will it be possible for prisoners to spend even less time in custody because of release with tagging?

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> In direct answer to the hon. Gentleman, we do not propose at this stage to proceed with the measure for under-18s. We want a reserve power. In due course, after evaluation of the pilot studies for the home detention curfew for over-18s, it may seem appropriate to run some for under-18s. I expect that the hon. Gentleman would not object to our having that reserve power, which might be helpful. However, we do not propose at this stage to extend the scheme, or even, for a while, to run pilots on it, for under-18s.
<P>
I hope that that deals with the points that the hon. Gentleman made. I do not think that there is any conflict with the other provisions of the Bill.
<P>
As for any shortening of sentences, there are no plans to use the powers in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It seems another case of the Government's seeking a reserve power to do things that they have no intention of doing, and which would contradict what they are doing already. However, in all the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 91 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 92</center></H4>
<H4><center>Curfew condition to be included in licence</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 348, in page 80, line 10, leave out "serious"	.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With that it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 427.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment speaks for itself in many respects. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien: The response is that it is completely unnecessary, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree.</B><P>
<P>
The Government amendment is necessary to deal with an unintended consequential power that we have spotted in new section 38A(1) (c). That new section is intended to allow us to recall offenders who breach their curfew but who cannot continue to be curfewed without unacceptable risk. When an offender is released on home detention curfew, he or she will be subject to a licence which can be revoked if the offender breaches the curfew.
<P>
The length of the licences will follow the procedures which flow from the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Licences for offenders serving sentences of between three and12 months will expire at the halfway point or the sentence. Offenders serving between 12 months and four years will remain subject to a licence beyond the period of their home detention curfew until they have spent a period under supervision equivalent to the period that they would have spent under supervision had they not been released on home detention curfew.
<P>
One of the conditions on the licence for such prisoners will be to comply with the terms of the home detention curfew. That condition will expire at the halfway point of the sentence, the point at which the offender would have been released from custody had he or she not been released on home detention curfew. As drafted, new section 38A(1) (c) will allow us to recall offenders after their halfway point of sentence and after the home detention curfew requirement had expired. the power is therefore unnecessary and an anomaly and it would be helpful to change it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Do the words "serious harm"	 bear the same meaning as they do in the criminal Justice Act 1991?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. Is the hon. Gentleman satisfied? He has a clear answer to that and so perhaps I can ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I said that the amendment spoke for itself and the Committee will also remember our earlier long debates about the meaning of "serious harm"	. My concerns remain because the same arguments about the high threshold that is created by serious harm apply.It seems that we have made no further progress here and it would not be appropriate in all the circumstances to take the matter any further today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister tried to brush aside the amendment despite the eloquence with which my hon. Friend moved it. It is quite an important amendment and I do not see why we should not hear more from the Minister about the word "serious"	. Why has he imposed it? The clause reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it appears to the Secretary of State, as regards a person released on licence that he has failed to comply with the curfew condition"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 that is fair enough 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that his whereabouts can no longer be electronically monitored"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 that is also fair enough 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that it is necessary to do so in order to protect the public from serious harm from him ... the Secretary of State may revoke the licence"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why is "serious"	 there? What does it mean. Why can we not just say if it is necessary to do so in order to protect the public from harm?
<P>
We are talking about a prisoner who has been let out early anyway. We have had numerous assurances from the Minister that a careful assessment will be made of him, that he will not cause any harm to the community and that it would help him to go out and live at home for a bit and gradually be brought back into society. Why has the word "serious"	 been included? It is a kind of let-out clause to ensure that virtually no one will be brought back into prison. A person who is serving a sentence is not free but is fulfilling his debt to society. If he is in danger of causing any harm of any kind to anybody, he should be kept in prison.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The word "serious"	 is there to qualify the word "harm"	 which is so nebulous and vague that it is difficult to make a proper judgment about it. What does harm to the public mean? Is it dropping litter, shouting in the street or what? It is all too vague. The word "serious"	 at least provides a basis for making an assessment of the sort of criteria about which the public will be concerned. Actions must be serious enough for the public to be genuinely concerned about them, not so lacking in seriousness that the public believe that the harm caused is frivolous. We need a balance and we need to be specific in order to provide significant and substantial protection for the public. I believe that the Bill provides it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I said that our concerns remain and I referred to the Criminal Justice Act 1991 in the light of my hon. Friend's important intervention. It might assist the Committee if I reminded hon. Members of the meaning of serious harm. It means death or serious personal injury, whether physical or psychological. That is an inappropriately high threshold and it would be preferable to have more flexibility. The Minister calls the word "harm"	 nebulous but we believe that it is more flexible and more appropriate for the Bill. That the threshold for recalling prisoners is too high remains our concern and it needs to be understood in the light of our comments about the meaning of serious harm in earlier debates about sex offender orders. We remain worried about that too. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Disclosure of information</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is important to put a couple of points on the record about the clause. The approach which the Bill takes to tackling crime at its grass roots involves co-operation and partnership between agencies and partnerships both within and beyond the criminal justice system. That is particularly true in relation to crime reduction partnerships, youth offending teams and anti-social behaviour orders. Exchanging information is the life blood of these partnerships.
<P>
It is essential that there are clear powers to exchange that information, much of which is likely to be sensitive. It is important that the parties know how to share that information properly. There is a lot of misunderstanding about disclosure. Many bodies are unclear about how, or even whether they can do it. There are two stages to disclosing or exchanging information. Before public or statutory bodies can disclose information, they must establish that they have the power to do so and whether they have a responsibility to do so in the public interest. Once the question of power has been resolved, the disclosure must be carried out in a lawful manner.
<P>
The clause is about the first step establishing the power. The police have a general power of common law to disclose information for the prevention and detection of crime. Indeed, both the public and the Government expect them to use their powers and their knowledge to prevent and reduce crime and disorder. They also have statutory powers. The clause does not interfere with any of those important powers.
<P>
A number of public authorities collect information which will be central to the Bill's partnership approach. However, they may not have the powers to disclose this information to the police and others. The clause will provide those powers where they might otherwise be lacking. It is carefully drawn to provide a statutory authority for disclosure for those cases where none currently exists, so that the holder of the information has the say over what is disclosed and to meet the purposes of the Bill.
<P>
The clause empowers disclosure to and between the statutory authorities named in subsection (2): the police, local authorities, including social services, and the probation service. It does not give anyone a power to demand disclosure, to override or interfere with any statutory or common law duty of confidence, or the many existing and successful protocols for the sharing of information between, for instance, the police and the probation service; nor does it create a data free-for-all which would have severe implications for civil liberties.
<P>
In order both to facilitate the exchange of information and to ensure that it is done properly, the Home Office will provide guidance and draft protocols for use by the various agencies. We will work those out with the help of the Data Protection Registrar. All the agencies will appreciate the importance of following proper procedures and we are anxious to ensure that they are given the right guidance on how to do that. Equally, they must remember their responsibilities to work together and to act speedily to reduce crime and prevent offending.
<P>
If tempted to play safe and not to exchange or share information, agencies must ask what is in the public interest and what does common sense dictate. The sharing of information is a weapon against crime, and we must erode the position where the law is felt to shelter offenders with a convention of confidentiality, where the public is put at risk because agencies cannot be warned or cannot warn each other of the risk or where one agency cannot be confident that it can share what it knows because the law seems to be uncertain. The clause seeks to dispel that uncertainty.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
