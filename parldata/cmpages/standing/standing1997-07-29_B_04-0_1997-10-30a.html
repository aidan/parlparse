</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 6, leave out lines 4 to 6 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6)(a) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that a claimant has appealed a decision under section 9 above or section 11 below shall not prevent the Secretary of State revising the decision under subsection (1) above before the appeal is determined.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) Where the decision is revised under paragraph (a) and the decision as revised is the same as the decision that would have been made on the appeal had it been fully successful, the appeal shall lapse.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (c) Where a decision is revised under paragraph (a) but paragraph (b) does not apply, the appeal shall proceed as though it were an appeal against the decision as revised, unless the appellant requests that the appeal lapse.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to discover what the Government mean by prescribed circumstances in clause 10(6). There may be unfortunate circumstances in which an appeal should not lapse, and I want to ensure that they are covered by the Government intentions. A decision could be revised under the clause, but not necessarily in the way that the appellant had hoped. A partial revision of a decision would be possible. For example, claimants might appeal for a sum much larger than was originally granted, only to find that the revised sum was half the amount for which they had appealed. It is important, therefore, that in those circumstances the appeal does not necessarily lapse--and it will not if there is a clear definition of the prescribed circumstances.
<P>
I suggest that once an appeal has been lodged and clearly argued, at least on paper, it makes sense--if for no other reason than the sheer amount of bureaucracy involved--to allow that appeal to stand unless the revision meets the appeal requirements. I hope that that would speed up the process and ensure that an appeal did not lapse when the appellant wanted to proceed simply because the appeal had not been fully met by the revision.
<P>
It is probably fair to say that a number of revisions will meet the full requirements of the appeal. An appeal might be lodged because there is an obvious fault in the decision, which is corrected by the revision. Nevertheless, there will be other cases in which that does not happen, and it would be sensible for the appeal to go ahead.
<P>
Suggested new paragraph (b) in the amendment has been worded so that the appeal would lapse if the revision fully met its requirements. Under new paragraph (c) the appeal would lapse if the appellant felt that the revision was sufficient to make it unnecessary to go forward to the full appeal.
<P>
The amendment would give claimants a more sensible option for retaining their appeal when they wanted a greater revision than had been granted and, at the same time, would cut down on the bureaucracy of having to start a new appeal.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Keith Bradley):</B> The amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) is well intentioned. I am sure that all Members of the Committee agree that it is only right that those who want to exercise their right of appeal should be free to do so. However, that is not the main issue in the clause. 
<P>
To explain what is involved I shall quote my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne). [Interruption.] We have been bonding for the past couple of weeks.
<P>
My hon. Friend said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``. . . it is mere common sense that, where an appeal is current, it should generally lapse if the decision is revised before the appeal is determined . . . It makes a nonsense of any attempt to improve the review procedure to allow the possibility of a reviewed decision and an appeal running at the same time.''--[Official Report, 22 July 1997; Vol. 298, c. 817.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was absolutely right.
<P>
The Bill is about modernisation--it is about a more responsive service to our customers, tackling unacceptable delays in the appeals service and cutting out unnecessary bureaucracy and waste. However, retaining the right of appeal to an independent tribunal remains a fundamental part of the Government's proposals, and nothing in clause 10 detracts from that.
<P>
The amendment seeks to remove subsection (6), which is designed to remove one of the problems with the current system. All too often a customer appeals and his main concerns could be met quickly and simply by the relevant agency. None the less, if the appeal raises other issues, even if neither the agency nor a tribunal could address them, the whole appeal must go forward and no change can be made in the meantime.
<P>
The result is that--several months later in current circumstances--the customer receives his correct entitlement after his appeal has eventually been heard. From our observations and discussions with agencies and customers, we know that that leads to frustration for all concerned. The appeals service becomes overloaded with unnecessary appeals, appeals backlogs increase, and the taxpayer foots the bill for expensive bureaucratic processes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I may not have understood one point here, and I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify it for me. Is he saying that if the appeal is continued, it is impossible for the revised decision to be put into effect straight away?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. The appeal has to complete its course before the revised decision can be implemented. That is exactly what we are trying to get away from. In future, the incorrect decision will have to be revised at the earliest opportunity. Under the provisions before us we can make that change. The customer will, of course, have a right of appeal after the change has been made--we are not denying him that right. We want, however, to correct the decision at the earliest opportunity and let the situation flow from there.
<P>
As I mentioned earlier, the Government's clear commitment is to ensure claimants a right to appeal to an independent tribunal. That, too, is something that subsection (6) is intended to protect. The intention is to prescribe that, where the revised decision is unfavourable--because benefit is reduced, for example--the customer's appeal will go forward to the tribunal without delay--unless, of course, he requests that it should lapse.
<P>
With that clarification and assurance about the way in which the system will operate, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, but I am not sure that he has achieved in the clause the aim--which I think we share in practice--of making sure that the system is simplified as much as possible.
<P>
I understand the difficulty caused if a decision cannot be put into effect while an appeal is still outstanding. That could, however, be met simply by changing the regulations so that the revised decision would take effect straight away. It should still be possible to leave the appeal outstanding if the revised decision is not exactly in line with the appeal. I think, judging by what the Minister said towards the end of his remarks, that he intends that to happen. That certainly seems to be the case where the revised decision would directly damage the claimant's interests under the prescribed circumstances--presumably those that the Minister will prescribe.
<P>
The Minister talked about a decision reducing the amount of money paid, but it should be left in place wherever the revised decision is not exactly in line with the appeal--unless, as he said, the appellant wanted to stop the appeal going ahead. There are plenty of circumstances in which the revised decision might be in favour of the claimant but still would not be precisely in line with what the appeal was asking for. I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister clarifies that further point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it the wish of the Committee that the amendment be withdrawn? [Interruption.] Does the Minister want to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara. I was busy pondering the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
There is no disagreement about the purpose of the clause, which is to enable us to revise a decision and implement the revision without denying the right of appeal against that new decision, and for that to move forward as fast as possible. There is nothing between us on the matter, but if it will help the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, I shall write to him to clarify the procedure, covering the point that he has raised. I hope that, after that assurance, he feels comfortable with the way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> With that assurance, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. However, if the clarification is not sufficient we shall table another. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 6, line 6, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) The Secretary of State shall publish each revision or decision made under this section within a period of seven days of its being made'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. O'Hara, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This really is a more congenial atmosphere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment amounts to a requirement for transparency. As the discussions on other amendments have shown, the clause gives the Secretary of State enormously wide powers to revise decisions. Although the intention may be to streamline the present inefficiencies of the process, there are, as I would describe it, enormous powers to make case law.
<P>
There are no restrictions on the circumstances in which revisions can be made or on the time limit beyond that, which laid down in the regulations. It is--dare I say it--somewhat unreasonable of the Government to claim that they want democratic accountability to Parliament in that area and then to rely solely on secondary law. Indeed, on 22 July, Mr. Brady said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are seeking comprehensive ways of monitoring the system in the future to ensure that it is accountable to Parliament.''--[Official Report, 22 July 1997; Vol. 298, c. 851.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would argue in that context that the subject matter of the clause in particular should have the support of primary law as well as of regulations.
<P>
The power that falls to the Minister in that area is to revise any decision on any grounds. There is the flexibility to revise a decision under appeal and where that happens--when the revised decision is made pending appeal--the appeal will lapse. Indeed, the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``need not consider any issue that it not raised''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by an applicant and which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``did not cause him to act on his own initiative.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee should focus on the fact that significant law-making power will result from the clause. One can think of many areas in which the power will emerge to establish, by practice and by revised decisions, new attitudes to and interpretations of administrative decisions and people's legal rights. I do not known whether that is intended, but the power is definitely there.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, if the principle of writing circumstances into primary law is not accepted, transparency becomes the other democratic answer. Indeed, transparency is crucial; everyone engaged in social security activity should know what decisions have been made and what previously believed interpretations of the law have been overturned. That thinking results in the amendment, which requires such decisions to be published.
<P>
I conclude by repeating the point that it is unsatisfactory for the powers in the clause, however well intentioned, and however much Mr. Brady advises us--

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman giving way to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am not rising solely to correct the hon. Gentleman for mistakenly referring to me as ``Mr. Brady''--who is in fact the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. I also seek clarification in order to respond more effectively to the amendment. Is the amendment intended to deal with notification to the customer of the decision and the terms in which that decision was made, or is it about the publication of case law as it generally arises from the Bill? I want to be clear about the hon. Gentleman's main point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mr. Bradley. It is difficult to separate the two, because some revisions of decisions pertaining to individuals will make case law, but there may also be circumstances in which a new philosophy within the Department will result in decisions that deliberately set out to make case law. That is why it is difficult to distinguish between the two. It is not easy to put one element into a box labelled ``individual applicants'' and the other into a box labelled ``changes of case law''. If the whole lot is published, there cannot be any doubt. There may be an argument for endeavouring to separate the two, but it would be difficult in practice to distinguish between them.
<P>
I conclude by stressing the importance of the issue. Huge wide powers are being established without protection under primary legislation being built into the circumstances of their use. The results of decisions must be known by all participants. Transparency, here as in many other walks of life, is the logical answer to the problem of communicating changes in case law and ensuring that the public at large know what is happening in a key area of decision-making. I commend the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Some small points of clarification of procedure are necessary before we go on. When an hon. Member gives way, he or she sits down and allows the other hon. Member to stand. When the Chairman stands, everybody sits. When Committee members address each other, they do so by reference not to their names but to their constituencies--or to the title if the person addressed is a Minister. I address you by your names.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): I do not want to detain the Committee for long, but I should like to support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight).
<P>
The amendment takes us back to the main issues of transparency and accountability, although I do not want to re-rehearse the detailed arguments of our previous sitting. Subsection (4) deals with regulations, but you will be relieved to know, Mr. O'Hara, that I am not going to reiterate our beliefs on affirmative and negative resolutions.
<P>
The regulations will form far-reaching secondary legislation. The Minister sought to help us as much as he could in previous debates, and by conceding that where possible, he would outline, in as much detail as possible, the Government's intentions as to the final form of the regulations. Despite his best efforts, however, we are still in the dark about the nuts and bolts of the regulations provided for in the parts of the Bill that we have covered so far. Absolute transparency in all such proceedings is important: people should understand the reasons behind decisions that have been made either in the name of or by the Secretary of State, so that they are fully conversant with those decisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 5 is a modest and reasonable amendment. I was going to say that the Minister is also modest, but that is unfair on him because he is a Minister. He is a reasonable man.
<P>
Hon. Members: ``Oh''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I am sure that my hon. Friend will remember what Winston Churchill said of Clement Attlee--that he was a very modest man, but then, he had a great deal to be modest about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Indeed, I hesitated because of that very quip--I did not want to be rude to the Minister. Naturally, he is a modest man in his personal behaviour--[Interruption.] One assumes he is.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This literary conceit has been taken too far. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) got it right by putting his point--which was out of order--so quickly that I could not stop him. I ask other members of the Committee to observe that maxim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara. The all-pervading power of the Opposition Whips Office means that one wants to respond to one's Whip's pertinent comments, but I accept that that is out of order and I shall return to the amendment.
<P>
As I was saying, the Minister is a reasonable man and the amendment is a reasonable amendment--it would merely enhance the transparency and accountability of decisions. In the interests of furthering open and transparent government, I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to accepting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I will try to be helpful. There was a genuine misunderstanding on my part as to the aim of the amendment. I still think that it is important to distinguish between decisions that are taken by the Secretary of State for individuals and decisions that are made ultimately by commissioners, which will become case law.
<P>
Commissioners' decisions are always published and are available for purchase by the public from the appropriate body, normally Her Majesty's Stationery Office. They are usually published soon after the decision to put them into the public domain, but it is often some time before the detail behind that case law becomes available. In no sense will clause 10 restrict or inhibit that activity.
<P>
The Secretary of State's decisions will be about individuals whose applications have gone through the Department. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman wishes to put the details of such individuals into the public domain in the same way that case law is published. I do not think that it would be right, in terms of confidentiality, for individual circumstances to be made public and published by linking case law and individuals as the amendment seems to propose.
<P>
The current arrangements for notification of a decision to an individual will still apply. Whenever possible, we ensure that the individual is notified of a decision within 24 hours. We intend to continue that practice in the future, without needing the seven-day period. That is not without exception. There may be complicated circumstances that need clear guidance to ensure that notification is accurate and correct on the points of law. With exception, that may sometimes take a little longer and may even fall outside the seven-day limit proposed in the amendment, if that applied to individual circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister's comments about current procedures are extremely helpful. He said that the current arrangement is to try to notify the individual of the decision within 24 hours, and no one would disagree with that. But what proportion of decisions are, in reality, notified to individuals within 24 hours? What proportion cannot be notified because of the point that he has made, and what proportion are not notified because of bureaucracy or administrative problems?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am happy to supply the hon. Gentleman with that information; I do not have the details to hand. However, I can assure the Committee that in the overwhelming number of cases--my officials have advised me that that is almost all of them--individuals are notified in that way. It is part of efficient administration to get out such notifications; it is in no one's interests to have them hanging around. As soon as a decision is made, notification is sent to the customer.
<P>
In a previous debate, we talked about certain claims needing several decisions in one day, and all of those being notified. As we pointed out, people receive all such notifications, normally on the next day, and that is part of the problem. When they receive all those notifications at the same time, there is confusion about which decision has been taken. The evidence that we are all aware of from constituency cases of people receiving notification--and quickly--gives me some certainty that my argument that in almost all cases we manage to get the decision to the individual in 24 hours is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Something crossed my mind as the Minister was speaking. When decisions are made known to individuals, is the information written in simple, everyday English that people understand, or does it include constant cross-references to bits of regulations and legislation that can be confusing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As part of our modernisation of the system, we are looking very carefully at the way in which communication is made to the public, through leaflets and letters, to try and make such information much more understandable and user-friendly. In that way, people understand what decision has been taken and why and it is clear what they need to appeal against. Part of the problem of the appeals process, and why it tends to be wide ranging and not efficient, is because people are not appealing against the outcome, and there is also the point at which they want to dispute the reason for the decision. It all fits in the general modernising process.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I dread to use the word ``computer'', for fear that I will be attacked. Better use of the technology will provide helpful simplification and speed of action. I take the hon. Gentleman's point about ensuring that the computer produces material in an understandable and simple form, but we must also ensure that information is processed quickly. The press of a button may generate a decision, and we must ensure that it arrives with a customer within my suggested time scale.
<P>
I hope that by differentiating between the commissioners' decisions--which are published in the normal course and within the time scale that I have suggested--the individual will receive the information as fast as possible. We intend to ensure that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall give way once more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's patience.
<P>
I wish to check one point of fact. Clause 9 lists the relevant benefits, but not the Child Support Agency decisions. Paragraph 2(h), however, uses the words ``such other benefit as may be prescribed.''ÌDoes that affect the agency's decisions or does the Minister consider them not to be a benefit in the narrow definition that most people understand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am confident that those decisions are included. Clause 40, which deals with the revision of child support decisions, is related to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am especially interested in that comment in the light of the Minister's earlier comments about most decisions--``almost all'' was, I think, the final phrase in a note sent to the Minister by his adviser. The Minister said that most decisions were reached within 24 hours, unless there was a legal problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I said that decisions were notified within that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does that notification include decisions from the Child Support Agency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> In my example of the many decisions for which notification is immediate I was referring to those of the Child Support Agency. The decisions are made when circumstances change, and the decison about the entitlement is then relayed to the applicant.
<P>
We are discussing decisions, not the totality of cases. A lot of confusion arises because of the way in which decisions are taken on a number of types of cases. At present all applicants have to be notified. All of those notifications fall on the customer's doormat together. At present, that results in confusion about which one overrides which, and about which is the final decision. The clause includes child support, through its link with clause 40.
<P>
I hope that, with my explanation and assurances, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the present arrangments. I am slightly unsatisfied about whether the present arrangements legally cover all that can fall out of the clause. The point has been made that commissioners publish decisions that amount to case law decisions. That presumably results from the matters that they consider. Do the present arrangements provide for the fact that in the new, proposed circumstances, the Secretary of State in effect has the power to make case law by fiat? Does that power fall under the commissioners' reporting requirements? It is debatable whether existing law and regulations provide adequately for that new and different contingency.
<P>
I entirely accept that it is not intended that confidential matters that pertain to individuals should be published in the public arena.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that commissioners make case law and not the Secretary of State, and that that arrangement will be retained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It seems that I am not making my point clearly enough.
<P>
The clause, as I understand it, gives the Secretary of State power to lay down rulings and decisions that will be used as precedents for other cases in the future. Such precedent decision making--I have used the shorthand of case law--will become important as the regulations proceed.
<P>
If the Minister can assure me that something in the clause prevents the Secretary of State from making decisions that have the case force of such precedent, my argument will fall. It seems to me, however, that the clause is intentionally drafted to give the Secretary of State extremely wide powers to take decisions that will have the force of precedent. I repeat that the amendment is not intended to require the publication of confidential information about individuals, and that there are bound to be occasions in the future when decisions about individuals will set important precedents, especially in the wider context of the Bill. That context is to limit the powers of legal rights to social security benefit.
<P>
Underneath quite a complicated Bill, a change in the balance of the law is taking place. I am not sure that my expression of this point is constitutionally correct, and I should be happy to withdraw the amendment, subject to legal clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall try one more time. The Secretary of State has no power to make case law, which is made by commissioners. The Secretary of State issues guidance--flowing from the decisions that commissioners make--on how individual cases should be dealt with. There is, therefore, a link between commissioners and the Secretary of State, but the Secretary of State has no power to make case law in the manner that the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
Decisions by commissioners affect the way that the Department--following the guidance issued by the Secretary of State--deals with its customers. The treatment of individuals is therefore a consequence of commissioners making case law. Nothing in the Bill changes that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I genuinely would like to know the answer to this question, as the Minister's explanation is illuminating. Will the Minister explain what prevents the Secretary of State's decisions from constituting precedent? I understand the point that he makes about his or her decisions not constituting precedent--unlike those of commissioners--but the legal basis for that is not clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Case law is established by social security commissioners and not the Secretary of State. That is the legal position, and nothing in the Bill changes that relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for pressing this point, but while I understand that that is the view that has been taken until now, it is not clear whether that is a statutory undertaking or a judicial underpinning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not intend to mislead the Committee in any way. It is the commissioners who have decided that they, and not the Secretary of State, should determine what case law is. Nothing in the Bill changes that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I genuinely want to understand this point, as it would help those of us who are unlikely to be enlightened about it in time for our next discussion. The Minister said that the commissioners decided that they should determine case law, which I accept--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Was the authority under which the commissioners made that decision statutory or judicial?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Judicial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I thank the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 10(1)(b) makes it clear that a Minister can change decisions on his own initiative. What does that mean? Does it mean that a Minister, on his own initiative, can make decisions that establish precedent? That would mean that the Bill includes a new power, different from the provisions of law and regulation that now pertain.
<P>
Is that initiative to make precedent at whim subject to the power of the commissioners to confirm changes in case law? If so, I shall withdraw the amendment, as it is not relevant. There is, however, some ambiguity, given the enormous power afforded by the wording of clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for labouring a point that is taxing the Minister's patience, but as this subject may have considerable ramifications, it is worth seeking further clarification.
<P>
The Minister helpfully clarified the position of the commissioners as the sole source of case law: their position is judicial, not statutory. As statute overrides judicial decision making, have departmental lawyers or others inside the Government's legal service undertaken any investigation to establish beyond doubt that clause 10--the same issue will arise when clause 11 is discussed--cannot change judicial decisions? Provided that is entirely clear, the point has no further relevance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I thank the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of the last statement, I shall withdraw the amendment, on the understanding that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B>--it is the commissioners who, by judicial power, comprise the legal body that puts into effect case law arising from such decisions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman happy to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> As the debate on amendment No. 5 showed, a horribly complex issue is at the nub of this part of the Bill. It is crucial, therefore, that we get it right. We fully understand the intentions of the Government; we are grateful for the Minister's doing everything that he could to answer my hon. Friends' pertinent queries. The point of the Committee is to scrutinise legislation. Although at times his patience was tried, we appreciate his efforts to reassure us and to clarify and explain the nature of the implications of the measure.
<P>
The importance of the clause leads me, however, to press the Minister further. No doubt he will have read the Child Poverty Action Group's briefing on the Bill. It raises a number of issues, with some of which my hon. Friends and I do not necessarily agree. One point that has arisen is the important question of details being left to regulation. Will the Minister explain the circumstances in which a decision can be revised?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That would help us in our deliberations in Committee, and it would also assist those outside the Committee Room, who, for a variety of reasons, are following our proceedings carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I want to return to an issue that we debated in connection with the amendments proposed to clause 10--the regulations to be made under it and other clauses in the Bill. I do not want to extend the debate further than necessary, but I remind the Committee that, under pressure from my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) and me, the Minister made a significant concession. He stated that he intended to make at least some of the draft regulations available during Committee--and I would like to add that I am grateful to the Minister for the helpful briefings on the Bill that he has provided.
<P>
I want to re-emphasise that the Opposition are still distinctly unhappy about the Bill. It is a skeleton, and much needs to be fleshed out by regulations. Will the Minister tell the Committee how he sees the progress of the presentations of the draft regulations to the Committee? Will it be in the same helpful way as we receive briefings on various issues as they appear on the Committee's horizons?

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Clause 10 is a key clause, and although I do not want to delay the Committee, it is worth while to spend a little time repeating its purpose.
<P>
Clause 10 will enable the Department of Social Security and its agencies to set up new, modern efficient systems to settle customers' disputes on decisions and to correct wrong decisions. The clause will allow decision makers to take a fresh look at decisions, and, where they are wrong, to put them right quickly, with the minimum of fuss. I hope that the Committee agrees that that is a sensible way forward.
<P>
Members of the Committee will know, from the experience of their constituents, that the current appeals process is cumbersome and lengthy. Other clauses in the Bill will make that process more efficient. Clause 10 complements the other improvements by ensuring that only those cases in which there is a genuine disagreement result in appeals.
<P>
Department of Social Security staff want to deliver a high standard of service to thier customers, and customers want to receive correct decisions. Customers often appeal against a decision, rather than discussing it with the relevant agency, because they are not aware of any other way to have decisions checked. They only want to have decisions checked and to be sure that they understand how decisions have been made.
<P>
Once an appeal has been lodged, however, the decision cannot be changed in the customer's favour unless all aspects of the appeal are met or the appeal is withdrawn. Cases are often drawn into a lengthy and unnecessary process, when decisions could be revised at an early stage by sensible discussion and by giving the customer information.
<P>
It is especially unfortunate that customers can become involved in the appeals process even when the appeal has no possibility of success. Proper explanation to the customer at the earliest possible time would normally avoid the need for an appeal, but at the moment cases have to go to appeal as there are no powers to correct decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does the Minister accept that one possible reason for the high proportion of appeals is that, because so many decisions are reversed on appeal, any customer whose claim is refused feels that he has nothing to lose under the current regime by going to appeal? If the Minister accepts that premise, what will his Department do to break down the culture that has grown up in that respect, given that the new system is meant to expedite proceedings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman's comments reinforce the need for a Bill to modernise the system. We need a customer-focused social security system so that discussion can take place at the earliest opportunity. The decisions made can be got right the first time by simplification, explanation and by ensuring that we have modern technological back-up to help in efficient delivery. That is the purpose of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Absolutely. As the Minister found out on Second Reading, we have no arguments against that because it is what we planned to do had we won the election on 1 May, so we are at one in that respect. The problem that the Minister is minimising--through no malicious intent, I am sure--is the current culture among customers, or potential customers. With all due respect, people in the Dog and Duck are not talking about the Social Security Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe </B>(Bradford, South): Oh?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggests that they might be, so it might be sensible for the Minister to visit a few pubs this weekend when he is in his constituency. I do not think that he will find people discussing the Bill. As we said earlier, the Minister is a modest man, so he can be modest in his alcoholic consumption during his visits.
<P>
On a serious point, I do not think that many customers are aware of the changes that the Government want to make and I suspect that when the Bill is enacted, there will be a large proportion of customers who are oblivious to the changes and are still steeped in the old culture. If the decision goes against them they will appeal automatically because they believe that they will have nothing to lose--indeed, they may have something considerable to win. I wonder how the Government will tackle the problem of educating people and breaking down that culture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for sanctioning my pub crawl this weekend on behalf of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We look forward to a report on Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Absolutely--I shall report back to the Committee.
<P>
We must not get the matter out of context. Clearly, part of the culture, as described by the hon. Gentleman, comes from the complexity of the current arrangements and the lack of opportunity for a face-to-face explanation about changed circumstances. An appeal takes place because there is not an opportunity for correction at an earlier stage. Only about 5 per cent. of all decisions taken by the Department are appealed against, however, so the culture is not as wide-ranging as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> To put that in context, obviously there will be no appeals against a successful decision, which will distort the figures and the 5 per cent. that the Minister just mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It depends how one describes a successful decision. If it is a decision that the customer wants, clearly he will not appeal. But the hon. Gentleman seemed to be implying that people would only be satisfied that the decision was right if they appealed against it and then had confirmation that it was right originally. We want to ensure that by allowing an early explanation of customer dissatisfaction, the problem can be resolved by that early dialogue so that it will not be necessary to go to appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I was talking only about decisions that went against customers; I suspect that the number of cases will be infinitely higher than 5 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I understand the point that has been made, but I was talking about the totality of the business in which we are involved. Clearly, the percentage of only those who are dissatisfied will be higher.
<P>
We want to get it right at the first opportunity so that people receive their entitlement as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Bill will ensure that information is made available. We shall make progress as speedily as possible on the regulations that will underpin those opportunities, and I assure members of the Committee that, when drafted, they will be made available to the House.
<P>
I hope that we all accept that clause 10 is a crucial element in the modernisation agenda; it will ensure that decisions can be made and changed at the earliest opportunity, but it will not in any way limit the right to appeal against the decision once it has been made. Given those assurances, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 10 stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish to give the Committee another small piece of procedural advice. I know that bonding is the order of the day, but I draw the attention of members of the Committee to the fact that they are not allowed to bond to the extent of addressing each other by name or by pronouns in the second person--singular or plural. The only bonding allowed is between the Chairman and members of the Committee, whom I may address by name. I ask that members of the Committee at all times address their remarks to the Chair and refer to other members of the Committee in the third person.

<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Committee will be delighted to know that the issue that I wished to raise was the use of regulation rather than primary legislation. However, rather than drive members of the Commitee to distraction, I thought that I would raise a different facet, which is of great concern to the Liberal Democrat party. Under clause 11(3), regulations may prescribe that the Secretary of State may do more or less as she pleases. I have great faith in the right hon. Lady--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> You do or you don't?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I do, and I am sure that the Government expect the Secretary of State to be in that position for a long period, and that her successors will be people of equally high standing and good character. Indeed, the Government probably think that people of such good nature will be in power indefinitely. I do not share that view; I am more concerned that a Government of a different hue may find themselves in power and seize on the Bill and the powers under clause 11(3) to have their wicked way with the benefits system.
<P>
The Minister and his colleagues are essentially decent people, but he cannot be sure that his successors will be decent people. We tabled amendments Nos. 128 and 129 in the hope that, should the unfortunate happen and there be a successor who is not of the same stature and caring disposition as the current Secretary of State, some safeguards will be in place.
<P>
We have listed in amendment No. 128 the circumstances in which a decision might be superseded. If the Minister does not agree with those circumstances and can think of others in which a decision might be superseded, we should be interested to know whether future regulations could include circumstances other than those listed in our amendment. If not, we ask the hon. Gentleman to accept our proposal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Given your earlier remarks about bonding, Mr. O'Hara, the example of Uhu-like bonding that we have just witnessed is indeed charming; and although some Conservative Members may not entirely agree with the particular animadversions of the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), we nevertheless support much of what underlies the amendment.
<P>
I do not wish to speak precisely in favour of amendment No. 128; we have some doubts about its drafting. However, I should like to speak about its general direction and to take considerably further the points made by the hon. Member for Northavon. What I have to say is important, although I realise that it may tax the patience of the Minister. However, I hope that the Minister and the Committee will nevertheless be willing to listen to a slightly longer exposition.
<P>
Amendment No. 128, and clause 11(3) to which it refers, illustrate well not merely a point that is important in itself, but one that has wider application in the drafting of other parts of the Bill. I hope that by exposing that point now we may eventually save the Committee's time in that we shall not need to expose those points repeatedly as we go through the Bill. I hope that the Minister will, on considering the points that I make now, propose Government amendments to mitigate the effect in other clauses.
<P>
I begin with a personal observation. As a new Member, witnessing for the first time the proceedings of a Standing Committee, I am slightly alarmed--I suppose it may have become habitual for those who have vastly greater experience--that the Committee tends to concentrate almost exclusively on the amendments. Not until the stand part debate does the Committee consider the clause or subsection being amended, and that debate does not even always take place when clauses are agreed to formerly. The result is that the underlying intent of a clause sometimes goes unnoticed.
<P>
I draw attention to the point made rather briefly by the hon. Member for Northavon about the wording of subsection (3). It is a classic of its kind. I have spent some time, with the assistance of officials of the House, trying to track down other cases of legislation being so beautifully and epigrammatically phrased. The subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Regulations may prescribe the cases and circumstances in which, and the procedure by which, a decision may be made under this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One could not more quickly describe such a large power. It allows regulations without constraint to prescribe cases or circumstances and procedures. That is about as wide as such legislation could be. It encapsulates the doctrine espoused by the Minister at a previous sitting that matters of procedure should be left out of the Bill and made by regulation.
<P>
However, the Minister also said that the first part of the Bill did deal with procedure. In trying to rescue coherence from that statement, one would assert that his doctrine was that the broad principles of procedure should be laid out in this part of the Bill but that all details of procedure should be laid out in regulation. Unfortunately, subsection (3) entirely belies that theory because it says nothing about the details of procedure but merely that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulations may prescribe the cases and circumstances in which, and the procedure by which''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>In other words, every aspect of procedure is to be left to regulation.
<P>
I wish to make some observations about the general implications and consequences of subsection (3) and the effect that amendment No. 128 would have. I should also like to pre-empt one of the responses that the Minister is otherwise all too likely to make. The Minister has said repeatedly, sometimes for the sake of debate and sometimes seriously, that Conservative Members have no business objecting to wide discretion and the use of regulation to incorporate procedural or other changes, on the grounds that the previous Government had a poor record in that respect.
<P>
I should like to place on record what is, no doubt, entirely evident to every member of the Committee. First, I was not a member of the previous Government--alas, not being a Member of the House, I had no opportunity to be so. Secondly, I spent about 10 years at considerable disbenefit to myself railing against the previous Government's overuse of regulation.
<P>
Thirdly, the over-use of regulation was by no means a practice of the previous Government only; it had developed in the United Kingdom since the 1920s and was vastly extended, I regret to say, by the Attlee Government, who set a trend which, I further regret to say, was adopted by successive Administrations, including the previous one--for which I make no excuse.
<P>
Fourthly, it ill behoves Labour Members, still less the Minister in his vast wisdom, to complain about improvements to or changes in the attitude of a political party, or about apologies for past errors, given that his party has performed perhaps the most remarkable change of heart ever witnessed in modern British politics. For all those reasons, I pray that the Minister will not respond to the serious and well intentioned remarks that I shall make merely by accusing me of engaging in the disgraceful business of holding a view which Conservative Members did not espouse when in government.
<P>
With that preface, I shall return to subsection (3) and amendment No. 128. It is important to concentrate not just on the precise drafting of this epigrammatic subsection but on the entire intent of clause 11, which bears considerable resemblance to clause 10, about which we have just heard useful clarification. Clause 11 will allow the Secretary of State to supersede decisions.
<P>
The predictability of decision making and of the outcomes of decisions is the hallmark of liberal democracy. That observation is not original; since the 17th century, people thinking about politics in Britain have stressed the extraordinary importance both of the promulgation of law--a point which my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has insisted upon--and of the predictability of law.
<P>
One of the characteristics of the tyrannies that existed for all too many years in eastern Europe is that they engaged in the practice, which we would regard as laughable, of making secret laws. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has alluded to a milder form of that problem. The unpredictability of decision making was also a problem in those countries. It was impossible for individuals to determine from day to day what might be the next decision of a particular commissar. Indeed, they found themselves in conflict with decisions which they could not have predicted as they were taken in secret. In this case, we are dealing not with secrecy or promulgation, as we were in the debate on amendments to clause 10, but with predictability.
<P>
A profound idea lies behind clause 11. The Secretary of State, having made a decision--an awesome thing for a Secretary of State to do, and it appears awesome to the people, who often feel like pawns, about whom those decisions are taken--can unmake and change it. In itself, that is wholly unobjectionable. Notwithstanding the remarkable and particularly pleasing eulogy by the hon. Member for Northavon, the Secretary of State is, like any human being, fallible and, however guided by the might and wisdom of the Department of Social Security, she may, alas, make mistakes. So it is reasonable to allow the Secretary of State to supersede a decision. Opposition Members do not question that.
<P>
However, it is a fundamental principle of liberal democracy that decisions should be made and unmade predictably. In this case, subsection (3) will govern whether the unmaking of decisions can be predicted because it explicitly states that there are no restrictions on the circumstances under which the Secretary of State may unmake a decision, apart from constraints that may be made by regulation--and the Bill lays down the explicit power that any regulation may be made at any time.
<P>
Through the combination of the general intent of the clause and the subsection with which the amendment deals, the Secretary of State is given a wide power to unmake all decisions--thereby, alas, necessarily introducing an element of unpredictability into the Bill, without any constraint on that unpredictability other than the vague gesture towards regulations which may encapsulate constraints. Although we have quibbles with the drafting of amendment No. 128, its intention is nevertheless clear, honourable, in the tradition of a liberal democracy and should be unobjectionable to the Government. It seeks only to place some constraints on the way in which and the basis on which decisions made be unmade and therefore to reintroduce at least some element of predictability in decision-making.
<P>
I said at the beginning of my contribution that I would like to expatiate on the issue at--with apologies to the Committee--some length because the implications of the subsection, in the context of the clause, will be much wider than the Bill or the topics with which it deals. I fear that I may have made myself notorious as an eccentric because of my attention, to which the Minister has made amusing allusions, to the question of computers in decision making, a question to which I do not wish to return now. The tenor of my remarks was that although Members of the Committee might not think that that mattered, it would have implications that mattered. And that is also true of my present point. The regulations that the Minister will lay down may--I hope that he will reassure us, and particularly the hon. Member for Northavon, on the point--be reasonable; they may be almost parallel to the constraints set out in amendment No. 128. However, there will come a time, not merely when the Secretary of State is no longer the Secretary of State--an eventuality that would not be as damaging to Conservative Members as it is to the hon. Member for Northavon--but when all Members, the procedures of the Committee and the drafters of the Bill have passed away; the statute will, however, probably still exist. People will draw conclusions from it and will regard it as an important precedent about how to regulate in the wide domain of social affairs. They will notice that the statute, as drafted in subsection 3 and in the clause as a whole, establishes the principles of regulation without constraint and of there being no need to insist in statute on any predictability in decision making. I do not believe that any member of the Committee, on either side, can conceivably be in harmony with those two principles or believe that those parts of the Bill were drafted with great ministerial attention--under the previous or the present Administration.
<P>
On reading the Bill--the principles of which we support--one often has the overwhelming and regrettable sense of Sir Humphrey having beaten Mr. Hacker hollow. The subsection exemplifies that; it is beautifully and epigrammatically drafted, but its intent is something to which no politician concerned with the wider implications for our democracy of the way in which we go about the business of statute law could conceivably subscribe. It is a classic example of Whitehall at its best and its worst: at its best in that it has put the matter beautifully and crisply; at its worst in that it establishes a precedent--not intentionally, of course--that will, over time, diminish people's ability to rely on the predictability of the law.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Minister, even if he does not accept amendment No. 128, will reconsider whether Government amendments should be tabled--to many measures in the Bill, including to this clause--to change the great licence and the great degree of unpredictability that subsection (3) introduces.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I have listened to the contribution of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) with great interest, and he has raised important questions about legislative procedures, the scrutiny of Parliament and accountability for Parliament's actions, which I take very seriously. As a new Government, we should examine the way in which Parliament introduces legislation and how we can be sure that it is, in the widest sense of the word, good legislation. We should consider whether interested parties have the opportunity to comment on, revise and contribute to the formation of good legislation. We take such matters seriously.
<P>
I hope that, when proposals are made, we shall carefully consider issues such as those that the hon. Gentleman raised and ensure that the rights of individuals in this modern democracy are in no way limited by the way in which Parliament develops legislation and subsequently scrutinises it.
<P>
Many of the hon. Gentleman's points were well made and I understand them. We are, however, dealing with the Bill as we find it. I have, in previous times, made comments about the use of regulatory powers, and I understand the points that members on both sides of the Committee have made.
<P>
The essence of the amendment is whether we should use primary or secondary legislation and I want to assure members of the Committee that the circumstances that are set out in it are exactly those that we have in mind. That said, we are using secondary legislation in this case because further opportunities to modernise the process may arise as a result of case law, as we have discussed. There may be a need in the future to be more precise than the amendment, which is framed in terms of primary legislation, suggests. In those circumstances, it would be easier and better to make subsequent changes through secondary legislation than to include measures in the Bill.
<P>
The Government clearly subscribe to the principles in the amendment and I accept the points that the hon. Member for West Dorset has made in the wider context. He rightly said that we deal with business by tabling amendments and then having a general discussion. It is always open to the Opposition to table amendments in a way that allows the debate to unfold differently, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will find ever more ingenious ways in which to make his points during his years in the House.
<P>
Given my assurance about the substance of the regulations, the argument is whether the proposals in the amendment should be dealt with in the Bill or through secondary legislation. In the Government's view, the matter should be dealt with in regulations, as proposed in this case. With those assurances I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I have no wish to prolong the debate. I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance that the specific regulations that are likely to be made relating to the clause are, more or less, those in the amendment. However, that does not answer the point that I made. It means that this particular Government and these particular Ministers will introduce regulations with which we will broadly agree, but it cannot bind future Governments and Ministers.
<P>
We are essentially being asked to accept that to avoid the future inconvenience of having to use primary legislation to cover an unforeseen reason for superseding decisions, we whould give carte-blanche to not only the present--and, it would appear, well thought of--Secretary of State, but to all future Secretaries of State. That is a point to which we will continue to return, but I see no merit in pursuing the amendment to a vote at this stage. I want to put on record that we are questioning the beneficence not of the present incumbent, but of future incumbents, and future claimants may want safeguards greater than those in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 6, line 14, leave out `either'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 110, in page 6, line 15, leave out `on his own initiative'.
<P>
No. 111, in page 6, line 22, leave out from `on' to `which' in line 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> In amendment No. 110 the word ``or'' should have been included before the words ``on his own initiative'' so that the amendment makes sense. Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 fall into one group and amendment No. 111 makes a slightly separate point.
<P>
I shall begin with amendment No. 111, which I can deal with quickly. It concerns the date on which decisions superseding earlier decisions should take effect. We are probing why the Government feel that in some cases the decision should take effect from the date on which it is made rather than that on which the application was made. One would assume that an application for a new decision is usually made because of a change of circumstances that took place when the application was made. I wonder why, therefore, the date of the decision, which is unlikely to have anything to do with the date when the circumstances changed, is being given as an alternative for the decision to take effect. The date of the decision seems rather an arbitrary choice, so the amendment seeks to probe what the Government mean by that.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 109 and 110 return to the previous discussion about the degree of arbitrariness with which the Secretary of State can make decisions that supersede previous ones. There is a genuine worry, particularly where the decision supersedes one made in a previous appeal. If a claimant has won on appeal, it seems rather open to allow the Secretary of State an opportunity to overturn what his appeal tribunal has previously laid down. We need to consider the precise circumstances in which that could take place.
<P>
In the previous discussion we learned something of those circumstances as viewed by the present Minister, at least. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon ably made the point that matters will be left to regulation and there will much opportunity to make changes in future. In this case that is unnecessary because if in future the Secretary of State finds good reasons for making a new decision which will supersede a previous one, he does not have to supersede that decision, but could simply suggest that the appellant request that a new decision be given to supersede the previous one. Because he can say that to the appellant, there is no need for the Secretary of State to have the power to start that process. An extra power which could be abused will be given to the Secretary of State. That is unnecessary because everything could be done through the claimant. Therefore, we would not be removing anything that would speed up the process or make it easier by making this change; we would simply be removing a power which might be abused--I hope that it will not be--while still allowing for decisions to be superseded in the way that the clause intends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for trying your patience, Mr. O'Hara, but I want to discuss in particular the issues raised by amendment No. 110 and the phrase ``on his own initiative'', and to amplify the remarks of the hon. Member for Newbury.
<P>
The tenor of the clause and the effect of subsection (3) give wide powers, untrammelled by statute, to the Secretary of State. As the Minister correctly stated, the issue is whether measures--perhaps a set of constraints--should be in statute or enshrined in regulations. I should have thought that, on inspecting that phrase, he would agree that, if all constraint on the superseding of decisions is to be left to regulations, it is a matter of great moment whether the superseding of the decision is due to an injustice being felt by an applicant and registered as an application for change or due to the Minister having observed some defect.
<P>
We should reconsider the terms of the regulations--the Minister has assured us of them and, as I understand it, they roughly correspond to amendment No. 128--and imagine the circumstances in which individuals would find decisions altered. There will be cases in which there is ignorance of or a problem about a material fact, actual or anticipated relevant changes of circumstance or problems of law.
<P>
Regulations may subsequently be changed, setting up different bases for the supersession of a decision. In such circumstances there is an extremely important point of principle: the distinction between the applicant applying for a change because he thinks that an injustice has occurred and the Secretary of State, perhaps for fiscal reasons, thinking it administratively proper to make a change. An individual, even if covered by such regulations, may have come to rely upon a decision, so there will be a marked sense of injustice if it is changed.
<P>
The Minister mentioned changed circumstances. I agree that a change in an individual's circumstances constitutes the strongest case for ministerial discretion, but a decision could be based on an honest mistake. All members of the Committee will know from their constituency dealings of cases in which both individuals and officials have made honest mistakes. Over a considerable period, the individual has come to rely on a decision that was honestly made, but due to an honest mistake. Under those circumstances, the individual will inevitably feel a considerable sense of injustice if subsequently, on his own initiative, the Secretary of State makes a decision reversing the previous one, upon which much was founded.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
In normal commerce between private individuals, when someone has formed a legitimate expectation, based upon a decision or undertaking made by another individual, there are all sorts of forms of protection--which those learned in the law will be able to inform the Committee about--for the individual who has come so to rely on the decision previously made.
<P>
Under subsection (2), the Secretary of State for Social Security, having made a decision based on an honest mistake--possibly made by his own officials--but on which an individual may have come to rely, he can, unconstrained by statute, either under regulations which he has laid or under subsequent regulations laid expressly for this purpose, make changes to that individual's circumstances by superseding one of his own decisions. That is getting extraordinarily close to the line that divides due process from tyranny. The Minister may say, under guidance from his advisers, that there is no fear of tyranny in this country because judicial review is permanently available to protect the citizen. That is a mistake that I fear regimes of both political hues have made over many years in this country.
<P>
Judicial review is a remedy available to very powerful and large groups or to persons who are supported by such large groups. It is not available to the ordinary individual. The cost of litigation is overwhelming; the individual faces a litigant who has a bottomless purse, a very large and well trained governmental legal service and the full power of Treasury Counsel. The costs entailed, if awarded against the individual who is making the claim, are sufficient to bankrupt millionaires, let alone the ordinary person. So judicial review is simply not the beginning of an answer. It is therefore extraordinarily important that statutes be drafted in such a way as to ensure that the individual can form legitimate expectations about decisions made, even when they are based on a mistake, and not find that circumstances arise--either through existing regulations or regulations made specifically for the purpose--in which legitimate expectations are falsified by subsequent changes of decision.
<P>
The phrase ``on his own initiative'' in subsection (2) is either close to having, or actually has, that intent and effect. I beg the Minister, who I am sure is currently preparing to defend that subsection and phrase with all his customary affability, intelligence and effectiveness--not to mention the support of his party's overwhelming numbers in Committee--to reflect whether he really wants to do that.
<P>
This, to adapt the phrase used by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford, might become the Keith Bradley memorial subsection. Its provisions may echo down the ages of legislation as being the point at which British legislation took an even worse turn than that which it has taken over many years as a result of giving Secretaries of State too great a licence in their regulation-making powers.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I rise not as a tyrant--not even a modest one. I hope that I can give the Committee some comfort by explaining how the amendments would affect the clause and what the consequences would be.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 109 and 110, which the hon. Gentleman rightly spoke to together, achieve a common aim which, as he identitifed, is to remove the power in clause 11 for the Secretary of State to revise a decision on her own initiative. I shall first explain what the clause does, and go on to explain why.
<P>
Broadly speaking, the clause provides the mechanism for changing decisions where there has been a change of circumstances during the currency of an award or where a decision is disputed after the time limit for revision under clause 10 has expired. Therefore, this clause will enable wrong decisions to be changed after the normal dispute period has expired or where a change of circumstances has taken place.
<P>
The clause provides that the process leading to having a decision superseded can be initiated either by an application from the customer or by the Secretary of State on her own initiative. This process is essentially the same as current practice. It enables a decision to be changed either where the customer reports a change in circumstances that affects entitlement to benefit--for example, the birth of a child may lead to an increase in income support--or where the Secretary of State decides to supersede a decision on her own initiative. An example of where the Secretary of State may wish to revise a decision on her own initiative might be where an error in an assessment of entitlement to benefit has come to light during a routine case check or where she has received a notification from some other source that leads to an increase in a customer's entitlement to benefit.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset implied that the Secretary of State using her initiative to change the circumstances would not always be in the customer's best interests. It works both ways. Another good example would be where there is a notification of an award of disability living allowance which would trigger any entitlement to a disability premium on income support. The Secretary of State could initiate that process because of what had come to light in favour of the customer; it would not rely on the customer having to find out that he may have an additional entitlement. It can therefore work in the customer's best interests. The hon. Member for West Dorset suggested that the tyranny of the state was there solely to deny people their entitlement rather than to improve their position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My question has two aspects. In the first place, does the Minister accept that in the preponderance of cases where the rights of an individual are being adversely affected, that individual will make an application if permitted? Secondly, does he accept that although there could be circumstances in which the Secretary of State wanted to make a change in favour of an individual, the Secretary of State will more typically want to make a change in favour of the Treasury? Will he therefore accept that we must be on our guard against the possibility--that was all I asserted--that the Secretary of State may abuse the right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The point I am trying to make is that the amendment's purpose is to deny the Secretary of State any opportunity to make revisions that could be in the interests of the customer. I do not want to deny the Secretary of State the right to improve the benefit entitlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Minister accept that his argument is like saying that it would be a good idea to allow the Ministry of Defence an untrammelled right to engage in warfare within the United Kingdom--on the grounds that there may be circumstances in which that would be the superior option and to the advantage of certain sections of the population--instead of using the police force? The fact that some eventualities may occur in which it could be advantageous to give greater powers to Ministers does not establish the correctness of conferring such powers on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I will not be led down that wide route. I am dealing with the Social Security Bill. Let me give another example of where the Secretary of State can make useful changes--the general uprating of benefits, which does not rely on the customer having to apply for an increase in every case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I will not give way again to the hon. Member for West Dorset; I give way to the hon. Member for Northavon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister; I wanted to deal with the other side of the coin. The Minister provided the interesting example of someone on disability living allowance who thereby becomes entitled to a disability premium on income support. The clause is intended to prompt the Secretary of State to ensure that that entitlement is claimed. In our earlier discussions, the Minister said that the last thing my pensioner who claims housing benefit wants is an onus on the Secretary of State to tell the income support people. What is the difference between those two cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Your amendment would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to make that revision. That is why I am suggesting that the amendments would not be in the best interests of the customer. The wish of the Liberal Democrat party to go down that route cuts off your ability to take that argument further. I hope that even that narrow point convinces you to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We must make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> But it would be helpful to the Minister to give way--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Let me deal with amendment No. 111 and then the hon. Gentleman can be helpful to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 would mean that the Secretary of State could change a decision only on the date on which it was reported by the customer. Customers do not always find it easy to report changes as soon as they happen--for example, it may take some time to obtain the appropriate documentary evidence. As I explained in response to an earlier amendment, we intend to give customers a month in which to report such changes. That should give them sufficient time to gather the information and report the change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way--I simply want to be helpful to him. If he feels that the amendments as drafted by the hon. Member for Northavon are defective because they would have the opposite effect to that intended--that is, they would be more restrictive--but he concedes that they make a genuine and worthwhile point, would he be prepared to offer the services of his own draftsmen to put the amendments in a shape acceptable to the Government? That would be an easy way around the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I will remember in future, Mr. O'Hara, not to believe that the hon. Gentleman is always trying to be helpful.
<P>
I have said why the Government cannot accept the amendments, and I hope that they will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> First, I should like to consider what the Minister said about amendment No. 111, which concerns the timing of decisions. He said--I may have misunderstood him, but perhaps he can clarify the point--that it is sometimes right for the decision to take effect not on the date of application, but on some other date.
<P>
The original clause appears to say not that there may be a better date than that on which the application was made, but that the only alternative date would be that on which the second decision was taken. It is not obvious why the date on which the second decision was taken is necessarily the right one if the date on which the application was made is not the right one. As I said earlier, it might be better to make it the date on which the change of circumstance took effect, but that is not necessarily the date on which the second decision was made. I need a little more clarification before I can withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is a serious one. Does he accept that there are considerable ambiguities surrounding effective dates in the current system? Like me, the hon. Gentleman may have come across cases of constituents who are denied particular rights on the grounds that they have not made appeals within a given time; in fact, they were unable to do so because the necessary documents had not been dispatched quickly enough. Does he agree, therefore, that there was a prior need to tighten up the system, which the clause unfortunately fails to do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I accept that there are difficult cases under the current legislation. It may well be that clause 11 does not deal with those, but since the Bill will replace almost the whole system, it is more important to ensure that the Bill is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> If I can try to be helpful with regard to amendment No. 111, the regulations provided for by clause 11(5) would allow another date to be prescribed, which would fit in with the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described. Thus what he wants amendment No. 111 to achieve will be possible under the regulation.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted to have the Minister's assurance on that. Of course, we do not yet know what the regulations will state, but we have at least succeeded in wheedling an assurance out of the Minister that he will ensure that they contain the amendment's point. With that in mind, I shall be delighted to withdraw it.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 have a different aim. The Minister has not entirely satisfied me about these amendments. If a decision is changed to the claimant's benefit, I still do not understand why the Secretary of State cannot ensure that the other route is taken--claimants themselves would suggest that a new decision should be made.
<P>
In circumstances in which the change would benefit the claimant or appellant, it does not seem necessary for the Secretary of State to have to decide to proceed to a new decision. I understand that the Secretary of State may be thinking of cases in which a further decision goes against the interests of the claimant or appellant, but those cases are very different. The Minister did not answer my point about possible new decisions that would favour the claimant. Will he explain further?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting the Secretary of State will not have the automatic power to make the change, but should tell the customer that there is a beneficial change? The customer would then have to apply for a beneficial decision from the Secretary of State. Would it not be simpler for the Secretary of State to make the change?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Of course it would be simpler in some ways for the procedure laid out in the clause to take effect. The danger is that the procedure, as stated in the clause, gives the Secretary of State other powers. I am trying to restrict the Secretary of State's ability to use more arbitrary powers. I do not wish to lessen the possibility that a decision could be changed as a result of the Secretary of State suggesting to the appellant that he or she may initiate that change. That would not restrict the claimants' rights to receive more benefit, if it was due to them, but it would prevent the Secretary of State from using arbitrary powers--especially to overturn an appeal that concluded in a claimant's favour.
<P>
The Minister has not answered that point fully. Will he comment further? He is obviously unwilling to do so. I am sorry about that, because the clause gives the Secretary of State unnecessary and arbitrary power. The Committee, therefore, may want to return to the matter. The argument has been fully aired for the moment. I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, although it has not yet been properly dealt with, on the understanding that the Committee may return to it.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall take this opportunity to give the Committee a little more procedural advice. First, the personal pronoun in the second person singular continues to be used occasionally. I ask members of the Committee to respect the Chair's monopoly on that usage by addressing all their remarks to the Chair.
<P>
Secondly, officials whose status means that they should be seen but not heard are nearly on the platform. Will the Minister help us to ensure that that status is observed?
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister spell out a little further the intent of the words ``his own initiative'', which appear in this clause and in the previous clause? Does that phrase mean that the Secretary of State can supersede or revise judgments? We do not know what arbitrary powers are intended. Will the regulations fully spell out what the term is intended to cover, or will there still be considerable potential to reinterpret the present understanding of law and judgments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that I am not pre-empting the Minister's reply to that. It is important to put on record a statement about the whole of the clause. The clause has the widest possible implications, and I came to the Committee this morning with the greatest possible doubts about its good sense. I fear that those doubts will be reinforced when I leave the Committee for lunch.
<P>
The clearest sign that a piece of legislation or administration has been misconceived is when the logic that defends it breaks down. I regret to say that the Minister's replies to Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members' criticisms of this clause have contained serious logical flaws. If the intention of this clause genuinely was to protect flexibility solely in circumstances in which that was the claimant's advantage, it would have been perfectly within the grasp of the Government's drafting assistants to achieve that. They could easily have fashioned the clause so that it specifically permitted the Secretary of State's initiative to be the basis for a supersession or revision of a decision in such circumstances. The failure to do that shows that that was not the sole intent of the phrase ``on his own initiative''.
<P>
The clause attempts to do what it appears to do--to give wide and arbitrary power, untrammelled by regulations, and a specific power to lay regulations, unconstrained by procedural rule or by the purposes for which those regulations are allowed to be laid. It is one of the worst examples of a bad tendency in English law. It is highly regrettable, not only in the context of the clause or the Bill, but in the context of the view that the public will take of the Government. The Government are adopting the worst practices of particular drafting, assisting Sir Humphrey in his endless quest to make it less possible for the public to depend upon clarity and predictability in decision making. It further assists Sir Humphrey in his defence of the Treasury's interests, allowing him--in this short-sighted manner--to put much more fundamental individual liberties at risk.
<P>
The drafting of clause 11, despite its underlying good sense, is highly regrettable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> To answer the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, regulations made under the clause will provide for circumstances in which decisions are superseded. Those regulations will be laid down and subject to the normal parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
It is unfortunate that the hon. Member for West Dorset does not believe that the Secretary of State should have the power to change matters for the benefit of the claimant. The hon. Member also appears to be arguing that, even when it is quite clear that a customer should not be receiving benefit, the Secretary of State should not have the power to revise the decision that led to that situation. The hon. Member seems to believe that, even when claimants have deliberately failed to notify a change of circumstances--perhaps they have returned to work and are still claiming benefit--the Secretary of State should not have the power to intervene to ensure that the benefit entitlement is accurate. That is regrettable. 
<P>
The clause is an important part of the modernisation of the processes of the DSS, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Regulations with respect to decisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 6, line 29, leave out ``or the former legislation``.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 37, in page 7, line 4, leave out lines 4 to 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The concentration of extensive powers--and indeed, from one perspective, new powers--in the Secretary of State's hands has been a constant theme in our debate. Hon. Members have therefore been anxious to ensure that the Secretary of State and departmental officials use those powers properly and predictably.
<P>
My amendments would remove the two references to ``the former legislation'' in clause 12. I have no quibble with clause 12 applying to what it calls ``the current legislation'': that makes sense. The reference to ``former legislation'' is, however, not so straightforward. The definition of ``former legislation'' is helpfully set out in subsection (4): the National Insurance Acts 1965 to 1974, the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts 1965 to 1974, the Social Security Act 1975 and Part II of the Social Security Act 1986.
<P>
The ``former legislation'' defined in the clause relates to contributory benefits. It is arguable that the safeguards that currently apply to benefits towards which people have paid good money should remain. A distinction should be drawn between the regulations that will put into effect the provisions of the Bill and the powers that the current legislation concentrates on the Secretary of State.
<P>
To amend the current legislation to extend that power to contributory benefits, making them subject to the same rules as the benefits that we have discussed, would be an amendment too far. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Further to the concise and accurate statements from my hon. friend the Member for Eastbourne, I wish to emphasise a point of wider principle. Subsection (1) not only affects a particular body of law dealing with contributory benefit; it also affects the legislative principle. It allows regulations to be made in subsequent legislation to cover eventualities that Parliament did not anticipate when it passed the original legislation. That is apparently its purpose and effect: if I have misunderstood that, will the Minister clarify it for me?
<P>
The provision constitutes a wide breach of the principle of parliamentary scrutiny. This Committee is examining the Bill clause by clause, but much of the purpose of our scrutiny would be lost if a one-line Bill were to be passed next year with the sole intent of allowing all matters in the Bill to be altered by regulation, subject only to the Social Security Administration Act 1992. There is, therefore, a serious question about the long-term constitutional effects of the provision proposed in the clause. I am not an expert in such matters, but I do not believe that that provision is unique--alas. It reinforces a highly questionable tendency, and that, allied to the points made previously in our debates, builds up further a picture in which the use of--or at least the effect of--this part of the Bill would undermine certain critical principles of legislative propriety. For that reason I thoroughly commend my hon. Friend's amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I want to reiterate the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. We are discussing powers that affect formal legislation on contributory benefits; such powers might be altered under regulations that we have not seen. That point has come up time and time again during the course of our debates. The Opposition accept that the Minister has sought to be as helpful as possible in his assurances about the content of the regulations, but I issue the same caveat as I have in the past. The regulations will be determined by negative resolution and all the arguments that we had in our previous debates continue to hold the same weight.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the matter carefully? Will he give us some cast-iron categorical assurances that allay our fears? He proposes to issue powers that might affect the principle of the contributory benefits. Such powers are far reaching, and at the moment their full effects remain unseen.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Conservative Members are reading meanings into the Bill that are not intended. The terms ``former legislation'' and ``current legislation'', used in the clause, refer to those Acts of Parliament that were in existence at the time of the consolidating legislation in 1992, and which have come into effect from that date. The categories that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford is trying to distinguish are irrelevant. ``Former'' and ``current'' refer to consolidation provisions and not--as has been suggested--categories of legislation.
<P>
The clause refers to the two groups of legislation that I have outlined, and not specifically to types of legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Minister accept that, in order to resolve the problem to which I alluded, it would be proper to remove references to both former and current legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No, I do not accept that. We need both terms to ensure that the consolidation in 1992 flows through into the present legislation. The amendments are unnecessary, and I hope that they will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of those remarks, does the Minister mean that contributory benefits are excluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No. All the legislation that has been identified applies, but it is not put into boxes and categorised in the way that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford has suggested. ``Former'' and ``current'' refer to the date of consolidation of the legislation and not to the nature of that legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does not that mean that the powers extend to contributory benefits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have the sense that I may have misunderstood an important point, and hope that Minister will explain. I understand his point both about current legislation, as defined--I think that I was remiss in not identifying the scope of that definition--and the references to the former legislation. It would appear to the layman, however, that both have the effect of permitting regulations to be made in respect of Acts, under which it was not anticipated that such regulations would be made. Will the Minister clarify that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Surely, when making new legislation, one should also consolidate previous legislation. One cannot just leave things in isolation, saying that one cannot consider particular matters because they were not scrutinised at the time the Acts were passed. I wish we could wipe out the past 18 years like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Either I am making a dreadful mistake or I am making a serious point. I am trying to make a serious point, but the Minister is treating it flippantly.
<P>
I am not talking about consolidation, although, of course, we accept it; it is an age-old practice. Unless I am unaware of the meaning of the word or missing some vital legal point--or the Minister is not explaining something--the Bill appears to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provision may be made by regulations for the making of any decisions . . . under or in connection with''
<P>
</UL></FONT>various sorts of previous legislation.
<P>
If the Bill gives the power to make regulations in respect of previous Acts, it is not a matter of consolidation but of permitting regulations to be made that would not be necessary if those previous Acts already provided such regulatory powers. The Bill must add regulatory powers to Acts that do not contain the power to make regulations. If I am wrong, a clear and modest explanation would help rather than a dismissal of my argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> What we are trying to do is bring in new, modern and different ways of decision making, so that all previous legislation can be treated in a modern and efficient manner. That is the purpose of allowing regulations to be based on previous legislation. It is common practice, and I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman is going on about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that the Minister has now admitted the effect of clause 12, although he was elegant enough not to say so. It would allow regulations to be made in respect of Acts, which were not premeditated when those Acts were considered. That is a matter of fundamental principle. The Minister may smile or conduct muttered conversations about the idiocy of my remarks as much as he pleases, but he will not remove the fact that it is a fundamental point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have listened with growing interest and unease to the debate. I had no idea that such a brief point would provoke such debate, but it has gone on for so long partly because much of what the Minister said and what I and my hon. Friends said was like two ships passing in the night--as if they were not engaged on the same point.
<P>
The Minister spoke about putting things in boxes, but that is a distinction without a difference. At the end of the exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset and the Minister, it was finally accepted that, as I said in my opening speech, the former legislation covers contributory benefits. It is now perfectly plain and out in the open that the Bill will refer to previous legislation and apply new concentrated powers to contributory benefits, benefits to which people contribute from their own funds. That is where to draw the distinction, leaving aside arguments about whether ``former legislation'' is a term of art and what it encompasses.
<P>
That is what I was trying to say; and none of us is satisfied with the Minister's explanation. We have, however, made our point, even if the Minister still has still to make his. On that basis, rather grudgingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 6, line 38, leave out from `expertise' to `direct' in line 39 and insert `he shall'.
<P>
As I said last time--famous last words, perhaps--this is a brief point. The amendment refers to subsection (3), which is the most bizarre bit of drafting it has been my misfortune to stumble across for some time. I shall be happy to be told differently by the Minister with his battery of experts and draftsmen, but it seems to suggest that when special expertise is patently required and that is recognised by the Secretary of State, instead of taking the obvious next step, as suggested in my amendment, of seeking advice from experts, the Secretary of State can ignore the benefit of outside help and go ahead with her decision. We are giving the Secretary of State the power not to have the assistance of experts even when it is clearly recognised that such expertise is required. That is a rash power for any Secretary of State, but especially for the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman). The draftsman must have been nodding off on this occasion.
<P>
Leaving aside the merits of my amendment, I should be rather embarrassed to be a member of a legislature that put such nonsense into law. For once, perhaps this is an amendment that the Minister can take seriously and contemplate accepting. Inserting the words ``he shall'' will mean that when expertise is required it will be sought. That is the nub of my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne, I, too, am puzzled by the wording in the subsection. I shall be interested to know why the Secretary of State might publish regulations that are contrary to the main gist of the provision. I understand from subsection (3) that the Secretary of State will have powers available if experts need to be consulted for advice, so why are the words ``unless regulations otherwise provide'' included? Why do we need regulations to state the exact opposite of what seems to be the main intention of the subsection? I should also be interested to know about the definition of expert, referred to in subsection (4).
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> May I just see whether I can help my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne? I have a suggestion to make, based on long acquaintance with the practices of certain legislative draftsmen. The draftsman in this case may not have been nodding off, as suggested by my hon. Friend, but nodding on. He may have become so used to the phrase ``unless regulations otherwise provide'', which may have been so much part of his--dare I say it--computer, that he included it without the slightest idea of why it was either necessary or desirable in this case.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that such speculation plays a great part in our proceedings, so I ask the hon. Member for West Chelmsford to be brief in his response to that intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Indeed, Mr. O'Hara. I shall leave it by saying simply that I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his suggestion. However, I should like to know why the phrase is in the subsection. It is contradictory and an unusual expression to include because it is completely at variance with the main thrust of the provision.
<P>
To define the word ``expert'' seems self-evidently necessary and sensible. However, can the Minister elaborate futher on special expertise? Obviously, if a problem arises in the Department concerning law, accountancy or other technical matters, Ministers will need to go outside the Department to obtain advice so that they are equipped with the best information available.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On what basis will the experts be consulted? Will it be through a competitive tendering system in which the Secretary of State will have on call advisers in different specialist fields to use in the circumstances outlined in subsection (3), or will there be greater flexibility when, on an ad hoc basis, the Secretary of State can call on experts who will no doubt be known to the Department? How will the use of experts and the public funding of the advice that is given be determined?
<P>
For example, will such an exercise be undertaken along the lines of the precedent set by the Department of Health with the use of media advisers? I am sure that Ministers read the story in The Mirror about the &#163;70,000 that is being used to provide an expert from outside the Department to advise the Secretary of State on how to improve her public image. That is a classic example of how to use experts. I assume that the definition in the Bill that refers to subsection (3) includes expert advice on media specialists to improve a person's image and his or her user-friendliness. I should appreciate the Minister's clarification of the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I shall not go down that route. Obviously, he was determined to get the point on the record some time this morning, and used this provision to do so.
<P>
Clause 12(3) provides the Secretary of State with appropriate flexibility to decide which cases call for expert advice. The amendment would remove that flexibility by binding the Secretary of State's hands. The right hon. Lady will seek the assistance of an expert when faced with a matter that requires special expertise when that is necessary to reach a decision on the case in question. The Department will seek the most appropriate advice that is in the public's interest, in the same way as this or previous Governments have always done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He has been patient as well as modest this morning. Does he agree that the words ``unless regulations otherwise provide'' are unnecessary and meaningless in the clause because of what he has just told the Committee? In other words, does the hon. Gentleman believe and intend that regulations will be made to stop the Secretary of State deciding that he or she needs such assistance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The words have been included in the provision to ensure that there is flexibility. In the spirit of co-operation, however, I am willingto reconsider whether those particular words are necessary. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue the point.
<P>
The reason why the requirement should be only permissive, not prescriptive, is that it is not our view that the Secretary of State may need in each case to refer to an adviser with particular expertise. The Secretary of State may sometimes be able to take a decision based on the information before him or her. That decision would not then need to be referred to the second opinion of an expert because the back-up information would already have been made available. That is why the clause is permissive, not prescriptive. In the light of that explanation and the concession that I have given him, I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> First, I am delighted by the Minister's concession; it has taken a lot of effort on our part to wring it from him. Let us hope that that concession is the harbinger of things to come. I think that all new Ministers, of whatever party, are protective of their Bills--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> It is our Bill [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> In that case, I am grateful that the Minister is so protective of our Bill. We can perhaps all agree that the wording may have been a slip of the word-processor during drafting, and I am grateful for the Minister's agreement to look at it again.
<P>
I do not want to sour the good relations that have broken out as a result of the concession, minor though it is, but I shall conclude by saying that I am still puzzled as to how a Secretary of State who had recognised that a problem required expertise would then proceed not to seek any. However, it seems that that will be a matter for the Secretary of State. On the basis of our new harmony, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee and the public that in accordance with the agreed order of consideration, we now proceed to clauses 18 and 19.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Finality of Decisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 12, leave out lines 10 to 12 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) below, subsection (1) above shall not make any finding of fact or other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision, or on which is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further decision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>	(3) Regulations shall provide a determination that a person is capable or incapable of work for the purpose of one relevant benefit shall be conclusive for the purpose of his entitlement to another relevant benefit.
<P>
	(4) For the purpose of subsection (3) above, ``relevant benefit'' shall have the same meaning as for section 9 above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause relates to the finality of decisions. Clearly, in some cases it makes sense for a decision to be treated as final for the purposes of considering other benefits. I recently visited the Stockport welfare rights unit, where people told me of the bizarre possibility of a claimant's signing on sick and being told that he is not sick enough and should claim jobseeker's allowance, yet when he turns up at the jobseeker's allowance department he is told that he is too unwell to work and should claim sickness benefit. He is entitled to neither benefit, because one office is using one set of rules and principles and the other is using another. The idea that a decision should be made once and then applied in all cases seems perfectly sensible.
<P>
For that reason, proposed new subsection (3) uses incapacity for work as an example of a case in which we approve of the principle of finality. However, there may be other instances in which a decision, once made, should be revisited without necessarily being regarded as final. For example, someone who is denied income support because he or she is deemed not to be habitually resident, and who makes a subsequent claim, may receive the immediate answer, ``No, because we have already said that you are not habitually resident; our decision was final then and remains so.'' The amendment seeks to probe whether finality would benefit claimants in some but not all cases while allowing for other issues to be reconsidered if they are central to a claim. That is why we want to amend the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would clarify one point on amendment No. 136, which would introduce into the clause a subsection on regulations. He seems to have slipped into the same habit as the Government in wanting to provide the fine detail under regulations.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman supported us in the Division on the amendment tabled to clause 11 in which we sought to reverse the decision on other regulations so that they would be dealt with under the affirmative rather than the negative procedure, so I am slightly surprised that the amendment before us does not specify whether the affirmative procedure would be used.
<P>
I appreciate that in drafting amendments it is not easy to include all the points that one would like to make. I am now learning that from bitter experience, especially as I no longer have the benefit of civil servants to draft amendments for me. Nonetheless, I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would confirm whether, if the amendment were to be accepted, he would wish to amend the provision further so that regulations would be dealt with under the affirmative procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's views on the lack of support for non-governmental parties in drafting amendments. I share his preference for regulations to be dealt with under the affirmative rather than the negative procedure. If the Government were to accept the principle of the amendment, I should be happy if they also adopted the affirmative procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that there is a deep connection between clause 18 and the issues that we discussed in debates on clauses 10 and 11, and to some extent on clause 12. In the debate on clause 11 we mentioned the importance that we attach to the arbitrariness of the powers contained therein.
<P>
Under those clauses, the Secretary of State will be given discretion to reverse and supersede decisions, but we now find that subsection (1), which would be greatly modified by amendment No. 136, will allow the Secretary of State to have the comfortable feeling that any decision will be final. That intensifies the asymmetry between the Secretary of State and the claimant.
<P>
Although, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford, the drafting of amendment No. 136 might not be perfect, the general intention of constraining the finality of decisions is merely one small but highly necessary step in trying to redress that asymmetry.
<P>
Debate adjourned.--[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]
