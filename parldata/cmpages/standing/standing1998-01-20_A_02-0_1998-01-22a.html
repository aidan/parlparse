<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 22 January 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/095/1997095.htm">School Standards and Framework Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Could we 
have some clarification about whether the Committee will sit this afternoon? The public notices in the 
House show that the Committee is scheduled to sit this afternoon, but my clear understanding—it is 
confirmed at column 28 of Tuesday’s Hansard—is that we would not sit this afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. It is not within my control. I intend to stay in 
London this weekend to see my grandson, so I am entirely at the Committee’s disposal.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to set limits on infant class sizes</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [20 January]: No. 60, in page 1, line 10, to leave out from ‘impose’ to end 
of line and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘on local education authorities a statutory duty to offer to all infant children resident within their 
area a place in a maintained school in a class of a maximum size prescribed within the 
regulations.’.—[Mr. Dorrell.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I was just launching into my speech on Tuesday when—I hope 
tantalisingly—I had to stop as it was 1 pm. I was about to explain the two advantages of finding you, 
Mr. McWilliam, in the Chair. First, you know how little I understand of procedure as a new Member 
of Parliament; and secondly, I know how tolerant you are of new Members for their lack of 
understanding.
<P>
I wish to tell new Labour Members that although your Whip may have told you that you must toe 
the line, he was only pulling your leg. The whole point of the Committee stage is that we should 
debate every aspect of the Bill, each expressing his personal views, but if you fail to do so, all the 
Whip can do is ask you to recite the seven times table.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman used the word “you”. I can recite the seven times 
table.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> You are quite right, Mr. McWilliam, but I am sure that those to whom my 
remarks were addressed will understand.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the balance of advantage of having smaller class sizes rests 
with the parents of those children who are directly affected. I have been involved in the education 
system, in one way or another, in London, in Cornwall and now in Surrey, and I know of no one, of 
any party, who maintains that class size does not matter. However, that is not the same as saying that 
class size should be the overriding consideration. Other factors are important.
<P>
In its press release of 4 December 1997, the Department for Education and Employment 
announced the result of a survey. Indeed, it was given quite a spin by Labour spin doctors. They 
applauded the fact that 35 per cent. of parents cited lower class sizes as their top priority. However, 
the same press release stated that 38 per cent. of parents regarded a greater emphasis on basics as 
being the top priority and that almost 30 per cent. of parents wanted schools to promote greater 
potential involvement. It was with the aim of promoting greater parental involvement that we tabled 
the amendment.
<P>
It is worth bearing in mind that the survey was based on responses to a leaflet distributed in 
supermarkets and high street stores. The press release pats itself on the back by saying that the 
response showed that the top priorities for parents were the Department’s top priorities. Well done 
indeed, but that was a self-selecting response. I imagine that most of those who responded to the 
survey would be inclined to agree with it. We cannot read an endorsement of the Government’s plans 
into the result.
<P>
In moving towards smaller class sizes, we need to ensure an element of parent power as well as 
state power. The problem of the 31st child has been mentioned, but we should also remember the 
problem of the sibling and what happens when parents want their children to go to a Church school. 
Religious education is dealt with more thoroughly in clause 54—sorry, I mean clause 56!
<P>
It is worth noting the Government’s aims. The White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We have pledged to reduce class sizes for 5, 6 and 7 year-olds to 30 or below within the next 
five years.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an example of a slogan being put before sense. To promise to deliver class sizes of 30 or 
below for all children in that age group is to make an effective and catching slogan, but many parents 
regard the possible side effects to its implementation as unacceptable.
<P>
The White Paper says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Research evidence shows the importance of class size for younger children.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some research may show that, but there is plenty of conflicting evidence. In the London area, the 
boroughs of Bromley and Richmond have some of the highest educational achievements, yet they also 
have some of the largest class sizes in the area.
<P>
There is also a debate about how much a class size needs to be reduced before there is any 
tangible effect. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) suggested that 
a figure of 24 would have to be reached. In the opening summary of the scholarly paper written by 
Blatchford and Mortimore in the Oxford Review of Education, the authors state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“It is concluded that there is now firm evidence of a link”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
between class size and educational attainment—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“but only in the early years and only with classes smaller than 20. The evidence supports the 
reduction of class sizes in the first years at school, especially with disadvantaged pupils, but much still 
needs to be researched.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed it does. The authors highlight the findings of three other eminent researchers who flatly 
contradict their own findings. In 1990, Tomlinson found that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Reducing class size to the point where student achievement would likely benefit . . . is 
prohibitively expensive.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In 1989, Slavin wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The evidence . . . suggests that . . . reducing class size will not itself make a substantial 
difference in student achievement.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In 1992, Burstall wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The outcomes of this research effort (into the connection between class size and educational 
attainments) having been conflicting, inconclusive and disappointingly meagre.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am indebted to the excellent Library research paper 97/136, which was produced for members 
of the Committee. It cites research from the United States, including the STAR research project in 
Tennessee, of which it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“In that study pupils in small classes (13-17)”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in roughly the five to eight-year-old group—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“performed significantly better than pupils in regular classes (22-25).”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are not talking about reducing class sizes to those levels—the clause would not 
achieve that, especially if it is unamended.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): I am at a loss to understand how the hon. 
Gentleman’s argument relates to the amendment. He seems to be arguing against giving parents the 
opportunity of reduced class sizes. The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) seemed to 
admit in the previous sitting that the amendment was impractical. The hon. Gentleman should tell us 
why he thinks that we should accept the amendment and deal with other clauses when they are 
debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It goes to the heart of the amendment that, if there is no clear evidence that class 
sizes should be given overriding priority in determining the policies and targets of local education 
authorities, there should be more parental discretion as to when such targets are achieved.  The 
amendment would grant parents such discretion. We must examine whether there is conclusive 
evidence that smaller class sizes, such as those proposed by the Government, will have a material 
effect on educational achievement.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): The hon. Gentleman has said that parental power 
and discretion is the key issue. Will he explain what the right hon. Member for Charnwood failed to 
explain during the previous sitting: what happens to the discretion, power and reasonable expectations 
of the parents of children who are offered—and, therefore, expect their children to be taught in—
classes of 30, if a school is allowed to admit a 31st, 32nd, 33rd or perhaps 34th child? That could 
happen under the amendment because it would not limit the discretion of schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I fear that that shows the thinking and philosophy of those who still have not 
given up their belief in the command economy. The point of a flexible approach is that people on the 
ground can interpret it flexibly. It is the duty of the LEA to offer a place in a class of 30 or fewer 
children. Some parents might prefer to send their children to a certain school, even though that means 
that their children are in a class of 31. Those who think that having their children attend a class of 30 
is more important than anything else, even than which school their children attend or how far they 
have to travel, could opt to send their children to such a school. That could happen in the same way as 
an airline determines for whom travelling on a specific flight is more important than anything else 
and who could travel on another flight when demand for seats is greater than the number available.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): The hon. Gentleman’s remarks go to the heart of the debate. 
The amendment would impose a statutory duty on LEAs to offer all infant children a place within a 
class of a maximum size. Will he answer the question that he has already been asked: if an authority 
were to admit another child to a class—therefore, raising the maximum size—would it not breach its 
statutory duty to the children already in the class and, therefore, have to offer them places elsewhere? 
Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that children shuttle back and forth to different classes when 
another child is admitted?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): It is not practical.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is entirely practical for the other parents with children in that class to say that 
they do not want their children to be part of a class of 31. As I have said, those children can take up 
places in another school where there is a class of fewer than 30 pupils. In reality, during the year, 
there is an ebb and flow—the rate of which varies from area to area—of children coming and going in 
schools. It is a fact of life that, when that happens, there must be some give and take—no doubt that 
can be organised on the ground. It is clearly possible to find out which parents consider it a priority 
for their children to be in a class of 30 and which parents consider it a priority for their children to go 
to the school of their first choice, or the school which their children’s siblings attend, or the school 
which, in their view, has the best teaching of religious matters.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Does my hon. Friend agree that if Labour 
Members will not accept some flexibility in the interpretation of this matter, they risk creating a huge 
problem? If parents move into an area that is served by only one school, which may only just be 
meeting its target of having only 30 children in each class, they may be denied a place at that school.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend, who has put his finger on the heart of 
the matter. The problem is not our amendment, the problem is what your Government propose to do. 
It is an impractical idea; it will cost parents and children a great deal to impose this limit of 30. It will 
mean that people who arrive in an area in which the local school is already at its maximum quota will 
have to send their child on a bus—or other means of transport—many miles away to receive an 
education that meets your dictatorial criteria.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not have any dictatorial criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman in media 
res, especially when he is reaching such a great peroration, but will he now admit that he has given 
the game away? In response to an intervention of mine on Tuesday, the right hon. Member for 
Charnwood was at pains to stress that this was not a wrecking amendment. The absolutist nature of 
the hon. Gentleman’s argument demonstrates that, whatever the intentions of the right hon. 
Gentleman, at least one Conservative Back Bencher has gone off message.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall remember to address my remarks to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I am not off message at all; the clause will be extremely difficult to implement. The amendment 
is the first of many practical suggestions that we will be proposing, and it highlights one of the 
problems of the scheme’s core. It is up to the Government to propose solutions to a problem that is of 
their making.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> The nub of the argument is not being addressed; will the hon. Gentleman 
address it? He has referred constantly to the amendment being a practical, not a wrecking 
amendment. As a former chair of education, I see it entirely as a wrecking amendment, because it 
could never work. there may be difficulties with what the Government are proposing, but this is a 
wrecking amendment.
<P>
Would there be a ballot of all the parents in a school to which the 31st child wished to go on 
each occasion that parents asked for their child to enter a class? How would the local authority 
administer that ballot? What would happen to those who need to give their consent to losing the 
opportunity that the Government promised them of having their children educated in a class of 30 or 
fewer?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the amendment had been a wrecking amendment, I would not have 
selected it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am very grateful for your wise words, Mr. McWilliam, and I have nothing to 
add to them.
<P>
Our point is that, of course, reducing class sizes substantially would be a noble aim, but what 
would it cost? I calculate that reducing all class sizes in the relevant age group to 15—a level at which 
research clearly indicates that educational attainment would be significantly improved—would cost 
£15 billion over five years. Those resources are simply not available. Instead, we have—
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must not heckle.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The Bill proposes a marginal change in class sizes—a change which has a cost. As the White 
Paper stated, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“There will be a cost to introducing smaller classes”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which, the Government admit,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“we intend to meet through phasing out the Assisted Places Scheme.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not remind the Committee of the many telling arguments that Conservatives Members 
made when the assisted places legislation was being discussed last year other than to say that that cost 
was a heavy one. We were told many times that it was a case of the new Government governing for 
the many and not the few. However, all the evidence suggest that some of the few will be put at an 
advantage by the proposed small reduction in class sizes at the expense of another category of the few. 
You are choosing to benefit one category of the few at the expense of others.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not choosing to benefit any few. Also, neither the clause nor the 
amendment deal with the assisted places scheme and hon. Members should not seek to hang that 
subject on the hook of the amendment; if hon. Members are bright enough to do so, there will be 
another amendment on which they can do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. Clearly, that is a case of merely a few being 
benefited. I seek the guidance of the Minister on the point. The amendment goes only some way 
towards addressing the real concern that the way in which the clause is drafted would allow the 
Minister to cherry pick what areas he would favour with the targets and the accompanying resources. 
The Minister would have the discretion to favour Labour-controlled areas with smaller class sizes, at 
the expense of other, Conservative areas. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain how the 
unamended clause will be introduced in a way that is fair to all areas— so that such discretion 
cannot—not will not—be abused.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, 
Mr. McWilliam. As you said at the beginning of our debate, years ago we served on the Committee 
stage of the Telecommunications Act 1984, when I believe Mr. John Golding spoke for six hours.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Twelve hours.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I do not know how you occupied your time, Mr. McWilliam, but it nearly 
drove the then Government Back Benchers mad. None of us intend to speak for 12 hours on the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman—I slept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Would you give permission for 
hon. Gentlemen to remove their jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Gentleman may remove their jackets if they wish; hon. ladies are, of 
course, always free to do so.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I did not notice you sleeping during the passage of that Act, Mr. McWilliam—
we read novels, but you would not have allowed that if you had been in the chair.
<P>
The amendment raises the practical difficulties of the Government achieving their target. 
Education is a national service that is locally administered—sometimes very well, sometimes not so 
well. So far, Opposition Members have pointed out the sheer practical difficulties that the 
Government will face in achieving their objective. As the hon. Member for Harrogate and 
Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) said in our previous debate, there must be greater—indeed, full—
flexibility. One factor of our national life will make that difficult for the Government to achieve: the 
decision to allow rapid housing development in certain areas, with all the consequences that that has 
for education. The Government must quickly address that problem. The Minister will be aware that a 
decision has recently been taken to allow considerable housing expansion in Newcastle. I am not 
familiar with all the ins and outs of that project, but it will offer a challenge to Newcastle education 
authority.
<P>
Nearer home, in my constituency, the Government have decided to allow building between 
Hitchin and Stevenage, going into the green belt and creating a new town—we could call it 
Hitchenage—with all the consequences for education. One of the post-war problems has been that we 
can build houses just like that, but it is a devil of a job for the education and national health services 
to keep up with such housing development. I understand that there is no statutory requirement on the 
planning authorities and the Department of the Environment properly to consult education authorities 
on whether education can keep up with rapid housing development. We have grappled with that 
problem for years in Bedfordshire because we were required to take London overspill. If we add to 
that the Greenwich judgment and the right of people to cross county boundaries, the Government have 
a problem. I do not know whether the Government are thinking of introducing a sort of article 3B of 
the Treaty of Rome to allow local authorities some subsidiarity in trying to meet the problem. But I 
ask them to consider carefully the consequences of rapid housing development on schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> Is not it a fact that housing development on such a scale usually takes place in the 
context of a local plan determined by the local authority? Before becoming a Member of Parliament, I 
was a councillor, and having taken part in drawing up a local plan, I know that planning authorities 
consult education authorities about arrangements for education for land that is allocated. That 
happens not for small developments, but for the scale of development to which the hon. Gentleman 
referred.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I wish that it were as simple as that, but Hertfordshire county council had no 
idea that the decision would suddenly go through, against its wishes, and that the land between 
Hitchin and Stevenage would be built on. Many county councils have been ordered just like that to 
accept more housing. The hon. Gentleman is right that there is a county structure plan and a great 
deal of careful thinking, particularly about how the education service can cope, but when the 
Department of the Environment—be it Conservative or Labour; I am not making a party political 
point—with a stroke of a pen says that an area has to have more houses, it is extremely difficult for 
local education authorities to keep pace. We know the Government’s targets for class sizes. The recent 
housing decisions, which I appreciate the Minister must support under the guise of collective 
responsibility, will have a considerable consequence for education provision, especially the 
Government’s target for the number of pupils in a class.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I wonder how to relate this to the clause, but the hon. Gentleman will 
recognise that the education committee becomes involved not at the structure plan level or when 
projections of housing numbers are being made, but when the detail of the plans is being discussed. I 
know from 20 years experience that the principal decision about the number of houses to have in the 
county is made before the land is allocated. It is when you allocate the land that you must correctly 
phase the planning permissions with the eduction provision.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is 25 years since I had to make such decisions.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I note that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) said 
“correctly phased”, but for the education service, plans are often incorrectly phased. That is not a 
party political point, but a practical one for the education service. I mention it in good faith because 
Ministers must address it as they set about their target for class sizes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but he is 
making it clear why we and the Government are right to support maximum class sizes of 30. In some 
areas, such as in my constituency, where there has been rapid unplanned housing development, 
enormous pressure has been put on schools to raise class sizes. That is why we support the proposal to 
make it the LEAs’ responsibility to ensure that children are not taught in classes of more than 30. His 
point emphasises the need for the legislation.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> The hon. Gentleman brings me neatly to the end of my speech. He suggests 
that, as a result of the clause, the revenue support grant must be so flexible that it can quickly take 
account of rapid housing development. I am glad that the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives agree. 
I have often thought that all good Liberals should join the Conservative party.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I leave that as a problem for the Government and hope that, in due course, they will respond 
positively. The DFEE should made a bigger noise over planning because there is an education angle 
to building houses. The Department should shout from the roof-top at the Department of the 
Environment when, with a stroke of the pen, it overturns county structure plans, with consequences 
for education.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for 
South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Madel). Given the Government’s recent decisions about new 
housing development in green-belt areas, it is important that greater attention is given to the 
educational impact. If the clause is adopted, it will have a significant impact on local authorities in 
providing schooling for children who come to live in new housing developments. In response to the 
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, education is not a sufficiently material consideration in 
planning proposals to prevent permission being given, but it often should be because the impact of 
housing development on the local authority and local schools is significant and should be given 
greater weight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> Is it not still the case, even in the exceptional circumstances of so-called rapid 
housing development, that the lead-in time, from the decision of the Secretary of State to the houses 
being built and occupied, is lengthy? That gives education authorities time to plan. One reason why 
they may not have planned so quickly in the past is because, further to the point made by the hon. 
Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, they decided to stuff children into bigger classes. Faced 
with the proposals in the Bill, local authorities will have to respond more quickly, but they will have 
sufficient time because there is still a long lead-in time before houses are built, taking into account all 
the necessary consultations on drainage and everything else.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> There are two issues here. First, the lead-in time for putting in place the statutory 
local plans is significant, but the problem is—this is an issue about how the local plans regime 
operates—that it may take some time. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West 
Bedfordshire said, local plans may quickly be overturned as a result of decisions taken by the 
Secretary of State. Of course, circumstances change from the time when local plans are devised, but 
that is an issue about how long local plans are supposed to remain as the background for local 
authority planning decisions.
<P>
Secondly, it is all very well to say that when a housing development is known about well in 
advance, the education authority can make provision, but it can make provision only if it has the 
necessary resources. If we accept the clause, so that there is a limit on infant class sizes in all local 
schools, the cost of ensuring that education is provided for children from housing developments will 
be significant and will be difficult for many LEAs to bear.
<P>
I want to comment on the practicalities of the Government’s proposals and explain why my right 
hon. Fried the Member for Charnwood tabled the amendment. The first impracticality is that the 
clause does not impose a set limit on class sizes. If I were chairing a local education authority today, I 
would be worried that the Secretary of State was being given power by regulations—an issue that we 
raised at this Committee’s first sitting—to impose a limit. It is not stipulated that the limit will not 
change, and the limit that is set in one year may not pertain in subsequent years.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I can assist the hon. Lady; I am being tolerant, but the debate is 
becoming somewhat wider than this narrow amendment. I shall have to consider that when we reach 
the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> As a new Member, I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for pointing me in the 
direction of the issues that I should address. I believe that this particular issue is relevant to the 
practical implications of the unamended clause.
<P>
The amendment would also give a degree of flexibility to local education authorities, which the 
clause in its present form would not allow. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood drew the 
Committee’s attention to the impact on parental choice during Tuesday’s sitting. The Government 
seem to be facing a dilemma over parental choice because of the setting of limits. I am prepared to be 
corrected by the Under-Secretary of State when she addresses these issues, but my perusal of the Bill 
suggests that, where the right to a place at a school with a particular limit on class sizes does not 
exist, and there is potential to impose a limit on the size of all class sizes within a local education 
authority area, the appeals mechanism still seems to allow children to be admitted over and above the 
Government’s set limit. that should answer many of the questions that Labour Members have asked 
about the amendment. The Government accept that there might be occasions where the limit on class 
size will not apply and parental choice will apply instead. Arguments against the amendment on such 
a basis should therefore fall away.
<P>
The amendment caters for the need to offer flexibility. Local education authorities will face 
significant resource requirements in many parts of the country, including parts of my constituency, if 
the limit is enforced in every infant class. Schools in some areas will find it very difficult to 
accommodate a statutory limit in all infant classes without employing more teachers, building extra 
classrooms or putting temporary classrooms on a particular site.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> There is surely an obligation on Opposition Members to address the 
amendment intellectually. The hon. Lady is attacking the idea of having resources that would allow 
classes to be reduced to 30 pupils, although that is what the amendment offers. Is she implying that 
the amendment’s offer is a hollow one, which cannot be delivered? As the amendment appears to 
support the concept of offering limited class sizes to all parents, why is her speech attacking that 
concept?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk suggests that I am attacking the idea of 
having the resources, but I am arguing that if the size of every infant class in a local education 
authority area is to be limited, significant resources will be needed to meet that requirement. I doubt 
that such resources are currently available to local education authorities.
<P>
The amendment states that the statutory limit should not have to be imposed on every class, but 
that all parents should have the right to be offered a place for their child in a class of a particular size. 
One of the shadow unitary authorities in my constituency—which is at present under Berkshire county 
council, but is about to come under unitary authorities—made the point, both to me and to the 
Department for Education and Employment, that parents would, in many cases, prefer children to be 
in a class of more than 30 with a qualified teacher and an assistant than in a class of 30 with one 
teacher. Our amendment would enable parents to make that choice by providing flexibility.
<P>
I want to make one further point. My other fear about the impact of the Government’s proposals, 
which the amendment would help to allay, is that many schools will respond by increasing vertical 
grouping. In many cases, vertical grouping works to the satisfaction of parents and schools; in other, 
there is considerable concern. I have been on a governing body at a school where vertical grouping 
caused real concern among parents.
<P>
Our amendment would provide the flexibility of offering a place, while not requiring every class 
to have a limited size. If the Government do not take that practical response, there will be concern 
about resources available to local education authorities and about how classes will be handled. 
Vertical grouping will increase, and that will, in some areas, increase parents’ worries about their 
children’s education.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. 
Brady), I want to point out that hon. Members are being lax about use of the word “you”. I do not 
mind, but if hon. Members get into bad habits, they may say “you” in the Chamber and end up on 
television in embarrassing circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I shall expunge that three-letter word from my 
vocabulary in all possible circumstances.
<P>
I am delighted to follow my hon. Friends who have made compelling arguments for greater 
flexibility. The core of the matter is whether the Committee believes in parental choice in education. 
The heart of our contention is that we—as parents, individuals and Members of Parliament—welcome 
smaller class sizes where practical and sensible, but that to commit all schools in all circumstances to 
meeting that criterion is a major limit on parental choice. It will result in many parents having to 
shunt their children around the areas where they live and to send them to schools not of their 
choosing, but chosen, effectively, by their local education authority. Smaller class sizes are good, but 
not at all costs or in all circumstances, at all places and in all times.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk interestingly intervened to agree that there are 
practical problems with the Bill. The Committee will look forward to the amendment that he will no 
doubt table, in due course, to address those difficulties. If he can deal with the problems better than we 
can, we will support him, but I suspect that the Bill will remain as it is if the hon. Gentleman has 
anything to do with it. I look forward to hearing him try to address the problem, although I am 
pleased that he has been realistic enough to recognise its validity.
<P>
Several of my colleagues represent areas more rural than mine. They have related the problems 
of small village schools that have only one classroom and teacher available for each year group. Such 
schools may be many miles from others. Their problems must be addressed. From my own 
perspective, however, there are slightly different practical difficulties in the suburbs and the cities, 
where parents will try to find good-quality schools for their children within a realistic distance from 
their homes. I have the enviable task of defending very good infant, primary and secondary schools in 
Altrincham and Sale. However, that poses its own problems, given that my constituency neighbours 
areas where schools are less good. For example, schools in my constituency are very close to the 
boundary of the Manchester LEA, which is one of the worst LEAs in the country. Trafford, in contrast 
is one of the best LEAs. There is a constant demand for places in schools in my constituency from 
residents who live over the boundary in Manchester.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the amendment is rejected, considerable problems may arise for my constituents, who may be 
deprived of their first choice of school. My constituency is a relatively small, compact area that 
contains very good schools, but it is close to areas with poorer schools. If the amendment is rejected, 
we should limit choice and opportunities for parents in areas with poorer schools. I welcome the fact 
that schools in my constituency provide excellent opportunities, which are denied to residents who 
live on the other side of the LEA boundary. I fear that those opportunities may be lost if the popular, 
over-subscribed schools in my constituency are denied flexibility in the numbers that they admit to 
entry-level classes.
<P>
Empty places, which we discussed earlier, are frequently in the poorer schools and the poorer 
LEA areas. Although it is inefficient to have many empty places in schools, there are many such 
places in schools that are close to my constituency. I can guarantee that they are not in schools to 
which my constituents would wish to send their children—and, in my view, they are not in schools to 
which local residents should have to send their children.
<P>
The danger is that the Bill will reverse the positive flow between educational institutions. In 
some cases, people who are unfortunate enough to reside in a poor LEA with poor schools can 
currently travel across the LEA boundary and avail themselves of good schools for their children. 
Sadly, however, not everyone has such opportunities. Unless the clause is amended, that positive flow 
may become a negative flow because all of the places in the popular, good schools will be filled, which 
is a dire prospect. If schools have no flexibility over their admissions numbers, parents in a LEA with 
good schools may be forced to send their children to less good schools that are outside that area.
<P>
Families that cannot get access to their local school may face considerable practical problems. 
As a Member who represents a compact constituency, I can only sympathise with those hon. Members 
who represents a larger, more dispersed areas. In Altrincham and Sale, distances can be great and 
travelling time may be excessive, especially at rush hour when people have to get their children to 
school.  Several people have complained to me at my advice bureaux because they have not got their 
children into their first choice of school, which is most regrettable. All hon. Members should pause 
and reflect on the massive flood of aggrieved cases that we shall face in our surgeries if the Bill is 
enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> The hon. Gentleman spoke of the massive flood of aggrieved cases. Has 
he given no thought to the massive flood of aggrieved cases that will arise in our surgeries if the 
amendment is accepted? Parents would ask to take their children—who were originally in classes with 
30 or fewer pupils—out of even larger classes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> That is a can of worms that the Government have unwisely opened by proposing 
such an inflexible approach to local education. We can all agree that, whenever possible, there should 
be more resources and small class sizes, but that goal is being frustrated by the Bill’s inflexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I refer my hon. Friend to the survey referred to in the DFEE’s press release on 4 
December. Although 35 per cent. of those surveyed regarded lower class sizes as a priority, 68 per 
cent. cited either a greater emphasis on basics or greater parental involvement—which is what the 
amendment would ensure—as more important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. The survey does not even mention access to 
denominational education, which is of enormous importance to my constituents. As my hon. Friend 
the Member for Tiverton and Honiton said, that is a real problem with the Bill. What happens, for 
example, when a Roman Catholic school does not have the flexibility to accept one or two extra 
pupils? Will those pupils be denied access to the denominational education of their choice? Are the 
Government pledging resources to build a new classroom and employ new teachers for every school 
where there is an extra pupil?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I assist the hon. Gentleman? If he looks at the amendment paper, he 
will find that he is arguing in favour of amendment No. 62—he should not be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful for your assistance, Mr. McWilliam, as I am sure all members of the 
Committee are. Labour Members have, perhaps, led me away from the core point.
<P>
The problem arising from the inflexible limit on class sizes in infant schools will continue in an 
area such as my constituency, which has good schools but is surrounded by areas with less good 
schools. Even if there were sufficient resources to counter the initial problem of coping with more 
than 30 pupils—or whatever figure the Government impose by order—the problem will persist. There 
will still be applications to the good schools—this is the inverse of the point made by Labour 
Members in their interventions—which will put further pressure on them. Unless some flexibility is 
allowed, the logic of the Bill is that there will either have to be a massive and endless expansion of 
schools or access to the schools and parental choice will be cut.
<P>
It is possible, at great expense, to solve those problems in rural areas, but I do not believe that it 
is possible to solve them in more populous areas, such as my constituency. The Government would be 
wise to reflect on the points made by Conservative Members and to consider whether there is some 
way in which they can address the problem through the Bill.
<P>
Far be it from me to offer too much help and support to the new Government, but they are 
creating a serious problem for themselves. What was a popular manifesto pledge during the election 
could become a millstone around their neck. They may not be able to deliver what the Bill promises 
and they may come to rue the day that they disagreed with our splendid amendment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire mentioned the massive new housing 
estates that seem to be in prospect in many parts of the country, including areas around my 
constituency. Regardless of the lead time, the Government must accept either that planning 
permission for those estates be refused until an educational plan can guarantee that the class size limit 
will be met, or that new schools must be built first.
<P>
The hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) suggested that local authorities are entirely in 
control of that building process, but in many parts of the country it is being taken out of the hands of 
local authorities. You can therefore see that the education authority, which has responsibility under 
the Bill to put forward plans to implement the proposals, will not necessarily be the body responsible 
for making decisions about building. That is a major concern.
<P>
In conclusion, I return to the core point. Please do not think only about rural areas and village 
schools, reflect also on the Bill’s impact on areas such as mine. We have good schools, which are in 
demand—they draw applicants not only from the immediate vicinity, but from less privileged areas 
with schools that are not as good. Schools in areas such as mine therefore provide a resource for many 
who would otherwise have no real choice. Hon. Members should reflect on the damage that the clause 
will do to those people’s hopes and aspirations.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton) rose—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Lady, I must tell the hon. Member for Altrincham 
and Sale, West that, through his careless use of the word “you”, he inadvertently suggested that I was 
limiting choice and access to schools. He should not feel too bad about it—in similar circumstances, I 
have been accused of everything from Rachmanism to fathering unwanted children.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I shall attempt not to fall foul of the procedures and rules of the Committee. In 
passing, Mr. McWilliam, may I share a thought with you? I received a grammar school education and 
I recall spending a lot of time in English classes learning how to precis. That exercise is very good in 
helping to eliminate the word “you” from one’s writing. Given your advice, Mr. McWilliam, perhaps 
a little tuition might not go amiss for all of us, once the Committee is over.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Maths, too.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Yes, indeed. Tutorials will be given by appointment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should not heckle anyone, especially not their Front 
Bench spokesmen.
<P>
Mrs. Browning: For the benefit of Labour Members, I shall simplify the reasons why my right 
hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood moved the amendment. When the Government went to the 
electorate on 1 May, their pledge to limit class sizes to 30 for five to seven-year-olds was a key plank. 
Indeed, I understand that Labour Members carry that pledge in their top pockets or in their handbags, 
along with the other pledges that they have to deliver before the next election.
<P>
It became apparent immediately after the general election, beginning with the abolition of 
assisted places—needed to fund the pledge on class sizes—that the Labour party had done no 
preparation on delivering that pledge prior to being elected. Indeed, when I challenged the Minister 
for School Standards on the specifics of the rural primary school and the 31st child, he said that he 
thought that it was a good question and that he was looking into the matter. Clearly, the preparation 
necessary to delivery that promise was not done before the election.
<P>
The Government now have the great difficulty of having to legislate to fulfil that promise. The 
very timing of the Bill is indicative of the difficulty. During the election, Labour’s slogan was, 
“Education, education, education”. We were still waiting for the Bill when the summer recess arrived. 
the Bill was then flagged up for the autumn, but it was not given a Second Reading until the day 
before the House rose for Christmas. That is indicative of the difficulties that the draftsmen at the 
Department of Education and Employment had in trying to accommodate Labour’s manifesto pledges 
in legislation in a fair and practical manner.
<H4><center>[Ms Rachel Squire in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood spoke of the need for flexibility in clause 1. 
That is acknowledged by the fact that the Secretary of State feels that he must have the power to 
change the rules on class numbers and timings. The Bill does not contain a clear, fair or equitable 
formula to deliver the Government’s pledge to the satisfaction of the electorate. If one were to ask the 
average parents whose children are at school at present—not those carefully sought focus groups who 
presumably persuaded the Labour party to include the magic figure of 30 in the manifesto—what they 
expected to receive as a result of the pledge to limit class sizes to 30 five to seven-year-olds, no doubt 
we would be told that they anticipated resources being put into the local primary school that their 
children attend or expect to attend. 
<P>
They would not expect—as the Government will find—that their children would be denied a 
place in their local primary school, whether urban or rural. That is especially true in rural areas, 
where the Government will have the greatest difficulty in delivering their pledge. Parents expect the 
resources—the extra classroom, staffing and revenue costs—to be provided to honour the 
Government’s pledge.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill lacks detail. The Secretary of State will keep the powers under review in his own 
domain—no doubt so that he can rejig them annually so that the pledge can be delivered before the 
Government go the electorate. Had the Government fulfiled people’s expectations by putting resources 
behind the pledge, the amendment would be unnecessary. If LEAs are to be required by legislation to 
limit class size, it is only reasonable that they should be given the resources to fulfil parents’ 
expectations. The flexibility provided by the amendment is required because the resources are not 
available for schools to provide extra classrooms and teachers.
<P>
The Minister, who has just left the Room, made it clear early on in this Parliament that he 
anticipates that the take-up of spare places—will enable the Government to deliver classes of 30 or 
fewer. All the horrors that have been outlined by hon. Members on this side of the class—[Laughter] 
A Freudian slip, Ms. Squire. I am only sorry that the Minister is not sitting in his place in the front 
row, as all naughty boys should.
<P>
We are genuinely concerned about the effect on very young children—how far they will have to 
travel to take up spare places, given the lack of resources in their local schools—and about parents’ 
disappointment and the limitation of parental choice. Parental choice was key to the previous 
Government’s education policy. We have no reason to believe that the Labour Government do not 
recognise parental choice; indeed, the White Paper has much to say about parental choice and we 
shall later discuss a clause which specifically concerns it. We have tabled the amendment in the 
interests of parents and young children.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> The hon. Lady’s case appears to be based on the notion that smaller classes are 
desirable, but should not be mandatory. We have also heard that class size is now accepted as an 
important factor in raising educational standards. Does not the history of modern education show that 
if class size is left as being vaguely desirable, smaller classes are not achieved? They were not 
achieved during the past 18 years under Conservative Governments, no matter how desirable they 
may have been said to have been.
<P>
This debate has demonstrated that the amendment is unworkable. The only way to make class 
size count is to state, as the Bill does, that there will not be class sizes of more than 30. The class size 
factor in raising standards can then come into operation and make a difference.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I do not wish to rehearse the substantial argument about the optimum class size 
for children in that age group. In my opening remarks in the previous debate, I made it clear that I do 
not question the principle of smaller class sizes, but my argument is that there is evidence, as outlined 
by Opposition Members, that factors other than size are relevant to raising standards.
<P>
The point I wish to make to the hon. Gentleman is the one I started with—if Labour’s election 
promise for smaller class sizes were to be properly honoured in the country, parents of children of that 
age group, or coming up to that age group, would expect the pledge will be honoured in their local 
schools. Clearly, that cannot happen because the resources will not be there to provide the extra 
classroom or the extra teacher.
<P>
I shall quote from a letter received this week from the National Association of Head Teachers, 
which has been made available to the Minister. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We are receiving reports to the effect that some LEAs are refusing to consider altering 
Standard Numbers or Admission Limits. yet many existing Standard Numbers (eg 68 pupils implies 
two classes of 34) will place schools in breach of the Class Size Limits. The alternative would be 
vertically grouped classes, which is unacceptable educationally”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May). All those problems 
are starting to come out of the woodwork and if the clause is accepted, its inflexibility will inevitably 
lead to further obstacles to the honouring of the Government’s pledge. I have no reason to let the 
Government off the hook for what I think was an ill-thought-out pledge, but I am concerned about 
those parents, children and teachers who will have to try and manage the policy in practical terms and 
who will find it extremely difficult. If the Government incur the wrath of parents, that is their fault. 
They should have done their homework on the pledge before the election.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> I understand the hon. Lady wanting to pursue a line that attacks the Government for 
being inflexible; however, it is only minutes since we were being attacked for giving the Minister too 
much flexibility in phasing in and tackling those problems. The hon. Lady cannot have it both ways. 
Is she saying that there is too much flexibility, or is she saying that there is not enough?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am saying that there is not enough flexibility in the Bill. Rather than 
incorporating that flexibility into the Bill, and instead of giving it to the people who will make the 
day-to-day decisions in their own LEAs and schools, the Secretary of State—characteristically of the 
tenor of the Bill—seeks the powers for himself in order to manipulate that flexibility. He wants the 
power; he does not want it to be devolved down to local parents and local schools in the interests of 
the individual child. We will return to that in future clauses because it is characteristic of what the 
Secretary of State seeks to do in taking powers to the centre and removing them from those at the 
sharp end who best know their own locality and their own children.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> It is clear, from the contributions of the hon. Lady and her colleagues, 
what the Opposition think is wrong with the clause. Perhaps the hon. Lady could focus on the merits 
or otherwise of the amendment that we are debating. Will she address the point about the impact on 
those parents already allocated a place with a promise that the class size would be restricted to 30? 
More specifically, give that at least one Opposition Member has made at least one concession about 
the general merits of keeping class sizes as small as possible, will she reflect on what she thinks the 
impact of the amendment will be on the reduction of class sizes, given that we have already heard the 
history of the way in which class sizes have risen under the total discretion that schools have hitherto 
been given in that regard? Does not she agree that were the amendment to be accepted, it would have 
no impact on class sizes?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> No, I do not accept that. During the previous sitting, I referred, as did other 
Conservative Members, to the need for flexibility in aspects of five to seven-year-old classes, other 
than those related to a particular size. I cited information supplied by the Library that showed that 
large key stage 1 classes in some local education authorities produce better results than smaller classes 
in other LEAs. Therefore, other factors come into play if we want to raise standards for that age 
group.
<P>
Of course, Conservative Members do not dispute the principle of raising standards. However, we 
are debating the clause in such detail because the Government cannot deliver parental expectations of 
30 pupils to a class. They cannot do so because they are not prepared to provide resources needed to 
produce the extra teachers and classrooms that will be required to fulfil the expectation that they have 
engendered in parents. Therefore, we must debate the manipulation of that pledge. The Government 
think that they can deliver, but they are giving the Secretary of State powers to rejig the Bill if all does 
not go according to plan.
<P>
Although we are dealing with clause 1, huge problems have already been envisaged not only by 
Conservative Members but by organisations, such as the National Association of Head Teachers, and 
governing bodies which have serious concerns about the ability to deliver the policy. Therefore, the 
flexibility that the amendment would provide is necessary.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire has raised the important questions of 
planning permission and the impact on small primary schools of sudden increases over a short 
period—especially when compared to LEA planning time scales for capital expenditure—in new 
building in an area, often contrary to what was expected in the local plan. Such problems are being 
experienced throughout the country.
<P>
During the previous sitting, I said that, while the Committee is considering the Bill, other 
Departments and bodies are taking day-to-day decisions that will have an impact on the decisions that 
we take. Extraneous circumstances can have an impact on the Bill, and we must take account of that 
in our debates to ensure that we do not ignore those other factors.
<P>
In dealing with my point of order, you said, Mr. McWilliam, that when the Committee sits was 
not a matter for the Chairman, so I hope that, when the Under-Secretary responds to the debate, she 
will say whether the Committee will sit this afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> 
As this is my first opportunity to address the Committee, may I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. 
McWilliam? I look forward to your chairmanship over the next few weeks—although I hope that the 
Committee does not sit for as long as two of the Committees on which you served, the 
telecommunications Bills.
<P>
This has been a wide-ranging debate. Indeed, as some of my hon. Friends have said, we have 
discussed issues that go far beyond amendment No. 60. You have rightly said, Mr. McWilliam, that 
many of those matters will be dealt with in forthcoming debates, so I shall not address them now. I 
shall respond later to debates on amendments dealing with the distance from home and church 
schools, and I do not want to repeat myself.
<P>
The debate started well; it was heartening to those of us who have spent many hours in 
Committee—I refer both to my hon. Friends and to my honourable associates in the Liberal Democrat 
party.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Is “associates” a parliamentary term in this 
context?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As long as it is not abusive, it is parliamentary.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It depends on the mood I am in, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
We have spent many an hour in Committee trying to get former Conservative Ministers to accept 
that class size is an issue. They have never done so. Furthermore, they have denied that it is an issue 
in raising standards. Clearly, we need look only at their actions. In 18 years of Tory Government, 
none of their policies helped to reduce class sizes, resulting in their being greater when that 
Government left office than they had been previously.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) made a learned speech at the start of our 
sitting, in which he quoted research undertaken in this country and others. I smiled because I 
remember with great clarity that, when we were in opposition, I tabled a question to the right hon. 
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) about his evidence on class size. I remember being 
given a one-sentence answer that there was no such evidence. If only the right hon. Gentleman had 
been able to talk to his hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, who was about to join him on the 
Opposition Benches, he, too, could have referred to the false research that has just been mentioned.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I believe that I have discussed the issue with my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Bromley and Chislehurst. However, it is fair to say—as I did—that the research gives conflicting 
signals. Possibly, some of the research to which I referred has not been in circulation very long.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Good gracious me. What a lot of research has been published since 1 May. I was 
surprised that in his litany of research on class size, the hon. Gentleman did not quote the recent 
statement of his right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, who said in our previous sitting on 
Tuesday that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“class size has a strong influence on educational attainment for children aged five to seven.”—
[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 20 January 1998; c. 31.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the one hand, Opposition Members want to agree that class size is important, but on the 
other, they table an amendment that would deny any action to reduce class size. My hon. Friends have 
pointed that out time and again in their interventions, but the Opposition have not dealt with that 
response.
<P>
We agree with Opposition Members that class size is not the only issue in raising standards. A 
small class with a bad teacher, who has bad lesson plans, poor leadership, poor training, and no focus 
or targets, is no good. Many of the proposals in this Bill and in the education Bill that is currently in 
another place address many other issues, such as teaching standards, early years and targets. All the 
announcements made by the Government since 1 May have been about a collection of policies and an 
overall strategy on standards. Class size does matter, but there are other steps that must be taken to 
raise standards. It is important; it is so important that we should legislate on it, but I would never say 
that class size removes the need to take action on all the other issues to which I have referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for confirming that class size is only one of the 
issues that matters. At the heart of our debate has been the conflict between two objectives; lower class 
sizes and greater parental choice. Does the hon. Lady believe that it is right for the Government, 
rather than parents, to set priorities for children’s education?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I shall come on to parental choice—or parental preference, which is a more honest 
description of what both the previous Government and this Government have tried to offer parents. 
Parental preference is extremely important. Parents need the right to express a preference for the 
school to which they wish their children to go. I say that cautiously. Let us never pretend that parents 
always have their first choice. That has not been the case. It is very difficult; it is beyond policies that 
any Government could devise to guarantee to every single parent that their first choice will be 
honoured. If you look at the number of appeals over recent years, you will see that it has increased. 
The Audit Commission report published 12 to 18 months ago talked about a gridlock in the system in 
which parents were not getting the choice that they wanted.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I caution the hon. Lady that the admonition about the use of the 
word “you” applies to Ministers as well as to new Members.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Even to new Ministers, Mr. McWilliam. I shall try not to do it again.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will not interpret that as a wish by the Government not to grant 
parental preference. It is a timely reminder, given comments from Opposition Members, that no one 
has has ever proposed a system in which every parent is guaranteed first choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way again on this point. I agree that 
parental preference has never been absolute, and probably never can be. Does she accept that the 
clause as it stands will make that worse and make it less likely that parents will get their first choice 
of school?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I reiterate some of the points that have been eloquently made by my hon. Friends. 
Much has been said about the 31st child, but, as one of my hon. Friends said, the amendment would 
include the 38th, the 39th, the 40th and the 41st child as well. Opposition Members need to take that 
into account.
<P>
The intention of the amendment is to allow a parent to exercise an option, or express a 
preference, that they would prefer their child to be in a particular class of 40, 50 or 60 rather than 
elsewhere in a class of 28. The wishes of those parents need to be balanced against those of parents 
whose children were admitted to that school believing that their children would be in a class of fewer 
than 30. The notion that we can expect parents to take children to another school, so that they can be 
in a class of 30, is nonsense, as the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said. He talked about 
increasing mobility among schools; I see that as a growing problem in our effort to raise standards at 
the primary stage. We do not want to do anything that forces parents to take their child away mid-
term or after the first or second week, when there is an influx of children. The amendment would 
allow them to do that.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> There seems to be an element of uncertainty about clause 1, which affects the 
amendment. It could be interpreted as saying that the Government will set fixed limits on class sizes, 
applied mechanically, school by school; or it could be interpreted as meaning that the Government 
intend to set targets for an area, or for a group of schools. Either is a possible interpretation.
<P>
If a rigid target were set and applied school by school, I fail to see how that would recognise, as 
the Minister claims to, the need for parental choice to be taken into account. If, however, a target for 
an area were laid down, it would allow at least some flexibility, so that at the margin a local balance 
could be struck between the desirability of a smaller class size and other factors such as parental 
choice.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am not quite sure how a target for an area would work. Our pledge is clear, 
evidently Opposition Members do not carry pledge cards. It is that every child of five, six or seven 
will be in a class of no more than 30. That is what we intend to deliver by the end of this 
Administration. That has been said, not only in Committee, but by my right hon. Friends the 
Secretary of State and the Prime Minister; it is part of our contract with the people who elected us on 
1 May. I cannot see how there could be any misinterpretation. Our pledge is for class sizes of 30 for 
five, six and seven-year-olds.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I accept the sincerity with which the Minister reiterates the Government’s 
pledges made to the people at the general election. However, the people who were influenced by that 
pledge have an expectation. That expectation is not just of some mechanical setting and rigid 
application of 30, but that in their local primary school, in their village, their child will be in a class 
of 30. If an intake in one year group means that a class has 38, 40 or whatever the number of pupils, 
parents will expect resources to be found to reduce class sizes. That is the nub of it. In order to fulfil 
their pledge, the Government are not going to be able to provide resources to meet the expectations of 
the people who made this a popular policy. That is why so much in the Bill requires the Secretary of 
State to intervene in a statutory way to manipulate matters to fulfil a Government pledge. That is not 
what people expected when the Government put the pledge to them at the election.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I would merely reiterate that at the time of the election the people’s expectation was 
of the pledge that was made to them. That is the pledge that will be delivered. I do not want to stand 
here and take lectures from Opposition Members about resources in education, given their record on 
that subject and our speedy action within the first months of government to put back into education 
some of the resources that they removed in the latter years of their Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am going to make some progress.
<P>
Two issues are involved, one of which is the need to address the amendment as the Opposition 
intended. I have a duty to do that because it is on the Order Paper and people will consider it at the 
end of the debate.
<P>
If the amendment were passed, the pledge that we intend to honour class sizes for five, six and 
seven-year-olds would not be met; Opposition Members must accept that. They cannot like the 
principle, share the intention and want it to happen, but not be party to the legislation that will make 
it possible. If they share our aim, they must put forward proposals on how we can achieve it. That is 
what the clauses do. They are the way in which we will honour our pledge on class size because class 
size matters.
<P>
Many Opposition Members quoted 30-odd per cent. The responses were not from a focus group 
but from a White Paper consultation. Thousands of meetings took place up and down the country 
involving not only people who wrote to the Department, but people in my hon. Friend’s constituencies 
and elsewhere. It came through clearly that class size is one of the issues of greatest concern to 
parents. Of course it is not the only concern; of course parents want the other things that I mentioned 
earlier. But they also want class sizes to be reduced.
<P>
I am sure that this aspect of the Bill will be welcomed by parents. Indeed, in my advice bureaux 
before the election parents complained that their children were in class sizes that were too large. That 
was especially important for those in early infant stages because no one had time to listen to children 
reading and they did not receive the close work that is essential at that age.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It has been quite clear from the representations of the teaching profession and 
governing bodies that once a class size drops below 30, schools lose the financial resources which, as 
my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said, help to fund classroom assistants for key lessons 
such as English when they listen to children read. For many schools—as the National Association of 
Head Teachers reiterated in its letter that was sent to one of my hon. Friends—there is likely to be no 
funding in classes of 30 for a classroom assistant to help with key lessons. When the Minister claims 
that the situation will be better per se, she has not taken account of the loss of a classroom assistant 
who, by carrying out functions such as listening to children read, is important for that age group.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I take this opportunity to say how valuable classroom assistants are and how much 
we appreciate their increasingly important role. The hon. Lady would, however, have difficulty in 
proving that no class with fewer than 30 pupils ever had a classroom assistant. I do not believe that 
that is so. Some classes with fewer than 30 do have classroom assistants.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The point, simply is not that no class of under 30 ever has a classroom assistant, but 
that parents with the choice of a class of 32 or 33 with a teacher and classroom assistant or a class 
with 30 with a teacher and no classroom assistant might feel that the individual time given to their 
child would be greater in the former case. Those parents would prefer a higher number than 30—if 
that is to be the limit—rather than having the limit of 30 imposed with the loss of the assistant.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Clearly, how a school decides to spend its allocated money is a decision for the 
school. Some will choose to employ classroom assistants, others to employ their resources in other 
ways. In all the consultation that I have carried out on the White Paper and the pledge, no parent has 
ever said, “I’d prefer my child to be in a class of more than 30 and have a classroom assistant.” The 
pledge of a qualified teacher in a class of 30 or fewer is favoured by parents who know that the raft of 
policies that we have proposed will contribute to raising standards.
<P>
Let me talk about what the amendment means. Many speeches have not addressed its meaning. I 
first thought that it meant that LEAs should offer places in classes of a maximum size to children 
from within their areas. I thought that the Opposition sought to prevent local authorities from 
depending on others to deliver the class size pledge. That is how the amendment is written.
<P>
For the record, we would not favour local authorities seeking to meet the class size pledge by 
palming off responsibility to neighbouring authorities. From what hon. Members have said, I know 
that that was not the Opposition’s intention, but perhaps they will understand why I sought assurances 
from the right hon. Member for Charnwood that that was not their intent. There will always be some 
children who choose to cross boundaries. In my constituency, as in that of the hon. Member for 
Altrincham and Sale, West, some families live nearer schools in a neighbouring local authority than 
they do to schools in Birmingham. However, we would not expect local authorities to meet the pledge 
in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My point was the opposite. Children may suffer from being sent out of the local 
authority area where they attend school into another where there is no problem in accommodating 
them, but the schools are no good. The quality of their education will therefore be lower.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I cannot see a situation in which a child would be made to leave a local authority 
area to secure a place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My point is that if my borough were required by inflexible statute to guarantee class 
sizes of 30, it might no longer be able to accept the children it currently takes from a neighbouring 
local authority area which has poor schools. Those children would have to go to poor schools where 
they could be easily accommodated although their parents did not want to send them there.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I think I take the hon. Gentleman’s point. Local authorities have a legal obligation to 
plan sufficient places. They have always taken account of the pattern of transfer across boundaries as 
well the number of children in the area. Those are matters for local decision and action. We see no 
difference in their taking into account cross-boundary movements.
<P>
It is important to consider the words of the amendment rather than its intention. The debate has 
been welcome and it is important that the first amendment debated on an important clause has opened 
a wide discussion. That may help us to consider subsequent amendments more quickly—says I 
looking at the Government Whip sitting next to me. I have tried to address issues that will not arise in 
relation to later amendments.
<P>
The class size pledge will be delivered as part of our contract with the people. It was welcomed 
by parents at the general election and has since been welcomed by parents during the consultation on 
the White Paper. Along with the raft of other proposals that we have put forward, it will enable the 
Government to raise standards. There is general agreement that the amendment would not have the 
intended effect, and I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw it. If she does not, I ask members of the 
Committee to vote against it.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I asked the Minister to deal with my 
question about the Committee sitting this afternoon. Before we proceed to the next amendment, could 
the Minister be given an opportunity to reply to my question?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. Unless anyone else wants to make a point of 
order, we shall consider the next amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out ‘infant’ and insert 
‘primary’.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘ “primary class’’ means a class containing pupils the majority of whom will attain the age of

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I hope that it will be possible to explain to members of the Committee why they 
should support the amendments. I hope also to anticipate and overcome some of the Government’s 
possible objections. As a result of our deliberations on the previous amendment, it is absolutely clear 
that all members of the Committee agree, in one formulation of language or another, that class size 
really does matter. We have gone further and said that other things matter too, but we all agree that 
class size matters.
<P>
In reaching that agreement, there have been some remarkable U-turns. The Conservative party 
used to believe in the importance of class size because class sizes were enshrined in the Education Act 
944, introduced by a Conservative Secretary of State. That Act led to circular 10, draft buildings 
regulations, issued on 14 November 1944, which set maxima of 30 for secondary schools and 40 for 
primary schools and expressed the hope that those maxima would later be reduced. More recently, the 
Conservative party maintained that class size mattered because it stated in its 1983 election manifesto 
that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the average number of children per teacher is the lowest ever.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
clearly they thought then that class size was important.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In 1983, the leader of the Liberal Democrats believed in scrapping nuclear 
weapons. Are we going to dig that far back in history?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the hon. Lady does not want me to go that far back, we can examine a more recent 
quote that we heard at our previous sitting. On 13 December 1994, the then Under-Secretary of State 
for Education,  the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“there is no proven causal connection between class size and educational output.”—[Official 
Report, 13 December 1994; Vol. 251, c. 767.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The U-turn was completed when the hon. Lady acknowledged at our previous sitting, as did the 
right hon. Member for Charnwood, that they believe that class size matters.
<P>
It is important to say for the record that U-turns have not been confined to the Conservative 
party. I am sure that the hon. Lady would want me to point out that the Education Act 1944 was 
supported by both the Liberal party and the Labour party. It is interesting to remember what happened 
subsequently, because Labour’s 1969 schools regulations revoked the class size reduction limits. 
Fortunately, we have now also seen a U-turn by the Labour party.
<P>
Again for the record, and with my tongue slightly in cheek, I should point out that the Liberal 
party and its successors have been consistent. Not only did we support the Education Act 1944, my 
historical research showed that in 1947, when I was born, the Liberal party assembly passed a 
resolution including the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The most immediate need is to reduce the size of classes in primary schools.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have continued to argue that case. We all now agree that class size matters and I shall spend 
a few minutes explaining why we came to that conclusion, which is relevant to the amendment.
<P>
In agreeing that class size is important, we must acknowledge that the figures are worrying. 
Throughout the 1990s, class sizes have risen. The percentage of primary school pupils in classes of 
more than 30 was 20.1 per cent. in 1992 and rose to 21.5 per cent. in 1993. The percentage then rose 
to 23.1 per cent., 24.4 per cent., 26.3 per cent. and, finally, 28 per cent. in 1997. There has been a 
significant rise in the percentage of primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 and many of us 
would argue that that is a dreadful legacy from the previous Government.
<P>
Why are we so concerned about class size? Reference has been made to many arguments and 
much research, but it is important for the Committee to acknowledge that there is a clear relationship 
between class size and the quality of education. Research shows that smaller classes lead to increased 
learning in the early years, have the most favourable effect on student attitude and have a positive 
effect on the academic achievement of disadvantaged students. We know that pupils in smaller classes 
misbehave less, participate more, spend more time on tasks and interrupt less frequently. Research—
not least that done by the National Association of Head Teachers—also tells us that teachers’ work 
load increases as the class size increases, and that bigger classes are associated with more stress. That 
is especially important with regard to the number of teachers who are currently leaving the profession 
early. Over the last 12 months, 20,000 highly qualified professional teachers have left the classroom. 
Many of them said that the stress of the job made them decide to leave.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I find it hard to understand how that is 
relevant to the leaving out of the word ‘infant’, and the insertion of the word “primary”, which the 
amendment proposes.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If I had thought that the hon. Gentleman was out of order, I would have ruled 
him out of order. He strayed briefly, but then mentioned the amendment, which is paramount.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am very grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam. if the hon. Member for Guildford waits 
for perhaps 30 seconds, I shall show precisely why my introductory remarks have been so relevant to 
the amendment, for which I seek not only the Government’s support but his own. If he has listened to 
the arguments as to why class size is so important, he will be able to recognise instantly the 
connection between the two.
<P>
The research also shows that increasing class size leads to loss of motivation, loss of efficiency, 
loss of enthusiasm for teaching and to a reduction in the amount of time available for the 
identification of, and support for, children with special educational needs. If all of those research 
findings are correct, which I believe all members of the Committee should now accept, we presumably 
believe that those arguments apply to all pupils, in all classes, at all ages.
<P>
There may be support for that point of view already. The Minister, whom I am delighted to see 
in the Committee, certainly used to subscribe to that point of view. He is on record as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We are aware that standards are under attack throughout the system. In our primary schools, 
more than 1 million children—one in four—are in classes of more than 30.”—[Official Report, 29 
March 1995; Vol. 257, c 1105.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Minister was referring to all primary pupils, and saying that the standard of their 
education was under attack. He was not merely referring to key stage 1; he was also referring to key 
stage 2.
<P>
At that time, of course, the Minister was in Opposition. As the hon. Member for Tiverton and 
Honiton has accused me of using historical references, it is perhaps more important to examine what 
the Minister has said on these issues since coming to office. He has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Government believe that classes of more than 30 pupils become not so much a valuable 
learning experience as a question of crowd control.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As he was answering a question from a Conservative Member, he went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“There is a rich irony in the question posed by Conservative Members. Today we published new 
figures showing that, in primary schools, one in three young people is in a class of more than 30 
pupils.”—[Official Report, 26 June 1997; Vol. 296, c. 966]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members should note that in 1995 his answer was one in four. The Minister was clearly 
demonstrating that he was concerned about all primary school pupils in classes of over 30, which he 
described as classes that were less a valuable learning experience than an exercise in crowd control.
<P>
Some might say that we should not only take note of the Minister’s comments in government; 
we should also take note of what his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said. It appears that 
the Secretary of State is also genuinely concerned about all primary school pupils, not just those in key 
stage 1, as he has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Over the past 10 years, there has been a substantial worsening of the PTR”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the pupil-teacher ratio—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> “in both our primary and secondary schools”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say, and these words are important:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> “Again, that is another legacy which we have to address.”—[Official Report, 2 June 1997; Vol. 
295, c. 26.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that the Secretary of State believes that something must be done about rising class 
sizes, not only at key stage 1 and key stage 2, but even in secondary schools.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman’s comments earlier in that debate are even more telling, and hon. 
Members who are considering whether to support the amendment would do well to heed them:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We, the profession, teachers and the majority of parents have agreed that class size matters. 
We must therefore ask: to which children does it matter? Does it matter to only a few or to all our 
children in all our schools?”—[Official Report, 2 June; Vol. 295, c. 22.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Committee will agree that the Minister and the Secretary of State have made it 
abundantly clear, in opposition and in government, that they believe that class size matters and that 
over-large classes damage children’s education not only in key stage 1 but in key stage 2—and, some 
would argue, in secondary schools, too.

<P>

<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I cannot resist asking whether the hon. Gentleman would argue that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I would certainly argue that; the purpose of the amendment is to enable the 
Government to introduce regulations that would apply to class sizes at both key stage 2 and key stage 
1. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it would be a strange irony to reduce class sizes for 
primary pupils at key stage 1—vital though that is; it has our full support—only for those pupils to 
have to move into a larger class at key stage 2. As we know from all the research, if you reduce the 
class sizes at key stage 1, you get rid of that long tail of underachievement that the Government are so 
keen to remove.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I did reduce class sizes at key stage 1, but that was 25 years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I think that the record will show that I was referring to the hon. Member for South-
West Bedfordshire, but I apologise if I strayed. I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would accept 
that reducing class sizes at key stage 1 helps to remove the long tail of underachievement.
<P>
Research also shows that if pupils move into larger classes at key stage 2, the long tail of 
underachievement reappears and the benefits of smaller class sizes at key stage 1 are lost.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman gave the Committee the references for 
the evidence that he is citing, as it would be interesting to read it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not have all the details now, but if the hon. Lady waits until the sitting has 
finished, I will be more than happy to drop a note to her or any other member of the Committee.
<P>
Liberal Democrats and, I hope, the Conservative party fully support the Government’s desire to 
reduce class sizes for pupils at key stage 1; I hope that there is no question about that. Our concern is 
that the Government should provide support for the 476,934 pupils who in January 1997 were in key 
stage 1 classes of more than 30. However, we are equally conscious that there are far more primary 
school pupils at key stage 2—780,099—in classes of more than 30, significantly more than in the 
previous year. Our amendment seeks to put on record the commitment of the Government and of the 
Bill’s supporters that they intend, if not immediately then at some point, to take action to reduce class 
sizes at key stage 2 as well as at key stage 1.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that governing is about choosing 
priorities? He has had to do some stretched linguistic analysis of Ministers’ statements when he could 
have read our manifesto and our five-point pledge card, which made clear our priorities, now 
embodied in the Bill. Would the hon. Gentleman put his party’s position on the record? Does he 
accept that the Government are choosing the right priority and that the first issue to address is the 
youngest age groups? If he does, it is understandable—in the utopian vision which the Liberal 
Democrats seem to inhabit—that there may be some merit in at least having the discussion and then 
voting against the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; had he waited another second, he would have 
heard me saying more or less what he said. I said that I would try to predict some of the objections 
and then seek to overcome them. One such objection would be that the Government would say that 
this is a matter of priority, and that they are right. If they are going to tell the Committee that 
reducing key stage 1 class sizes should take priority over reducing those of key stage 2, we would 
entirely agree with the support that; the research evidence demonstrates that that should be the case. 
However, that does not alter the fact that both the Minister and his right hon. Friend—with both of 
whom I agree—and many others accept that class sizes in key stage 2 are also important and deserve 
our attention.
<P>
We are well aware that the clause enables the Secretary of State to issue regulations in relation to 
the reduction of class sizes. We do not yet know what those regulations will say. We understand from 
the Government’s manifesto commitments that the regulations will impose a class size limit of 30 on 
key stage 1 classes. However, so far we have not had confirmation of that and no regulations have 
been produced. It must therefore be possible to contemplate an instrument being passed that illustrates 
our concern with class sizes throughout the primary sector but which incorporates the figure of 30 for 
key stage 1 and perhaps a much higher figure for key stage 2.
<P>
After all, I am sure that the Minister is concerned about the more than 110,000 pupils who are in 
classes of 35 or more and about the thousands who are in classes of more than 40. So it would be 
perfectly possible within the regulations, which we have not yet seen, to refer not only to the 
Government’s commitment to a maximum of 30 pupils at key stage 1, but to the desire for smaller 
sizes generally in the longer term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I am aware that the Liberal Democrats share the aspirations of Labour Members—
indeed, I hope of all Members—for modernisation of the House and therefore for pre-legislative 
scrutiny. However, I had not realised that they were now expressing an enthusiasm for pre-emptive 
clauses, because that is what the amendment would create. The hon. Gentleman is developing an 
argument about the scope of the Secretary of State’s regulations. Surely to include an aspiration in the 
Bill—which is what is contained in the clause—is not the same as to accept the practical amendment. 
The points that the hon. Gentleman is developing merely serve to underline that.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As the hon. Gentleman, who is a welcome new hon. Member, will be well aware, 
there are no regulations before us. When those regulations are forthcoming, we can consider whether 
they are practicable.
<P>
It is quite usual for regulations to contain an aspirational element. I draw the hon. Gentleman’s 
attention to the first maximum class size regulations, which came into force in 1945, arising from the 
Education Act 1944. As well as specifying the maximums, they made the aspirational comment that it 
was intended to reduce the limits in due course, so aspirations can be included in regulations. For 
example, the Government could set a maximum class size for key stage 1 of 30 and a maximum of 36 
for key stage 2. That would not place a significant additional burden on the Government, but it would 
indicate their commitment. In that way, they could go just a little further than they said that they 
would at the election.
<P>
Some may say, “Why should we go that little bit further than we said that we would at the 
election?” When Labour Members decide how to vote, I ask them to bear in mind the recent words of 
the Secretary of State, who said on 21 May in an interview with Mr. Donald Macintyre:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“I was one of those who said during the election that if we can achieve more than we’ve 
promised, we’ll restore faith in politics and democracy.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I urge the Committee to consider doing just that.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I just want to make a short intervention. I listened carefully to what the hon. 
Member for Bath said. Amendment No. 6 refers to a—
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Redefinition.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> Yes, it lists ages up to 11. I take it from the amendments that the hon. 
Gentleman is aiming for class sizes of 30 or below up to the age of 11. I assume that the hon. 
Gentleman imagines that the overwhelming majority of primary schools take pupils from the ages of 
five to 11. They do, but some local education authorities run middle schools—they take pupils from 
the ages of eight to 12 in Buckinghamshire and from nine to 13 in Bedfordshire. That involves 
considerable implications for the curriculum and for the costs of running such schools, the subjects 
that must be taught and the number of teachers that you must employ.
<P>
The amendment has a budgetary consequence for middle schools, which I would be grateful if 
the hon. Gentleman would address. Middle schools, such as those in Bedfordshire, want to make 
absolutely sure that pupils are well prepared when they move to upper schools at 13, because they are 
merely two years away from GCSEs. There is a budgetary consequence to that—in fact, there is a 
budgetary consequence to everything that the hon. Gentleman said. He referred to the fact that he is 
an associate. During the election campaign, the Liberal Democrats made it crystal clear that a penny 
must be placed on income tax to be spent on education—
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> If necessary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are to be avoided. While I am on my feet, I must 
tell experienced Members—although the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has been a 
personal friend for almost 20 years, I almost forgot his name—that they should not lead new Members 
into bad habits by the inadvertent use of the word “you”.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. It is obvious from what the hon. member for Bath 
said that more money must be spent. The Liberal Democrats made it crystal clear that they want to put 
a penny on income tax, to be hypothecated to the education service. However, they left unsaid what 
would happen if a local education authority wanted to spend the money on discretionary grants or 
special education needs rather than putting it into the schools budget.
<P>
Because the hon. Gentleman used the word “associate”, I am prompted to him whether the 
Liberal Democrats still believe that it is essential that the Chancellor puts a penny on income tax on 
17 March to allow the Government to deliver on those pledges? If not, and because it was a central 
plank of the Liberal Democrat election policy, I assume that there will be no more associatism. During 
the election, many people stood on the doorstep talking about that penny. It certainly stuck in people’s 
minds—although not in my constituency, because not many people there voted Liberal. Indeed, the 
opposite was the problem, but I shall say no more about that.
<P>
The Liberals sometimes come up with a racy election slogan that sticks in people’s minds. In 
1974, Jeremy Thorpe said that the way out of the problem was site values, works councils and more 
conciliation. Six and a half million people voted Liberal because they thought that it would help avoid 
the miners’ strike. The problem today is rather more specific. The amendment has budgetary 
consequences, especially for middle schools that take pupils aged 13.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I am almost finished.
<P>
Above all, we want to know whether the penny on income tax stands and whether the Liberal 
Democrats will insist that it should be introduced in the Budget on 17 March. I shall now give way to 
the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who has so courteously given way to 
Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Does the Conservative party support additional spending on education, or are you 
going to keep entirely within the spending limits that you gave the Labour party, which you would 
have inherited if you were now in office?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not say anything about spending limits.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I can set the hon. Gentleman’s mind at rest. I have a consistent record in 
Bedfordshire of suggesting that the revenue support grant is tilted to allow more money to go into 
Bedfordshire schools, not least because of the problems caused by rapid housing developments, to 
which I referred to earlier. All the education reforms in Bedfordshire are good I am particularly 
pleased that 90 per cent. of children in Bedfordshire are in nursery schools or four-plus units, which is 
Conservative party policy in Bedfordshire. What we have done in Bedfordshire has meant more 
spending, so the hon. Gentleman has no cause to worry. I shall continue to argue for spending to be 
more correctly directed to the Bedfordshire education authority.
<P>
I was tempted to raise the matter because of the use of the word “associate”. The amendments 
will cost money, especially for children between the ages of 11 and 13. The members of the 
Committee are exchanging views and trying to obtain information. As the late John Junor of the 
Sunday Express said, we are entitled to know.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I am pleased to be here this morning, 
Mr. McWilliam, having just sent my 100 lines to the Secretary of State saying that I must learn my 
seven times table. While going to the Department in my ministerial car this morning, I was reading 
The Sun, which gave me some advice about the seven times table. In my edition, the newspaper said 
that 0 x 7 = 70. I hope that tomorrow’s front page will have a picture of the editor with that printed 
over his head.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The December press release from the Department for Education and 
Employment contains three figures: 38 per cent., 35 per cent., and 30 per cent.; but that adds up to 
103 per cent. We know who cannot do multiplication, but who in the Department cannot add up?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman’s remarks will be about primary schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> They will be, Mr. McWilliam. I think that there was such overwhelming support for 
our White Paper that people expressed more than one preference, which is why the figure is more 
than 100 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It was not my intention to raise the issue with the Minister this morning, which 
no doubt will surprise him, but as he has raised it himself, I must caution him. I suspect that his slip 
of the tongue yesterday was to demonstrate that he had been badly let down by a grammar school 
education. I hope that it was not some Machiavellian plot, before we come to the clause on grammar 
schools, to show that they do not deliver what many of us believe. As a former grammar school girl, I 
shall not mention the matter again if the Minister does not, because I suspect his motives.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment refers to primary schools. Even I did not go to a primary 
grammar school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There are occasions when we former grammar school pupils should stand together, 
and I appreciate the hon. Lady’s comments.
<P>
We need to make it clear that our policy commitment to reduce class sizes to 30 or fewer for five, 
six and seven-year-olds, will not be implemented in a way that will adversely affect children in the 
junior years of primary education. Later, when we discuss amendment No. 5 to clause 2, which has 
been tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, we shall be giving assurances that we shall monitor and 
take steps to guarantee that children in junior years are not affected detrimentally by our policy.
<P>
It would be false to give the impression, as the hon. Member for Bath did this morning when 
speaking to his amendments, that the Government are unconcerned about class sizes for eight, nine, 
10 and 11-year-olds. We are concerned about how those class sizes have been allowed to increase over 
the years. We have inherited a terrible legacy from the previous Government and it is our intention to 
take steps to reduce class sizes. We believe that we can do that, in a way that will complement our 
pledge that we put before the electorate on 1 May, by providing extra resources for the education 
service.
<P>
Following my right hon. Friend the Chancellor’s statement on 2 July last year, for the first time 
in many years new money will be going into the school system from April this year. There will be 
£835 million extra for schools. We must recognise that there will be difficulties if that money is eaten 
up by, for example, a teachers’ pay increase that is way above the rate of inflation, which will mean 
less money to employ more teachers and to buy new books and equipment. We can reduce class sizes 
by employing more teachers. In the primary sector, teachers are being recruited through the teacher 
training establishments, so there is no question of there being a lack of supply of teachers. We hope 
that the additional £835 million that will be fed through to the school system will be used to employ 
more teachers and to reduce class sizes across the board. Such additional resources could lead to a 
substantial reduction in class sizes.
<P>
Over and above that, there is the clear manifesto commitment on which we fought the election. 
It is a card pledge—one of the five key pledges that the Government put to the electorate. It is one of 
the main reasons an overwhelming number of the electorate supported Labour party candidates in the 
general election. Clause 1 has the clear objective of giving the Secretary of State the power to ensure 
that no class for five, six and seven-year-olds has more than 30 places.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some people have said that the number 30 does not appear in the Bill, but I assure the 
Committee that it will be the Secretary of State’s intention, through regulations, to restrict class sizes 
to 30. I put that on record because it is an election pledge that we intend to honour. There is no 
question of the measure adversely affecting children in the junior years of primary education. We 
want to concentrate on getting the early years right. That is our priority. The regulations made under 
clause 1 will enable the Secretary of State to do precisely that.
<P>
Obviously, as the class size pledge rolls on year by year, it will benefit eight, nine and 10-year-
olds. That will be a clear consequence. We are concentrating first on the infant years because all the 
research referred to this morning—to which the right hon. Member for Charnwood referred on 
Tuesday when he moved the amendment—shows that smaller classes in the early years are 
particularly important in raising standards in primary schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The Minister said something important. As the Labour party made clear at the 
election, and as the Minister has repeated, the maximum class size regulations will, over the lifetime 
of a Parliament, roll forward into key stage 2. That is exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for 
Bath and I are trying to achieve through the amendments. We fully accept the Government’s priority, 
which has been clearly stated, but will the Minister now put on record the intention to roll forward the 
maximum class size of 30 into key stage 2 once it has been achieved in key stage 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> In replying to the amendment, I am pointing out the practical consequences of our 
pledge on class sizes. We do not intend to deliver it for key stage 2 children by way of regulation. 
Those who know how schools operate will be conscious of the practical consequences of introducing a 
class size limit of 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds. Coupled with that—I shall go into more detail 
about it on amendment No. 5 to clause 2—is our monitoring of the consequences for junior-aged 
children, to ensure that they are not adversely affected by the implementation of our class size pledge.
<P>
I believe that we will see benefits flowing through to eight, nine and 10-year-olds, but we do not 
intend, by regulation, to introduce provisions for key stage 2 pupils similar to those that we intend to 
introduce for key stage 1. We believe that that is the best way forward.
<P>
There are concerns, expressed most articulately by the Opposition, about inflexibility, about 
ensuring that we have a system that can respond. If we try to make regulations covering key stage 1 
and key stage 2 at the same time, there will be practical difficulties. By phasing in the pledge over 
several years, and we pledged delivery by the end of this Parliament, we will overcome the difficulties 
of inflexibility referred to by Opposition Members.
<P>
In the next few weeks we will announce how we will allocate the first tranche of money—£22 
million from September—released by the phasing out of the assisted places scheme. Several 
authorities will benefit. We can use that experience to identify how to deliver the pledge in detail. 
That will enable us to address the point made by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton about the 
31st child, particularly in a rural environment. I am open minded on that; there are practical 
considerations about how we deal with it. Proceeding as we intend will allow us to consider them as 
we work with schools, the church authorities and the local education authorities to make sure that we 
implement the pledge in a way sensitive to the needs and views of parents and small communities. 
Perhaps it will be more expensive to deliver the pledge if we are to meet those considerations, but we 
can do it within the financial envelope of revenue spending released by phasing out the assisted places 
scheme. The right hon. Member for Charnwood has tabled amendments that address funding 
arrangements.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath are not necessary. I understand the 
motives behind them but believe that our guarantee that the pledge will be delivered for five, six and 
seven-year-olds as outlined in the Bill, together with the additional, resources being made available, 
will ensure that other children—particularly in the primary sector—will also benefit. I ask the hon. 
Gentleman to withdraw his amendments. If he is unable to do so, I ask the Committee to reject them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire desperately desired to know the 
Liberal Democrat position on a penny on income tax. It is very clear. At the general election,  we 
believed that the Conservative Government were underfunding education. We made a clear 
commitment to increase spending on education by £2 billion in a full year. To do so, we would have 
needed to put a penny on income tax. The new Labour Government have taken on the Conservative 
Budget and have continued to underfund education, so our position is exactly the same. We are 
waiting to see what the Chancellor of the Exchequer will say in his Budget in March. If new riches 
are found, our position may change. The hon. Member for South-West-Bedfordshire will have to wait, 
just as I will, to see what the Liberal Democrat Treasury team will have to say in March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> On the Liberal Democrat Treasury team’s use of figures, can the hon. Gentleman 
confirm that when their spokesman was asked what eight times seven was, he said 72?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I can neither confirm nor deny that. It sounds as if our spokesman was listening 
more attentively to the answer given by the Secretary of State than to the question.
<P>
The Minister’s remarks on our amendments have been revealing and helpful. They reveal that 
the Government are concerned to reduce class sizes in key stage 1 and key stage 2. That desire is 
welcome and will be welcome beyond this Room. However, the Minister said that the means of doing 
that would be to pass regulations for maximum class size on key stage 1, in respect of which there was 
a big debate on Labour’s manifesto. However, for key stage 2, he hopes that additional money will 
somehow mysteriously make it all happen. That is a huge difference of approach. Many of us know 
why the Government are not prepared to do anything about class size maximums for key stage 2; they 
have realised that class size maximums, even for key stage 1, are much more complicated than they 
had thought. There is a need for flexibility and consideration of different ideas. The Minister’s 
remarks reflect those difficulties. Nevertheless, he made a clear commitment on behalf of the 
Government to reduce class sizes for key stage 2. We shall want to press the Government to give us 
more detail about how they plan to do that but, in the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
