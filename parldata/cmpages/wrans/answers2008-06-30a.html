 The terms of the debate on energy have changed in recent years.

It is also recognised that urgent action is required in both areas. Our public consultation on nuclear power found much support for our view that the evidence argues that nuclear power should be part of the solution to these challenges, although I recognise that not everybody shares this view.</p>

 Different orders and EC directives mean that the UK Government cannot define the period during which a foreign registered vehicle is exempt from the requirement to be registered and licensed with DVLA.

We do recognise that people do not necessarily want lap-dancing establishments in their neighbourhoods and we want to ensure local authorities have the powers to reflect the views of local people when considering applications. We will therefore consider whether or not lap-dancing clubs should fall under the category of sex encounter establishments under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and legislate if this is necessary.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not make its own estimates of the number of children working in the mining industry. For this we rely on the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which estimates the number of children working in the mining sector to be over 1 million worldwide. DFID supports the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to help countries implement core labour standards that include the elimination of child labour. We are also working with the ILO and civil society organisations to promote efforts to remove children from all hazardous labour.

As one of the four central themes of its work, Communities and Small-scale Mining (CASM) includes a focus on children working in dangerous and hazardous conditions in small-scale mining.

 Approximately 17 per cent. of the 44 weeks of instruction an officer cadet receives at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is devoted to counter-insurgency tactics and operations.

 Most National Challenge schools serve areas where pupils are more likely than average to come from deprived backgrounds&#151;for example as shown by eligibility for free school meals. Nonetheless, since there are many schools in similarly adverse socio-economic conditions where more than 30 per cent. of students gain five or more higher level GCSEs including English and mathematics, local deprivation should not be seen as an excuse for low achievement, but important content in assessing the level of support needed to improve academic standards.</p>

 I have had many discussions, and received a range of representations on, the early learning goals in the Early Years Foundation Stage. The early learning goals are developmental milestones for children at the end of the EYFS, most of whom are aged five and over. The very strong consensus is that the majority of the goals are pitched appropriately, but some representations have questioned two specific goals on aspects of early literacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80630w0020.htm_para0"><a name="0807013000051">The fact is that around a third of children already achieve those two goals, and evidence shows that children who develop well in the Foundation Stage go on to do well in primary school.

These include Family Intervention Projects, the Parenting Early Intervention Programme, Respect Parenting Practitioners and funding for at least one new Parenting Expert in every local authority to provide evidence-based parenting programmes for parents of children who are considered to be at risk or those parents with problems that are known to put their children at risk.</p>

The Academy is providing training and support to increase the number of practitioners who can deliver evidence-based parenting programmes, particularly to vulnerable parents. They are also working closely with other third sector organisations to improve the availability and quality of parenting support across England.</p>

This includes structured parenting programmes, support groups, counselling and helplines. Parenting services for some of the country's most vulnerable, including teenage parents, disabled parents and families facing break up are to get a share of up to &#163;8 million in 2008-09 through the Parenting Fund.</p>

 The annual school sport survey collects data relating to participation in PE and sport by five to 16-year-olds in England. This enables us to measure progress towards our PSA target to have at least 85 per cent. of pupils doing at least two hours high quality PE and sport each week by September 2008. Currently, 86 per cent. of young people are doing the two hours.

A Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment was not carried out because the project principally comprised a strip out of existing floors and creation of newly-configured office space and did not involve stripping the building back to its core, nor overhauling the main building plant.

 Requests made by patients under the provisions of section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 must be considered on a case by case basis. The Act makes it clear that a section 10 request should only be overridden where the purpose served by processing the data is sufficiently important to warrant doing so even where it is accepted that substantial harm or distress is being caused. We do not expect there to be many, if any, circumstances where this would arise in the case of an individual who is competent to make decisions. However, there may be circumstances, for example, where there are serious child protection concerns, where a doctor might feel that a parents request to opt a child out of having a summary care record is not in the best interest of a child.</p>

1. Nursing and midwifery figures exclude students on training courses leading to a first qualification as a nurse or midwife. Includes GP practice nurses.<br>
2. In 2006, ambulance staff were collected under new, more detailed, occupation codes. As a result, qualified totals and support to ambulance staff totals are not directly comparable with previous years.<br>

 Information about average waiting times for different types of cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, is not collected centrally. Cancer waiting times standards were introduced for all cancer patients from December 2005. They are a maximum wait of 31 days from diagnosis to first cancer treatment and a maximum wait of 62 days from urgent referral for suspected cancer to first cancer treatment. In the last quarter (January to March 2008), performance against these standards in England was 99.5 per cent. and 96.8 per cent. respectively.</p>

 Negotiations on a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism have been taking place since 2000 with the active support and involvement of the UK. We have made the case throughout for a clear text consistent with the 13 existing sectoral counter-terrorism conventions as well as with international humanitarian law. A comprehensive convention could contribute to a more unified global response to terrorism and we will work closely with our European allies and other international partners to try to reach agreement in the next round of negotiations this autumn.</p>

 Foreign journalists, along with all other foreigners, are normally only able to travel to Tibet after acquiring a time-limited entry permit from the Chinese authorities. The Chinese authorities are not currently granting such permits. We continue to urge the Chinese authorities to allow free media access to Tibet, not just the restricted access we saw on 21 June. My noble Friend the Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, Lord Malloch-Brown, raised the issue of media access with Chinese Vice Minister Wang Yi when he visited China on 14 April.</p>
