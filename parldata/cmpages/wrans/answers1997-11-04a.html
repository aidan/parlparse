<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on progress at the Oslo Conference on preventing the exploitation of child labour in third world and developing countries. [13359]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Conference was organised by the Norwegian Government with the joint support of the ILO and UNICEF. Building on an earlier conference in Amsterdam, as well as three subsequent regional conferences in Asia, Africa and Latin America, its purpose was to achieve agreement on an Agenda for Action, to be taken forward by governments--41 were represented, the majority from developing countries; representatives of multilateral organisations, trades unions, employers associations and NGOs were also represented at the conference.
<P>

<a name="71104w01.html_para0">The Conference was a success. It produced a sensible and balanced agenda for action; it provided the opportunity for the different constituents to understand each other's viewpoints and agree more collaborative ways of working together. While some further work will be required to achieve agreement next year on the new ILO Convention on Intolerable Child Labour, the Oslo Conference will have strengthened in-country and international partnerships for tackling the problem on the ground.
<P>

<a name="71104w01.html_para1">The Conference was largely devoted to working sessions on the themes of legislation, education and social mobilisation. Views on priorities and sequencing between these themes depended largely on each participant's constituency and country of origin. Cutting across each working group was a discussion of how to take measures to end child labour while protecting the livelihoods of working children and their families.
<P>

<a name="71104w01.html_para2">In my statement to the Conference I said that the industrialised world should re-read its own history concerning our own past exploitation of children and then approach this subject with due humility. But our own history reminds us how destructive child labour can be. It stunts childhood and damages health, and the deprivation of education it entails sentences the child concerned to a lifetime of poverty. At the same time, child labour undermines the wages of adults and entrenches families in poverty. If the poor countries are to develop, they must ensure that the children are in school and their parents at work.
<P>

<a name="71104w01.html_para3">I mentioned the great public concern in the UK about child labour. UK consumers are increasingly supporting ethical movements and are not prepared to buy goods produced by exploiting children. But we have learnt that boycotts or over-night exclusion of children from 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 1997 : Column: 92</I><P>
industries can drive the children into worse exploitation. So we must devise strategies that benefit the children and their families. Football stitching is not the most intolerable type of work for children in Pakistan, but it is one which drew international attention. We have to start work where we can. I therefore announced our intention to fund Save the Children to implement a social protection programme in Sialkot so that when, at the end of next year, children stop working in the football stitching industry, they are not forced into more hazardous and exploitative work. We intend that the model developed in Sialkot will then be adapted and applied in another province, focusing on removing and protecting children from more intolerable forms of work which are less susceptible to pressure form international consumers.

<a name="71104w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will publish the action plan, due by 1 October 1997, for resolving the computer millennium problem in her Department, its agencies and other public bodies for which she is responsible; if such was fully completed on time; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Because of the extent of public interest in the issue, DFID's costed action plans, along with that of other government departments, will be reported first to Parliament after analysis by the Central Information Technology Unit (Cabinet Office) and Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency to which DFID's plans were notified in October 1997. They will be available thereafter.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 An audit of DFID's systems was completed in June 1997 and identified a small number of departmental systems that were not millennium compliant in addition to those corporate systems that had already been identified.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As Secretary of State I have overall responsibility. The responsible official within the Department is Mr. A. Davis, Head of the Information Systems Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on what funding provision has been made to accommodate the expenditure needed to resolve the computer millennium problem; and if she expects to have sufficient funding to pay for the work necessary to achieve complete millennium compliance by 1 January 2000.

<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 For 1997-98 we have made provision for &#163;145,000 consisting of &#163;100,000 for purchasing assistance and &#163;45,000 of departmental staff's time working on year 2000 issues. For 1998-99 provision of &#163;65,000 has been made to cover departmental staff time testing changes. The budgets are adequate unless there are unforseen difficulties.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what is her latest estimate of the total cost of resolving the computer millennium problem in <i>(a)</i> her Department, <i>(b)</i> its agencies and <i>(c)</i> other public bodies for which she is responsible; if she will state in each case (i) expenditure incurred to date, (ii) expenditure planned for 1997-98, (iii) expenditure planned for 1998-99 and (iv) expenditure planned for 1999-2000; and if she will make a statement. [13628]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The figures of expenditure to date are not available for the corporate systems already made millennium compliant. This is because they were being transferred to a new system for resource accounting and no separate costs for staff input were kept. An estimated &#163;10,000 of staff time establishing inventory, planning and reporting on other systems has been incurred to date.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the effect of the lack of rule of law in southern Ethiopia on the delivery of United Kingdom supported aid programmes to that country. [13750]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There has been no disruption to UK supported aid programmes in southern Ethiopia arising from legal or security problems in that region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Jennifer Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the World Trade Organisation's ruling on Caribbean banana imports to the EU and its impact on overseas aid to the Caribbean. [14048]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The EU bananas regime represents a serious attempt to meet our obligations to our trading partners and developing countries. We are obviously disappointed that parts of it have been found incompatible with the WTO, but accept that the Community must now set about revising the EU arrangements to bring them into conformity with the WTO's rules.
<P>

<a name="71104w01.html_para4">The Government is considering the WTO findings on the EU banana regime in liaison with the Commission in Brussels, which have the principal responsibility for proposing a new WTO compatible regime. We intend to play a major role as leading advocates of the legitimate interests of those developing countries in the Caribbean which have traditionally supplied the UK market. They can rest assured that we have their interest high on our agenda.
<P>

<a name="71104w01.html_para5">The Windward Islands, already have large allocations of aid from the European Union under the Stabex facility. These are being deployed to strengthen the competitiveness of the banana industry, assist economic diversification and develop social safety nets. The case

for additional finance from the European Union will be examined as the implications of the WTO findings become clearer.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w01.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As stated in the letter of 20 October to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, we have already provided &#163;50,000 for the purchase of food, medicines and water containers. We are now considering the 28 October appeal from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and are expecting proposals from CAFOD and World Vision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Alan Keen: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will make a statement on the 12 guiding principles for using market testing and contracting out. [14544]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Following consultation with the Council of Civil Service Unions and the CBI, I have published "12 Guiding Principles in Using Market Testing and Contracting Out" for central Government Departments, including their agencies. I am grateful for the assistance of the Council of Civil Service Unions and the CBI. Wherever possible I have incorporated their suggestions.
<P>

<a name="71104w02.html_para0">The "12 Guiding Principles" have been very well received. They will also apply to private finance initiative projects that involve staff transfers.
<P>

<a name="71104w02.html_para1">The Government's "12 Guiding Principles" are as follows.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Our aim is to develop modernised, high quality, efficient, responsive, customer-focused central Government services. Our approach to this is pragmatic not dogmatic.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. We will work in partnership with the private sector, extending the circle of those involved in public service.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. We will use market testing and contracting out when in individual cases these can be shown to offer better value for money, that is: better quality services at optimal cost. Our approach to this is pragmatic not dogmatic.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Existing plans for market tests and contracting out, therefore, should proceed, unless the Minister is satisfied that in the circumstances of an individual case, better value for money can be achieved by other means, which will enable a Department to live within its running costs ceilings. This judgment should be based on a robust and objective comparison of the particular market test or contracting out exercise and the alternative means available.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Ministers remain accountable for services contracted out to the private sector. (That is the Carltona principle is replicated).
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. The energy, skill and commitment of staff are our best assets in modernising public services. They should be properly trained to carry out market testing, contracting out, benchmarking, restructuring and other means for achieving better value for money that is: better quality services at optimal cost.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>4 Nov 1997 : Column: 95</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. The concerns of those affected by change should be fully taken into account and properly addressed.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>8. Where the relevant circumstances apply when work transfers, staff will be protected by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) and the consultation and information requirements of those regulations should be followed scrupulously. To avoid a successful claim for constructive unfair dismissal when staff transfer from Crown employment in circumstances to which TUPE applies, Departments should ensure that the new employers offer broadly comparable occupational pension provision or suitable compensation.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>9. Full, effective and continuous communication is a key to successful improvement and change. It should begin as soon as a review which might lead to change is mooted and it should continue afterwards to share what has been achieved. It should happen even when there may be little to report. That way, staff, and their recognised trade union representatives, can be engaged throughout and rumours can be avoided.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>10. There should also be full and open information and communication with Departments' customers and stakeholders.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>11. Relations with the private sector need to rest on two-way openness and trust. Until the Government's new arrangements on freedom of information are in place, Departments should apply a liberal interpretation to the existing "Code of Practice on Access to Government Information" and its "Guidance on Interpretation." Unsuccessful bidders need to know why they were unsuccessful and how they could succeed next time. For the public, it is important to know how much central Government services cost, no matter who provides them. Commercial confidentiality must not be used as a cloak to deny the public's right to know.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>12. Senior management in Departments must give leadership in all these areas and should encourage innovation and continuous improvement.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71104w02.html_para2">The guidance on market testing and contracting out, by central Government departments, is being up-dated to reflect these 12 guiding principles. The Council of Civil Service Unions and the CBI are being involved in this work.

<a name="71104w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 In December 1996 and January 1997, the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency issued a year 2000 questionnaire to a sample of 133 central government departments, executive agencies and other public sector organisations. The majority of large departments and agencies responded to this questionnaire. Departments and agencies which did not respond are listed in the table. Most of these have responded to a follow-up survey carried out in the summer. All departments and agencies are required to complete a full and detailed costed action plan as soon as possible after 1 October 1997.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what proposals he has to extend the provisions of the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992 to Northern Ireland. [11995]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no such proposals. The differences between the land laws of Northern Ireland and of England and Wales make such an extension impossible.

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1997]:</i> The Royal Mint and Bank of England have been closely involved in preparatory work with other member states and national central banks on the design and specifications of euro coins and banknotes. On the basis of the provisional specifications for euro coins and the specifications for banknotes agreed in the European Monetary Institute they will be easily distinguishable from sterling coins and banknotes.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 1997]:</i> At 29 October, there were 24 invoices outstanding with a value of &#163;9,002. This represents 2.4 per cent. of invoices paid in a typical month. The value represents less than 1 per cent. of the typical average value of invoices paid per month.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will state the amount allocated in each budget of the European Community for information relating to implementation of EMU; on what occasions such expenditure was authorised by the Economic and Finance Council; and what <i>(a)</i> observations and <i>(b)</i> votes were made by Ministers on each occasion. [12965]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1997]:</i> Funding for information relating to the implementation of EMU has been made available since 1996 under the European Commission's information programme for European citizens (Prince). The relevant budget line is B3306.
<P>

<a name="71104w03.html_para1">The EC Budget does not break down the overall level of Prince by individual programme. I would suggest that the hon. Member approaches the European Commission directly for this information.
<P>

<a name="71104w03.html_para2">The Budget Council have so far considered the budget allocation for Prince on four occasions--during their second reading of the 1996 budget on 17 November 1995, their first and second readings of the 1997 budget on 25 July 1996 and 19 November 1996, and their first reading of the 1998 budget on 24 July 1997.
<P>

<a name="71104w03.html_para3">On each occasion the Budget Council, supported by the UK, have reduced the budget allocation for Prince. However, since this spending is not obligatory under the treaty it has been the European Parliament that has in each case set the final level in the budget.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to what extent Government investment in <i>(a)</i> additional building for maintained schools, <i>(b)</i> the national health service, <i>(c)</i> London Underground and <i>(d)</i> new roads counts within the totals of Government revenue, expenditure and borrowing used for the European monetary union convergence criteria.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1997]:</i> All current and capital expenditure by central and local government contributes to the general government financial deficit (GGFD), the Maastricht measure of the budget deficit. This includes all government grants to maintained schools and London Underground, and all Government spending on the national health service and new roads.
<P>

<a name="71104w03.html_para4">Government lending and government transactions in shares are not included in the GGFD. For example, government lending to London Underground, NHS trust hospitals and students does not increase GGFD. However, the government has to finance such lending through higher taxes or increased borrowing. Increased borrowing would add to general government gross debt--the Maastricht measure of Government debt.
<P>

<a name="71104w03.html_para5">Similarly, receipts from repayments of government lending, and from privatisation proceeds, do not reduce the GGFD but would reduce gross debt.

 I have asked officials in Customs and Excise to monitor the effect of the introduction of the higher rate of insurance premium tax and this will include the impact of the differential tax treatment on travel agents. It is too early yet to draw any firm conclusions from this process and I anticipate that the monitoring will continue for some time. The issue of the application of the higher rate to travel insurance sold by travel agents will also be the subject of a judicial review hearing on 4 November. The conclusions of that hearing will clearly need to be taken into account when considering whether changes are necessary to this measure.

<P>
<a name="71104w04.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the Government intends to pursue the four challenges made by the United Kingdom in the European Court of Justice to spending without a legal base by the European Commission. [14576]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs Liddell: </B> 
 The Government has decided to continue with the four cases currently before the European Court of Justice. These cover expenditure on social exclusion projects, for both the 1995 and 1996 budget years; and, for the 1996 budget year, measures in favour of older people and the "pilot action" for a European Voluntary Service.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para1">I should like to make it clear that in choosing to retain these challenges the Government is seeking to uphold an important matter of budgetary principle. We believe that it is essential for the proper and effective control of public expenditure that the European Commission should be bound by the same rules of propriety that apply elsewhere in the EU.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para2">At the same time, I am anxious to stress that this decision in no way reflects our views on the policy content of the challenged measures nor calls into question the Government's commitment to Community action in the social field where this is agreed by the Council. Our support for the new treaty provisions agreed at Amsterdam, which allow the Council to adopt small spending programmes on employment and social exclusion by QMV, is evidence of this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w04.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the international meetings he attended in September. [14577]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I attended the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting in Mauritius on the 15-17 September. I then attended the first meeting of Asian and European Finance Ministers on 19 September in Bangkok. This was followed by a series of meetings in Hong Kong. The G7 was held on 20 September with the G10 Finance Ministers and central bank governors meeting on 21 September. The IMF's interim committee meeting was also held on 21 September, and was followed by the IMF/World Bank annual meeting on 23 September. I also attended the IMF/World Bank Development Committee with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development on 22 September.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para3">My over-arching priorities for these meetings were the reduction of developing country debt and the promotion of the benefits of openness and transparency in economic policy.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para4">I announced the UK's "Debt 2000" initiative at the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting. This initiative, which has now been dubbed the "Mauritius mandate", is designed to resolve the debt problems of poor countries once and for all and set them on a path to sustainable growth. It proposes that every poor country eligible for debt relief should have at least embarked on the process of securing the full relief they need by the year 2000. This will contribute to the international target of halving the proportion of the world's population living in absolute poverty by 2015.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para5">I stressed that the success of this mandate depends not only on the commitment of the creditor countries but also on solid action by the debtors. Debtor countries must adopt and maintain sound economic policies which are necessary for sustainable economic development. Each country is unique and no one policy will be right for every country. But accountable economic decision-making and a focus on productive expenditure, including basic health and education, will be vital aspects of their economic programmes. My right hon. Friend, the Minister for International Development announced that the UK is willing to cancel the remaining aid debt due to the UK from poorer Commonwealth countries. These countries could be relieved of the need to repay as much as &#163;132 million.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para6">I encourage other creditors to provide the maximum possible relief to ensure a robust exit from unsustainable debt to those countries who focus on transparency and productive expenditure. I expressed my desire for these countries to receive the necessary debt relief in less than the maximum six years that is presently envisaged under the rules of the initiative. The Mauritius mandate was well received and was supported by other Commonwealth Ministers.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para7">I also launched a new initiative on openness in economic decision making at the interim committee. My central proposal was that the IMF should develop a code of good practice for promoting openness in fiscal and monetary policy. I believe that this should focus on basic principles that apply to all IMF members. As such, I 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 1997 : Column: 105</I><P>
proposed that the IMF should, as a matter of course, comment on such practices in their IV consultations with all member countries. I also suggested that this code could be used operationally in the design of IMF programmes for financial assistance. These proposals attracted considerable interest and the fund is now developing such a code on the fiscal side.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para8">I stressed that long-term stability in monetary and fiscal policy is necessary to achieve sustainable growth. But, the role of government must also be to equip individuals and companies to succeed in the ever more competitive global market-place. Part of this entails ensuring that policies which provide economic stability are combined with institutions and procedures which create the confidence that stability will be maintained. It was agreed that greater openness and transparency would enhance policy credibility and limit the potential for corruption.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para9">In keeping with this, I announced that the UK would publish a full set of annual accounts and a quarterly report on the region exchange reserves detailing the UK's outstanding forward position.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para10">Another key feature of the discussions at these meetings was capital flows. It was agreed that private capital flows can bring substantial benefits and as such, the report of the Commonwealth working group on private capital flows was endorsed by the Ministers. The importance of sound macroeconomic policies and financial systems, strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks and political stability were recognised as essential for encouraging inward investment.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para11">There was general agreement that the international financial institutions also have a key role to play in putting in place multilateral arrangements and mechanisms for promoting and coping with private capital flows. More specifically for the Commonwealth, Ministers agreed on the key elements of a code of good practice for national policies that attract and sustain private capital flows. The secretariat was asked to develop these elements into a full code as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para12">The interim committee adopted the statement on "The Liberalisation of Capital Movements Under an Amendment of the Fund's Articles" and considered that an amendment of the fund's articles will provide the most effective means of promoting an orderly liberalisation of capital movements consistent with the fund's role in the international monetary system. The proposed amendment to the articles will also ensure that liberalisation can be phased in at a country's chosen pace and that controls can be reintroduced on a temporary basis.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para13">The first ever meeting of Asian and European Finance Ministers represented an important addition to the Asia-Europe Meetings (or ASEM) process which began only last year, and reflected the growing co-operation between two regions whose economic and financial interests are rapidly converging.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para14">The meeting began with an exchange of views on the macroeconomic outlook and developments in foreign exchange markets. I offered my full support to the programmes of adjustment which Thailand and the Philippines have agreed with the IMF, and stressed how crucial it would be to adhere to these programmes. Asian 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 1997 : Column: 106</I><P>
partners were keen to learn more about the implications of EMU, and we agreed that every opportunity would be taken to keep them fully informed on latest developments.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para15">In the second session on financial sector issues, I stressed the need for close co-operation, and the importance for both Asia and Europe of sharing and learning from each other--especially through a greater openness, in the trade in financial services and a welcoming attitude to foreign capital. We agreed a number of useful initiatives, including closer co-operation on financial supervision and the fight against money laundering.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para16">The Government places great importance on the ASEM process, and the Prime Minister very much looks forward to welcoming Asian and European Heads to London next April as host of the second ASEM summit. The G7 meeting considered recent developments in south-east Asia in the context of surveillance. We were informed of international efforts to assist Thailand and expected the Thai authorities not only to implement the Fund program but also to continue to co-operate with the other international financial institutions. We agreed on the importance of minimising contagion and will continue to monitor closely developments in south-east Asia. In accordance with this, the importance of increased transparency within and supervision of financial systems was stressed. We also discussed recent developments in exchange and financial markets and agreed to monitor developments in these markets and cooperate as necessary.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para17">My colleagues were interested in the plans that we have for our presidency of the G7 and G8 next year. I informed them that employability will be one of the main themes of the UK presidency.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para18">The G10 meeting welcomed the broad endorsement given to the concerted strategy to promote financial stability in emerging market economies that has been developed in collaboration with representatives of these economies. The finalisation of the Basle core principles of effective banking supervision was welcomed and the importance of their endorsement and implementation by national authorities was stressed.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para19">I was nominated as Chairman of the Group of Ten for the coming year. At the interim committee, I welcomed the agreements in the executive board on the eleventh review of quotas which provides a 45 per cent. increase for the fund--$90 billion--and the special equity allocation of 21.4 billion SDRs which was formally approved at the meetings.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para20">Both the Secretary of State for International Development and I attended the Development Committee meeting where we stressed that corruption and weak governance undermine macroeconomic stability, private sector activity and sustainable development objectives, and may erode international support for development objectives, and may erode international support for development cooperation. We supported calls for criminalisation of bribery and the abolition of tax deductibility of bribes, and for the fund to examine the effects of corruption in governance on countries macroeconomic performance.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para21">A package to alleviate the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency's resource constraints was agreed.




<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 1997 : Column: 107</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para22">At the joint IMF/World Bank annual meeting I outlined the changes we have made to both monetary and fiscal policies in the UK. I outlined the benefits of giving operational independence to the Bank of England and the benefits clear rules, a new discipline, openness and accountability will bring to fiscal policy. I explained that our task is to secure high and sustainable levels of growth and employment in the UK as well as in the rest of the world.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para23">I stressed the importance of our dependence upon each other and the importance of international cooperation to maintain an open economy. Although we are committed to a constructive partnership with Europe, we must remain open and outward looking to the rest of the world. And above all, regional concerns must never replace international commitments.
<P>

<a name="71104w04.html_para24">Copies of my speeches and the communiques of these meetings have been put in the Library of the House. There was no G7 communique.

 In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, an audit of all computer-based systems across MOD, including the Defence Agencies, has been under way since mid-1996. The audit is being used to identify and assess the Year 2000 compliancy of systems that process date-related information and to measure progress in modification or replacement of affected systems. The audit covers equipment ranging from office systems to front-line military hardware. The audit is one component of the MOD action plan for managing the Year 2000 problem. As is the case with other Departments, a costed action plan has been provided to the Cabinet Office, who are preparing a report for my right hon.

 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1997]:</i> A number of inquiries have been received about the progress of individual compensation claims. The firearms compensation section is dealing with claims as quickly as possible, and in the order in which they are received. It has so far made over 14,200 payments to the value of over &#163;17 million. The sheer number of claims received over the three-month hand-in period means that some processing delays are inevitable. That was explained to the House when the scheme was approved, but, as promised, we are doing all that we can to keep these to a minimum.

 The Prison Service has had a long standing interest in developing a new prison in the east London/Essex area. This will provide new prison places to meet the population increases now being projected and help reduce the overcrowding currently being experienced within London prisons, to which large numbers of young offenders and adult prisoners from the Essex area are sent.
<P>

<a name="71104w08.html_para3">A number of sites in the east London/Essex area have been looked at by the Prison Service in recent years. One site in the Colchester area was investigated some two years ago, but was considered too small for a prison development.
<P>

<a name="71104w08.html_para4">Another possible site in Colchester has been recently drawn to the attention of the Prison Service. This is now being assessed, but it is too early to say whether it will prove suitable to be pursued further.

 Mr. Carlos Pulgarin has alleged that while he was in Feltham young offender institution in September he was assaulted by prison officers.

I understand that the police have sent their report on the incident to the Crown Prosecution Service, who are considering what action to take.

 We have no plans to amend the Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs undertook a study into volatile substance abuse, the results of which were published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1995. A copy of their report is in the Library. They concluded that there were no acceptable legislative changes that would do more than the Act already does to protect young people. Responsibility for enforcement of the provisions of the Act rests with the police.

<a name="71104w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Derek Twigg: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if there will be a further round of the regional challenge competition for the allocation of European structural funds grants. [14582]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Government has decided that the further round of the regional challenge competition will not go ahead and the prize fund of &#163;160 million will return to the regions eligible for structural funds grants. This will restore decision-making on funding allocations to the regions and relieve local partners of the considerable burden involved in the administration of the challenge approach.
<P>

<a name="71104w10.html_para4">The first round of regional challenge did, of course, produce some imaginative projects with potentially significant regional benefits, and we wish these projects every success. However, the original aims of the challenge can now be achieved through other mechanisms. The new "action plan" approach, to be introduced on a flexible basis in England, will encourage a strong strategic focus on high quality projects which can make a real difference to the regional economy and attract private sector contributions, whilst avoiding the additional administrative burdens of regional challenge.

 Twelve African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which traditionally supplied bananas to the EU have individual export allocations under the EU regime. These total 857,700 tonnes of bananas.

<P>

<a name="71104w11.html_para0">Other imports of bananas enter the EU within an annual tariff quota; since the enlargement of the EU in 1995 this has been set at 2.553 million tonnes. This figure includes a small allocation for ACP imports outside the traditional quotas. There are three types of licences for importing bananas within the tariff quota: Category A licences (66.5 per cent. of the tariff quota) are allocated on the basis of past trade in third country and non-traditional ACP bananas; Category B licences (30 per cent. of the tariff quota) are allocated on the basis of past trade in EU or traditional ACP bananas; Category C licences (3.5 per cent.) are allocated to traders who do not have a record of trade in bananas before 1993. The tariff quota licences can be used freely to import third-country or non-traditional ACP bananas, i.e. their use is not linked to imports from a particular supplying country. The principal

<P>

We are disappointed by the WTO ruling but we accept that the Community must now set about revising the EU arrangements to bring them into conformity with WTO rules.

<a name="71104w11.html_para5">The UK's commitment to banana production in the Caribbean is a long-standing one. This Government are in no doubt about the vital importance of the banana industry to the Caribbean and will continue to ensure that the interests of the Caribbean banana growers are fully recognised in the negotiations on the new WTO-consistent arrangements. The Caribbean must be given the opportunity to prove that it can sustain a viable industry committed to providing a good quality product at a competitive price to the European consumer.

<P>
<a name="71104w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the terms of Council Regulation 3699/93, Member States which have not complied with their Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP) objectives are not eligible for EU funding in respect of vessel construction or modernisation grants. It is also open to the European Commission to invoke the provisions of the Treaty in respect of any failure to meet obligations which they consider sufficiently serious.
<P>

<a name="71104w12.html_para0">As far as the Commission's Report on MAGP III is concerned, the section devoted to the UK refers to two outstanding requests for adjustments to our objectives and to the need for certain discrepancies in fleet registers to be corrected.
<P>

<a name="71104w12.html_para1">The Commission subsequently put proposals to the Fisheries Management Committee on 27-28 October which are expected to be adopted shortly. They have the effect of amending the UK MAGP III objectives for the purposes of setting new objectives for MAGP IV. These changes would meet all the points which we have put to the Commission. Details are given in the table.

 Audits of all the Department's major business-critical systems are now complete.

<P>
<P>

 It is currently planned that funding for preventive and remedial action to resolve the computer millennium problem will be met from existing PES provision.

<P>

<a name="71104w12.html_para3">However, some aspects of the programme are still largely an unknown quantity. There is a likelihood, therefore, that some non-critical work may need to be deferred beyond the end-December 1998 target set by the Central IT Unit of the Cabinet Office, that additional funds may need to be sought, or a combination of both.

 In compliance with the Government-wide target set by the Cabinet Office's Central IT Unit (CITU), MAFF has submitted an action plan, required by October 1997.

 The current welfare codes make it clear that beak trimming of poultry should be carried out only where necessary to avoid a worse welfare problem such as might be caused by outbreaks of cannibalism in laying hens. We are addressing through our research programme the need to develop commercial systems which can reliably meet the welfare needs of poultry without recourse to this procedure.

<a name="71104w13.html_para0">The results of these studies will be taken into account in any revisions to the welfare codes and when reviewing the need for further legislative controls.

<a name="71104w13.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Provision of life saving equipment is governed by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. This places a duty on operators of canals and waterways towards members of the public who may be affected by the way in which they carry out their work. The extent to which operators must safeguard the public depends upon the nature of the risks involved and the cost and effectiveness of possible precautions. Relevant factors include the costs of installing life saving equipment, the practicalities of maintaining and protecting it against vandalism and theft, and the availability of someone nearby to deploy it. British Waterways has set up a user safety programme to review the risk to any groups who use its canal network.

(16) SSA figure is not comparable with that for the previous year as a result of changes to the Education SSA formula e.g. removal of further education in 1993-94 from local authority responsibility.<P>

(17) SSA figure is much lower following reorganisation in Derbyshire on 1 April 1997. The total Education SSA of Derbyshire CC and the City of Derby is &#163;320.622 million (1.80 per cent. of the national total).<P>

<P>
<a name="71104w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the research centres whose work has been evaluated by his Department in respect of research into <i>(a)</i> exposure to fine wood dust and <i>(b)</i> exposure to formaldehyde particles; what contact his Department has had with them; and what contact is planned in the future. [13866]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w14.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Comprehensive reviews of the international scientific literature were undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and considered by the Health and Safety Commission when advising on the setting of Maximum Exposure Limits for formaldehyde and softwood dusts under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations.
<P>

<a name="71104w14.html_para0">Studies have been carried out on formaldehyde for HSE by the Medical Research Council toxicology unit. HSE has also commissioned work on wood dust with the Health and Safety Laboratory. Future contact will depend on the nature of the new research commissioned and the findings that emerge.
<P>

<a name="71104w14.html_para1">Studies on non-occupational exposure have been carried out for my Department by the Medical Research Council's Institute for Environment and Health and by the Building Research Establishment, where long term studies are continuing. My Department will maintain contact with these research organisations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w14.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the safety exposure limit, in parts per million, for formaldehyde emissions set by <i>(a)</i> the Health and Safety Executive and <i>(b)</i> other EU member states; and what international figures his Department has evaluated. [13865]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w14.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Formaldehyde has a maximum exposure limit (MEL) of two parts per million for an eight-hour time weighted average and for a 15-minute reference period under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH).
<P>

<a name="71104w14.html_para2">The occupational exposure limits for other EU member states and worldwide, where information is available, is in the table below. Under COSHH, employers are required to control exposures to formaldehyde to a level as low as is reasonably practicable and in any case below the MEL. It is therefore misleading to compare the numerical value of the MEL with limits in other countries, where limits have different definitions and applications.

(18) ACGIH: American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists--This is a non statutory body and the limits they prescribe are only a recommendation.<P>

MEL: Maximum exposure limit. MELs have a particular status under COSHH. Under the Regulations, there is a duty to control exposure to substances with a MEL to a level as low as is reasonably practicable, and in any case below the MEL. This duty to reduce exposures thus does not stop once the MEL level has been achieved, but continues until all that is reasonably practicable has been done. This special status of MELs means that it is misleading simply to compare the numerical value of a MEL with a limit that applies in another country, where limits have different definitions and applications.<P>

TWA: Time weighted average. Both the long-term and the short-term exposure limits are expressed as airborne concentrations averaged over a specified period of time. The period for the long-term limit is usually eight hours; the short-term exposure limit (STEL) in the UK is 15 minutes but may be different elsewhere.<P>

 The Health and Safety Executive is conducting a literature review into the health effects of medium density fibreboard (MDF). My Department has commissioned the Medical Research Council's Institute for Environment and Health to carry out a preliminary assessment of the potential risks from the domestic use of MDF. Both those studies complement earlier extensive research and reviews on the possible health risks to which MDF could give rise. Machining of MDF can result in exposure to formaldehyde and wood dust.

 Since 1988, 58 local authorities have completed 63 large scale voluntary transfers of all or part of their housing stock. These transfers have led to the transfer of over 252,000 dwellings, many of the tenants have benefited as a result of increased investment in their homes. So far, transfers have generated over &#163;2.4 billion in capital receipts and raised over &#163;4 billion in private finance for the acquisition, repair and maintenance, and management of the properties.

 The Government supports efforts to improve zoo standards throughout the Community, which are long overdue. We believe that a directive would be the most effective way to achieve this. In deciding whether to pursue a directive in the Environment Council, we will need to consider whether it would attract sufficient support from other member states to secure its early adoption. We are discussing this with other member states as part of the groundwork for the forthcoming UK Presidency. If a directive is unattainable, the main alternative is to finalise a Council recommendation on zoos, which would be a significant step forward.

 Regulations for the protection of important hedgerows in England and Wales came into force on 1 June 1997.

Although an important first step, we have instigated a review to consider how the regulations might be strengthened so that they give better protection for hedgerows. The review is being undertaken by a group which includes the statutory agencies, local authorities and the main farming and conservation bodies. It has been asked to report its recommendations by the end of December 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w16.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance he has issued concerning the erection of telecommunications masts. [14543]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Current planning policy guidance on telecommunication development is set out in planning policy guidance note 8 (PPG8 revised December 1992). That guidance reflects the importance attached to keeping to a minimum the number of telecommunications masts, and of sites for such installations. At paragraph 27, the PPG states that the sharing of masts will help to achieve this aim, where such sharing is practicable, as will the use of existing buildings to site new antennas. Telecommunications operators, licensed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry under the Telecommunications Act 1984, are required by their licence conditions to take all reasonable steps to investigate the possibility of mast sharing. We already advise local planning authorities in the PPG that they may reasonably expect applicants for planning permission for large masts to show evidence that they have explored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or other structure.
<P>

<a name="71104w16.html_para1">It will henceforth be our policy to extend this guidance to the development of smaller masts, particularly those which are permitted under Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. Where an operator seeks a prior approval determination for a mast under that Order, clear evidence should be presented to the local planning authority that the operator has investigated carefully the siting of antennas on existing buildings or other structures, including masts. This is a further factor to consider alongside the sitting factors set out in appendix E to Department of the Environment circular 9/95. If the evidence regarding the consideration of such alternative 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 1997 : Column: 153</I><P>
sites is not considered satisfactory, the planning authority, or the Secretary of State on appeal, may be justified in refusing approval to the mast's siting.
<P>

<a name="71104w16.html_para2">Operators will be assisted in exploring alternatives to new mast development by the register of mast sites maintained by the Radiocommunications Agency. Operators and local planning authorities can now access that information which should help in the consideration of alternative sites that have already been cleared for radio transmission purposes.

 My right hon. friend has had no discussions with the Greater Glasgow Health Board or other bodies in Glasgow in healthy living initiatives.

 The Scottish Office issued guidance to Health Boards and interested parties on 8 July this year on national core standards for the registration, operation and inspection of nursing homes. Following consultation, guidance will be issued soon to local authorities on the registration and inspection of residential care homes. Legislation on the regulation and inspection of residential and nursing home care and domiciliary care will follow when a suitable opportunity presents.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 1997]:</i> The tuition fees which will apply to new students entering higher education in session 1998-99 are expected to be &#163;1,000 and will be increased in line with inflation for subsequent years. New entrants in session 1997-98, existing students and those with a confirmed place by 1 August 1997 for 1998 will not be affected. For Scottish and EU students undertaking an Honours degree course at a Scottish university, which is a year longer than comparable courses elsewhere in the UK, The Scottish Office will waive the student's tuition fee in the final year and pay the fee to the institutions directly. Some students will be exempt altogether from making a contribution toward tuition fees throughout their higher education,

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 1997]:</i> The project referred to is not a research project. Its purpose was to make it easier for teacher educators and their students to acquire the relevant knowledge and insights to deliver health education in schools. Health education and promotion are central to the curriculum and ethos of primary, secondary and special schools in Scotland. Our new teachers must, therefore, be well prepared for their responsibilities in teaching their pupils about health and in encouraging them to develop healthy styles of living. The project has been under way since April 1996 and will be completed in April 1998. From the start, it has been a co-operative venture involving staff from each of the teacher education institutions (TEIs), and representatives from the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS), the General Teaching Council and the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department (SOEID). The materials developed are to be made available to each of the TEIs to be adapted to fit their own courses. The materials, which are based on existing good practice in health education, will be relevant to students preparing to work with all children and young people of primary and secondary school age.

We discussed preparations for the British-French Summit and Luxembourg Special European Council, both of which focus on employment policies. British and French views on enlargement and handling the European conference are similar. I stressed the importance of related issues such as reform of the common agricultural policy. I also raised the urgent need for a solution to the problem of illegal immigrants arriving via Eurostar.

<a name="71104w22.html_para3">The executive regularly reviews performance standards across its regions and has allocated additional resources to those regions where inspection times are particularly lengthy. Present performance is influenced by the backlog of applications which exists due to unprecedented demand for grants. It is anticipated that performance standards will improve as the benefit of additional resources takes effect. In addition, performance on renovation and replacement grants has been severely effected by the diversion of financial and personnel resources to the administration of repairs grants. These grants are mandatory, on foot of public health notices issued by local councils. Recent years have seen an unprecedented demand for this grant. Very recent legislative changes have led to a significant reduction in repair grant applications. There are already signs of small improvements in performance on other grants as the impact of this reduction takes effect.

 We set targets to reduce National Health Service management costs in 1997-98 by &#163;100 million. Many of the savings achieved will already have been re-invested locally in direct patient care services. In addition, we have directly invested &#163;10 million of the savings from deferring the 8th wave of general practitioner fundholders in improving breast cancer services, so that all women have speedy access to high quality diagnosis and treatment. We have also invested a further &#163;5 million in strengthening paediatric intensive care services in readiness for the winter. It is estimated that at the start of this financial year health authorities were planning to purchase an additional 66,000 elective episodes--cases treated from waiting lists--in 1997-98 when compared with 1996-97.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what are the guidelines for the minimum levels of income which absent parents should expect to live on following calculations by the CSA. [13735]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 For those in work, child support assessments made under the maintenance formula ensure that an absent parent is generally left with at least 70 per cent. of his net income and at least &#163;30 a week more than he would have if claiming income support. Most absent parents are left with significantly higher amounts, though lower figures may apply where, for example, an interim maintenance assessment has been imposed in an effort to secure the absent parent's co-operation or the absent parent is in arrears with his payments.
<P>

<a name="71104w26.html_para2">Absent parents who receive income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance are generally required to pay a standard weekly amount, currently &#163;5.00, unless for example they are sick or disabled or have a dependent child living with them. This payment recognises that absent parents are important to their children and should normally be expected to contribute to their maintenance.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71104w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Travel to work costs are taken into consideration under the standard maintenance formula. Where the straight line distance of journeys from home to work exceeds 150 miles per week an allowance of 10 pence per mile is made for each excess mile.
<P>
