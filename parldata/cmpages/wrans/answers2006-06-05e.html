<i> [holding answer 25 May 2006]:</i> Coalition forces have trained some 6,650 members of the Facilities Protection Service (FPS) based in Multi-National Division (South-East). The basic training course provides FPS guards with the skills that allow them to act as static security. The advanced course content varies, being structured at the discretion of FPS commanders, but frequently includes such areas as combat life support, Quick Reaction Forces, and logistics. At present, the FPS are operating at over 800 sites in Multi-National Division (South-East) on behalf of 22 Ministries.</p>

 On 20 March 2006, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) rolled out Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) to all 48,000 RAF service personnel throughout the world on time and on budget. The event marked the culmination of five years of system design, development, integration and testing and bears testimony to a very strong partnering agreement between MOD and EDS. The total cost to date of JPA is &#163;116 million.</p>

Prior to rollout, the readiness for service was assessed by an independent Office of Government Commerce Gateway review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="60605w0009.htm_para1"><a name="06060519000579">On JPA rollout to the RAF there were a small number of technical issues which had not manifested themselves in the extensive testing carried out prior to its launch. This resulted in the system operating much more slowly than anticipated which greatly restricted the number of self-service users at any one time. Over the course of the last six weeks these early problems have been overcome and all users now have full access to the system. JPA has performed satisfactorily on rollout to RAF professional HR administrators and has delivered pay to the RAF with only a relatively few discrepancies caused by the migration of data from the legacy systems to JPA. Although the first few weeks following rollout have generated a significant number of enquiries, no formal complaints have been received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="60605w0009.htm_para2"><a name="06060519000580">Following RAF rollout, the related provisional JPA dates for the RN and Army were June and November 2006 respectively. However, in order to more closely align JPA with Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) programme requirements, current plans are that JPA will be rolled out to the RN from October 2006 and to the Army from March 2007 respectively.</p>

Encouraging staff to share vehicles when travelling to work is dependent on the circumstances of each site.

The Royal Navy also encourages the practice through its intranet sites with schemes in place at Royal Navy Fleet HQ, and at Portsmouth and Devonport Naval Bases.</p>

people. The Home Office's comprehensive &#147;Guidance on ASBOs&#148; issued jointly with the Youth Justice Board and the Association of Chief Police Officers is currently being updated and will be issued shortly. In addition joint guidance issued by the Home Office, Youth Justice Board and the Association of Chief Police Officers, issued in March 2005, provides youth offending teams with advice on their role in preventing and reducing antisocial behaviour. Practitioners can also access information provided by the Together campaign in the form of a website, an extensive range of leaflets and a telephone action line offering advice on all aspects of antisocial behaviour.</p>

 The cost of calls to the new 101 single non-emergency number has been set at 10p per call following consultation with a wide group of stakeholders and research with the public. The research showed that a small fixed charge would not put people off calling the service but would reduce the likelihood of the service being abused. The Government, police and local authorities will not profit in any way from the 10p fixed charge for calls to the single non-emergency number. The charge will be retained by telecom providers to offset the substantial cost of carrying calls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="60605w0012.htm_para3"><a name="06060519001056">This fixed rate charge compares favourably with existing police and local authority non-emergency numbers many of which are charged at 0845 call rates which can cost as much as 10p per minute or more.

 Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 is the primary measure for combating illegal working. It provides employers with a statutory defence from conviction if they check and record certain specified documents belonging to potential employees. To support employers in meeting their responsibilities under section 8, IND produced short (summary) guidance which was distributed widely among other Government Departments and agencies. If further guidance on this legislation is required, the booklet refers the reader to the immigration and nationality directorate website where comprehensive guidance is available, and there is also a reference to the Employers&#146; Helpline which offers a dedicated service for employers by advising on the legislation on preventing illegal migrant working. The Employers&#146; Helpline also disseminates hard copies of the comprehensive guidance on request. The comprehensive guidance makes clear that this legislation covers contracted and sub-contracted employment.</p>

The study will follow the principles laid down in the draft EU Directive on Humane Trapping Standards whereby the humaneness of a trapping device is first assessed under controlled conditions in pen trials before, if its humaneness is deemed to be acceptable, field trials of the device are conducted to confirm its humaneness and to assess its efficacy and non-target risks. The aim is to release all captured badgers taken during the trial back into the wild unharmed.</p>

 The Marine Fisheries Agency, along with other fisheries administrations in the UK, operates systems as required by EU legislation to monitor and control the activity of UK fishing vessels to ensure quotas allocated to the UK are not exceeded. This involves maintaining dedicated systems for the collection and collation of information from vessel logbooks and landing declarations, as well as information from sales notes from registered buyers and sellers of fish. The information from UK systems is collated to produce reports on the level of uptake of quotas that are updated on a daily or weekly basis as appropriate. These reports are used by fisheries administrations, producer organisations and other groups in the UK to manage the individual quota allocations during each year. Monthly reports are provided to the European Commission, with measures also in place to check and validate information received by the Commission from other member states on landings by UK vessels outside the UK. The agency takes management action, as necessary, to control or close activity in particular fisheries to ensure quotas limits are complied with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="60605w0020.htm_para10"><a name="0606064000349">The risk weightings relate to enforcement of sea fisheries legislation. The Marine Fisheries Agency aims to deploy 60 per cent. of its inspection and enforcement resources to high risk fisheries, 30 per cent. to medium risk and 10 per cent. to low risk. The specific risk weightings take account of a number of factors, including the nature of the fishery, the area and the type of fishing activity. For instance, we would consider vessels fishing in an area and for a species for which specific recovery measures have been introduced to be classified as &#145;high risk&#146;. The agency is developing a computer model to assist in analysing a wide range of factors to determine compliance risks in fisheries for the medium to long term so that its resources can be deployed and utilised to best effect.</p>

This scheme, therefore, requires close and careful financial management. To this end, each region is given an annual budget within which it must manage the grant awards it has made. This will include any delays to project expenditure and therefore delays to claims, as well as any under or over-claims by beneficiaries.</p>

In this regard, it is expected that some additional monies will be identified as available to support new grant awards before the closure of the scheme at the end of June. The precise value of funds available for grant awards will be confirmed by mid-June.</p>

 The new governance structure is designed to strengthen the BBC's independence from Government and will be reinforced by very clear separation between the Trust and the Executive Board.

The Trust's overarching responsibility will be to represent the interests of the licence fee payer. The new system will also deliver effective oversight of the Executive Board's activities by the Trust, in the public interest; at the same time, it will prevent micro-management of the executive Board's activities by the Trust in a way that would distract from the Trust's strategic role.</p>

 The horse race betting levy recognises the unique relationship between that sport and the betting industry. Horse racing is a sport whose primary purpose is to provide a betting product. In that respect, it is a symbiotic relationship not shared by other sports, except perhaps greyhound racing which has a separate arrangement with bookmakers. Consequently, the Government currently have no plans to introduce a betting levy for other sports.</p>

 Culling efficiency in the proactive trial areas is calculated by taking the proportion of the badger population that is available to be trapped within the whole trial area (the trapping efficacy) and correcting this to reflect the degree of landowner consent.</p>

This figure was based on a trapping efficacy of 50 to 80 per cent. and landowner consent of 43 to 82 per cent.</p>

Variations in trapping efficiency will reflect the season, the weather, the differing amount of non-consent land within each proactive removal area, and trap interference. The approach and results from the revised estimates will be discussed with the ISG.</p>

 No specific assessment of the cost of making an application to the Rural Enterprise Scheme has been carried out, but we know from our work with applicants to schemes run by my Department that the costs associated with applications can vary considerably from case to case.

This was done to streamline single payment scheme and customer registration telephone enquiries into the agency through one route, to allow staff to concentrate on processing. More importantly, this system aims to ensure that customers receive consistent answers and any, more complex enquiries can be directed to specialist areas of the business to call the customer back.</p>

SPS claimants will be best served by the Rural Payments Agency maintaining its focus on ensuring that outstanding sums are paid as soon as possible.

This seeks views on a draft action plan that aims, over a 10 year period, to increase the number of people who choose to make use of outdoor recreational facilities. In particular, the plan is aimed at the nine million disabled people and the five million people from ethnic minority communities in the UK, often living in areas of high urban density, who do not currently access proportionate benefit from England's green areas.</p>

The latest figures show that local authorities in England recycled 22.9 per cent. of household waste in 2004-05 compared to 10.3 per cent. in 2001-02. More packaging waste is being recovered and recycled, rising from 33 per cent. to 56 per cent. between 1998 and 2004. The re-use and recycling of industrial and commercial waste has also increased, together with construction and demolition waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="60605w0033.htm_para16"><a name="06060646000614">However, we still have much more to do. In 2000, our waste strategy set targets to recycle or compost at least 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. The Government have provided local authorities with greater levels of funding to enable them to meet their targets, and the majority of local authorities are working hard to improve their performance. Defra is proposing more targeted intervention and engagement with the poorest performers, and those local authorities with the lowest recycling rates in England have had their targets for 2007-08 raised from 18 per cent. to 20 per cent.</p>

 Between the financial years 2000-01 and 2004-05, the UK has provided a total of &#163;8.15 million of aid to Grenada. Of this total, &#163;1.65 million was provided over the period as financial assistance, and &#163;6.5 million was provided as emergency assistance following the impact of Hurricane Ivan on the country in September 2004.</p>

One of the objectives of this programme, which was launched in September 2004, was to narrow the gaps that existed between the enrolment of Scheduled Caste and other children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="60605w0042.htm_para5"><a name="06060657000091">The recent mid-term review of SSA indicates that the programme has been effective in increasing the enrolment of Scheduled Caste children into mainstream education. The proportion of Scheduled Caste children in the school population has increased from 19 per cent. in 2003 to 21.3 per cent. in 2005. This means that millions of Dalit children are now in schools alongside other children and the proportion of Dalit children in mainstream Government schools now exceeds the proportion of Dalit children in the general population. This success has been achieved through a range of strategies that have helped to tackle discrimination at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"><a name="60605w0042.htm_para6"><a name="06060657000092">Special efforts are needed to ensure that Dalits are able to exercise their rights to access mainstream services. DFID is providing &#163;75 million over five years to UNICEF in India to help reduce child mortality to tackle social exclusion in health and education services. Under this partnership, UNICEF has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies. This will increase understanding of how to tackle the constraints and barriers that Dalits face in accessing services.</p>

 The Department introduced the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) scheme in 1999, under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations, which were updated by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations in 2003. The TPS scheme provides protection to UK consumers from cold calling by foreign companies if the calls are made on behalf of UK companies and the consumer has previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or has been registered with the TPS for at least 28 days. Therefore, those making cold calls are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS list. The Information Commissioner has responsibility for the enforcement of the TPS scheme and considers complaints about breaches. However, cold calls from non-UK companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the TPS scheme, as the companies and products have no link with the UK.</p>

 The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 implement European Council Directive (97/7/EC) to increase consumer protection throughout the EU and give consumers confidence when buying at a distance.

The Regulations provide a seven day &#147;cooling off period&#148; during which the consumer can withdraw from the contract, this gives consumers an opportunity to examine the goods. Consumers who exercise their right to cancel must be refunded all money paid within 30 days.</p>

 The Department&#146;s preferred approach when making international comparisons with other EU countries is to rely on data compiled by the International Energy Agency (the IEA) or the European Commission. The IEA conducts periodic reviews of member countries&#146; energy policies, which are published in a variety of forms. A review of a member country&#146;s energy policies will typically include an analysis of supply, demand and energy mix including whether the country uses nuclear power to generate electricity.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 May 2006]:</i> Personal debt has risen substantially over the last 10 years, both in real terms and as a proportion of income. By the end of 2005 borrowing stood at approximately &#163;1.3tn, or 151 per cent. of income. This compares to a real value of &#163;530 billion in 1995, or 75 per cent. of income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="60605w0046.htm_para2"><a name="06060657001163">Despite these significant rises in the uptake of borrowing in the UK we do not believe that personal debt constitutes a major problem. The large majority of consumers continue to use credit in a productive and prudent way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_582"><a name="60605w0046.htm_para3"><a name="06060657001164">However, the Government recognise that for a small but significant number of individuals debt causes serious problems. Current estimates suggest that the number of individuals experiencing such debt problems stands at around 5 per cent. of the adult population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_583"><a name="60605w0046.htm_para4"><a name="06060657001166">In recognition of these problems we are doing much to help those with personal debt problems as outlined in the Government's 2004 &#147;Tackling Over-indebtedness: Action Plan&#148; and the subsequent 2005 Annual Report. DTI examples include the recently launched &#163;45 million Face-to-Face Debt Advice Project, which will result in hundreds of new debt advisers, and the multi-million pound support given to the National Debtline phone service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_584"><a name="60605w0046.htm_para5"><a name="06060657001167">The DTI also recognizes that over-indebtedness is an issue that can only be resolved through the close co-operation of a number of different Government bodies, and actively supports programmes by other Departments including major financial education policies currently being implemented by the Financial Services Authority and Department for Education and Skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_585"><a name="60605w0046.htm_para6"><a name="06060657001168">Furthermore, the DTI is committed to the continued monitoring of the over- indebtedness picture in the UK and will report again in early 2007 on the extent of the problem.</p>

 No assessment of the merits of private copying levies on blank recording media and devices has been made since the introduction of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act in 1988 in the UK. However, the European Commission has commissioned a study which will look at the whole body of copyright legislation in Europe and has indicated it will review levies in 2007. Currently, the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property is looking at the whole UK IP framework, and analysing a number of copyright issues, including private copying.

 The minimum legal obligations for post office service provision are determined according to the universal service obligations set by the postal services regulator, Postcomm and are reflected in Royal Mail's licence. The Royal Mail chief executive's reference to a network of 4,000 post office branches reflects a hypothetical network geared solely towards fulfilling licence criteria for provision of mail services. However, the Government's track record shows that it has made a substantial investment in the post office network in recognition of the many more services it provides, for example access to cash and other Government services.</p>

 Entitlement to vote in elections in the UK is based in large part on nationality but is not restricted only to those holding British citizenship. In recent years the addition of a &#147;nationality&#148; box in the registration form provides an opportunity for electoral registration officers (EROs), who would otherwise have no reason to know, to determine an individual&#146;s eligibility for inclusion on the basis of their stated nationality. Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may object and notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual.

 The Government believe that family mediation has significant advantages in resolving disputes, particularly in relation to children. The Government are taking forward a number of measures to give the strongest possible encouragement to mediation as an alternative to contested court proceedings.

 There is no current requirement on either judges or magistrates to meet victims of crime as part of their training.

 The right to establish a conscientious objection to military service has long been recognised by the armed forces. As conscription no longer exists, it is unlikely that anybody who has an existing conscientious objection to military service would join the armed forces. Those who develop a genuine conscientious objection during service in the armed forces are able to follow well established procedures for their service to be terminated, and this includes an independent appeals procedure in any case where an application has been rejected.

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="60605w0051.htm_para1"><a name="06060666000475">1 July 1997 was the date when the Gurkhas became a UK-based force, on completion of the withdrawal from their previous base in Hong Kong. Under the terms of the HM Forces Immigration Rule (HMFIR), announced on 30 September 2004, a Gurkha discharged from the British Army on or after that date may apply for indefinite leave to enter the UK, and settle and work here. This requires the applicant to have completed at least four years service as a Gurkha with the British Army and to have been discharged in Nepal on completion of his engagement. HMFIR is based on the general principle of granting settlement on the basis of close personal ties with the UK, which Gurkhas are assumed to have developed as members of a UK-based force. Those who retired before 1 July 1997 and are not covered by the new Rule, can still apply, but would be expected to demonstrate that such ties exist.</p>

 The new Government in Nepal has already made significant steps towards achieving democratic accountability over its defence and security forces. On 18 May 2006 the Nepalese House of Representatives unanimously passed an historic declaration which announced itself as the sovereign body of the country, and renamed His Majesty's Government of Nepal as &#147;Government of Nepal&#148; and the Royal Nepal Army as the &#147;Nepal Army&#148;. The King is no longer the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Nepalese Army are now subordinated to democratic control. Her Majesty's Government&#146;s goal in Nepal remains to help the country emerge from the current conflict with a sustainable peace, based on the principles of a civilian, accountable and democratic Government, as the necessary foundation on which to build a viable economy and climate for recovery and reform. Although much remains to be done, this can best be achieved through engagement by the international community with the new democratic Government and with the new Nepal Army to help it adjust to the new accountability.

 Since humans can be exposed to low levels of chemicals in their diet, or in their environment, over a significant proportion of their lifespan, studies to evaluate lifetime exposure are conducted in animals to ascertain the potential for the chemical to cause cancer. The objective of carcinogenicity studies is to identify the potential of test materials to cause tumours in animals and to assess the relevant risk in humans. Carcinogenicity studies are time consuming and resource intensive and are only performed when potential or actual human exposure warrants the need for this information to be generated. Our implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 ensures that this is the case, and that the studies that are undertaken avoid unnecessary animal use, do not cause unnecessary suffering and provide data of a sufficiently high quality to inform risk assessments and regulatory decisions.</p>

Antisocial Behaviour Order (ASBO) data were collected on aggregate numbers only by police force area. Tables A to H give the number of ASBOs issued to 10 to17-year-olds at all courts, as notified to the Home Office, from 1 June 2000 to 30 September 2005 (latest available), by individual age and the local authority area in which prohibitions have been imposed.

On 20 December 2005 we announced that we would put on a statutory footing the exisiting good practice guidance that agencies should conduct a one year review of ASBOs issued to children and young people, in order to ensure that they are receiving the help and support they need in order to avoid breaching the terms of the ASBOs.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases the Criminal Records Bureau has dealt with since its inception; how many errors have been made in identification in that period; and if he will make a statement. [73502]</p>

<p><a name="st_680"><a name="0606078000202"><a name="60605w0053.htm_spnew6"><a name="0606078001923"><b>Joan Ryan:</b>
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has issued 8.9 million Disclosures since its launch in March 2002 to 31 March 2006. In that time, there have been 2,273 occasions where Disclosure applicant details were matched by the CRB to a person with the same or very similar details who has a criminal record and, where the details had been challenged by the applicant, their dispute was subsequently upheld.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_651"><a name="60605w0053.htm_para3"><a name="0606078000203">These cases are clearly regrettable, but represent a very small proportion of cases&#151;0.025 per cent. of the total number of Disclosures issued. The CRB is acutely aware of the human consequences of making an incorrect matching decision and does not do so lightly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_652"><a name="60605w0053.htm_para4"><a name="0606078000204">However, the CRB must err on the side of caution when an individual has the same or very similar personal details to those of someone who has a criminal record. This is because it is better to be safe than run the risk of letting an inappropriate person through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_653"><a name="60605w0053.htm_para5"><a name="0606078000205">When a Disclosure is disputed it is resolved by asking the applicant to have their fingerprints taken at a local police station to help either confirm or overturn the original matching decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_654"><a name="60605w0053.htm_para6"><a name="0606078000206">The CRB will always apologise if the original matching decision is later found to be incorrect. In the event of a dispute the CRB notifies the prospective employer who would be aware of the CRB's Code of Practice that asks them not to take any precipitative action and defer any employment decision until the dispute is resolved. When a Disclosure is disputed the CRB will inform all parties that this is the case, including the employer. Where the information contained in the Disclosure is found not to relate to the applicant, a fresh Disclosure will be issued free of charge to both the applicant and the Registered Body. 90 per cent. of disputes are resolved within 21 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_655"><a name="60605w0053.htm_para7"><a name="0606078000207">A public consultation exercise was conducted in October 2003 about making greater use of fingerprinting at an earlier stage in the application process and to aid the matching and decision-making procedures. The overwhelming response was not in favour of such a measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_656"><a name="60605w0053.htm_para8"><a name="0606078000208">It is worth noting that under the previous police checking arrangements, individuals were not able to see the criminal records information disclosed about them. The information would have been passed only to the prospective employer and not to the job applicant and the prospective employer would have had no obligation to pass on the contents of the information to the individual.</p>

To date the initiative which was successfully launched in December 2005 has brought influential mainstream Muslims scholars and thinkers to speak to audiences of thousands of 18 to 30 year old British Muslims, a large percentage of whom have been young British Muslim women.

 The following protocols ensure that appropriate quality assurances are maintained: Prison Service Order 7100 explains how key Prison Service performance measures are defined; clear approval and validation mechanisms are in place in the networked system for data collation; and further assurances are obtained by independent internal audit, to ensure that the data provided and the methodology for collation is correct.</p>

 Full reviews of sanitation arrangements at both establishments have been carried out recently. At Long Lartin the views of staff and prisoners were sought. A number of possible changes have been identified to improve access procedures as well as in-cell facilities. Revised access procedures are shortly to be the subject of a pilot trial. At Albany as a result of the review procedures were introduced to maximise the opportunity for prisoners to use the sanitation facilities.</p>

 A Professional Standards Strategy and the Professional Standards Unit were established in February 2003 to tackle staff corruption in the Prison Service. The strategy is contained in Prison Service Order 1215 &#147;Professional Standards: Preventing and Handling Staff Wrongdoing.&#148; It sets out a policy framework and practical advice for staff, including governing governors, for obtaining, developing and dealing with information and intelligence on corrupt staff. It includes provision for confidential reporting and establishes the requirement to provide specialist professional standards managers at prison, area and national levels. The London Area Professional Standards Managers support and visit London establishments to monitor compliance with the strategy.</p>

 According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime figures, 2004-05 saw a 21 per cent. reduction in the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. However, production decreased by only 2.4 per cent. as improved weather conditions and less disease resulted in higher yields per hectare. This was particularly the case in Helmand Province, where opium production increased despite a 10 per cent. fall in the area under cultivation.</p>

 It is for the companies involved to answer questions about their decision to co-operate with the Chinese Government on restrictions on the internet and on messages sent using their software. The government believes that freedom of information is essential to the development of a modern, stable and sustainable society. We are very concerned about the apparent hardening of Chinese policy on freedom of expression, including in relation to the Internet. We made this a theme of our bilateral human rights dialogue with the Chinese in June 2005 and the UK-led EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in October 2005.

 We keep the human rights situation in Colombia under constant review and frequently raise specific human rights cases with the relevant Colombian authorities. We remain concerned about the situation faced by civil society in Colombia. While the human rights situation clearly remains unacceptable, we feel that some progress has been made and it is important to recognise this. Figures for 2005 demonstrate that the number of murders, kidnappings, displacements and massacres generally decreased by comparison with those for 2004. Much more needs to be done, however. The UK's objective is to support both the Government of Colombia and civil society through projects that promote human rights, democracy and good governance.</p>

 We make frequent representations to the Colombian Government on human rights issues, through our embassy in Bogota, through the EU and other international groupings, and in contacts with visiting Colombian officials in London. We also regularly raise specific cases of concern with the Colombian Government. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, most recently did so with Foreign Minister Barco of Colombia on 12 May in the margins of the European Union-Latin America and Caribbean summit in Vienna. Human rights are at the heart of our policy towards Colombia. We consistently urge the Colombian Government to implement recommendations arising from successive annual reports of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights and have offered to help them to do so.</p>

 There are some encouraging signs. As indicated in the Ministerial Conclusions on Colombia of the Council of the European Union in October last year, we and other EU member states consider that the effective and transparent implementation of the Law on Justice and Peace, under which more than 30,000 paramilitaries in Colombia have now demobilised, will have a positive impact on peace-building in Colombia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_715"><a name="60605w0062.htm_para0"><a name="06060712000109">The Colombian Government are talking actively with the National Liberation Army, a left-wing illegal armed group. The last round of talks took place in Cuba last month, and further talks are scheduled for later this year. However, the Colombian Government's recent efforts to begin preliminary talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the countries biggest illegal armed group, have been consistently rejected by the guerrillas. We hope that, after the elections, the incoming government will continue actively to promote peace in Colombia. We will continue to support Colombia in its efforts to tackle the inter-connected problems arising from the internal armed conflict, the trade in illegal drugs and human rights abuses.</p>

 We encourage the Colombian Government to ensure that the civilian justice system is used where appropriate, rather than the military justice system. Indeed, the UK is currently funding a project in support of the reform of the Colombian military justice system, aimed at making it more transparent and accountable. One of the additional objectives of the reforms is to ensure there is a very clear delineation between those cases where military justice procedures are applicable and those that should be dealt with by civilian courts. The subordination of the military justice system to the civil system is fundamental to this  <br>

We intend to support this office through the provision of technical assistance and advice, to ensure that he is able to do his job effectively. The UK is actively considering a range of activities to help ensure the election is free and fair, including supporting the Government of Pakistan with training election officials, and voter education campaigns. We are currently in discussions with EU and other partners about the scope for collectively monitoring the elections. As I have stated previously, officials in both London and Pakistan also meet regularly with members of the Pakistani Government, opposition parties and members of civil society to ensure that we remain abreast of developments. This also gives us an opportunity to stress the importance we attach to free and fair elections.</p>

 Dental access centres (DACs) are managed by primary care trusts (PCTs). There are not separate expenditure lines for DACs within PCT accounts and there has been no single funding stream. DACs have instead been funded through a variety of mechanisms as part of the non-discretionary general dental services and PCT-led personal dental service pilots. A separate breakdown of DAC expenditure and allocations would be available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_797"><a name="60605w0069.htm_para0"><a name="06060756000451">For this and future years, PCTs will receive allocations, totalling around &#163;1.7 billion for 2006-07, which include funding for the primary care dentistry they commission, including DACs. There is no funding stream or allocation specifically for DACs as it is now up to PCTs how they provide for the dental needs of their population.</p>

 The main element of national health service dental services is the primary dental care services provided by dentists working within the general dental service, or personal dental service. From 1 April 2006 all primary dental care services are managed locally, and the Department has allocated the sums shown in the table to primary care trusts (PCTs) in the area of the proposed North West strategic health authority (SHA) to support primary dental care in 2006-07.

The profile of safe use, storage and disposal of medicines has been raised through NHS Direct's website and the NHS Direct section of the Thompson local directory, which is issued to all households. We are also in discussion with NHS Direct to develop a leaflet, which professionals can give to members of the public when they are prescribed controlled drugs to ensure that they understand the importance of taking these medicines, and also to encourage them to return unused and unwanted medicines to pharmacies for safe disposal. We take every appropriate opportunity to communicate messages of safe use and disposal of medicines in our communication strategy.</p>

 There is no need to include a non-discrimination clause in the Bill to amend the Mental Health Act because the legislation must work in conjunction with other non-discrimination legislation, including the Race Relations Act, which prohibits any discrimination on racial grounds including race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins, and the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

 We are currently conducting a race equality impact assessment (REIA) of the amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983. As part of this, we will be holding a series of workshop events across the country which started at the end of May and will run throughout the beginning of June this year. In addition we have published a questionnaire on our website and we are engaging with relevant stakeholders to ensure that as many people as possible are involved in the process.</p>

 There are a number of policies which were in the 2004 draft Mental Health Bill which we are not intending to take forward in the proposed Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 1983. Our intention with the proposed amending Bill is to focus on the main priorities in terms of modernising mental health legislation. Some of the policies which will not be in the amending Bill may be taken forward through other means.</p>

We may also use other legislative vehicles to introduce some of the changes previously planned. For example, we are currently considering the possibility of using other legislation to provide a second tier appellate structure allowing for appeals to be heard within the tribunal system but this will not be specific to mental health, and to improve the monitoring functions of the Mental Health Act Commission. We will also be exploring the scope for clarifying the safeguards for children, if necessary through the amendment of existing regulations and guidance.</p>

This will be monitored by the Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual health check. Thanks to the strong emphasis we put on improving mental health services since publishing the NHS Plan in 2000, very significant progress has been made to date.</p>

 Research evidence shows, that apart from the benefits to oral health, the only negative effect of adding fluoride to drinking water to a level of one part per million is on the incidence of dental fluorosis. In 2003, the independent expert advisory committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COT), issued a report "Fluorine in the 1997 Total Diet Study", which noted that fluoride intakes of formula-fed infants may exceed the</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_840"><a name="60605w0075.htm_para9"><a name="06071949000001">for dental fluorosis. However, COT concluded that infants are at lesser risk of dental fluorosis than older children because the critical time for development of aesthetically significant dental fluorosis is during formation of the permanent teeth at age three to four. COT went on to recommend that more research is needed to determine the impact of the cosmetic effect of dental fluorosis on the affected individual and on any possible long-term health outcomes in people affected by dental fluorosis.</p>

 The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) has a contingency plan in place to ensure that any outbreak of Avian Influenza is dealt with quickly and effectively. If there is an outbreak in domestic poultry, infected birds and dangerous contacts will be culled. As part of the ongoing testing of the plan, culling has been tested on two separate occasions with a further exercise planned over the summer. Vaccination offers potential benefits in disease control but preventive vaccination of poultry is not the most effective defence. At UK-level, a plan is in place for a possible vaccination programme for zoo birds for conservation purposes, based on veterinary risk assessment, and 2.3 million doses of vaccine have been obtained for this purpose. DARD&#146;s policy on the wider use of vaccination will be kept under review in the light of scientific developments in vaccines.</p>

 The enriched curriculum is primarily a pedagogical approach to teaching and learning for children in years one and two of statutory education. It is designed to be sensitive to the way young children learn naturally and to provide greater flexibility in how children learn at an early age. It is not possible to make a direct comparison in the cost of delivery of the enriched curriculum and traditional curriculum, as there are other contributory factors, such as school size and type and involvement in other initiatives that influence costs in any individual school.</p>

 Synthetic phonics is one of a range of measures available to teachers in schools in Northern Ireland for the teaching of reading. The Department of Education has no plans to specify that schools should only use this measure.</p>

 The Enriched Curriculum pilot arose from concerns expressed by teachers in the Shankill area, where the traditional curriculum was not meeting the needs of their pupils. The external evaluation by Queens University was undertaken on a longitudinal basis. It compares the achievements of Enriched Curriculum pupils and traditional curriculum pupils in different classes within the same school. The findings are that children in the Enriched Curriculum in Shankill schools benefit from the approach. Their educational achievements are at least of the same standard as those taking the traditional curriculum by the end of Year 4, and in addition they demonstrate increased self-esteem, confidence, oral skills and enjoyment of learning.</p>

 A strategy for addressing domestic violence in Northern Ireland, &#147;Tackling Violence at Home&#148;, was launched in October 2005. The strategy is aimed at providing protection and support to all victims of domestic violence, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. All victims can seek information and advice through the free-phone Domestic Violence Helpline and male victims are sign-posted to organisations that provide services for men, such as the Men&#146;s Advisory Project, Men-to-Men or the Rainbow Project. Any victim of a domestic assault can seek protection from the police who will investigate, arrest the alleged abuser if power exists and prosecute where there is evidence of a crime. Alternatively a victim can engage a solicitor and apply to a court for a civil order (a non-molestation order and/or an occupation order) to prevent further abuse or exclude the abuser from the family home. There are 12 Women&#146;s Aid Refuges for women and children fleeing domestic violence. There are no refuges in operation specifically for male victims of domestic violence given the small numbers involved but men may seek assistance from the Housing Executive who will offer the full range of homelessness services including supported or unsupported temporary accommodation.</p>

In particular, major road improvements are prioritised on a country-wide basis, not on a district council basis, taking account of a broad range of criteria such as strategic planning policy, traffic flows, number of accidents, potential travel save times, environmental impact and value for money. While the actual spend on a major works scheme may be within one council area, the benefits of such schemes are not confined to the district council area or constituency in which they are located.</p>

Similarly the resources available for each maintenance activity (e.g. resurfacing, patching, gully emptying, grass cutting etc) are apportioned to district council areas using appropriate indicators of need.</p>

 Translink has advised that, in line with passenger demand, minor route changes regularly occur. Recently more substantial alterations have been made to some Goldline service routes, specifically those operating between Coleraine, Larne, Ballymena and Belfast. Also, Coleraine itself has recently seen a major reorganisation of services in the Coleraine/Portrush/Portstewart areas. Following the introduction of the new Metro network in February 2005, Translink is now developing Metro Phase 2, which will extend Metro-type services to areas outside Greater Belfast.</p>

Where a demand to cross a particular road has been highlighted, Roads Service may carry out an assessment to ascertain whether the location may qualify for a pedestrian crossing. The assessment procedure takes into account the demand to cross the road, together with the difficulty crossing the road. Vulnerable road users are given extra weighting in the assessment. Pedestrian refuges may be provided at sites that do not qualify for a pedestrian crossing facility.</p>

 From 1 April 2007 Northern Ireland&#146;s water and sewerage services will be provided by a Government-owned company, Northern Ireland Water Limited (NIWL). Self-financing arrangements will be introduced which will result in the full costs incurred in providing water and sewerage services being recovered from charges to customers. The comprehensive water and sewerage charging regime to be introduced will involve the general introduction of unmeasured domestic water and sewerage charges with measured charges (i.e. metering) being introduced for all new properties and new connections. Meters will also be offered to pensioner households. In the non-domestic sector, water charges will be extended and sewerage charges introduced for all non-domestic customers.</p>

There will also be a low-income protection scheme in the form of an affordability tariff which will involve capping charges for eligible customers at an affordable level. The affordability tariff will ensure that eligible low-income households spend no more than  3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage charges. As many as 200,000 households (30 per cent. of all households) in Northern Ireland who presently qualify for rate rebate, housing benefit or the new Northern Ireland rate relief scheme should benefit from this scheme. The affordability tariff will also extend to all 16 to 17-year-old householders and to children leaving care up to the age of 21. For those on low incomes, the affordability tariff will mean that no-one will pay more than &#163;180 regardless of the value of the property in which they live. On 1 June 2006 the Government published draft legislation, entitled The Water and Sewerage Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, which will introduce important changes to the way water and sewerage services are delivered in Northern Ireland. Among other things the Draft Order sets out a framework for the levying of charges for water and sewerage services.</p>
