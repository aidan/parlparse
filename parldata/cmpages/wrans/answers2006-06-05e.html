is a sport whose primary purpose is to provide a betting product. In

facilities for gambling without authorisation. It would be
inappropriate for the Gambling Commission to duplicate these provisions
through the introduction of licence
conditions.</p><p><a name="06060620000175">The

so.</p><p><a name="06060620000176"><b><a name="06060620000592">Mr.

of strychnine for mole control is controlled under the Biocidal
Products Directive administered in the UK by the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) as the UK Competent
Authority.</p><p><a name="06060646000229">This
Biocidal Products Directive aims to harmonise controls for marketing
and use of biocidal products across Europe, while ensuring a high level
of protection for human health and the environment. This includes the
assessment of the active substances (such as strychnine) in biocidal
products, followed by the authorisation of individual products
containing those substances. These risks assessments should be based on
scientific data packages provided by industry or other interested
parties.</p><p><a name="06060646000230">Industry did
not submit any such data to support the continued marketing and use of
strychnine, and so under the requirements of the directive, strychnine
must be removed from the market by 1 September
2006.</p><p><a name="06060646000231">However, the
directive does allow member states, on behalf of applicants, to apply
for a temporary exemption for substances considered to have
&#145;essential use&#146; in those member states. The HSE has
received an application for the &#145;essential use&#146; of
strychnine to control moles from the British Pest Control Association
(BPCA) and will forward this to the European Commission for
consideration.</p><p><a name="06060646000232">If this
application is successful, it will allow strychnine to continue to be
used until 14 May 2010. However, in the meantime, industry will need to
develop alternative methods for controlling moles in the
future.</p><p><a name="06060646000233">On research
into alternatives to strychnine, the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published in 2004 a report produced by the
Central Science Laboratory which reviewed the range of mole control
methods that exist across the EU. The report is available on

Defra website:

currently under review and our revised strategy will put forward a
range of measures to build on recent improvements in
recycling.</p><p><a name="06060646000238">Defra has
set national targets to increase household waste recycling to 25 per
cent. by 2005-06, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. The
amount of household waste which is recycled has doubled in the last 4
years and is continuing to
rise.</p><p><a name="06060646000239">Local
authorities are working hard to improve their performance in household
waste recycling, however, Defra is proposing more targeted intervention
and engagement with the poorest performers. Those local authorities
with the lowest recycling rates in England have had their targets for
2007-08 raised from 18 per cent. to 20 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06060646000240">The Waste
Minimisation and Recycling Fund and its successor (the Waste
Performance and Efficiency Grant) have provided funding totalling
&#163;294 million over the three years to 2005-06 for specific
projects to expand recycling operations. Through the Private Finance
Initiative (PFI), credits worth &#163;355 million have been made
available over the same period as an extra source of funding, with a
further &#163;535 million available in 2006-07 and
2007-08.</p><p><a name="06060646000241">The Business
Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme has been developed to

resource efficiency and waste projects that will benefit business,

recycling.</p><p><a name="06060646000242">On
a national basis, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is
working to promote sustainable waste management by creating stable and

competitive scheme that has been very popular and successful in the

usually in proportion to the amount of grant being
requested.</p><p><a name="06060646000250">My
Department recognises that costs to applicants can be significant.
Indeed, the costs of preparing a project and its supporting
documentation (which may include feasibility studies, technical
development work and preparation of a detailed business case), are
themselves eligible for funding. Development costs will not be funded

however; and it is clear throughout the guidance that work is
undertaken at the applicant's own

the minimisation and recycling of waste since the publication of the
&#147;Waste Strategy for England and Wales 2000&#148;, which sets
out Government's strategy for sustainable waste management.</p><p><a name="06060646000613">Lesser amounts of most kinds of
waste are being landfilled, and recycling and composting of household
waste has doubled in the last four years. The latest figures show that
local authorities in England recycled 22.9 per cent. of household waste
in 2004-05 compared to 10.3 per cent. in 2001-02. More packaging waste
is being recovered and recycled, rising from 33 per cent. to 56 per
cent. between 1998 and 2004. The re-use and recycling of industrial and
commercial waste has also increased, together with construction and
demolition
waste.</p><p><a name="06060646000614">However, we
still have much more to do. In 2000, our waste strategy set targets to
recycle or compost at least 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010 and
33 per cent. by 2015. The Government have provided local authorities
with greater levels of funding to enable them to meet their targets,
and the majority of local authorities are working hard to improve their
performance. Defra is proposing more targeted intervention and
engagement with the poorest performers, and those local authorities
with the lowest recycling rates in England have had their targets for
2007-08 raised from 18 per cent. to 20 per cent.</p><p><a name="06060646000615">A number of programmes
including the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund and its successor
the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant, the Business Resource
Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme, and the Waste and Resources
Action Programme (WRAP) have been set up to support and increase waste
recycling and provide efficient markets for recycled
materials.</p><p><a name="06060646000616">A review
of the Government's waste strategy is currently underway. The new
strategy will support the use of waste as a resource. It will also
focus on waste prevention and resource efficiency, the development of a
recycling culture, and a more joined up approach across waste
streams&#151;particularly for business and local authority
waste.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060646000040">Water</h3><p><a name="06060646000617"><b><a name="06060646001915">Mr.

range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs
and help and support to find
work.</p><p><a name="06060646001012">Additional help
is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New deal 50
plus, which is a voluntary programme, provides people with advice and
guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help
through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April
2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000
older workers into employment. Once in work, new deal 50 plus customers
can claim a Training Grant of up to &#163;1,500 for training of which
up to &#163;300 can be used for life-long
learning.</p><p><a name="06060646001013">People aged
50 and over are also eligible for help from new deal 25 plus. People
who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and
who have not previously participated on new deal 25 plus, are already
required to attend the Gateway stage of the new deal 25 plus programme.
This is a period of up to 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 193W</b><br>4 months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to

Period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over.
The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people
return to work.</p><p><a name="06060646001014">Since
April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the new
deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for
18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more
extensive help back to work. Interim pilot data has yielded positive
results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be
commencing a phased national
rollout.</p><p><a name="06060646001015">New deal 50
plus is a voluntary programme for those who have been claiming
benefits, including those claiming the pension credit, for six months.
However, our Green Paper also announced our intention to pilot
mandatory participation in new deal 50 plus activities for people aged
50-59 who have been claiming JSA for six months. This will involve
attendance at work-focused interviews and the development of action
plans to help participants move into employment. Pilot locations have
not yet been
confirmed.</p><p><a name="06060646001016">Since
October 2004, pension credit has been a qualifying benefit for the
majority of Jobcentre Plus programmes. This enables people aged 60 and
over who are claiming pension credit to take advantage of the wide
range of back to work help
available.</p><p><a name="06060646001017">In spring
2005 there were three million people claiming incapacity benefits in
Great Britain, of which 1.3 million were aged 50 or over. As nearly
half of all benefit claimants aged 50 or over are on IB, they will be
able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work
service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008.
Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal
advisers and direct access to a &#145;Choices Package&#146; of
employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay.
Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available
on a voluntary
basis.</p><p><a name="06060646001018">Our Age
Positive Campaign works with employers and others to promote the
business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age
in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the
&#145;Be Ready&#146; national information campaign to raise
employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and
retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of
older workers in advance of age legislation due in October
2006.</p><p><a name="06060646001019">The number of
people working past State Pension Age has been increasing and now
stands at over one million. We have introduced more attractive state
pension deferral options with a higher rate of increment (10.4 per
cent.) and the option of taking a lump sum instead of a weekly increase
if individuals defer taking their pension for 12 months or

the Deputy Prime Minister does not normally provide funding directly to
any Urban Regeneration Company (URC). Instead, funding is provided by
the partners in each URC; this covers, separately, revenue and capital
costs. The usual partners of a URC comprise the local Regional
Development Agency (RDA), the local authority or authorities, and
English Partnerships (EP). The table shows the estimated revenue
funding provided to the individual URCs for the latest financial year,
2005-06. Allocations for previous years were of a similar order for
each URC. Note that URCs have been created at different times over the
past seven
years.</p><p><a name="06060646001590">Information on
funding allocations for capital projects in each URC is not held

directly to the URCs; rather, expenditure on projects is incurred by
the partners themselves, on the basis of strategies agreed with the
URCs.</p><p><a name="06060646001591">Exceptionally,
and in addition to the above quoted data, ODPM does provide special
direct funding to the URC in Peterborough, under the Growth Areas

programme; this is done to support the work that these two companies
are carrying out under these initiatives, in addition to their standard
URC regeneration
activities.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="5"><i> Revenue

India in its efforts to combat caste discrimination and social
exclusion in all its forms. Dalits (also known as Scheduled Castes),
like other minorities, have a right to be included in all the
mainstream Government programmes that DFID supports. DFID does not
support particular programmes aimed at minority communities but
promotes social inclusion in all its programmes.</p><p><a name="06060657000089">India's constitution safeguards
the rights of all its citizens and the Government of India's policies
provide the necessary framework to tackle discrimination. The challenge
is to implement these policies effectively and for this reason DFID is
engaging with the Government of India and other development partners to
help to implement their commitments.</p><p><a name="06060657000090">For example, in education, DFID
supports India's National Programme for achieving universal primary
education (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan&#151;SSA). One of the objectives of
this programme, which was launched in September 2004, was to narrow the
gaps that existed between the enrolment of Scheduled Caste and other
children.</p><p><a name="06060657000091">The recent
mid term review of SSA indicates that the programme has been effective
in increasing the enrolment of Scheduled Caste children into mainstream
education. The proportion of Scheduled Caste children in the school
population has increased from 19 per cent. in 2003 to 21.3 per cent. in
2005. This means that millions of Dalit children are now in schools
alongside other children and the proportion of Dalit children in
mainstream government schools now exceeds the proportion of Dalit
children in the general population. This success has been achieved
through a range of strategies that have helped to tackle discrimination
at all levels.</p><p><a name="06060657000092">Special efforts are needed to
ensure that Dalits are able to exercise their rights to access
mainstream services. DFID is providing &#163;75 million over five
years to UNICEF in India to help reduce child mortality to tackle
social exclusion in health and education services. Under this
partnership, UNICEF has signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Indian Institute of Dalit Studies. This will increase understanding of
how to tackle the constraints and barriers that Dalits face in
accessing services.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060657000008">Maldives</h3><p><a name="06060657000093"><b><a name="06060657001384">Mr.

of households. Some households are, however, not able to receive
broadband services, or only at very low speeds, due to local

because of the poor quality of networks.</p><p><a name="06060657000105">The broadband market is

benefits from broadband. The CD-ROM was sent to parish councils, rural
community councils, regional development agencies, devolved
administrations, intermediary organisations and other interested

scheme provides protection to UK consumers from cold calling by foreign
companies if the calls are made on behalf of the UK companies and the
consumer has previously notified the caller that they do not wish to
receive such calls or has been registered with the TPS for at least 28
days. Therefore, those making cold calls are legally required not to
call a number that has registered on the TPS list. The Information
Commissioner has responsibility for the enforcement of the TPS scheme
and considers complaints about breaches. However, cold calls from
non-UK companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the

are ensuring that where it makes sense to carry out an activity at 9
regional sites as opposed to 47 individual sites, we will do so. A
number of the roles presently carried out at the Greater Merseyside LSC
will transfer to the North West Regional Centre, but will continue to

conscription no longer exists, it is unlikely that anybody who has an
existing conscientious objection to military service would join the
armed forces. Those who develop a genuine conscientious objection
during service in the armed forces are able to follow well established
procedures for their service to be terminated, and this includes an
independent appeals procedure in any case where an application has been
rejected. Information about the procedures is readily

[74003]</p><p><a name="0606078000053"><b><a name="0606078001897">Joan
Ryan:</b> Since humans can be exposed to low levels of
chemicals in their diet, or in their environment, over a significant
proportion of their lifespan, studies to evaluate lifetime exposure are
conducted in animals to ascertain the potential for the chemical to
cause cancer. The objective of carcinogenicity studies is to identify
the potential of test materials to cause tumours in animals and to
assess the relevant risk in humans. Carcinogenicity studies are time
consuming and resource intensive and are only performed when potential
or actual human exposure warrants the need for this information to be
generated. Our implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986 ensures that this is the case, and that the studies that are
undertaken avoid unnecessary animal use, do not cause unnecessary
suffering, and provide data of a sufficiently high quality to inform
risk assessments and regulatory
decisions.</p><p><a name="0606078000054">We make
every effort to keep abreast of developments in this and other areas
relevant to the use of animals under the 1986 Act. For example, issues
relating to the use of animals for carcinogenicity studies fall within
the broader remit of the Inter-departmental Group on the 3Rs, which the
Home Office leads and membership of which includes relevant United
Kingdom regulators. We are informed of work on validation within Europe
through the United Kingdom representative to the Scientific Advisory
Committee to the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative
Methods (ECVAM). In addition, our professional inspectorate maintains
awareness of developments taking place within United Kingdom research
laboratories, and of relevant
publications.</p><p><a name="0606078000055">In this
latter context, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have
recently published a report entitled &#147;Creative
Accounting&#148; looking at carcinogenicity studies. We have referred
the technical issues contained in the PETA report to the Committee on
Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the
Environment (COC) for scientific evaluation. We will consider any
issues relevant to the implementation of the 1986 Act when we have
received the Committee&#146;s
advice.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606078000003">Antisocial

commencement, 1 April 1999 to 31 May 2000, Antisocial Behaviour Order
(ASBO) data were collected on aggregate numbers only by police force
area. Tables A-H give the number of ASBOs issued to 10 to17-year-olds
at all courts, as notified to the Home Office, from 1 June 2000 to 30
September 2005 (latest available), by individual age and the local
authority area in which prohibitions have been imposed. Data collated
centrally for statistical purposes does not identify the type of
antisocial behaviour that led to the issuing of an ASBO.</p><p><a name="0606078000065">ASBO breach data only cover
breach proceedings where there has been a conviction. These data are
available at criminal justice system area level onlyand are
currently available from 1 June 2000 to31 December 2003 for
ASBOs issued since 1 June 2000. During this period, of the 392 persons
aged 10 to 17 convicted for breaching their ASBO, on one or more
occasions, 179 received a custodial sentence, of which 30 were for
breach of ASBO alone. Within the same period and, as notified to the
Home Office, no notification was received of the breach of an ASBO made
at the same time as a parenting order.</p><p><a name="0606078000066">The minimum duration of an ASBO
is two years but there is no maximum period. It is for the court to
decide the duration of the order depending on the severity of their
anti-social behaviour. The latest published figures up to September
2005 show that62 per cent of anti- social behaviour orders
issued to young people aged 10 to 17 were for a period of less than
three years. On 20 December 2005 we announced that we would put on a

Ryan:</b> The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has issued 8.9
million Disclosures since its launch in March 2002 to 31 March 2006. In
that time, there have been 2,273 occasions where Disclosure applicant
details were matched by the CRB to a person with the same or very
similar details who has a criminal record and, where the details had
been challenged by the applicant, their dispute was subsequently
upheld.</p><p><a name="0606078000203">These cases are
clearly regrettable, but represent a very small proportion of
cases&#151;0.025 per cent. of the total number of Disclosures issued.
The CRB is acutely aware of the human consequences of making an
incorrect matching decision and does not do so
lightly.</p><p><a name="0606078000204">However, the
CRB must err on the side of caution when an individual has the same or
very similar personal details to those of someone who has a criminal
record. This is because it is better to be safe than run the risk of
letting an inappropriate person
through.</p><p><a name="0606078000205">When a
Disclosure is disputed it is resolved by asking the applicant to have
their fingerprints taken at a local police station to help either
confirm or overturn the original matching
decision.</p><p><a name="0606078000206">The CRB will
always apologise if the original matching decision is later found to be
incorrect. In the event of a dispute the CRB notifies the prospective
employer who would be aware of the CRB's Code of Practice that asks
them not to take any precipitative action and defer any employment
decision until the dispute is resolved. When a Disclosure is disputed
the CRB will inform all parties that this is the case, including the
employer. Where the information contained in the Disclosure is found
not to relate to the applicant, a fresh Disclosure will be issued free
of charge to both the applicant and the Registered Body. 90 per cent.
of disputes are resolved within 21
days.</p><p><a name="0606078000207">A public
consultation exercise was conducted in October 2003 about making
greater use of fingerprinting at an earlier stage in the application
process and to aid the matching and decision-making procedures. The
overwhelming response was not in favour of such a
measure.</p><p><a name="0606078000208">It is worth
noting that under the previous police checking arrangements,
individuals were not able to see the criminal records information
disclosed about them. The information would have been passed only to
the prospective employer and not to the job applicant and the
prospective employer would have had no obligation to pass on the
contents of the information to the
individual.</p><p><a name="0606078000209"><b><a name="0606078001924">Mrs.

Valuable work is undertaken with prisoners throughout their sentence

discharging prison. However, a new method of evaluation is now being
tested within NOMS which may facilitate a more sophisticated analysis
of the impact of different regimes. If this methodology proves

Howells:</b> According to the United Nations Office on drugs
and crime figures, 2004-05 saw a 21 per cent. reduction in the level of
opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. However, production decreased
by only 2.4 per cent. as improved weather conditions and less disease
resulted in higher yields per hectare. This was particularly the case
in Helmand Province, where opium production increased despite a 10 per
cent. fall in the area under
cultivation.</p><p><a name="06060712000064">It would
be speculation to draw a link between an increase in opium production
in 2004-05 and the security situation in Helmand. However, it is clear
that the drugs trade flourishes in a lawless environment.It
also contributes to the perpetuation of that environment and hinders
the reconstruction
process.</p><p><a name="06060712000065">That is why
the UK is supporting the Government of Afghanistan to implement its
National Drug Control Strategy, including by co-ordinating
international assistance designed to target the trafficker and the
trade, strengthen and diversify legal rural livelihoods, build
effective counter narcotics institutions and reduce domestic demand.
More broadly, our wider military and civilian engagement in Helmand
Province will help to create a more secure environment and develop

nationality or ethnic or national origins, and the Disability

in the 2004 draft Mental Health Bill which we are not intending to take
forward in the proposed Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 1983. Our

priorities in terms of modernising mental health legislation. Some of

forward through other
means.</p><p><a name="06060756001223">For
example, we are using our programme on risk management to promote the
importance of care planning and we intend to use the Code of Practice
to provide guidance on many issues, such as the importance of
information sharing between agencies involved in a patient's care. We
may also use other legislative vehicles to introduce some of the
changes previously planned. For example, we are currently considering
the possibility of using other legislation to provide a second tier
appellate structure allowing for appeals to be heard within the
tribunal system but this will not be specific to mental health, and to
improve the monitoring functions of the Mental Health Act Commission.
We will also be exploring the scope for clarifying the safeguards for
children, if necessary through the amendment of existing regulations
and
guidance.</p><p><a name="06060756001224">In
terms of the changes we are planning to make to the 1983 Act, these may
involve some new powers to make secondary legislation. In particular,
we are intending to improve patient safeguards by increasing the speed
and frequency of the Mental Health Review Tribunal's consideration of
cases for all civil patients treated under the Act, by taking an order

fluoride to drinking water to a level of one part per million is on the
incidence of dental fluorosis. In 2003, the independent expert advisory
committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the
environment (COT), issued a report "Fluorine in the 1997 Total Diet
Study", which noted that fluoride intakes of formula-fed infants may
exceed the 'no observed adverse effect level' for dental fluorosis.
However, COT concluded that infants are at lesser risk of dental
fluorosis than older children because the critical time for development
of aesthetically significant dental fluorosis is during formation of
the permanent teeth at age three to four. COT went on to recommend that
more research is needed to determine the impact of the cosmetic effect
of dental fluorosis on the affected individual and on any possible
long-term health outcomes in people affected by dental
fluorosis.</p><p><a name="06060756001466">The

in disease control but preventive vaccination of poultry is not the
most effective defence. At UK-level, a plan is in place for a possible
vaccination programme for zoo birds for conservation purposes, based on
veterinary risk assessment, and 2.3 million doses of vaccine have been

Northern Ireland &#147;Tackling Violence at Home&#148; was launched
in October 2005. The strategy is aimed at providing protection and
support to all victims of domestic violence, irrespective of gender or
sexual orientation. All victims can seek information and advice through
the free-phone Domestic Violence Helpline and male victims are
sign-posted to organisations that provide services for men, such as the
Men&#146;s Advisory Project, Men-to-Men or the Rainbow Project. Any
victim of a domestic assault can seek protection from the police who
will investigate, arrest the alleged abuser if power exists and
prosecute where there is evidence of a crime. Alternatively a victim
can engage a solicitor and apply to a court for a civil order (a
non-molestation order and/or an occupation order) to prevent further
abuse or exclude the abuser from the family home. There are 12
Women&#146;s Aid Refuges for women and children fleeing domestic
violence. There are no refuges in operation specifically for male
victims of domestic violence given the small
numbers involved but men may seek assistance from the Housing Executive
who will offer the full range of homelessness services including
supported or unsupported temporary
accommodation.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060756000118">Domiciliary

Road Service funding has been allocated to (a) bridge strengthening
programmes and (b) road maintenance and resurfacing in each district
council area in Northern Ireland in each of the last five financial
years.</p></ul><a name="06060756006709"><ul><p class="tabletext">I have been
asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief
Executive of Roads
Service.</p></ul><a name="06060756006710"><ul><p class="tabletext">The following
table at Annex 1 shows the total expenditure incurred by Roads Service
on capital (major and minor) road improvement schemes and on
maintenance activities during the period 2000/01-2004/05. Expenditure
details by district council area for 2005/06 are not yet
available.</p></ul><a name="06060756006711"><ul><p class="tabletext">In
providing this information, I should like to emphasise that Roads
Service does not simply apportion its total budget for capital and
maintenance expenditure equally across district council areas. In
particular, major road improvements are prioritised on a country-wide
basis, not on a district council basis, taking account of a broad range
of criteria such as strategic planning policy, traffic flows, number of
accidents, potential travel save times, environmental impact and value
for money. While the actual spend on a major works scheme may be within
one council area, the benefits of such schemes are not confined to the
district council area or constituency in which they are
located.</p></ul><a name="06060756006712"><ul><p class="tabletext">The resources
available for minor capital schemes are allocated to the four Roads
Service Divisions and, in turn, apportioned across district council
areas on a needs-based priority approach using indicators such as
population, weighted road lengths and the number of accidents. -This
ensures, so far as possible, an equitable distribution of funds across
the country. Similarly the resources available for each maintenance
activity (e.g. resurfacing, patching, gully emptying, grass cutting
etc) are apportioned to district council areas using appropriate
indicators of
need.</p></ul><a name="06060756006713"><ul><p class="tabletext">You also asked
for a separate breakdown of funding in relation to bridge strengthening
programmes and roads maintenance and resurfacing. The attached table at
Annex 2 details the information per district council area in the years
2000/01-2004/05. Again, expenditure details by district council area
for 2005/06 are not yet
available.</p></ul><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="6"><i> Annex

contained an error. The answer should have stated that in 14 of the
cases the police do not have a current residential address. The correct
answer in full is as follows. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for
this error.</p><p><a name="06060756005621">On 28
April 2006, 644 people in Northern Ireland were subject to the
notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and in 14 of
these cases the police do not have a current residential address. This
represents a compliance rate of over 97 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06060756005622">In line with the
police service of Northern Ireland's zero tolerance policy on breaches
of the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act, all
offenders who do not comply are pursued and reported to the Public
Prosecution Service with a view to prosecution.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 469W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06060756000187">Sheep-worrying

Cairns:</b> From 1 April 2007 Northern Ireland&#146;s water
and sewerage services will be provided by a Government owned company,
Northern Ireland Water Limited (NIWL). Self-financing arrangements will
be introduced which will result in the full costs incurred in providing
water and sewerage services being recovered from charges to customers.
The comprehensive water and sewerage charging regime to be introduced
will involve the general introduction of unmeasured domestic water and
sewerage charges with measured charges (i.e. metering) being introduced
for all new properties and new connections. Meters will also be offered
to pensioner households. In the non-domestic sector, water charges will
be extended and sewerage charges introduced for all non-domestic
customers.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 486W</b><br><p><a name="06060756006639">All these new
charges will be phased in over three years so NIWL will not be fully
self-financing until 2009-10. There will also be a low-income
protection scheme in the form of an affordability tariff which will
involve capping charges for eligible customers at an affordable level.
The affordability tariff will ensure that eligible low-income
households spend no more than 3 per cent. of their income on
water and sewerage charges. As many as 200,000 households (30 per cent.
of all households) in Northern Ireland who presently qualify for rate
rebate, housing benefit or the new Northern Ireland rate relief scheme
should benefit from this scheme. The affordability tariff will also
extend to all 16 to 17-year-old householders and to children leaving
care up to the age of 21. For those on low incomes, the affordability
tariff will mean that no-one will pay more than &#163;180 regardless
of the value of the property in which they live. On 1 June 2006 the
Government published draft legislation, entitled The Water and Sewerage
Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006,
which will introduce important changes to the way water and sewerage
services are delivered in Northern Ireland. Among other things the
Draft Order sets out a framework for the levying of charges for water
