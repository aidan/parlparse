<a name="51018w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Chess</h3>


<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="51018w01.html_wqn0"><b> Susan Kramer: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on official recognition of chess as a sport.  [15892]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51018w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Chess is not currently recognised as a sport. The unanimous support of all four national Sports Councils and UK Sport is required in order for a sport or its governing body to receive official recognition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The criteria that the Sports Councils use to decide whether an activity should be recognised as a sport are derived from their Royal Charters, and ultimately from the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937. Legal advice has stated that chess does not fall within the meaning of the word &quot;sport&quot; for the purposes of the Royal Charter, or the meaning of &quot;physical training and recreation&quot; in the Act. Recognition of chess would therefore require amendments to the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Sport is now a devolved matter, so a change in the current position would require the unanimous support of both the Devolved Administrations (DAs) and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 822W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Sports Councils, before any progress could be made. It would be necessary to put a case to the DAs and the Sports Councils for legislative change that would include chess, and if necessary other &quot;mind games&quot;, within the criteria for recognition as a sport. The case put forward must be able to convince them that chess provides the same benefits to the public, such as improved health and fitness, as recognised sports, in order to merit equal status and the financial support that comes with it.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51018w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible on behalf of the Cabinet for the arrangements for the annual Remembrance day ceremony at the Cenotaph. As, Minister for Culture I am working with Paul Goggins, Minister for Race Equality in the Home Office, to explore the most appropriate role for the Government in the bicentenary celebrations to mark the abolition of slave trade in 2007.

<a name="stpa_3">Culture Online (COL) is an innovative initiative to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. It brings together cultural organisations with cutting-edge technical providers to create projects that delight adults and children of all ages and backgrounds. Eighteen projects have been commissioned so far. As the programme has developed, COL has attracted an increasing amount of public recognition, awards and nominations. The projects have won three BAFTA Interactives, one Webby, three Newspaper Society awards and an Association of Online Publishers award; 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 827W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
two projects have been nominated for British Interactive Media Association awards. COL was also cited as a best practice case study in the NAO&#039;s &quot;Managing Risks to Improve Public Services&quot; report, published last year.

The actual amounts will vary between soil types and land management practices, and recent evidence suggests that carbon is increasing in some soils.

At the start of the Scheme the participants committed to deliver 3.96 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub>  equivalent (tCO <sub>2</sub> e) in emissions reductions by the end of the Scheme (2006). To date, DPs have exceeded targets, and the Scheme has delivered additional emissions reductions of 5.9 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> e.

The representation indicated the Government&#039;s view that a case has not been made for this departure from national policy and a regionally specific policy was therefore not justified in the RSS.

 Sugar accounted for about 7.5 per cent. of Swaziland&#039;s exports in 2003, about a third of which went to the European Union (EU). Changes to the EU regime, with exports to the EU at a lower price, could lead to a reduction in export earnings since the EU offers a higher price for Swaziland&#039;s sugar than other markets.

<a name="stpa_13">Recent research indicates, however, that if Swaziland implements planned reforms of its sugar industry and secures unlimited access to the EU market through the proposed Southern African Development Community (SADC) Economic Partnership Agreement, then there should be positive impact on production levels, export earnings and employment. This is in contrast to the possible negative impact in most other African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries.

 The established policy of the EU is not to supply arms to Iran. We assess export licence applications on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria and other policies taking into account the prevailing circumstances at the time. We will not issue an export licence if approval would be inconsistent with national embargoes observed by the UK. I refer my hon. Friend to the parliamentary statements made by Douglas Hurd, the then Foreign Secretary, on 1 March 1993 and my hon. Friend Tony Lloyd, the then Minister of State, on 28 September 1998, which set out our approach in respect of Iran. We will not issue licences for the export to Iran of goods or technology on the military or nuclear list, except for goods essential for the safety of civil aircraft and air traffic control systems and certain radioactive substances for medical use. No licences will be approved for any equipment where there is knowledge or reason to suspect that it will go to a military end-user or be used for military purposes. On very rare occasions, and with parliamentary agreement, exceptions are made where denying an export or gift would be against the spirit of the embargo. For example, we did so earlier this year with a small donation of body armour for the anti-narcotics police, who work closely with the UK and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to prevent drugs trafficking.

 Any request from a Member of Parliament to visit a Defence establishment is considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the circumstances of the request.

Members are not required to hold a security clearance when visiting departmental sites; however, the principle of the need to know applies to the protection of, and access to, defence sites and other sensitive Government assets. Visits are at the discretion of Ministers and, where possible, Members are afforded briefings up to the level of RESTRICTED when visiting MOD establishments. This is a facility MOD Ministers have provided to allow MPs a greater insight into defence issues and to allow them better to serve their constituents.

<a name="stpa_65">The national service framework for mental health (1999) and the mental health policy implementation guide on adult acute inpatient care (2002) requires a flexible range of appropriate therapeutic and recreational resources and activities to be available in mental health in-patient settings. The latter requires the creation and maintenance of a therapeutic activity milieu to include evening and weekend activities and opportunities both on and off the ward which may include educational, social, daily living, artistic, recreational and leisure activities. The national minimum standards for general adult services in psychiatric intensive care units and low secure environments (2002) requires all patients to have access to fresh air and secure external space and space for regular exercise with appropriate supervision.

<sup>(20)</sup> The cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for the years 1997 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) for2001 onwards. The codes used are listed:<br>

Malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung&#151;ICD-9 162; ICD-10 C33-C34;<br>

<sup>(21)</sup> Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for lung cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from cancer by site is described in an article published in August 2004.<sup>(23)</sup> <br>

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51018w34.html_spnew2"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Since 1996 the number of workforce jobs has increased by over 2.5 million or 9.2 per cent. These gains have been achieved despite a fall in manufacturing jobs over this period of over 1 million, which accounted for 16 per cent. of total jobs in 1996 and 11.2 per cent. in 2005. The decline in the manufacturing workforce is more than balanced by rises in other sectors. Falling manufacturing employment is a common feature across all advanced economies, with the share of manufacturing employment falling in all G7 countries since 1996 with the exception only of Canada.

 It is open to local authorities and schools to use whichever strategy they feel appropriate to meet the learning needs of a child with dyslexia. The Department commissioned research, published in 2002, into the effectiveness of intervention schemes for children with literacy difficulties. The research included a number of schemes which make reference to children with dyslexia including Reading Intervention (formerly Cumbria Reading with Phonology Project). The successful interventions readily available to schools were listed in a subsequent National Literacy Strategy publication on choosing and implementing interventions for children with significant literacy difficulties, and Reading Intervention was among those listed.

This advice will inform our work to renew the National Literacy Framework for Teaching to ensure that it reflects the most recent and relevant research and evidence for all learners. The review will also inform the work of the new Early Development and Learning Framework which, together with the renewed Literacy Framework, will help ensure that there is a coherent progression path in early literacy for all learners.

 The Department ceased sending publications automatically to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. The service to Northamptonshire was discontinued in October 2004. Our detailed research showed that a significant number of schools wanted greater freedom to choose the publications they wanted, when they wanted them and to be able to order paper copies in the multiples they require. We have given schools this choice by introducing an online ordering system and fortnightly email service, notifying schools of new and important publications. This puts schools in control of what they receive and when they receive it.

The awarding bodies responsible for GCSE and A level qualifications have assured the regulators that they followed the code of practice during the 2005 summer exam series. No data is available on the total number of markers who were not current or former teachers, though the number is believed to be very small, and any such markers would have received appropriate training and have their performance monitored.

<i>[holding answer 13 October 2005]:</i> The Department offers incentives to schools to achieve excellence in a range of ways. Participation in the specialist schools programme rewards schools for reaching and maintaining rigorous standards. This year we have offered additional opportunities for high-performing specialist schools to take on leading roles. Other examples of how schools are recognised for their excellence include the National Healthy School Programme, which recognises schools that meet standards in four key areas supporting children&#039;s health and learning, and Artsmark, which recognises, promotes and disseminates good practice in arts education provision. The value added indicator in the Achievement and Attainment tables is also an important way of recognising the progress that pupils have made between key stages.

 The Government&#039;s vision for all schools to provide a core offer of extended services is a challenging one and our success will depend upon effective partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors. The National Remodelling Team, through its cultural change programme, is encouraging schools and local authorities to work with existing and new providers in the voluntary and private sectors and is offering support to help them do so. This close working will provide a clear understanding of the role of such organisations in providing extended services at the local and national level. The monitoring strategy we are developing with the NRT will also look at the involvement of the private and voluntary sector in developing extended services.

For primary schools the funding will provide continuing support for initial and existing teacher training as well as training for support staff. To date we have trained 1,200 new primary teachers with a specialism in languages. Next month we will publish in hard copy and online our Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages, which sets out learning objectives for the four years of Key Stage 2. It will be supported by training, guidance and a planning tool.

<p>
<a name="51018w39.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">The funding will support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11&#150;18 year olds, including alternative qualifications and vocational options at Key Stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies. We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications.

<p>
<a name="51018w39.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">The funding will also allow language colleges to extend the role they play in supporting local primary and secondary schools in delivering language programmes. Last month the new languages recognition scheme, the Languages Ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is available in eight languages. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date more than 250 centres&#151;including Local Authorities and Specialist Language Colleges&#151;have registered to take part in the scheme.

 The decision to make languages at Key Stage 4 an entitlement subject from September 2004 was taken following national consultation on the 14&#150;19 &#039;extending opportunities, raising standards&#039; Green Paper in 2002. Since that date, no further research has been commissioned by the Department. However, research undertaken by CILT&#151;The National Centre for Languages in 2004 showed that 30 per cent. of state schools maintained languages as a compulsory subject at age 14, in addition to the 224 Specialist Language Colleges where languages are a compulsory subject.

 Qualifications relating to food preparation and cooking are developed in response to employers needs, and at this point most employers do not want nutrition as a mandatory element, although such a unit is currently available as an option. However, our recent work on improving school meals has shown that it is essential that all school catering staff have the training they need to be able to provide healthy meals for school children. That is why we worked with People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality industry) and the Food Standards Agency to develop a level 1 vocationally related qualification in providing a healthier school meals service. The aim of the VRQ is to give school cooks and caterers the basic knowledge and skills to deliver a healthier meals service. It has been specifically designed for staff involved in the preparation and service of school meals. It will enable school caterers to improve pupil nutritional intake from all food provided by the school meals service and know how to market and promote healthier choices to pupils.

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="51018w40.html_spnew5"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Devolved formula capital is allocated by national formula to all maintained schools in England so that they can invest in their local priorities. This year, a typical primary school receives over &#163;25,000 and a typical secondary school receives over &#163;87,000. By 2007&#150;08, these amounts increase to &#163;34,000 and &#163;113,000 respectively. Guidance on this funding allows schools to roll over this funding for up to three years to enable larger projects to be funded. I do not intend to extend this roll-over period. We should not deliver money too far ahead of use. Where schools have priority needs which exceed their three year allocations, they should approach their local authority for additional funding from the capital of over &#163;2 billion each year which we provide. In these times of high construction inflation, investment should be made as early as possible. This will also mean that children will benefit as early as possible from the investment.

The starting point for this is the evidence provided in the school&#039;s self evaluation form.

 Capital funding is provided to local authorities and schools through formulaic programmes targeted to need, so that they can address local priorities.

However, based on the mortality assumptions adopted by the Government Actuary for the 2001 actuarial review of the Teachers&#039; Pension Scheme, the life expectancy of a male teacher retiring at a) age 60 is 25 years and b) age 65 it is 20 years. For female teachers, the corresponding figures are 28 years at age 60 and 23 years at age 65.

The EU agreed on 14 October that measures should be taken to reduce the risk of avian influenza being transmitted from wild birds to poultry and to ensure their early detection systems are effective. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is considering with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) what further action may be necessary to implement these requirements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w44.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_148">DARD has put in place a range of precautionary measures to address the risk of avian influenza entering Northern Ireland and to stop it spreading. Advice regarding biosecurity has recently been re-issued to the poultry industry and is available on the DARD website. An avian influenza survey is being carried out this autumn for the third year in succession on certain types of poultry, and wild bird surveillance is also being 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 984W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
undertaken, with the support of the Environment and Heritage Service and other non-Government organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w44.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_149">There is close co-operation between relevant Departments to ensure a joined-up approach to the threat of avian influenza including in respect of the implications for public health. Officials are also working closely with their counterparts from the Department of Agriculture and Food in the Republic of Ireland in relation to avian influenza, which is of mutual interest in the context of the island of Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w44.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_150">DARD has a contingency plan in place, which has been approved by the EU, to ensure that any outbreak of avian influenza is dealt with quickly and effectively. This plan is continually being reviewed and updated, and has been tested on two occasions in recent weeks.

<sup>(82)</sup> Figures are provisional.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. MRSA patient episodes &#039;(MRSA PE) is defined as the total number of patients from whom blood cultureset(s) collected during the quarter grew MRS A. If repeat specimens were collected from a single patient, and the patient was considered to have had two episodes of bacteraemia, then they should be counted as two patients. As an arbitrary measure, if positive blood culture sets are collected more than 14 days apart, they should be considered as reflecting different episodes.<br>

2. Please note that it is not possible to state how many of these patients with MRS A positive blood cultures acquired their infection in hospital. Some will have been acquired in hospital but others will have acquired infection before admission to hospital, either in the community, or in another healthcare institution.<br>

3. Reports of patient episodes from a Trust may relate to patients who became infected in, and were reported by, another Trust. Patients whose infections were acquired in one hospital, and were subsequently transferred to another hospital, either within the same Trust or to another Trust, may have been counted more than once.<br>

4. Many confounding factors will influence numbers within Trusts. For instance, Trusts with different clinical mixes and specialties will have different numbers of patients at high risk of MRSA infections. For example, a hospital with a specialised renal unit would treat high numbers of patients who are at increased risk of infection and re-infection.<br>

 The Warm Homes Scheme is targeted to assist the most vulnerable members of our society in fuel poverty.

<p><a name="st_250"><a name="51018w49.html_spnew8"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The fee that is payable to the magistrates court upon lodging an appeal, under schedule 6 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980, is &#163;23.50 inclusive. I do not believe that this is prohibitively high. Occasionally, additional costs may be awarded against an appellant at the magistrate&#039;s discretion if an appeal is considered vexatious or frivolous. The advice of the Magistrates Association and the Justices Clerks Society is that the awarding of costs for a licensing appeal should be an exception and not a rule. We would therefore not expect residents who are appealing to be penalised.

 The Guidance issued by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, to licensing authorities, under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003, makes it clear that the cumulative impact of licensed premises on the promotion of the licensing objectives is a proper matter for a licensing authority to consider in developing its licensing policy statement. The guidance sets out how the licensing authority can consider adopting a special policy on cumulative impact. It also states that the effect of such a policy is to create a rebuttable presumption that applications for new premises licences or club premises certificates or material variations (which could include longer opening hours) will normally be refused, if relevant representations to that effect are received. The onus would be on the applicant to demonstrate that the operation of the premises involved will not add to the cumulative impact already being experienced.
