Turkey, the UK and the US. The aim of the exercise was to practise multi-battery, multi-national firing, training and tactics, in conjunction with close air support, and I understand that the exercise succeeded in its objectives. The total cost of the exercise is not held centrally by NATO but the cost of the UK participation was &#163;623,000, excluding the cost of ammunition and spares consumed during the exercise as these costs are not separately identified.

<a name="90512w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Three infantry exercises were carried out in France during this period. Of the first two, Liberty Bell took place between 11 and 25 July 1997, involved 452 personnel, and cost &#163;169,000; Fraternal Front took place between 5 and 19 September 1997, involved 122 personnel and cost &#163;43,000. The exercises were designed to test core infantry skills and the ability to plan and execute an overseas exercise. I understand that the exercises succeeded in their aims. The third exercise, Team Spirit, took place between 7 and 23 November 1997, involved 68 personnel from the Royal Marines and the French 9th Maritime Infantry Division, and cost &#163;5,934. The exercise was designed to enable the participating units to practise small-scale military alliance operations. I understand that this exercise also succeeded in its aim. All of the above costs exclude the costs of ammunition and spares consumed during the exercise as these costs are not separately identified.

 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1999]:</i> In August 1997, Headquarters Northern Ireland announced that, as a matter of policy, troops operating in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) would wear regimental headdress instead of helmets, but that local commanders had the discretion to authorise the wearing of helmets for the personal protection of soldiers under their command, taking into account the threat and local operational circumstances. The decisions taken by local commanders as to when they have ordered the wearing of helmets are not held.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department of Trade and Industry share a Public Service Agreement target to maintain the United Kingdom as the prime location in Europe for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Figures for the number of jobs secured from FDI are recorded by the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB), which is jointly run by the two departments. The figures, which cover both jobs safeguarded and new jobs created, are based on information provided by companies at the time of the announcement of the decision to invest and are released annually. The IBB recorded 1,057,700 jobs created or safeguarded by FDI between 1979 and 1998.

We also intend that this legislation should provide enabling powers for energy saving obligations in the gas and electricity industries.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 1999]:</i> We are committed to fostering a workplace culture which recognises the importance of family friendly employment policies, including parental leave, for both men and women in reconciling their work and family commitments. For the purposes of the regulatory impact assessment published with the Employment Relations Bill, we assumed that about 82,000 people would take parental leave each year, consisting of 6,000 men and 76,000 women. Over a five year period, this is equivalent to about 2 per cent. of eligible fathers and about 35 per cent. of eligible mothers.

 The successful contractors for the research have proposed a methodology for the ecological studies and this will be reviewed by the scientific steering committee. Fieldwork carried out this year will further help the contractors and steering committee to refine the methods to be used for subsequent years. It is envisaged that a provisional methodology will be made publicly available by the contractors and the steering committee soon after the steering group has met in early June. The final agreed methodology will be made available in the Autumn following the results of the first year's studies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proportion of the proposed climate change levy he plans to redirect to develop energy efficiency measures with particular emphasis on small to medium sized enterprises; and what plans he has to extend the option for negotiating tradeable permits.  [83704]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w04.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 In his Budget Statement on 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 173-190, the Chancellor announced as part of the climate change levy &#163;50 million per annum package to fund schemes aimed at promoting energy efficiency directly including energy efficiency audits/advice, mechanisms to promote low carbon technologies, and additional support for renewable sources of energy. Further details will be set out in the draft UK climate change programme later this year.
<P>

<a name="90512w04.htm_para3">The Government recognise that SMEs are a key part of the economy with special needs. They have already therefore designed specific schemes and programmes to help them save energy and money and, importantly from our point of view, do their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. My Department's Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme provides independent advice and information on energy efficiency and support for RD&D projects. Non-domestic energy users including SMEs are an important target audience for the programme. The Department also funds grant schemes specifically for SMEs delivered through the Energy Saving Trust. The experience gained from the Energy Efficiency Best practice programme will provide a good basis for developing further energy efficiency schemes as part of the &#163;50 million per annum package.




<P>
<P><I>12 May 1999 : Column: 154</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90512w04.htm_para4">On tradeable carbon permits, the Government fully recognise the potential benefits of a carbon emissions trading scheme, particularly in allowing business to deliver greenhouse gas reductions in a cost effective way, and in preparing business and the City for the international emissions trading scheme to be established under the Kyoto Protocol. We also see carbon emissions trading as potentially having a complementary role alongside the climate change levy. We are therefore taking forward the recommendation made by Lord Marshall in his report on "Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy", by working with the CBI and ACBE (the Government's Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment) to develop a pilot trading scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the long-term objectives of the proposed climate change levy; and what assessment he has made of the effect the climate change levy will have on non-intensive energy users.  [83705]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w04.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The climate change levy is intended to make a significant contribution to meeting our greenhouse gas targets--an estimated 1.5 million tonnes of carbon per annum. It is one of a number of measures being developed as part of a substantial package to help the UK achieve its climate change objectives and enable the Government to continue to play a leading role in international efforts to tackle climate change.
<P>

<a name="90512w04.htm_para5">The climate change levy has been designed to be revenue neutral across the business economy as a whole. Non-intensive energy users will be expected to pay the full rate of climate change levy but, like all sectors of business, they will receive a reduction of 0.5 percentage points in their National Insurance Contributions. In line with the recommendations made by Lord Marshall in his report on "Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy", the Government intend to retain an incentive for all users to save energy at the margin. Firms which are non-intensive users of energy but which are labour intensive will tend to be net gainers from the budget package. The accompanying cut in employer National Insurance contributions will encourage employment opportunities, while the additional support for energy efficiency measures will help stimulate the development of new technologies.
<P>

<a name="90512w04.htm_para6">The latest forecasts from the Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre estimate that average temperatures will rise by up to 3.5 per cent. by the end of the next century. As part of the international effort to tackle climate change, the UK has signed up to a legally binding target of 12.5 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels by 2008-12. The Government propose to go further than this and have set a domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse gas--by 2010.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to restrict the use of the criminal conviction certificate to employment purposes; and if he will make a statement on the steps that he is taking to ensure that the availability of criminal conviction certificates will not increase recidivism.  [83795]
<P>

<P>
<a name="90512w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Criminal conviction certificates will be available to individuals only on application and it will be for the individual concerned to decide to whom to provide the information contained in them. Criminal conviction certificates will give details only of unspent convictions. This is information which applicants can be asked to disclose at the moment. The criminal conviction certificate will allow employers to be sure that the information they have been given is full and accurate. We shall be consulting about guidance on the use of the certificates.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if <i>(a)</i> the Security Service has taken over the responsibility of promoting the risk analysis methodology CRAMM from the CCTA and <i>(b)</i> personal data are required to be processed in order to promote the software; and if he will make a statement on how his Department will apply to provisions of the Data Protection Acts to such processing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In 1997, the Security Service took over the management of CRAMM, but the promotion and marketing of the associated software package was undertaken by commercial organisations on its behalf. The Security Service is currently engaged in the transfer of the management responsibilities too, under Government licence, to a commercial consortium. Consequently, the Security Service holds no personal data in connection with the promotion of CRAMM.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received from the Data Protection Registrar <i>(a)</i> on the application of Sections 28 and 29 of the Data Protection Act 1998 to the Security Service and <i>(b)</i> on provisions in Clauses 11 and 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Bill.  [83791]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w05.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Data Protection Registrar wrote to me, in February this year, concerning the application of the Data Protection Act 1998 to the security and intelligence agencies when it comes into force. I replied that this was still under consideration and that no decision had been made. I said the same to my hon. Friend in my letter of 31 March. This remains the position although useful discussions between the Registrar's officials and mine have taken place.
<P>

<a name="90512w05.htm_para3">On <i>(b)</i>, the Data Protection Registrar has been consulted about clauses 11 and 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Bill. In the light of discussions with her Office, some additional safeguards have been provided.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w05.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We have not received any representations on this issues.
<P>

<a name="90512w05.htm_para4">The Data Protection Act 1998 provides a framework for the statutory regulation of public space Close Circuit Television (CCTV) systems. The Act builds upon the regime of the Data Protection Act 1984 but goes further in a number of respects. In particular, it provides enhanced rights for individuals in respect of personal data held about them by data controllers, including rights of subject access.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women were listed on his Department's paedophilia file on the latest date for which figures are available.  [83586]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Home Office does not maintain a "paedophilia file".
<P>

<a name="90512w06.htm_para0">However, the Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned or convicted of certain sexual offences, including certain sexual offences against children, to notify the police of their name, address and date of birth within 14 days of caution/conviction. The information is provided to the local police and stored in the Police National Computer.
<P>

<a name="90512w06.htm_para1">I understand that, as at 28 February 1999, 8,161 individuals were recorded on the Police National Computer as having notified the police in England and Wales of their details, in accordance with the 1997 Act. A breakdown of the sex of those who have notified the police of their details could, at present, be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="90512w06.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cunliffe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about the review of the Tote.  [84050]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90512w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Review of the Tote has been completed. I have considered the Report of the Steering Group which conducted the Review and have accepted the recommendations in it. I am most grateful to Peter Jones, the Chairman of the Tote, who chaired the Steering Group, for his skilful handling of this task. Copies of the Report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90512w06.htm_para2">The Tote's status as a non-departmental public body has served it well in the past but has become increasingly anomalous as the Tote has become a more commercial operation and developed its non-pool betting activities through acquisition of licensed betting offices. The Review, therefore, concluded that the commercial freedom now required by the Tote would be best provided by transfer to the private sector. This will require legislation and, in view of the time this is likely to take, the Review has made no recommendation as to the precise method of sale. That will need to be determined at the time.
<P>

<a name="90512w06.htm_para3">Further work will now need to be undertaken on the various sale options, including the possibility of a sale to racing, in consultation with the Tote, the racing industry and others. The Review also recognised the need to have regard to the interests of the taxpayer, as well as other stakeholders. This means that the Government have rejected the possibility of the tote being transferred to racing without consideration.




<P>
<P><I>12 May 1999 : Column: 160</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90512w06.htm_para4">Although the Tote's new status will now need to be worked out in detail, the Review has marked out the future path for the Tote which will enable it to develop and operate in a fully commercial way.

 Shelter and heating will be key issues for refugees during the cold weather, after their return to Kosovo and also for those who remain in neighbouring states. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is responsible for refugee care in this and other areas.

 The proposal to tax currency transactions is of considerable interest. It could bring benefits in two ways. It could help reduce short term currency speculation, and it could raise significant resources to reduce poverty. Unfortunately, there are serious practical difficulties which stand in the way of implementation: it is difficult to distinguish between currency speculation and necessary currency transactions, and it would be difficult to agree on a satisfactory distribution of revenues. We will continue to study this and related proposals.

 The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries is a voluntary instrument which sets out a general framework of principles and standards aimed at ensuring the responsible conservation, management and development of fisheries. It is a wide-ranging document covering the capture, processing and marketing of fish and fish products, aquaculture, fisheries research and the integration of fisheries into coastal state management. The European Community is committed to ensuring that the Common Fisheries Policy, which aims to promote responsible fisheries management and the conservation of fish stocks, is fully compatible with the relevant provisions of the Code.

 The proposals will be legislated in the Finance Bill 2000.

In those circumstances, the engagement will be treated as employment for the purpose of tax and National Insurance.

 <i>[holding answer 29 April 1999]:</i> We intend to re-advertise the post nationally very soon. We hope to appoint a Police Ombudsman designate in late July/early August. Much will depend, however, on the number of applicants, the availability of candidates for interview and the date on which the successful candidate is available to take up post, by Royal Appointment.

 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1999]:</i> The audio recording of police interviews with terrorist suspects is governed by a Code of Practice, laid in Parliament in draft on 23 February 1999 and on course to become operational on 24 May 1999. The Code of Practice makes no provision for the Secretary of State to listen to the audio recordings; nor does the Secretary of State consider it appropriate that she should intervene in any ongoing police investigation.
<P>

<a name="90512w09.htm_para1">On 15 April 1999, representations were received from a firm of solicitors on behalf of three persons arrested on 13 April 1999 under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 that there was no basis for their detention. The representations included a request that the Secretary of State should listen to the audio recordings of the interviews as a means of confirming this. The Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), acting on behalf of the Secretary of State and in accordance with S14(5) of the PTA, had earlier approved an application from the police for a two day extension of detention in respect of the persons detained. In light of the solicitors' representations, the Minister further considered the police application and upheld his decision to approve it.
<P>

<a name="90512w09.htm_para2">Access to audio recording is as follows:
<P>

<a name="90512w09.htm_para3">

<BR>
(i) the detained person may listen to the audio recording, on the authority of the Sub-Divisional Commander;
<BR>
(ii) a solicitor may listen to the audio recording, on the authority of the Sub-Divisional Commander;
<BR>
(iii) if a person is charged or informed that he or she will be prosecuted, a solicitor acting for that person may apply to the Sub-Divisional Commander for a copy of the audio recording;
<BR>
(iv) the Director of Public Prosecutions may listen to the audio recording, on his own authority;
<BR>
(v) a court may listen to the audio recording, on its own authority;
<BR>
(vi) the audio recording may constitute evidence on behalf of a party to civil proceedings, if relevant.
