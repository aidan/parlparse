<a name="50111w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Army Discipline</h3>


<p><a name="50111w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what time restrictions apply with respect to making an application to the Employment Tribunal following consideration of a complaint under Army redress procedures relating to <i>(a)</i> sexual harassment, <i>(b)</i> racial harassment, <i>(c)</i> parental leave directive, <i>(d)</i> pay and <i>(e)</i> religion.  [201838]</p>




<p><a name="50111w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The standard time limit for an application to an Employment Tribunal is six months from the most recent occurrence about which the claim is being made. There is no requirement for an Army complainant to wait for an outcome of the internal complaints procedure before taking their case to Employment Tribunal. However in such a case the Army procedures are usually put on hold pending the completion of the Employment Tribunal.

<a name="50111w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Atomic Weapons Establishment</h3>


<p><a name="50111w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the balance sheet value of the Atomic Weapons Establishment in the books of his Department was as at 31 March; what the carrying charge and applicable depreciation for that establishment is in the current year; and for what reasons his Department is investing a further &#163;467 million in that establishment. [206603]</p>




<p><a name="50111w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 As at 31 March 2004, the Gross Book Value of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) Balance Sheet was &#163;552.8 million and the associated carrying depreciation was &#163;55.3 million resulting in a Net Book Value of &#163;497.5 million. The projected depreciation to 31 March 2005, for AWE, is &#163;28.0 million. Investment at AWE is directed towards the maintenance of the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent and enables AWE to meet safety, environmental and operational requirements. It is also in accordance with the Government&#039;s policy of keeping options for maintaining a nuclear deterrent capability, in line with the policy set out at paragraph 3.11 of the 2003 Defence White Paper (Cm 6041&#150;1).

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his policy is on the deployment of British troops as part of combined European forces under EU leadership; and if he will make a statement.  [207710]</p>




<p><a name="50111w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As stated in the 2003 Defence White Paper, the Government expects United Kingdom forces to conduct operations alongside and integrated with a range of multinational groupings&#151;US, NATO, European, UN or other forces&#151;under various command arrangements. The most appropriate 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 374W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
command arrangement will depend on the prevailing circumstances. Decisions on whether to deploy British forces as part of an EU operation are taken by the Government on a case-by-case basis, as with NATO and all other multinational operations.

[207246]</p>




<p><a name="50111w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The United States have confirmed to us that they have not used Mark 77 firebombs, which are essentially napalm canisters, in Iraq at any time. No other Coalition member has Mark 77 firebombs in their inventory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w01.html_para0">
The United Kingdom is bound under Protocol III to the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) not to use incendiary weapons (which would include napalm) against military targets located within concentrations of civilians.

<p><a name="50111w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As I announced on the 16 December, the First Battalions of the Royal Scots and the King&#039;s Own Scottish Borderers will merge to form a new battalion within the future Royal Regiment of Scotland. This new regiment will have a common capbadge, uniform and a common tartan. There will, however, be scope for battalions to retain a degree of individual identity within these large regiments. For example, antecedent names will be maintained at battalion level prior to the new regimental name. How this can be achieved in other ways will be for the new regiment to decide in due course.

 The Department for Transport&#039;s advice on the use of cats eyes is set out in section 6 of Chapter 5 of the Traffic Signs Manual. A new edition was published last year. Because they remain effective in wet weather and particularly in areas prone to fog, when reflectorised road markings perform less well, they are recommended on all high-speed roads. Their use is compulsory with double white line systems, when the normal spacing is closed up to 4.5 metres, because it is essential for safety reasons that drivers recognise the lines in all weather conditions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action he is taking to develop hybrid engine cars.  [206921]</p>




<p><a name="50111w03.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Jamieson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 January 2005]:</i> The Government provides a number of incentives to encourage the purchase and use of clean, low carbon vehicles, including hybrid vehicles. The Vehicle Excise Duty regime, for example, rewards the purchase of the most fuel-efficient vehicles, with additional discounts for hybrid vehicles. The company car tax system introduced in April 2002 provides very large incentives to encourage the purchase of clean, fuel-efficient cars, with hybrid vehicles enjoying a significant additional discount.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w03.html_para4">
The Government also funds two grant programmes, run by the Energy Saving Trust, which are designed to encourage the development and market uptake of more environmentally friendly (lower CO <sub>2</sub>  and/or air pollutant-emitting) vehicles and vehicle technologies, including hybrids. The New Vehicle Technology Fund provides grants for projects to develop demonstration vehicles for new technologies which reduce the CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and/or air pollutant emissions such as NOx and particulates. During 2004&#150;05 18 projects have been funded, of which 11 involve hybrid technology. The grant allocation for the New Vehicle Technology Fund in 2004&#150;05 is &#163;4.6 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w03.html_para5">
The Powershift grant programme is also funded by Government, to provide grants to individuals and undertakings to purchase vehicles which are proven to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 384W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
have reduced CO <sub>2</sub>  and/or air pollutant emissions, in order to encourage their uptake. So far during 2004&#150;05, grants have been awarded towards the purchase of 1,053 hybrid cars, which represents 42 per cent. of the total number of vehicles funded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w03.html_para6">
As we announced on 21 December 2004, following our recent consultation exercise, we intend to revise the grant programmes so as to incentivise the cleanest cars regardless of the technology or fuel type, while ensuring that grant levels are also consistent with European rules on state aid.

<p><a name="50111w04.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The powers in Part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) allow the Government to make regulations requiring all new land based public transport vehicles&#151;trains, buses and coaches, and taxis&#151;to be accessible to disabled people, including those who need to remain in wheelchairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para6">
The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR) came into force on 31 December 1998, and have applied to all new rail vehicles coming into service in England, Scotland and Wales after that date. Northern Ireland has its own separate regulations. The RVAR, which were the first regulations to be made under Part 5 of the DDA, considerably improve access for disabled passengers to new rail vehicles. The Regulations were drawn up in close consultation with the Government&#039;s statutory advisers on transport issues as they affect disabled people, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para7">
The regulations cover wheelchair accessibility and accommodation, including the design of on-board accessible toilets for those trains in which toilet facilities are provided. They also specify the size and location of handrails and handholds, and control devices as well as covering the provision of audible warnings and other equipment. In addition, a requirement for both visual and audible passenger information assists passengers with sensory impairments to use rail services with confidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para8">
Over 3,800 new fully accessible rail vehicles are now in service&#151;which represents almost one third of the national heavy rail fleet. A further 700 vehicles will be entering service over the next 12 months. In addition, many older trains, while not meeting full RVAR standards already had wheelchair accommodation and other features to assist disabled passengers prior to 1998.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para9">
The Department does not record which vehicles are in use by which train operator, as they are frequently swapped between operators, according to operational needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para10">
The Government are proposing to take powers in the Disability Discrimination Bill to enable it to set an end date by which time all rail vehicles must comply with the RVAR. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State announced in November that the Government&#039;s preferred end-date is 2020. We also intend to require access improvements to those features which are included in refurbishment plans for older rail vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para11">
Using figures from the Strategic Rail Authority, we estimate, that fewer than 2200 non-compliant vehicles would still be in service by 2020. The decision as to whether to refurbish older trains to RVAR standards or replace them with new, RVAR compliant trains by then is a matter for the rolling stock leasing companies and train operators. The Government will be publishing for consultation a Regulatory Impact Assessment to accompany draft regulations, during the passage of the Bill through Parliament.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport which licensing authorities are not operating taxis that are accessible to disabled people; and if he will make a statement.  [207727]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 388W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50111w04.html_spnew6"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The following list is based on the latest statistical data on wheelchair accessible taxis, compiled by the Department for Transport and based on returns provided by local licensing authorities in England and Wales, as at 31 March 2004. This showed that the authorities listed did not license accessible vehicles as taxis at that time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para12">
We recognise that the current generation of accessible taxis do not meet the needs of all disabled people although they do provide a good level of access for many wheelchair users. The Department for Transport is therefore currently looking into the ergonomic requirements of taxi design that would enable as many disabled people as possible to use taxis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w04.html_para13">
The results of that research will form the basis of the technical specifications to support the Government&#039;s proposals to introduce Taxi Accessibility Regulations under part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). The proposals, which were announced in the House on 26 October 2003, would see the phasing in of regulations in specified licensing areas from 2010 (for all new vehicles), with full compliance by 2020. The 2010 date has been proposed to accommodate a full public consultation process, to give sufficient time for vehicle manufacturers and converters to produce new models that meet the regulations, and to give the trade sufficient time to adapt to the change. In the period before regulations are introduced, local licensing authorities remain free to introduce their own accessibility policies and we encourage them to do so in consultation with disabled people locally.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what progress has been made in encouraging the use of yellow school buses as a means to cut traffic congestion.  [207731]</p>




<p><a name="50111w05.html_spnew0"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 We know from our evaluation of various small-scale yellow and other dedicated school bus schemes that well-designed schemes have the potential to reduce car dependency for journeys to school and the traffic congestion that results from this. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that schemes do not reduce levels of walking or cycling or undermine the viability of important commercial bus services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w05.html_para0">
We therefore want to encourage individual local authorities to consider school bus schemes as part of broader local transport planning and to decide whether or not they would be appropriate to their area. We will give capital bids for such schemes careful consideration, taking account of value for money, regional priorities and affordability. We approved &#163;18.7 million funding for a yellow bus scheme serving 100 schools in West Yorkshire as part of the local transport settlement for 2004&#150;05. Funding for this project is to be released in three phases&#151;the second and third phases of funding are to be released subject to the first phase meeting its objectives with respect to modal switch from car.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what role UK officials had in the IMF monitoring exercise in Angola; and what advice they have offered to the Government of Angola. [207694]</p>




<p><a name="50111w06.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Government of Angola and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been engaged in talks for over a year about a staff monitored programme (SMP). Under an SMP, Angola would reach broad agreement on its macroeconomic policy approach, but without any linked IMF lending programme. An SMP is normally used by countries to demonstrate their track record of sound macroeconomic management in order to assist in achieving an international financial and investment standing. A key issue for Angola will be to ensure that all its revenues are captured in their budgets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w06.html_para0">
It is not yet clear that the political will exists in Angola to come to terms with the IMF. In the recent past, two programmes failed shortly after they had been agreed. The IMF is keen to avoid this happening again. A further IMF mission to discuss the Angola SMP will probably take place in January.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w06.html_para1">
UK officials have no direct involvement in the IMF missions although we are strongly encouraging the Government of Angola to do all it can to respond to the IMF&#039;s requests, and reach agreement on a programme. DFID has funded some work on oil revenue transparency in coordination with the World Bank which the IMF have found useful in their discussions on the fiscal position. Furthermore, DFID has advised the Government of Angola that DFID is willing to provide technical assistance to ensure the successful implementation of an IMF programme.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions his Department has had with the Indian Government concerning sex discrimination in India.  [206088]</p>




<p><a name="50111w07.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 December 2004]:</i> The Government of India (Gol) recognises that gender discrimination limits the prospects for development progress in India. It has a well-articulated policy and clearly mandated institutional structures, including the current tenth plan, for addressing gender discrimination. India has also played a lead role in ratifying gender-related UN conventions and international covenants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w07.html_para0">
However, a falling ratio of girls to boys, in rich and poor states, and among better off and poorer households, reflects continuing discrimination against women and girls. Violence against women and girls persists. The Gol recognises this in its reporting under the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The Gol has included several Bills related to improving the status of women in its forthcoming parliamentary session.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w07.html_para1">
Over the last two years, the Department for International Development (DFID) has engaged closely with the Gol on the design of the large national Sarva Shikshya Abhyan (Education-for-All) and reproductive and child health programmes, developing their focus on the most vulnerable and hard to reach people in India, especially those who suffer multiple discrimination and social exclusion, particularly girls and women among marginalised groups. Approaches to improving outcomes for women and girls are explicitly included in the agreed designs. The Gol measures success in these programmes against progress towards gender equality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w07.html_para2">
DFID also engages with Governments in its focus states on issues of discrimination and ensuring that women participate in design and monitoring of programmes. This state level work includes focused programmes that empower and address the practical needs and priorities of women and other marginalised groups, such as through micro-credit, development of gender policies, awareness raising and livelihood improvements, e.g. through the Andhra Pradesh Rural Livelihoods and the Western Orissa Rural Livelihoods programmes. In 2003, DFID supported analysis of the Orissa budget from a gender perspective; key sectors, including the Orissa state health strategy and water and sanitation reforms, now seek to take account of the particular needs of women and girls.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 398W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w07.html_para3">
DFID worked with the United Nations Development Programme in India to include gender analysis in their support for state Human Development Reports. Discussions of access to justice and support for police reforms have both paid particular attention to the needs of women. In all programmes with the Gol that DFID supports, we seek to have monitoring and evaluation data disaggregated by gender in order to inform policy decisions. DFID also supports civil society to work with government to reduce gender discrimination.

The details have yet to be determined, and are expected to be followed up by the Iraqi Transitional Government after the forthcoming elections. We support the reform in principle. DFID staff and advisers will continue to maintain contact with the Iraqi authorities, and with interested international organisations including the IMF, the World Bank and the World Food Programme, to ensure that the interests of poor and vulnerable families in Iraq are protected. A well-managed reform process should not have any adverse impact on levels of crime in Iraq.

This work and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s own assessments lead us to conclude that rising numbers of planning applications taken together with some increase in refusal rates have been the main statistical factors behind the increase in the number of planning appeals. There is a strong perception that the reduction in the period for submitting an appeal from six months to three months has led to applicants submitting appeals without first making any attempt to negotiate an amended application with the local planning authority and that this has also contributed to the rise in appeal numbers. I announced on 16 December that it was our intention to extend the period for submitting planning appeals from three to six months, which would have the effect of reversing the change which was introduced in September 2003. The orders giving effect to that change were laid before Parliament on 22 December 2004.

<p>
<a name="50111w10.html_para4">
For the sample, categories of venues were selected that did not appear to be reliant upon live music provision for their existence. MORI arrived at their estimate of 1.7 million live music events by calculating the average number of events being staged at each venue type in the sample, and then multiplying this figure by the total estimated number of venues in each category within England and Wales. Venues sampled were asked how many live events they had staged in the past 12 months, and were offered a series of ranges to choose from (e.g. 8&#150;10,11&#150;20, 21&#150;31, 32&#150;40, 40+). To calculate an average, MORI sensibly took the mid point for each range on the assumption that, on a normal distribution, they would expect roughly an equal proportion to fall above and below this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w10.html_para5">
For respondents who said that their venue had staged 40+ live events over the past 12 months, MORI assumed an average of 60 live events each year&#151;a realistic, if perhaps slightly conservative, estimate given that the number of such events each year could range between 41 and 150 (given three live music nights a week). In the unlikely scenario that all venues in the 41+ category only staged 41 live events in the past year, MORI calculated that the estimated number of live music events would be 1.3 million.

As regards the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, some research has been undertaken into the impact of the section 19 exception for the purposes of employment etc by organised religions and has found no instances of S19 being relied upon in the courts or tribunals. We intend to clarify the position further in the process of consulting on the extension of the Sex Discrimination Act to office holders later this year, as Government implements the Equal Treatment (Amendment) Directive.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the effect of European Court of Justice Case C-247/02, reference OJ C300 vol 47 of 4 December, on her Department&#039;s efforts to increase cross-EU competition in the awarding of public sector contracts by EU member states.  [207103]</p>




<p><a name="50111w12.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The judgement in the European Court of Justice Case C-247/02, reference OJ C300 vol. 47 of 4 December, confirms that award options for public sector contracts by EU member states of either accepting the lowest price or the most economically advantageous tender, provided by the EU procurement Directives, should not be overridden by national rules. In this particular case the judgement concluded that it was not permitted to have a national rule that imposed lowest price as the only award criteria for public contracts as this could have a negative impact on competition. The correct implementation of the EU Directives on public procurement is important as it facilitates fair and transparent competition across the EU.

Local education authorities will assess the student&#039;s income in the current academic year and, usually, the parents&#039; or partner&#039;s income in the previous financial year. LEAs will then work out whether the student is entitled to a Higher Education Grant and whether their parents or partner should pay a contribution towards the student&#039;s tuition fees and living costs.

<p><a name="50111w22.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w22.html_para4">
Since 2001 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable, to walk will have benefited from the Government&#039;s decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, whilst older and less well-off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w22.html_para5">
Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.39 million; in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, the proportion in employment has risen to 68.1 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w22.html_para6">
Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.1 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 2,890 in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland alone.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w22.html_para7">
Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&#150;03 show that there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&#150;97. Since 2001&#150;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&#150;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,200 families in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w22.html_para8">
We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &#163;10 billion more in 2004&#150;05 (in 2004&#150;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.

We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&#150;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over, to help with their fuel bills. The additional 80+ Annual Payment gives an extra &#163;100 to eligible households where there is someone aged 80 or over. Last winter there were 13,740 households in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland which received the winter fuel payment and, of those, 2,885 households received the additional Annual Payment. We expect numbers to be similar for this winter (2004&#150;05).

Additionally for this year eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the One-off 70+ Payment of &#163;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It will be paid with the winter fuel payment and last winter there were 7,970 households in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland with someone aged 70 or over which received a winter fuel payment.

All delegations agreed that Lisbon was the right strategy to tackle this, and did not need to be revisited. The SPA must in turn support Lisbon, increasing the quantity and quality of jobs, balancing flexibility and security, and building social inclusion. For the UK, I intervened to argue that employment was always the best social policy and, furthermore, that employment growth was the key to sustaining the European Social Model.

 Compliance with the ruling on the implementation of Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste will largely be achieved in England through new hazardous waste regulations which are planned to come fully into force in July 2005. Defra completed a consultation on the new regime in October 2004. The consultation paper is available on the following website: http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/wastereg-haz/index.htm.

The estimated costs of compliance are set out in the partial regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the consultation. Comprehensive guidance for businesses on the new regulations is proposed to be published three months before the new regime comes into force. Full compliance with the ruling will be complete once revised exemptions from waste management licensing requirements for establishments involved in the recovery and reuse of hazardous wastes are consulted on and implemented later in 2005.

<p><a name="50111w27.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 December 2004]</i>: The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) Violence against Women Initiative (VAWI) was an evidence based programme which aimed to find out which approaches and strategies were effective in supporting victims and tackling violence against women. In July 2000 27 domestic violence projects and seven rape and sexual assault projects were independently evaluated. The domestic violence projects were all multi-agency partnerships and many of the partner organisations involved in delivering interventions were voluntary groups such as Women&#039;s Aid, The projects worked in a variety of contexts and, while most provided some type of advocacy and support, the aims of the projects differed. The findings from the evaluations have been collated, and a series of research reports and concise practitioner guides have already been published. The research findings from those projects which specifically provided advocacy and support to victims are planned to be published, along with two concise practitioner guides, early in 2005.

<a name="50111w27.html_para7">
The evidence of the CRP VAWI&#151;and recent evaluations of specialist domestic violence courts which make clear that advocacy services are a key part in their success&#151;show the important role advocacy services have to play in supporting victims of domestic violence. Local partnerships responsible for crime and disorder are currently Identifying the need for domestic violence services in their local communities. Once identified, the appropriate organisation to meet that need is selected by local commissioning groups and their effectiveness monitored against criteria set out in their service level agreements.

 Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the courts alone, taking into account all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The Government believes that prison sentences should be reserved for those who are either serious, dangerous or seriously persistent offenders. Equally, offenders cannot expect to go unpunished if they fail to pay a fine.

<p>
<a name="50111w28.html_para1">
The court may issue a warrant of commitment: if the offender has failed to pay a fine and the court has, since the conviction, enquired into the defaulter&#039;s means in his presence on at least one occasion; in the case of an offence punishable with imprisonment, the defaulter appears to the court to have sufficient means to pay the sum forthwith; or the court is satisfied that the default is due to the defaulter&#039;s wilful refusal or culpable neglect and the court has considered or tried all other means of enforcing payment of the sum and it appears to the court that they are inappropriate or unsuccessful.

Whether the mother then keeps the child with her in prison is partly a matter for her choice and partly a matter for social services. The Prison Service provides places on mother and baby units and those mothers who wish to keep their child with them and are considered suitable may do so up to about the age of 18 months depending on what is in the best interests of the child. At 13 December 2004 there were 51 mothers in those units and their children&#039;s ages ranged from a few weeks to 16 months.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what review process applies to the use of anti-terrorism legislation; and if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of that legislation.  [205367]</p>




<p><a name="50111w32.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 16 December 2004]:</i> The powers in both the Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT) and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCS) are subject to review processes. Section 126 of the Terrorism Act 2000 requires the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament on the working of the Terrorism Act at least once every 12 months. This report is produced by the independent reviewer, currently Lord Carlile, and considers whether the Act has been used fairly and properly during the reporting period, taking into account the need to ensure that there are effective powers to deal with terrorism and adequate safeguards for the individual.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 496W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para3">
Lord Carlile additionally produces separate reports on the Northern Ireland specific powers within the Terrorism Act and the part 4 detention provisions of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, in order to inform the annual renewal debates for those parts of the legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para4">
In his most recent review of the Terrorism Act, published in April 2004, Lord Carlile concluded that overall the powers in the Act are necessary, that the provisions are functioning satisfactorily and that it continues to be fit for purpose. His latest report on part 7 of TACT, published in January 2004, recommended that the powers be renewed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para5">
In his report on the operation of part 4 of the ATCS Act, published in February 2004, Lord Carlile concluded that the Secretary of State had certified persons as international terrorists only in appropriate cases and that he had exercised independent judgment in each case. He recommended that continuing scrutiny be given to possible alternatives to detention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para6">
Additionally, the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act provided for a secondary review, of the Act as a whole, under section 122, to be conducted by a committee of Privy Councillors. This committee, chaired by Lord Newton, reported in December 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para7">
On 25 February 2004 the Home Secretary published a response to the recommendations made within the Privy Counsellor Review in a discussion paper entitled &quot;Counter Terrorism Powers: Reconciling Security and Liberty in an Open Society&quot;. Issues concerning the effectiveness of the ATCS Act raised by Lord Newton&#039;s committee were also debated in both the House of Commons, on the day of the above publication and the House of Lords on 4 March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para8">
As part of the discussion paper the Government launched a consultation process inviting contributions on the way forward on counter-terrorism measures over the longer term. The responses to that consultation exercise, together with the implications of the recent House of Lords judgment on the current ATCS Act part 4 powers, are currently under consideration and the Government have announced that they intend to bring forward their proposals early next year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the changes to UK law which would be required in order for the Government to be able to ratify the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (2000).  [207039]</p>




<p><a name="50111w32.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The United Kingdom was involved in the drafting process of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent and Punish Trafficking in Persons and was one of the first countries to sign the protocol. We are committed to its ratification.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para9">
The principal legislative requirement of the protocol is the criminalisation of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour and the removal of organs. We have introduced legislation to criminalise these forms of trafficking. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 includes offences covering trafficking into, within and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 497W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
out of the United Kingdom, for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Offences covering trafficking for other forms of exploitation, including trafficking for the purposes of forced labour and removal of organs, are included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para10">
We consider that, taken together with existing United Kingdom law, these offences mean that we fully comply with our legislative obligations under the protocol. However, ratification of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, is a pre-requisite to ratification of the protocol. We have identified a need for primary legislation to comply with the requirements of the Convention on the forfeiture of the instrumentalities of crime. Provision for this is included in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, which is currently before Parliament.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to expand the capacity of the POPPY Project to assist women who have been trafficked into prostitution.  [207040]</p>




<p><a name="50111w32.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Home Office-funded POPPY Scheme is being independently evaluated. Funding for the scheme has been agreed until March 2005 pending the outcome of the evaluation. Decisions about future Home Office funding, capacity issues and entry criteria for the scheme will be taken in light of lessons learned since the pilot was established in March 2003 and evidence from the final evaluation report, which we expect to receive very shortly.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many cases have been prosecuted under the trafficking offence established in the Sexual Offences Act 2003;  [207041]
</p>



<p>(2) how many cases have been prosecuted under the trafficking for exploitation offence established in section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004.  [207042]</p>




<p><a name="50111w32.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 We have introduced legislation to criminalise trafficking comprehensively. Sections 57 to 59 of the Sexual Offences Act criminalise trafficking for sexual exploitation. These offences came into force on 1 May 2004. Trafficking for other forms of exploitation, including for forced labour and organ removal, are criminalised by section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Bill which came into force on 1 December 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para11">
Data on numbers of prosecutions under these sections will be collected in the usual way and published in Home Office criminal statistics. Given that the offences came into effect recently, there is not any information yet held centrally about number of prosecutions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance has been issued on cases where trafficked children are appealing for exceptional leave to remain and there is evidence to suggest that they may be re-trafficked if returned to their country of origin.  [207043]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2005 : Column 498W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50111w32.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 No specific guidance has been issued on cases where trafficked children are requesting permission to remain in the UK. The granting or refusal of leave to enter is governed by the immigration rules HC 395.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para12">
However, guidance is issued to caseworkers on the criteria for assessing asylum claims, humanitarian protection and discretionary leave. Any assessment of asylum or human rights claim will include consideration of the future risk an applicant will face if returned to their country of origin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para13">
We would not enforce the removal of a child on his own unless we were satisfied that the child would be met on arrival in his country and that care arrangements were in place thereafter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para14">
If there was evidence that care arrangements were seriously below the standard normally provided in the country concerned or that they were so inadequate that the child would face a serious risk of harm if returned, consideration would be given to abandoning enforcement action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w32.html_para15">
Where there was evidence that a child had been trafficked to the United Kingdom, very careful consideration would be given to the child&#039;s circumstances in its country of origin before enforcement action was pursued. Where it was considered that removal would place the child at risk of further harm or abuse, such action would be abandoned.

<p><a name="50111w34.html_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 January 2004]:</i> The assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually undertaken by child psychiatrists, often with the help and contribution of other members of multidisciplinary child mental health services. However, it is becoming increasingly common for paediatricians to diagnose and manage ADHD. Even with the children diagnosed as having hyperkinetic disorder(the more severe and specific end of the spectrum(a treatment programme should not rely on medication alone. It is recommended that interventions that focus on the behaviour of the child, family interactions, classroom problems and learning difficulties should be offered. A comprehensive assessment involving more than one professional perspective will highlight the various problems that need to be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w34.html_para5">
The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has given advice on the use methylphenidate (more commonly known as Ritalin) in the treatment of ADHD. NICE recommended that methylphenidate should only be used as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for children with a diagnosis of severe ADHD.

<p><a name="50111w34.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Details of the number of children with autism are not available. The Department commissioned the Medical Research Council (MRC) to undertake a comprehensive review of autism research.

 We listened to service providers about their problems in recruiting staff and the effect the regulation on Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) Disclosures were having on their ability to provide services to vulnerable adults.

<p>
<a name="50111w34.html_para7">
&quot;PoVAFirst&quot; is an optional service provided by the CRB. It allows those organisations who are eligible to access the PoVA list, and who have requested checks of the list on their CRB disclosure application form, to receive results of the PoVA check in advance of the full disclosure being issued. It helps those providers of care to keep their staffing levels up to the necessary statutory requirements.

 Dentists who work in the national health service are eligible for membership of the NHS superannuation scheme, maternity, paternity and adoption leave payments, long-term sickness payments, commitment payments and support with continuing professional development and clinical audit. We are undertaking the most far reaching reforms of NHS dentistry since 1948, which, through the delegation of the commissioning of dental services to primary care trusts (PCTS), are intended to make working in the NHS more attractive to dentists. The reforms are supported by additional recurring funding of &#163;250 million in 2005&#150;06&#151;an increase of 19.3 per cent. compared to spending in 2003&#150;04.

Currently the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) trial is investigating whether screening using CA125 blood test or ultrasound detection will detect ovarian cancer in its early stage. Unlike cervical cancer there is no recognised pre-cancerous abnormalities of the ovary that can be detected and treated. 200,000 women are involved in this study and it will report around 2010.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the cost of increasing the level of the savings disregard to &#163;15.51 for people supported by local authorities in residential care.  [207624]</p>




<p><a name="50111w38.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 A savings disregard is applied to all people supported by local authorities in residential care where income exceeds &#163;79.60. The full disregard is applied to all people supported by the local authority whose weekly income exceeds &#163;87.35 even if their weekly income is so great they would not normally qualify for savings credit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111w38.html_para9">
The cost of raising the maximum savings disregard for older supported care home residents to &#163;15.51 per week cannot be calculated precisely, as there are no recent data available on the distribution of income of these residents. A best estimate is that the annual cost is likely to be in the range &#163;70 million to &#163;85 million.

<p><a name="50111w39.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The &quot;Choosing Health White Paper&quot; set out the Government&#039;s strategy for achieving long-term improvements in the health and diet of the population. The school fruit and vegetable scheme has a key role to play in instilling good eating habits in young people and is contributing towards the obesity public service agreement to:

The Department commissioned a National Opinion Poll survey of the school fruit and vegetable scheme, then known as the national school fruit scheme, which was published in October 2003. Nearly half of all parents questioned in that survey thought that the scheme had made them more aware of the importance of fruit for a healthy diet and over a quarter of children and their families reportedly ate more fruit at home as a direct result of the scheme.

The Big Lottery Fund has commissioned a full evaluation of the impact of the school fruit and vegetable scheme on children&#039;s diet and a full report is expected in early 2005.
