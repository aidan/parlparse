<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd0"><H3 align=center>Agricultural Subsidies</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the cost of UK agricultural subsidies and price support in areas which are not dependent on the Common Agricultural Policy in the last year for which figures are available; and if she will make a statement.  [156602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Commodities not subject to a Common Organisation of the Market include potatoes, horsemeat, honey, coffee, alcohol, cork and vinegars derived from alcohol. UK subsidies or price support for these areas are negligible or non-existent.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Calf Passports</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what happens to male calves which are refused passports because the owner failed to register them within 27 days.  [156044]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 In the first instance the animal's keeper has the right to appeal against the decision to refuse a passport if he thinks there are special or extenuating circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para0">If the appeal is unsuccessful, the animal may live out its life on the farm it is on. It may not be moved to other premises and it may not enter the food chain at the end of its life.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para1">If the keeper does not wish to keep the calf it may be moved under licence to a knacker's yard or other facility for destruction.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Milk Pricing</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Office of Fair Trading's recent re-examination of the supermarkets' code, with specific reference to milk pricing.  [156442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The report of the review by the Office of Fair Trading of the operation of the Supermarket Code of Practice was published on 20&nbsp;February 2004. It made no reference to milk pricing which falls outside the scope of the Code.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para2">We welcome the publication of the report and the OFTs decision to undertake a focused compliance audit of the supermarkets' dealings with suppliers. We hope that this will provide a firm evidence base for future action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress the Government are making with the European Landscape Convention; and when it will be <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;signed and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;ratified.  [157480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra has been considering with other interested Government Departments and agencies the possible costs and benefits to the UK of signing and ratifying the Council of Europe European Landscape Convention. No decision has yet been taken as to whether the UK will sign and ratify but I expect a decision to be made later this year.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Fisheries</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the accuracy of assessments made by the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;UK Government and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;European Commission on the attributes of fish discarded by fishing vessels operating in UK waters.  [152369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 These data are obtained by discard officers employed by the UK fisheries research agencies . They are collected in accordance with EC Regulation 1639/, which applies to all member states, and the precision levels of data relating to discards are set out in Chapter III E(1)c, H(1)e of that regulation. The European Commission makes use of the estimates made by member states, and may aggregate them when required.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Large Combustion Plants Directive</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn5"><B> Paddy Tipping: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how trading of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides within the national emission reduction plan proposed by her Department for implementation of the Large Combustion Plants Directive would operate, with particular reference to the Commission's decision that trading of pollutant emissions will only be allowed where emissions fall below best available techniques.  [155897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The general principles of an emissions trading scheme were set out in the National Emissions Reduction Plan submitted to the European Commission in November 2003. The plan is available on the Defra website. The details of any such scheme would be defined in close consultation with the potential participants depending on the Government's final decision on the UK's approach to implementing the Large Combustion Plants Directive.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para3">Plants within such a scheme would be able to trade allowances freely but would still have to comply, at all times, with all other relevant legislation, including the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive which requires the application of best available techniques.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Minor Highways and Byways (Vehicle Use)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what discussions she has had with groups representing users 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2004 : Column 1053W</I><P>
of mechanically propelled vehicles in connection with plans to restrict their use of minor highways and byways; and if she will make a statement;  [157306]
<P>
<UL>(2) what representations she has had from groups representing users of mechanically propelled vehicles regarding their use of minor highways and byways; and if she will make a statement;  [157307]
<P>
(3) if she will make a statement on plans to restrict the use of byways and minor highways by mechanically propelled vehicles.  [157308]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 During the course of last year I met the Trail Riders Fellowship, the Land Access and Recreation Association, the Royal Automobile Club, the Byways and Bridleways Trust Council, and the Auto-Cycle Union last year to discuss the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para4">The Government have subsequently published a consultation paper setting out its proposals for tackling the problems which can arise. So far 10 groups representing users of mechanically propelled vehicles have responded.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para5">The consultation period ends on 19&nbsp;March. When I have had an opportunity to consider all the responses, I will invite representative groups to meet me to discuss the issues. We will announce the Government's intentions on the way ahead in due course.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Scotland/UK Concordats</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn7"><B> Annabelle Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what amendments have been made to the Concordats between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government on co-ordination of European policy issues concerning agriculture; and what representations she has received from the Scottish Executive to amend the Concordats.  [157869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 There have been no amendments concerning agriculture made to any Concordats on co-ordination of European policy issues. Defra has not received any representations from the Scottish Executive to amend the Concordats.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd8"><H3 align=center>Beekeeping</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn8"><B> Chris McCafferty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cases of highly resistant varroa mites have been reported in the last 12 months in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;England, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Scotland and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;Wales.  [157782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The number of new cases of pyrethroid-resistant varroa mites reported in apiaries in England and Wales in the last 12 months is 59 and nine respectively. There have been no such cases reported in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what representations were made by her Department to the Commonwealth Games Federation 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2004 : Column 1054W</I><P>
General Assembly concerning the selection of disabled sports for the 2006 Commonwealth Games; and whether she will make further representations on behalf of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;bowls and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other excluded sports.  [158832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 None. The programme for elite athletes with disabilities at the 2006 Games was decided by the Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly following representations made by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the Melbourne 2006 games committee. The General Assembly agreed to increase the number of disability events from 8 to 12 from a list of 17 submitted by the IPC.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para6">This Government are committed to promoting disability sport and appreciates the popularity of bowls in this country. However, the selection process was the sole responsibility of the General Assembly and it would be inappropriate for Ministers from this Department to attempt to intervene.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para7">The Federation believe that the selection by the General Assembly offers the widest range of opportunities&#151;within a limited programme&#151;for the majority of athletes with disabilities from across the Commonwealth.

<a name="40304w01.html_sbhd10"><H3 align=center>Regional Museums</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps she is taking to increase the funding of regional museums.  [158144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w01.html_spnew10"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport's allocation of resources from Spending Review 2002 already includes a very significant increase in funding for regional museums, from &#163;10&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04 to &#163;30&nbsp;million in 2005&#150;06. One of our aims is to use that funding, which underpins the Renaissance in the Regions programme, to lever in funding from other sources.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para8">Recently we have doubled our contribution to the joint DCMS/Wolfson museums and galleries improvement fund, to provide a total annual fund of &#163;4&nbsp;million, and have extended its coverage to regional museums with designated collections and to museums participating in Renaissance in the Regions. DCMS and the Department for Education and Skills are also investing &#163;2.6&nbsp;million in the current financial year in education and community projects carried out by partnerships of national and regional museums.
<P>

<a name="40304w01.html_para9">In preparing the Departmental submission to the 2004 Spending Review, we will consider the needs of regional museums alongside other priorities and pressures during the 2005&#150;08 period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures she is taking to tackle problems caused to television reception as a consequence of transmissions by TETRA masts.  [158566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_spnew0"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 TETRA systems in the UK are licensed to operate on frequencies within the bands 380 to 385 MHz; 390 to 395 MHz; 410 to 430 MHz; 871 to 876 MHz and 916 to 921 MHz. Television broadcasting operates on channels outside these bands; within the range 470 to 862 MHz. Interference should not therefore 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2004 : Column 1055W</I><P>
occur to TV reception from TETRA transmissions provided that the TETRA systems are operating in accordance with their licence conditions and the standard of installation of the TV receiver including its aerial system are satisfactory.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para0">Ofcom, the independent regulator of communications is responsible for managing civil use of the radio spectrum including the investigation of legitimate reports of television and radio interference. Ofcom has published information on improving radio and TV reception to avoid interference, including specific advice on cases involving TETRA. In all such cases reported to Ofcom to date, the problems have been attributable to the performance of the consumers own TV aerial amplifiers which have been found to have a pass band wide enough to boost the TV signal and, inadvertently, the TETRA signals. In most cases a suitable filter between the amplifier and TV aerial will resolve the interference. Consumers in these cases have been advised to take up the problems with their suppliers.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are sample-based estimates and are subject to sampling error and other uncertainties.<P>





2. The reported figure for housing benefit relates only to the 85&nbsp;per cent. of expenditure covered by the housing benefit review. It does not include an allowance for overpaid expenditure due to non-residence at address, a small part of which may be the result of official error.<P>

3. Official error on long-term benefits is a very low proportion of expenditure, and sample is a very small one which excludes some types of cases. The resulting estimate is the best available but is subject to considerable uncertainty.<P>

4. The figures for income support, minimum income guarantee, jobseeker's allowance and housing benefit have been published in national statistics publications which report on the Department's performance against Public Service Agreement targets to reduce fraud and error.<P>

5. Estimates are not available for official error in other benefits in 2002&#150;03. Estimates of official error overpayments were published in reports on the benefit review exercises undertaken on disability living allowance, in 1997 and invalid care allowance (now called carer's allowance) in 1996. These out-of-date figures are not reliable indicators of the current level of official error in these benefits. A new review of disability living allowance will take place this year and provide an updated figure for that benefit.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Roy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;total amount of money lost by pension holders in company schemes where that pension scheme has wound up after the failure of the company and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the number of people who have lost pension provision in such circumstances.  [158152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Estimating the value of pensions lost and the number of people affected due to scheme wind-up and company insolvency, is fraught with numerous difficulties. We do not have information that tells us whether a scheme wind-up is due to company insolvency. Nor do we have information at an aggregate level on the fund assets and liabilities of schemes winding-up.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para2">The extent of pensions lost depends on many different factors&#151;such as the maturity of the scheme (that is, the age profile and retirement status of members), and the funding position before starting winding-up. The latter in turn is highly sensitive to investment decisions and conditions in the financial markets.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para3">Data is severely limited in these areas, and as a result the Government does not have reliable estimates of the amount of money lost or the number of people affected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on delays to processing entitlement to retirement pensions for the recently widowed.  [158702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Where pensioners are recently widowed, they may be entitled to have their pensions increased by virtue of the National Insurance contributions paid by their deceased spouses. The assessment of any entitlement to an increased pension is carried out by the National Pension Centre in Newcastle. While this assessment is being carried out, widows will continue to receive their own pensions and can also apply for interim payments to top this up.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para4">The National Pension Centre also deals with new claims for pensions from people who have previously been divorced or widowed, and changes of circumstances for over four million pensioners who have their pensions paid direct into a bank account.

<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para5">A recent build up of work in the Centre has been caused largely as a result of the Centre temporarily dealing with some work appropriate to the 26 Regional Pension Centres. As that work will return to the Regional Centres, and an additional 100 staff have been employed, the work at the National Pension Centre should be returned to normal levels by June. The number of cases outstanding where the pensioner has been recently bereaved has been reduced from over 20,000 at the end of December to just over 14,000 currently.

<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 There is no target set specifically for the processing of entitlements to retirement pensions for the recently widowed. Where pensioners are recently widowed, they may be entitled to have their pensions increased by virtue of the National Insurance contributions paid by their deceased spouses. The assessment of any entitlement to an increased pension is carried out by the National Pension Centre in Newcastle.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para6">When notified that a pensioner has been recently widowed, The National Pension Centre will assess whether the bereaved spouse can have their own pension increased, based on the contribution payments of their deceased partner. The National Pension Centre aims to deal with 95&nbsp;per cent. of such changes within 17 days. As at the end of December performance against this target for the year was at 90.6&nbsp;per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how many people above state pension age he estimates are not drawing a state retirement pension because they have deferred taking a state pension; and if he will make a statement;  [158767]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;men and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;women drawing state retirement pensions are receiving increments because they deferred drawing that pension beyond state pension age, broken down by the length of time for which that pension was deferred.  [158770]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w02.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 It is not possible to say exactly how many people are deferring their State Pension at a single point in time because it is not necessary to inform the Department for Work and Pensions of an intention to defer.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para7">However, estimates from the Government Actuary's Department suggest that approximately 120,000 pensioners in total are not drawing their state pension at the moment.
<P>

<a name="40304w02.html_para8">Information on current pensioners who have deferred their pension is not available in the form requested, but there are currently around 1.14&nbsp;million pensioners in total with increments, of whom 893,000 are women. These figures include a small number of people who have inherited increments from their partner's contribution record and will have not actually deferred retirement themselves.

<a name="40304w04.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 To meet the challenge of 21st century smuggling, HM Customs and Excise, in Wales and across the UK, have developed their tactics, replacing traditional, predictable and less productive activities with more intelligence-led targeted operations. Experience demonstrates that the most efficient and effective way to do this in many areas is to use flexible mobile strike force teams. With these teams, Customs can deploy larger numbers, less predictably and with greater impact.

We also said that the charge would be offset through fuel duty reductions for lorry operators, so that overall those who buy fuel in the UK will pay no more tax as a result of the introduction of the charge. A further progress report will be issued shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;December 2003]:</i> Complaints against UK troops in Iraq are dealt with by local commanders in accordance with established disciplinary procedures. The vast majority of complaints are of a minor nature and are, as a result generally not recorded centrally.

 The death of Baha Mousa is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Royal Military Police who, in exercising their constabulary powers, are fully independent of the Army chain of command. It would be inappropriate to comment until their investigation is complete.

 In collecting the costs incurred by UK forces, we do not separately identify those incurred on repair and reconstruction of civilian infrastructure. However, it is estimated that, in 2003&#150;04, some &#163;9.9&nbsp;million will be spent on quick impact projects, which enhance the security of UK forces. Such projects include the refurbishment of schools and health clinics, renovation of police stations, supplying oxygen to hospitals, and the repairing and re-supplying of water and sewerage works. This is separate from the cost of reconstruction, on which the Department for International Development is leading.

 There is no specific budget set aside for the entertainment of troops in operational locations. Instead, an assessment, based on the number of troops deployed on the operation, is made to determine how many events should be provided.
<P>

<a name="40304w04.html_para6">Just over &#163;0.5&nbsp;million has been approved to be spent on entertainers visiting troops in Iraq in 2003&#150;04. No costs were incurred in 2002&#150;03. In addition to this cost, entertainers may be provided with some limited non-cash assistance, such as transport, accommodation or food, should this be possible given operational pressures. The Services Sound and Vision Corporation incur an additional cost, extending their normal peacetime service to the United Kingdom forces stationed overseas, to those deployed operationally in Iraq. For 2003&#150;04, the additional cost for that activity is estimated at around &#163;4&nbsp;million.

 The Government is well aware of the heightened interest and concerns expressed about the offshoring of UK service operations, including call centre operations. My Department has commissioned research on the key factors contributing to the relative competitiveness of UK call centre operations to help identify any appropriate actions which need to be taken by industry or Government in response to the increasingly global market for call centre services. This will include an examination of the main product areas in the UK call and contact centre industry that are vulnerable to growing competition from lower-wage economies, which types of call and contract centre activity and which regions have been most affected or are most likely to be affected in the near future.
<P>

<a name="40304w06.html_para7">The North West Development Agency is working with the University of Central Lancashire and a wide range of other private and public sector partners on a new initiative, Call North West, in an aim to drive up the skills and productivity of the region's contact centres.

 Existing information does not enable us to provide reliable figures. Official statistics do not generally separate call centre activities from the main activity of a firm or enterprise (e.g. banking). The term "call centre" can be used to describe a broad variety of functions and activities across a wide range of commercial, industrial and public sectors. Difficulties and differences in definition are reflected in commercial market research on call centres where estimates on the number of call centres and call centre employees vary substantially.

A second wave of Pathfinders will start in September 2004.
<P>

<a name="40304w06.html_para12">The two Departments are also supporting the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship. Building on existing good practice, the aims of the council will be to raise the profile of entrepreneurship and starting a business as a career option within Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), including both universities and other higher education establishments, with the objective of increasing the numbers of students and graduates who give serious thought to this. It will therefore work with all interested parties to encourage and create an entrepreneurial culture amongst students and graduates.

<P>
<a name="40304w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Post Office Ltd.'s urban reinvention programme is essential if a viable and sustainable countrywide post office network is to be maintained and to meet the changing needs of customers. The company will ensure that at the end of the programme, at least 95&nbsp;per cent. of the population in urban areas will still live within a mile of their nearest post offices.
<P>

<a name="40304w07.html_para9">Postwatch has an important role in the programme in examining each individual closure proposals and monitoring the programme overall. I understand that, of some 1,600 closure proposals notified to them, over 200 have been withdrawn, deferred or modified during or after the consultation process.
<P>

<a name="40304w07.html_para10">Although the vast majority of urban reinvention closure proposals have attracted little criticism, concerns expressed about the consultation arrangements led me to ask Post Office Ltd. to review the arrangements and to propose changes to make them more inclusive and responsive. These changes were announced in my written statement of 5&nbsp;February.

The system which the Government is proposing to introduce to deliver this last aspect is set down in a Consultation Document, issued by the Department on 4&nbsp;February, entitled the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2004, copies of which have beenplaced in the Libraries of the House.

 In 2001&#150;02, DFID provided &#163;1&nbsp;million to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) programme 'Care and Protection for Refugees from Burma in Thailand'. This programme was targeted towards the Burmese refugees residing in Thailand (approximately 110,000 at that time) and focused on:

<a name="40304w09.html_para3">UNHCR faced many challenges during the period of activities which impacted on its ability to progress its objectives, including lack of access to both sides of the Thai-Burma border, continued insecurity in border areas of Burma, and continued problems with the definition and application of refugee admission criteria in Thailand. However, despite these constraints UNHCR continued the critical dialogue with the Government of Thailand on protection-related issues, including conducting re-registration of new arrivals and continued advocacy to prevent forced return. UNHCR also liaised with operational UN agencies and NGOs to facilitate provision of adequate living conditions within the camps. Within its care and protection activities, UNHCR implemented programmes to identify, prevent and respond to sexual and gender based violence,

 The approximate unit cost to the Court Service of processing a claim from issue of proceedings to judgment at a small-claims hearing in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;527. For the purpose of calculating the unit cost the divisor is the number of claims allocated to the small claims track. In 2002&#150;03 this was 80,496 (England and Wales). The total cost of small claims that are defended is therefore &#163;42,421,392.
<P>

<a name="40304w10.html_para5">The percentage of cost recovered from fees paid by litigants was 103&nbsp;per cent. This allows for income and cost associated with small claims that did not go to a hearing or were not defended. The cost of the small claims hearing itself, (included in the figure of &#163;527) is based on the average length of a small claims hearing published in Judicial Statistics 2002 (table 4.11).

<a name="40304w10.html_para6">In 2003 a total of 482 small claims were allocated to track at Middlesbrough county court, indicating a total cost of &#163;254,014.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w10.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Instances of looting and burning by State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) forces or other authorities are rare in the majority of the country. However, in the areas where armed conflict continues there are numerous allegations of looting and burning of property, and other human rights abuse, by SPDC forces. We judge that some of these allegations are credible. Restrictions on travel by British embassy personnel in Rangoon makes it impossible to independently verify individual allegations.
<P>

<a name="40304w10.html_para8">A certain level of extortion is widespread throughout the country. At the lowest and most common level it includes the extraction of small sums of money, by police and military personnel, at roadside and other checkpoints. We are aware also of frequent instances where 'contributions' to local projects, entertainment for VIP guests, additional charges for electricity and other services, etc. are extracted from householders under threat of jail sentences or other punishment, by civilian authorities.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w10.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Karenni State has an estimated population of 259,000 people. It is one of the least developed areas in Burma. There are large numbers of people who suffer from deficiencies in food, shelter and protection (as there are in other parts of Burma).
<P>

<a name="40304w10.html_para12">Between two thirds and three quarters of the area of the state is believed to be under the control of various armed ethnic organisations who have reached ceasefire agreements with the State Peace and Development Council. Although many problems remain in these ceasefire areas, the situation for ordinary villagers is better than in the areas where armed conflict continues.
<P>

<a name="40304w10.html_para13">In the areas of Karenni State where armed conflict continues, food, shelter and protection needs are particularly severe. Population displacement means that the numbers of people involved is probably considerably less than a quarter of the state's population.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w10.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We are aware of reports of increased military activity in southern Karenni State since December 2003. We are also aware of reports of an associated increase in instances of human rights abuse and internally displaced people. Some estimates of numbers and disposition of troops are available. The most comprehensive of these are provided by the Karen People's Progressive Party and Karen National Union forces and publicised by groups such as the Free Burma Rangers. They state that up to 1,000 new troops have been brought into the region. Other evidence for increased activity in this area is quite strong. But independent verification of troop numbers is not possible.

 Teachers' threshold costs are part of a teacher's salary. They form only one element of a range of costs that have to be met from a school's budget. It is not possible to establish the precise reasons why a school's delegated budget is in deficit as there can be many factors involved.

<P>
<a name="40304w12.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 To date no element of Soccer Strategy money has been set aside for improvements to Windsor Park, Belfast. However, an indicative sum of &#163;3&nbsp;million is earmarked from Soccer Strategy money for playing facilities generally. The playing facilities component of the Soccer Strategy is currently being subjected to independent economic appraisal. Improvements to Windsor Park could be considered as part of that component. I will, though, wish to be satisfied that recommendations in relation to Governance and that accountability arrangements provide appropriate safeguards for public funds, before any element of Soccer Strategy money, including that for playing facilities, could be released.

<a name="40304w13.html_para0">The Department for Education and Skills, together with the Food Standards Agency, has taken forward a project looking at school meals in 80 secondary schools in England. The project is assessing the food provided; consumption; and nutrient intake. The project is also looking at the use of salt in food preparation and availability at meal times. The results of this research will be published late spring 2004, and will inform future policy decisions on this issue.

<a name="40304w13.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge  </B> 
<i>[holding answers 26&nbsp;January 2004 and 2&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> My Department has published information on its website in response to inquiries from schools about using video and photographic images of pupils in school publications, or on the internet. In brief, that advises that schools should obtain parental permission to publish images of pupils, they should not identify individual pupils, and that photographs of pupils should be kept secure.
<P>

<a name="40304w13.html_para1">We were told last year that some local authorities and schools had misinterpreted that advice: either applying it to the use of cameras and videos by parents when 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2004 : Column 1107W</I><P>
filming or photographing school events, or using it to form the basis of policies relating to the publication of photographs in local newspapers. As a result we revised the advice to make it clear that it does not apply to those areas and that schools and local education authorities are free to set their own policies about those issues in light of local circumstances and sensitivities.
<P>

<a name="40304w13.html_para2">The Newspaper Society and the Society of Editors recently raised concerns about some schools unwillingness to allow the publication of photographs of pupils in the local press. Representatives of both societies met with officials of my Department last week to discuss the issues and officials agreed to consider amplifying the information on the Department's website about that.

<P>
<a name="40304w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. Schools are free to install food and drink vending machines and collect income from them. We would encourage schools to consider doing this as part of a whole-school approach to promoting a healthy diet rather than for purely financial reasons, and to strike a sensible balance in the food and drink sold. This policy underlies the 'Food in Schools' initiative, which will include projects on healthier vending as announced on 5&nbsp;January 2004.

The data reflect the position at the end of each financial year. Data at 1&nbsp;March are not available. The answer refers to both mortgage-style and income-contingent loans.

<P>

<a name="40304w14.html_para2">The review has found that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that &#163;1.8 billion is too much to pay for the legacy services.

That is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has asked the Audit Commission to undertake detailed inspections of local authorities with high unit costs, to inform the Spending Review and funding allocations for 2005&#150;06.

 The 2004&#150;05 Supporting People grant allocations includes a one off revenue allocation for the current round of Housing Corporation capital awards.

 As explained in the Joint Statement issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in August 2003, the Government consider that leisure developments of regional significance are likely to provide a major contribution to regeneration, and therefore expects regional planning bodies to identify suitable broad locations for such uses, where they deem it appropriate.

<P>
<a name="40304w15.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has for regulations specifying that <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;alarms and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;sprinklers be present and functioning in all homes.  [158278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w15.html_spnew6"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's approach to the provision of smoke alarms is primarily based upon regulation for new and altered buildings and education for elsewhere. Since 1992, the guidance which supports the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations, known as Approved Document B, has suggested, in the case of new houses (including bungalows), that at least one electrically operated smoke detector should be provided on every storey. The requirement is enforced through the building control system.
<P>

<a name="40304w15.html_para1">For existing properties we pursue a policy of persuasion and education on the benefits of such devices. The Government have undertaken a number of national television campaigns promoting smoke alarm ownership and maintenance. This has been very successful. Ownership has increased from nine per cent. in 1987 to its present figure of 80&nbsp;per cent. of households.
<P>

<a name="40304w15.html_para2">In addition, Part 1 of the Housing Bill provides for the replacement of the housing fitness standards by the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), which brings a risk assessment approach to the assessment of hazards in housing, including fire. Where a hazard from fire has been assessed, local authorities will have discretion to require such things as adequate means of escape from fire, appropriate fire detection and alarm systems and sprinkler systems. This does not mean that such measures will be required in every building but they may be appropriate where justified by the risk.
<P>

<a name="40304w15.html_para3">In relation to sprinklers we commissioned, in April 2001, an extensive research project with the Building Research Establishment (BRE) to consider fully the effectiveness of residential sprinklers. BRE published their research in February and a summary document of the work can be found on the Building Regulations section of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website www.odpm.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="40304w15.html_para4">As part of our current review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be considering the findings of the BRE research to see if there is a case for introducing amendments that enable us to target the provision of sprinklers in those new and altered residential premises where the people are considered to be most vulnerable.

 Specific information on the number of existing homeless dwellings operating in Lancashire and the number of homeless dwellings to be built in Lancashire is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w15.html_spnew8"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 No such targets have been set centrally. Local authorities are however required under section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 to draw up housing strategies for their area and should include targets for affordable housing and other housing needs based on up to date survey information.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not provide funding directly to any Urban Regeneration Company (URC). All funding is provided by the partners in each URC. This usually comprises the local Regional Development Agency (RDA), the local authority or authorities, and English Partnerships (EP). The table below shows the estimated revenue funding provided/projected by EP and the various RDAs to the

 All National Health Service foundation trusts are required to have a majority of governors elected by members of the public and patient constituencies. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 requires all NHS foundation trusts to take steps to ensure that the membership is representative of those eligible to be members. The democratic process is designed to secure a balance of interests on the board of governors. In addition, NHS

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The total amount of central Government funds spent on health cannot be analysed by health authority area. Expenditure per capita is calculated on health authority areas from the expenditure reported in health authorities and related primary care trusts.<P>





2. The health authority and all England expenditure figures are not prepared on a consistent basis as some elements cannot be accounted for at the health authority level. The majority of general dental services expenditure and an element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is included in the England total but not in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules. This expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority respectively.<P>

3. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant health authorities, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts. Figures are given in cash terms.<P>

4. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities and primary care trusts.5. Figures for 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;2002 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. This is to ensure consistency between years. Figures for 2002&#150;2003 based on strategic health authority areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<P>

6. In many health authorities, there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:<P>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<P>

asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.<P>

7. For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what restrictions have been placed on bidders for the National Programme for Information Technology in the NHS making public statements about the project; whether these restrictions are usual Government practice; and what the reasons are for the restrictions.

<P>
<a name="40304w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Programme for Information Technology (NpfIT) in the national health service follows normal Government and commercial practice in regard to managing procurements and contracts and has drawn upon standard guidance from the Office of Government Commerce. This is available at www.ogc.gov.uk/sdtoolkit/reference/ogc library/procurement/cup59d.pdf. This precludes suppliers from

<P>

<a name="40304w18.html_para7">Contractors and employees of the programme are contractually required to comply with this protocol. The reasons for this are to ensure consistency, avoid confusion, and to enable any issues or proposals to be managed efficiently. It is also important to ensure that normal commercial and business rules of confidentiality are observed.

 There are no central plans to convert staff grade posts into consultant posts over the next 12 months. National health service trusts can, if they feel there is a need, make proposals to their postgraduate deanery to increase the numbers of locally funded specialist training posts. These may be funded by conversion of staff grade posts and may eventually lead to additional consultant posts.

The MoU establishes a framework for returns from the UK to Afghanistan. Since then, voluntary returns have commenced under the terms of that Memorandum, and from April 2003 regular enforced returns have been successfully implemented. We will continue to work with the Afghan Transitional Administration to ensure that returns to Afghanistan are sustainable.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the meeting on 16&nbsp;September 2003 between the Minister of State for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety and representatives of Naturewatch; and when he expects to hold a follow-up meeting with the Chief Constable of North Wales.  [157436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w22.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I very much welcomed the opportunity to meet representatives of Naturewatch to hear their concerns about the law and other issues in relation to badger-baiting. I made clear once again the Government's utter abhorrence of such practices. Primary responsibility for legislation on the protection of badgers rests with colleagues in Defra. I noted the concern of Naturewatch that there should be clear statistics as to the scale of abuse. Convictions of the main offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, which are imprisonable, are recordable on the Police National Computer. This allows information about 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2004 : Column 1141W</I><P>
offences and offenders to be shared among police forces. However, since the offences in the Act are among the great number which are triable only summarily, the proposition that they should be made notifiable for the purpose of crime statistics (which focus on offences triable on indictment) presents great problems. I made it clear that I would wish to take the views of the Chief Constable of North Wales, who leads on wildlife crime matters within the Association of Chief Police Officers, on other possible options. My officials have been in touch with him, and I am anxious that this work should be taken forward as quickly as possible.

[156723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w22.html_spnew2"><B> Caroline Flint </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> No such assessment has been made. There is no requirement to pay fixed penalty fines on the spot.
<P>

<a name="40304w22.html_para2">The provisions of the fixed penalty system for road traffic offences are set out in Part III of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991. The recipient of a fixed penalty notice has the option of paying the penalty within 28 days or requesting a court hearing if the issue of the notice is disputed.

<a name="40304w22.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government does not propose to commission such an analysis. It has conducted a lengthy consultation exercise on different options for implementing an identity cards scheme, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set out the benefits of an identity cards scheme in his statement to the House on 11&nbsp;November 2003 and his publication 'Identity Cards: The Next Steps' (CMD 6020) and we have announced that there will be a further opportunity for consultation when the draft Bill is published.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w22.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 An identity card scheme without a central register would have less protection against people establishing multiple identities than one where there was a single, highly verified record of identity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w22.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The Chinese Government has very strict conditions for re-documenting their citizens and will only accept their return once they have verified their exact identity. This causes problems for many countries that wish to repatriate Chinese illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers, as those who do not wish to return are careful to conceal their true identity. Chinese officials seconded to the Immigration Service have recently provided assistance in identifying Chinese nationals to enable their return. We are now working on an arrangement to make this assistance permanent.
<P>

<a name="40304w22.html_para4">We have made it clear to the Chinese that we urgently need to find a solution to the problem of re-documenting those who continue to conceal their identity in order to frustrate return, and are working together to find a way forward to enable us to significantly increase returns to China.
<P>

<a name="40304w22.html_para5">My understanding is that activity by the Immigration Service on the Wirral in October 2002, in King's Lynn in the summer of 2003, and in the Morecambe Bay area in August 2003 has not led to any prosecutions against any individuals under immigration law. Although 120 Chinese nationals were interviewed by the Immigration Service on those occasions, they were not willing to provide evidence which could be used to support a prosecution against those who may have facilitated their entry into the United Kingdom or employed them illegally.
<P>

<a name="40304w22.html_para6">To date one of these Chinese nationals who had committed an immigration offence has been removed from the United Kingdom and two are in detention awaiting issue of travel documents and removal.

<a name="40304w23.html_para1">Information about the number of training places is not held centrally, however, the SIA has received assurances from the awarding bodies that there will be sufficient capacity to meet demand in any given region prior to the onset of licensing in that region.
<P>

<a name="40304w23.html_para2">As at 13&nbsp;February 2004, 137 individuals have successfully completed the SIA approved training course in Hampshire and the Isle of White and it is estimated that a further 300 meet the SIA competency requirements by virtue of their existing recognised training qualifications. These figures are subject to constant change as the rollout progresses.
<P>

<a name="40304w23.html_para3">Responsibility for ensuring that there are sufficient door supervisors to meet demand lies with the leisure industry and door supervisor providers. Under the provisions of the Licensing Act 2003, local authorities will be able to require that a specified number of SIA licensed door supervisors will be on duty at specified times as a condition of a premises licence. The SIA are continuing their communications campaigns to ensure the industry are aware of their responsibilities, and to encourage the highest level of participation in the scheme. With the SIA, we will monitor carefully the impact of licensing on the supply of door supervisors.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received about the advice given in PPG8: Telecommunications, that where proposals to locate telecommunications masts meet with the standards of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, it should not be necessary for a local planning authority to consider further health effects of the proposal.

 The number of traffic wardens employed by each of the police authorities in England and Wales for the last four years is given in the table, which also shows the percentage increase or decrease in numbers between the first and last years. Figures for the years prior to 1999&#150;2000 are not recorded centrally.

Many have now done so, and this has helped lead to a marked decline in traffic warden numbers.

<a name="40304w24.html_para3">My Department commissioned research on the effectiveness of cycle helmets, including the relative risk of injury to cyclists with and without helmets, by way of a literature review, and this was published in November 2002 (Road Safety Research Report No.30), a copy of which was placed in the Library. The conclusion from the review was that helmets have been found to be effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injury, particularly for children. A fully quantified cost benefit review comparing the effectiveness of helmets and other methods of reducing risk to cyclists is not possible since many measures, such as education, training and publicity, are not fully quantifiable. The Department therefore pursues a comprehensive package of measures. This is proving effective, and deaths and serious injuries to cyclists in 2002 were 34&nbsp;per cent. down compared with the 1994&#150;98 baseline for our Road Safety Strategy.
<P>

<a name="40304w24.html_para4">Our casualty data does not allow us to monitor the number and severity of head injuries due to increased use of helmets because it does not identify injury by specific parts of the body. However, in addition to the periodic monitoring we carry out of the wearing rates for cycling helmets, we plan to initiate further research to explore the possible relationship between cycling casualties and cycling levels to throw further light on this subject.

 We have allocated Herefordshire Council just over &#163;11&nbsp;million to spend on local transport schemes throughout the district in 2004&#150;05 under the Council's Local Transport Plan (LTP) which includes measures to increase cycle usage. The Council's last annual progress report on its LTP showed a 4.8&nbsp;per cent. increase in cycling in 2002&#150;03. Hereford is also one of the seven shortlisted towns looking for support from the Department for a sustainable travel town initiative. Two towns will soon be selected to apply a package of measures to promote not only cycling, but also walking and public transport. We have budgeted &#163;7.5&nbsp;million for this initiative, which will run for five years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Under the Strategic Rail Authority's new franchise agreement with Go Via, capacity will be increased when a new fleet of trains is provided on South Central services from 2005. The two-year extension of the Thameslink franchise, effective from 1&nbsp;April 2004, incorporates an option to provide additional capacity and services primarily on the Wimbledon loop where the route is most constrained. This proposal is subject to securing additional rolling stock and meeting value for money and affordability considerations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 There is no definition for crowding on the railways. However, all rail operators are required to provide a frequency of service and adequate capacity to prevent excessive crowding and to have in place strategies for dealing with regular systematic crowding when it occurs.

[156171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40304w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Carriages capable of reuse are principally those being replaced by new trains on cross country and the west coast main line. Primary responsibility for deciding their future use, if any, lies with their owners and operators. However, the Strategic Rail Authority's Rolling Stock Strategy encourages the cascading of surplus carriages to other uses and there have already been cases where this has happened. The number in storage at any one time fluctuates as vehicles are progressively withdrawn from service and others are redeployed or scrapped.

 Passenger Transport Authorities as local authorities are precluded from being franchisees by Section 25 of the Railways Act 1993. Only where a rail network has been designated as exempt from franchising, as with the Merseyrail network, can a Passenger Transport Authority be considered to run services on that network. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in his statement to the House on 19&nbsp;January that the current rail review would consider the scope for devolving more decision-making to the Passenger Transport Executives.

<a name="40304w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Integrated Transport block and maintenance allocations are issued as part of the Single Capital Pot and are unringfenced to give authorities greater flexibility over how they spend their funds. Local authorities may spend the funding as they wish on the services they provide in line with local priorities and in order to deliver the targets in their local transport plans (LTPs). When we are considering future capital allocations for local authorities, one of the factors taken into account is how local authorities have spent their LTP allocations and their performance in delivering their targets.
<P>
