It is important to note that the failure of any part of the Community Budget to gain a positive Statement of Assurance does not mean that the whole of that part of the budget was misspent.

In this context, the Government are committed to a dialogue with the financial services industry to ensure that FSAP and other measures are implemented in an effective, proportionate and consistent way.

<p><a name="50127w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s consultation paper&#151;&quot;Devolving Decision Making: A Consultation on Regional Funding Allocations&quot;&#151;set out our proposals to establish regional transport funding allocations. The consultation paper explained that funding decisions on routes of national and international significance would continue to be made on a national basis. To be regarded as such, a route has to satisfy all of the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">To have average daily traffic flows, along the length of the route, of more than 60,000 vehicles</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w03.html_para0">
In some marginal cases we applied these criteria with a degree of flexibility. However, the A3 satisfies just one of the criteria: it provides a link between London and the port of Portsmouth. Consequently, for the purposes of future regional decision-making, the consultation paper proposes that it should be regarded as a route of regional significance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w03.html_para1">
The current ministerial team and I have not visited Hindhead, but we appreciate that improvement of the A3 at this site will deal with a significant bottleneck.

The prevailing permit price in the market could be interpreted to represent the abatement cost to achieve this level of emission reductions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w03.html_para14">
For the UK, analysis by the DTI of the power station sector indicates that, during phase 1 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (2005 to 2007) reductions of around 4MtCO <sub>2</sub>  per annum could be achieved at a carbon price of around &#8364;5 per tonne of CO <sub>2</sub> . This price is lower than that which has recently prevailed in the market. It is possible however that there may be physical limitations on the amount of achievable savings in the near term.
</p>


<p>

The Government&#039;s plans include improvements in the information available to parents and greater use of methods such as the Collaborative Law model, mediation, in-court conciliation and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project. The Government intend strongly to promote these methods as better ways to reach agreement than through contested court hearings. All publicly funded clients will have to show that they have considered mediation. Lawyers will not be funded by legal aid if out of court settlement is not reached under the collaborative law scheme. In addition, the Government, senior judiciary and Rules Committee plan to review court rules and practice directions so that the strongest possible encouragement is given to parties to participate in forms of dispute resolution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w05.html_para2">
We do not plan to make these schemes compulsory in every case, as an essential part of the process is that people come to them voluntarily and are therefore willing to participate. Further, in some cases, including those where domestic violence has been an issue, it would not always be appropriate to impose mediation on separating parents.

Records are not kept of either amended fire certificates issued or outstanding applications for amended certificates. Any amended certificates issued are counted in with fire certificates issued. In respect of outstanding applications for amended certificates, there is no statutory requirement for owners/occupiers of certificated premises to apply for amended certificates. Section 8 of the Fire Precautions Act requires the owner/occupier to inform the fire authority of any material structural changes to the building. The fire authority then has a duty, if satisfied with the proposals, either to amend the fire certificate or issue a new one.

 In response to concerns raised by a number of local authorities, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertook an assessment of the potential knock on effects of the then Licensing Bill, including additional street cleansing costs, in 2003. Despite consulting 18 local authorities, the Local Government Association and the Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government, it proved impossible to produce robust evidence of any additional street cleansing costs. The available evidence was inconclusive on whether there would be an overall cost to local government. We continue to examine and monitor the situation.

During the recent discussions about the 2005&#150;06 Local Government Finance Settlement, of the 233 representations received from local authorities, 21 made some reference to the impact of the Licensing Act.

Funding for street cleaning is provided through the local government finance settlement. Total support from Government grant and business rates in 2005&#150;06 will be &#163;60.1 billion. That is &#163;3.5 billion, or 6.3 per cent., more than in 2004&#150;05. We believe that this substantial investment in local government and the scope for efficiency gains addresses the pressures faced by local government. There is no excuse for excessive increases in council tax.

However, since April 2004 offenders in Hartlepool charged with certain trigger offences known to be commonly committed by drug users have been tested for opiates and cocaine/crack as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. Between April and December 2004 a total of 588 offenders were tested and just over half (55 per cent.) of them tested positive for opiates or cocaine/crack. This gives some indication of the proportion of property crime that may be linked to drug use, although it should be noted that not all crime by drug users is necessarily committed to support their habit.

<p><a name="50127w09.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Each case is decided on its individual merits. Where there has been a recommendation by the Court for deportation, there is a presumption that, save in .the most exceptional circumstances, the recommendation will be enforced. All cases, including those whose deportation is considered to be conducive to the public good, are considered under the provisions of paragraph 364 of HC 395 &quot;Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules&quot;. This includes age, length of residence and strength of connections in the United Kingdom, personal history, domestic circumstances, previous criminal record, compassionate circumstances and any representations received. Should any one or a combination of these factors outweigh the public interest, deportation would not proceed.

Work will continue on the implementation and evaluation of the Tampere agenda, and begin on the new multi-annual work programme (the &quot;Hague Programme&quot;) which will take forward the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. In line with the Hague Programme, priority will also be given to developing a coherent external dimension of this work through enhanced cooperation with third countries, groups of countries and regions.

<p><a name="50127w10.html_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 A joint statement issued in April 2004 by representatives of many important faith communities in Britain urged the Government to legislate against incitement to religious hatred as soon as possible. An updated version of this statement with additional signatories was issued in January 2005. The statement reaffirms the belief of the bodies represented that the measure is necessary to remedy an unjust and anomalous gap in the present law whereby racial groups are protected from incited hatred whereas religious groups are not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w10.html_para2">
The Home Office has received representations from a number of religious groups who have concerns about aspects of the proposed measure. These concerns have focused around the extent to which the legislation might in certain circumstances inhibit the freedom to worship and to proselytise. There have also been concerns expressed by groups such as humanists and secularists that the law would not catch incited hatred against groups holding non-religious beliefs. The Home Office has met representatives of these groups and will continue to work to allay their concerns.

 Information published by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance indicates that countries with legislation of this kind include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France Germany, Greece and Italy. The state of Victoria in Australia also has legislation on this subject. The details of legislation vary, as one would expect. For example, the offence in Victoria has a lower threshold and wider scope than the Government are proposing for this country.

As regards effectiveness, while it is useful to look for similar provisions in other jurisdictions, we share the view of the House of Lords Select Committee which in its Report on Religious Offences in England and Wales (April 2003) concluded that &quot;Whilst it is possible to describe the offences that exist in different jurisdictions with some accuracy assessing their efficacy is much more difficult.&#039;

Data for 1999&#150;2000 could only be provided at a disproportionate cost. Countries not included in the table have not received PRBS. Note, DFID spends some of its funds through multilateral agencies, some of which also distribute direct budget support. While we impute a notional &quot;share&quot; of money we give to the EC, World Bank or other agencies as being spent in individual countries, we are not able to split this down further to show how much is spent as direct budget support.

 In 1999&#150;2000, DFID provided one consultancy for project management services under the Government of Ghana&#039;s Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD). The role of the project team was to: draw up technical and procurement specifications for the replacement payroll system; improve the quality of payroll data; provide advice and training in payroll implementation; and provide technical support to keep the old payroll system running. DFID also funded a separate two-week procurement mission prior to the purchase of equipment for the project.

 DFID has approved &#163;16.4 million to help the Government of Vietnam prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam. This support began in January 2004 and will, over a 5-year period, seek to raise the level of protection of high-risk groups by promoting condom use, and use advertising campaigns to get HIV/AIDS prevention messages across to the country at large. It is too early to gauge results a year in, but around 40 million condoms were distributed to selected sites in 2004 which is expected to help reduce the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS among high-risk groups. This support is co-financed with the Norwegian Government and managed by the World Health Organisation and the Vietnamese Ministry of Health.

DFID, together with other key donors has established a co-ordination mechanism to help promote the UNAIDS &quot;Three Ones&quot; approach to tackling HIV/AIDS (that is &quot;One&quot; action framework, &quot;One&quot; national coordinating authority, and &quot;One&quot; national monitoring and evaluation system.

<p><a name="50127w15.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Following the launch of the Learning Age Green Paper (DfEE 1998) we did pump prime an initiative known as the Graduate Apprenticeship. These combined a higher education qualification (honours degree or higher) with structured work based learning underpinned by key skills and national vocational qualifications units. This early work provided a useful platform for developing foundation degrees which are now the main vehicle we have for expanding vocational higher education opportunities. They are designed with employers and combine work based learning with academic study. Since they were introduced in 2001 they have grown in popularity and there are currently 37,000 students on these programmes studying either full time or part time, including those studying with the backing of their employer. We are also working with HEFCE, the LSC and Sector Skills Councils at ways of strengthening progression for apprenticeships into higher education, including through foundation degrees, and we&#039;re still working with those sectors who feel there is still scope for a level 4 apprenticeship.

 The information requested is submitted to the Department according to local education authority areas, rather than districts within an LEA. Nottingham, North forms part of City of Nottingham LEA. The information is contained within the following table:

<br>
<br>

<sup>(31)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

<sup>(32)</sup> 1997&#150;98 financial data are taken from (pre local government reorganisation) Nottinghamshire LEA&#039;s Revenue Outturn spending return submitted to the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. 2003&#150;04 financial data are taken from City of Nottingham LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement (Table 



A) submitted to the Department for Education and Skills. 2003&#150;04 data remains provisional and is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup> Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including these under fives funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under five pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included in the 2003&#150;04 pupil count. Other LEA maintained pupils includes ail pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from the form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(34)</sup> Financial data is collected at local authority level and not constituency level and as such the figures provided are for City of Nottingham LEA. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Nottinghamshire LEA was split into City of Nottingham LEA and Nottinghamshire LEA As a result, the 1997&#150;98 data is for pre-LGR Nottinghamshire LEA and the 2003&#150;04 data is for City of Nottingham LEA.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 as at 24 January 2004.<br>

Information relating to Foyle Community Health and Social Services Trust and Sperrin Lakeland Health and Social Services Trust are based on numbers of persons waiting for treatment, as opposed to initial assessment, by a podiatrist, although in most cases assessment and treatment take place on the same day.<br>





Southern Health and Social Services Board area Trusts do not hold official waiting list figures, although in some trusts this information is recorded by professional staff. Any data collected are held on manual systems and could be provided only at disproportionate cost because of the time required to extract the information.<br>

<p><a name="50127w24.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to her answer of 15 December 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1124W, on the EU constitution, whether such a legal basis exists within the European Communities treaties.  [207140]</p>




<p><a name="50127w24.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 Article III-122 of the proposed constitutional treaty would provide a legal basis for European laws defining the principles and conditions enabling services of general economic interest to fulfil their missions, without prejudice to the competence of member states, in compliance with the constitution, to provide, to commission and to fund such services. There is presently EC competence to legislate on services of general economic interest within the current European community treaty, for example, in Articles 71 and 80(2) (transport), 95 (internal market approximation measures) and 156 (trans-European networks). A measure under Article III-122 could deal with the principles and conditions referred to above across a range of services of general economic interest; to do this under the current European community treaty would require assembling sectoral legal bases or restricting the measure to approximation provisions. Any new law made under Article III-122 would be adopted on the basis of qualified majority voting and co-decision with the European Parliament. Article III-122 explicitly maintains the competence of member states in the key areas of providing, commissioning and funding services of general economic interest.
</p>





<p><a name="50127w24.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to her Answer of 15 December 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1124W, on the EU Constitution, what the definition is of services of general economic interest; and if she will make a statement on the effect of the provisions of the EU Constitutional Treaty on the competence of <i>(a)</i> member states and <i>(b)</i> the European Commission in respect of such services.  [207284]</p>




<p><a name="50127w24.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 There is neither a UK- nor EU- level legal definition of services of general economic interest (SGEIs), although the term &quot;services of general economic interest&quot; can be found in Articles 16 and 86 of the EC Treaty. However, the European Commission states in its White Paper on Services of General Interest (COM (2004) 374 final) that there is broad agreement that the term SGEIs &quot;refers to services of an economic nature which the member states or the Community subject to specific public service obligations by virtue of a general interest criterion&quot;. In ECJ case C-l79/90, the court said that SGEIs &quot;were services which exhibited a general economic interest with special characteristics compared with those offered by other economic activities&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w24.html_para2">
The EC Treaty presently gives the European Commission competence to bring forward proposals for EC legislation on SGEIs under sectoral legal bases, for example Articles 71 and 80(2) (transport) or 156 (trans-european networks), or under Article 95 (internal market approximation measures). Such proposals could 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Jan 2005 : Column 532W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
define the principles and conditions enabling SGEIs to fulfil their missions. A Commission proposal for legislation on SGEIs would have to be compliant with the EC Treaty&#039;s provisions, such as internal market requirements, and could not infringe on member states&#039; competence to provide, to commission and to fund these services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w24.html_para3">
The Constitutional Treaty would give the Commission an additional legal basis under which the Commission could bring forward a proposal for legislation on SGEIs at a horizontal level. However, a commission proposal on SGEIs under this legal base would also have to be compliant with the EC Treaty&#039;s provision, such as internal market requirements, and Article III-122 explicitly maintains the competence of member states in the key areas of providing, commissioning and funding services of general economic interest.

<p><a name="50127w24.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The detailed provisions relating to this objective are contained in Articles III-248&#150;255 of the Treaty. These largely reflect the existing EC competence in this area, with the addition of an explicit reference to space policy. The Article&#039;s set out the European Union&#039;s aim to achieve a European Research Area, improve the EU&#039;s competitiveness in science and technology and ensure EU policies are properly supported by research. They also outline a list of activities to support these aims. As with the rest of the Treaty, any action in this area is also subject to the application of the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity. In addition, any action would be subject to the constraints of the EU budget.

 Between 1 May 2003 and 26 November 2004, Significant Incident reports and Significant Action reports indicate that United Kingdom forces in Iraq encountered a number of Iraqi casualties. The figures drawn from those reports are not an accurate estimate of Iraqi casualties, either those caused by UK forces or those caused by insurgent activities, and should not be taken as such. They apply only to casualties which were witnessed or discovered by UK forces, and give no indication of casualties outside the UK&#039;s areas of operations in South East Iraq, although they also cover the Black Watch deployment to the North Babil area in November 2004. UK forces are not always present at all incidents which result in Iraqi civilian casualties, and following hostile contacts they are not always able to make an accurate count of Iraqi casualties, either because they have withdrawn from the area, or because such casualties have been removed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w27.html_para1">
These reports indicate that 200 Iraqis believed to have been enemy combatants have died, and 80 have been injured, in incidents where military force was deliberately applied by UK forces. Five Iraqis believed not to have been enemy combatants have died, and a further 13 have been injured, in incidents during the course of which military force was deliberately applied by UK forces. These figures do not necessarily indicate that UK forces caused the casualties, but merely that they recorded them during the course of incidents in which deliberate military force was applied.

Reports indicate that 17 Iraqis believed to have been enemy combatants have died, and 22 have been injured, during the course of other incidents, 144 Iraqis believed not to have been enemy combatants have died, and 192 have been injured, during the course of other incidents. This includes the full range of incidents in which UK forces have been involved, or to which UK forces have been called, but where no deliberate military force was applied. This includes improvised explosive device attacks by insurgent forces on civilian targets, road traffic accidents and in one case the discovery in May 2003 of a mass grave, thought to date back to 1991, containing 32 dead.

 Where people who have already obtained a satisfactory Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) disclosure move to a new position which involves contact with adult service users, they are required to obtain another CRB check.
