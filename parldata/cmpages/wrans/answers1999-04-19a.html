 I refer my hon. Friend to the written answer given to him by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office on 14 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>239-40</i>.

<a name="90419w01.htm_sbhd2"><H4><center>Glidewell Report</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Golding: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what decisions he has taken on the recommendations on file preparation, case management and witness warning in the report of the Review of the Crown Prosecution Service by the right hon. Sir Iain Glidewell.  [81491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The interim response to the Report by Sir Iain Glidewell which I published on 30 November 1998 drew attention to the fact that these key recommendations (recommendations 13-16, 20 and 31) were being considered by a newly formed Criminal Justice Units Project Group, chaired jointly by the CPS and the Association of Police Officers. The Project Group, which also included representatives from other agencies and an independent member, has now completed its consideration of the Report's recommendations, and has made proposals for taking them forward.
<P>

<a name="90419w01.htm_para0">The Project Group has proposed that there should be a national model for joint administration, which incorporates the principles of flexibility and partnership and which builds on the arrangements currently being piloted to reduce delays under the Narey Reducing Delays initiative. It is important, as the Report recognises, that the new arrangements provide flexibility, so that Chief Crown Prosecutors and Chief Constables can develop local solutions jointly.
<P>

<a name="90419w01.htm_para1">The Government have decided to accept this proposal. This partnership approach between the CPS and the police, reflecting the principles advocated by Glidewell 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 1999 : Column: 398</I><P>
and incorporating elements of co-location, common administration and integrated working, will provide the framework for better working relationships between CPS staff and operational police officers and ensure that the work of both agencies is more effective. It will further streamline casework and file handling processes, remove duplication and unnecessary burdens, and reduce delay.
<P>

<a name="90419w01.htm_para2">The new model for joint administration will also enable the police and the CPS to provide a better service to victims and witnesses, building on established arrangements and maintaining the co-ordination of victim and witness care.
<P>

<a name="90419w01.htm_para3">A feature of the new arrangements is that the police will retain their responsibility for file preparation and witness warning, and that accordingly these responsibilities should not be transferred to the CPS as recommended by Glidewell. The Government have decided that it would not be practical, or a proper reflection of the respective constitutional priorities of the CPS and the police, to require a transfer of responsibilities. The new arrangements will, however, ensure closer co-operation between the police and the CPS and improved file preparation.
<P>

<a name="90419w01.htm_para4">Chief Crown Prosecutors and Chief Constables will be asked to submit joint outline implementation plans by the end of November 1999 to a new inter-agency implementation group which we are setting up to oversee these new arrangements.

I took advice from the Military Survey Agency on the average height above sea level for the Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency. Based on the mean of the highest and lowest points in the area, which are at Blindstones (541 metres) and Wellihole Bridge (148 metres) respectively, this is 344.5 metres.

<a name="90419w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the integration of the frigate Somerset into a French-led naval group off Kosovo, with particular reference to the role of (i) the WEU, (ii) NATO and (iii) the St. Malo Accords in the formulation of this policy.  [81045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 HMS Somerset has been attached to the French Task Group, led by the French aircraft carrier FOCH, since 14 February and is scheduled to revert to national tasking shortly. The integration of Somerset was at the invitation of the French authorities immediately following the St. Malo Summit. Initially scheduled as a training mission to the Indian Ocean, the Task Group was diverted for operations in the Adriatic following the deterioration of the situation in Kosovo. The integration is purely a bilateral arrangement between the UK and France and has no particular reference to WEU or NATO.
<P>

<a name="90419w02.htm_para0">The concept of a combined deployment is very much in the spirit of closer military co-operation between the UK and France, reinforced by the signing of the Letter of Intent at the St. Malo Summit in December 1998. It also takes forward the navy-to-navy Letter of Intent signed in 1996, which tasked our two navies

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>

"to continue to investigate the possibilities for the attachment of units for extended periods".
The integration is an excellent means to further strengthen our bilateral links and provides a practical dimension to the present debate on European security and defence.

<P>
<a name="90419w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.




<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 1999 : Column: 402</I><P>

No such representations have been received.
<P>

<a name="90419w02.htm_para1">On discharge from the forces, former service personnel who are sick or disabled can claim Incapacity Benefit. The short-term higher rate of Incapacity Benefit is payable after 28 weeks and the long-term rate after 52 weeks.
<P>

<a name="90419w02.htm_para2">Periods of sickness before discharge do not count towards the qualifying periods for the higher rates of Incapacity Benefit. Rules do, however, protect potential entitlement to the age addition payable with long-term Incapacity Benefit. For former members of the forces, it is the earliest date that the person became sick that is relevant in deciding entitlement to the age addition.

 The football authorities are responsible for the development of football in this country. The Football Association has developed coaching courses for coaches, teachers and those connected with junior football teams. These courses include in their curricula teaching and coaching techniques and principles of play, together with first aid training. The FA lays down specific requirements for those working in Centres of Excellence and Football Academies to hold the relevant qualifications. As part of the 'Charter for Quality', the FA will be introducing at the end of 1999 a national, voluntary, kite-mark scheme of 'Chartermark' clubs to recognise clubs in junior football that meet specific conditions, including the requirement that junior managers and coaches hold FA approved first aid and coaching qualifications.

 The Mandate of the UN Preventative Force (UNPREDEP) expired on 28 February 1999 because there was no consensus within the UN Security Council to renew its mandate. Its role was entirely separate from that of the NATO forces in Macedonia. As there was no UK contingent in UNPPREDEP, its demise has had no effect on the build-up of UK forces in Macedonia.

 The St. Malo Summit identified a broad variety of areas for enhanced Franco-British co-operation: European defence, crisis management, common foreign and security policy, Africa, EU institutions, integrated transport issues, duty free, the entrepreneurship taskforce, the millennium bug, the Franco-British electronic village, dialogue 2000, Paris-London 2000, the audio-visual working group, and this year's British-French summit. The pace of progress will differ from subject to subject, but the summit gave considerable impetus to a closer relationship, and work is ongoing in these and other areas to ensure that there is the closest bilateral engagement.
<P>

<a name="90419w03.htm_para0">In some aspects this has already yielded concrete progress--for example, the proposed joint Foreign Ministers' visit and Heads of Mission Conference in Africa took place in February and proved the effectiveness of such shared contacts on African issues.

When we became aware recently that the Chilean Government were considering publishing a decree prohibiting Chilean carriers from flying to the Falklands, we told them that we would strongly regret such a measure. We are very disappointed that they have nevertheless published such a decree. Lan Chile have not been able to fly to the Islands since their contract with the Falkland Islands Development Corporation expired on 31 March. While we hope that they will be allowed to resume the flights, other options are under consideration. We are in close touch with the Falkland Islands Government on this.

 The issue of repatriation of powers from the EU to Member States was not on the agenda for either the Maastricht or Amsterdam IGCs.
<P>

<a name="90419w03.htm_para1">The Maastricht Treaty, however, introduced the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality into EC law, both of which were given further effect by the Protocol agreed at Amsterdam. The principle of subsidiarity aims to ensure that decisions are taken at the most appropriate level in areas of shared competence between the EC and Member States. Its application is one way of ensuring that decisions are taken as close to the citizen as possible.

<P>
<a name="90419w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 requires every local authority periodically to review air quality in its area.

<P>

<a name="90419w04.htm_para2">The Government recently published their proposals for review of the National Air Quality Strategy (NAQS), and, in particular, their proposals for revised and additional objectives for the pollutants. During the review process, as a result of the better understanding of the sources and types of particles in the UK provided by the work of the Airborne Particles Expert Group, it became apparent that the current PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  objective would not be achievable in a number of local authority areas with any measures that are currently practicable. The Group's work also revealed 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 1999 : Column: 410</I><P>
the importance of non-UK sources and the limit to which local authority action could control levels of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> . The Government are therefore consulting on a proposal to replace the objective with the Stage 1 limit values in the EC Air Quality Daughter Directive, while retaining it as an indicative level. Discussions are also in progress with the UK's EC partners to explore ways of reducing the transboundary particle problem.
<P>

<a name="90419w04.htm_para3">Should the Government decide to proceed with their proposal, such a change would have significant implications for the scale of work local authorities would need to undertake on the review and assessment of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  and the conclusions they reach. To help local authorities, and without prejudice to the outcome of the consultation process, my officials have written to local authorities with further information on how they might proceed with the review and assessment process ahead of a decision on the Strategy review.

They expect the second section (from Fawkham Junction to St. Pancras) to be completed in 2007.

 There should be no difference apart from one of scale. The genetically modified crops in the farm-scale evaluations will be grown under normal commercial conditions following the suppliers' recommendations and requirements for the use of seed and herbicide.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in respect of the &#163;50 million allocated in the 1998 Budget for rural bus services, how much has been spent, how much has been allocated but not yet spent, and how many extra bus journeys have run as a consequence of this extra money.  [81264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w05.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Of the &#163;50 million a year for rural transport in the United Kingdom announced in the 1998 Budget, &#163;37.5 million a year was allocated for rural bus services in England. Final figures for actual spend in 1998-99 are not yet available but local authorities have previously estimated that they would spend &#163;25 million in that financial year, reflecting the fact that less than a full year was available for spend.

<P>

<a name="90419w05.htm_para0">Results from an interim survey of local authorities shows that by the end of 1998-99 over 550 new services are being operated as a result of the new finance, with a further 740 services improved in frequency or coverage.

 The Government have provided &#163;4.2 million per annum for the Rural Transport Partnership scheme. The overarching aim of the scheme is to promote social inclusion by enhancing rural transport services and securing a long-term improvement in the accessibility of rural people to jobs, services and social activity. The Countryside Agency is working to stimulate interest in the scheme and is providing advice to prospective partnerships. A number of schemes have been accepted for funding, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of these partnerships soon.

 Action to reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from transport is a key element of our approach to tackling climate change. Since coming into office, this Government have taken a number of measures designed to reduce transport CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. These include the integrated transport measures detailed in last year's White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport", the proposed reforms of vehicle excise duty and company car taxation, and also raising the annual increase in fuel duty to 6 per cent. In addition, we fully support the European Union's strategy for reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from cars, including the voluntary agreement with European car manufacturers, which commits them to a 25 per cent. reduction in average new car fuel consumption by 2008.

 In September 1998 we announced an investment of &#163;50 million from the Modernisation Fund to support initiatives which widen access to nursing and midwifery diploma programmes. This funding is for the period 1999 to 2002 and covers the costs of enabling enrolled nurses to retrain/upgrade their qualifications and return to the National Health Service. The funding will also enable existing NHS staff (previously only available for Health Care Assistants) to access pre-registration nursing and midwifery diploma programmes. The cost of expanding part time and flexible pre-registration nursing and midwifery diploma programmes is also being met from this investment in order to give those who might not normally be able to access nursing and midwifery education, for example those with family responsibilities, the opportunity to do so.

 <i>[holding answer 13 April 1999]:</i> There have been a total of 1,333 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) made via the UK spontaneous reporting scheme (the Yellow Card Scheme) associated with lamotrigine, of which 42 were fatal. Eighteen of the fatalities were associated with convulsions (the condition for which the drug was prescribed) and therefore it is difficult to establish what role, if any, the drug played in these cases. In general, doctors are asked to report suspected adverse drug reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme and therefore it is not possible to definitely attribute causality. Factors such as the patients' underlying illnesses and other medication may have contributed to the reactions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the rate at which a tax credit for pre-school children could have been introduced into the proposed working families tax credit if it were to be financed by not introducing the proposed childcare tax credit.  [76100]<P>

<a name="90419w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The cost of the childcare tax credit in the Working Families Tax Credit is estimated to be about &#163;200 million in 2000-01, the first full year of the tax credit. If the childcare tax credit within Working Families Tax Credit was not introduced and the money spent instead on an additional tax credit for children under 5, then, taking into account reductions in income related benefits, the credit could be set at about &#163;5 a week on top of the rates announced by the Chancellor in the Budget.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if it is the Inland Revenue's policy to warn taxpayers that they are likely to issue a section 20 Taxes Management Act 1970 notice in circumstances where a taxpayer appeals against a section 19A Taxes Management Act 1970 notice for information.  [80256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w08.htm_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The powers in section 19A and section 20 Taxes Management Act 1970 are not mutually exclusive. However, the Inland Revenue would not normally issue a notice under section 20 in order to obtain information that they had failed to obtain under section 19A. Very rarely, it might become clear, after the taxpayer had appealed against a section 19A notice, that section 20 was in fact the more appropriate section to use. A notice under section 20 cannot be issued by an inspector unless the taxpayer has failed to take an opportunity to provide the information voluntarily, and may be issued only with the consent of an independent Appeal Commissioner.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w08.htm_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In 1997-98 the Revenue made 2.180 million self assessment repayments and a further 2.812 million in 1998-99, totalling &#163;1.536 billion and &#163;2.431 billion respectively. The Revenue has processes in place designed to ensure that its staff accurately capture information from returns on to their computer systems. It also has processes in place designed specifically to risk assess repayments both before and after they are issued. It has no evidence to suggest that tax was over or under repaid as a result of processing errors in other than a very small number of cases.

 This is a matter for the legal professional bodies. The rules of the Bar Council and the Law Society prohibit such arrangements. The Bar Council has no current plans for change. The Law Society issued a consultation paper in October 1998 on the possibility of allowing solicitors to enter multi-disciplinary partnerships; the responses are currently being analysed. Under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, it could fall to the Lord Chancellor and the designated judges to approve any proposed changes to those rules, if such changes came into the scope of Schedule 4 of that Act.

 Government plans for the handling of complaints about members of the legal professional bodies were announced during the Second Reading of the Access to Justice Bill on 14 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 230-325. There is currently a good deal of public concern that the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors is failing to deal adequately with complaints. The Government share this concern. We therefore propose to establish a new post with the responsibility for setting targets for complaints handling and making recommendations about complaints systems. These powers would, however, be held in reserve unless and until the professions are seen not to be making real progress; that progress will be measured against targets which the bodies would be encouraged to set. The new powers would cover all the authorised bodies including the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Institute of Legal Executives.

<a name="90419w11.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list by local education authority <i>(a)</i> how many Key Stage One and Key Stage Two pupils in maintained schools were being educated in the same class in January 1999 and <i>(b)</i> how many pupils were being educated in mixed year group classes in maintained primary schools in January 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 1999]:</i> Information about the number of Key Stage One and Key Stage Two pupils who are being educated in the same class is not collected centrally. However, the following table shows the number of mixed Key Stage classes in primary schools in January 1999. This will include some mixed Key Stage Two and Key Stage Three classes. The proportion of pupils in mixed year classes has fallen in primary schools from 27 per cent. in 1998 to 26 per cent. in 1999.

Officials are now giving urgent consideration to the material provided to enable my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to make a decision as soon as possible.

 I have received a great many representations from within and outside of the meat industry on the proposed level of Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) charges for 1999-2000. The level of MHS charges to apply in 1999-2000 for hygiene/welfare inspection and for the enforcement of Specified Risk Material controls has yet to be decided. Ministers are still carefully considering proposals made by the MHS to ensure that they are fully cost justified. They will then be subject to full consultation with all plant operators. The results of the consultation will be reported back to Ministers who will then take final decisions on the level of rates to apply and their operative date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w12.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Producers who meet strictly defined criteria may apply to the appropriate category of the Suckler Cow Quota national reserve for a quota allocation. Some of the categories cover new entrants and other existing producers wanting extra quota. There is no category which specifically covers dairy farmers seeking to convert to suckler production, although such producers may qualify under a category for first-time claimants. In addition, both new and existing producers are free to buy or lease quota from other producers.
<P>

<a name="90419w12.htm_para0">The maximum amount of quota which may be allocated varies depending on the category applied to, the circumstances of the applicant and the availability of quota in the reserve. There are no rules governing the minimum amounts which may be allocated to a producer, but it is not possible to allocate less than 0.1 of a quota.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w13.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> The responsibility for agriculture and food issues--including those relating to genetically modified crops and foods--rests primarily with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<P>

<a name="90419w13.htm_para3">Other Government Departments also have a role. For example, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has primary responsibility for protection of the environment, and is therefore responsible for ensuring the safety of the release of genetically modified organisms--including genetically modified crops--into the environment. In this respect, DETR/MAFF act jointly on GM crop applications, with DETR taking the lead. Similarly, given the Department of Health's primary responsibility for human health, it acts jointly with MAFF on genetically modified food applications, with MAFF taking the lead.
<P>

<a name="90419w13.htm_para4">The Office of Science and Technology seeks to ensure that there is effective co-ordination between Government Departments, and that the Government are receiving the best scientific advice.

 There is a provision in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill to replace the All-work Test with the Personal Capability Assessment.

For all benefits where entitlement depends on a medical question, the examining doctor will act in an advisory capacity to the decision maker, providing expert medical advice to enable them to reach a correct decision on benefit entitlement.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to minimise fraud in the administration of housing benefit.  [79751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w15.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 "Safeguarding Social Security", published last month, makes it clear that we want a benefit system which is secure from start to finish. This Government are committed to taking tough action against housing benefit fraud. We have already reformed the anti-fraud financial incentive scheme for local authorities to ensure they continue to be rewarded for detecting cases of genuine benefit fraud and cases where they identify that a claimant is no longer resident at an address. An additional &#163;100 million will be made available to local authorities over the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 1999 : Column: 458</I><P>
next three years to encourage them to adopt the Verification Framework. Through a series of additional checks, carried out throughout the life of a benefit claim, the Verification Framework will help to secure the administration of housing benefit. The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate is continuing to carry out a rolling programme of visits to local authorities. This will also play a key role in driving up standards of administration and security.
<P>

<a name="90419w15.htm_para5">To secure the payment of housing benefit from the outset of a claim all local authorities have been invited to participate in the Royal Mail "do not redirect" initiative. This initiative prevents benefit claimants from using Royal Mail's postal redirection arrangements to make false claims to benefit from multiple addresses. To further streamline the administration of housing benefit, over &#163;3 million has been made available this year to install computer terminals in local authorities which provide access to the Department's benefit systems. We are now looking to extend this initiative to include exchanging information electronically between local authorities and the Department, providing further scope to prevent fraud and error occurring in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w15.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We are improving procedures and processes across the board to get claims right from the outset and then keep them right to reduce losses from fraud and error. It is vital that we secure the gateway to the benefit system. The initial step of checking a claim requires careful scrutiny of the evidence that must be provided by a claimant before payment is made. We have already tightened the gateway to Income Support and saved &#163;200 million in 1998-99 alone.

<P>
31. <a name="90419w15.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on his plans to train and support staff to tackle fraud in the benefit system.  [79759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w15.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department is committed to training and developing all staff to deliver their jobs more effectively, in line with the principles of Investors in People. This commitment applies equally to our staff who tackle fraud in the benefit systems, and who through their administrative duties help in our prevention of fraud.
<P>

<a name="90419w15.htm_para6">In October 1997 the gateway to Income Support was substantially strengthened by introducing more checks at points of known weakness. Staff were given over 200,000 hours of extra training on the new rules and this was supported by drawing together into a single code more than 450 separate instructions on how to check and process Income Support claims.
<P>

<a name="90419w15.htm_para7">The Benefits Agency (BA) provides extensive training for counter fraud staff ranging from standard interviewing techniques through to specialist training in the law, surveillance and case preparation for the courts. In June 1997 we set up a joint development initiative between the BA and Local Authorities to establish commonality across a range of standards and training issues. In particular the Professionalism In Security (PINS) project is seeking to introduce a new package of accredited training that will lead to the award of a professional qualification in fraud investigation and will be recognised by both central and local government.

[81112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w15.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The fraud strategy paper published on 29 March, "A New Contract for Welfare: Safeguarding Social Security", highlights the weaknesses of the system that we inherited. The paper also sets out our strategy for dealing with those weaknesses, many of which have been highlighted in the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's report.
<P>

<a name="90419w15.htm_para10">The Benefits Agency is committed to improving standards and, in response to the issues raised in the BFI report, has produced a robust and detailed action plan which was published in the report. It has already taken a number of steps to improve staff compliance to administrative procedures and counter-fraud work. This action plan, together with an annual plan for the Area Directorate 3, will be reviewed regularly and rigorously to check that standards are achieved.
<P>

<a name="90419w15.htm_para11">By working in partnership, councils and the Benefits Agency can fight fraud more effectively, as well as giving better service to the public. That is why we have earmarked funding in each Benefits Agency area to develop stronger links with local councils. Liaison between the BA and the local authorities is governed by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) at local level, based on national models. All SLAs have been revised recently and cover core activities on benefit administration and fraud and give each party a clear statement of how co-operation should work in practice.

It should be noted that some of these people may have no SERPS entitlement and, therefore, will not be affected by the change.

<P>
<a name="90419w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 No one who already has the Widow's Bereavement Tax allowance will lose it. Anyone who claims the allowance before 5 April 2000 will receive it in the normal way--for the tax year they claim and the following year.
<P>

<a name="90419w16.htm_para0">In the future, widows and widowers who are under pension age will be able to claim the new bereavement benefits, which will include the Bereavement Payment--a tax free lump sum of &#163;2,000 payable to widows and widowers. This is double the amount of the current lump sum, Widow's Payment.

 The Government have introduced a number of measures to give all lone parents the opportunity to work.
<P>

<a name="90419w16.htm_para1">In the Budget we announced plans to increase the support available to lone parents going into work. From this October, those getting Income Support will continue to receive that benefit for two weeks when they start work and claim Working Families Tax Credit. This will give real help with meeting expenses, including child care costs, in the period up to the first payday. At present, concerns about such expenses can deter lone parents from making the move into work.
<P>

<a name="90419w16.htm_para2">The National Minimum Wage and the Working Families Tax Credit will help ensure that work pays for lone parents. We are also helping lone parents overcome the barriers they face in moving into work through the New Deal for Lone Parents and the National Childcare Strategy.

 The latest National Association of Pension Funds Survey shows proportion of eligible employees joining occupational pensions schemes. For final salary schemes the figure has increased from 62 per cent. in 1997 to 86 per cent. in 1998. For Money purchase schemes the comparable figures are 68 per cent. and 75 per cent. In schemes where employers operate automatic entry the figures are over 90 per cent.

We have discussed the operational procedures with disability organisations and we are aware that when contacting claimants, we need to take account of their individual circumstances and the effect that this contact may have. We are taking steps to ensure that any periodic inquiry literature issued to claimants, including to those who are diagnosed with a mental illness, is both clear and user-friendly, giving people the opportunity to discuss the best way of obtaining information as to their needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90419w17.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have been considering the report into the brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. The report focuses on the Metropolitan Police but it raises many issues for policing and, indeed, society generally. Many of the Lawrence report's recommendations are pertinent in Northern Ireland, not only in terms of how racial differences are addressed, but also in terms of divisions along religious and other lines.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para5">The Government attach great importance to issues of racial equality in Northern Ireland and, in the context of policing, I welcome the first meeting of the Consultative Committee on Policing for Ethnic Minorities hosted recently by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and the RUC. This Committee will do much to ensure the views of ethnic minority groups are fully understood and their policing needs met. It will develop a greater understanding in the police service of the problems faced by ethnic minorities and provide a means by which these communities can work with the police to provide a better service and have their problems addressed.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para6">The Criminal Justice and Policing section of the Good Friday Agreement recognises that we have a unique opportunity to bring about a society,




<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 1999 : Column: 468</I><P>


<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"which will recognise the full and equal legitimacy and worth of identities, senses of allegiance and ethos of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90419w17.htm_para7">This is why the Government established the independent Commission on Policing and the Review of Criminal Justice, which will report later this year. The terms of reference of these two bodies cover many areas highlighted by the report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para8">None the less, there are a number of areas where I will want to see comparable changes to those set out in my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's action plan for addressing the recommendations of the Lawrence report. On the application of not only race relations legislation, but all Northern Ireland's stringent equality legislation to the police, I want to see as full a coverage as possible. Northern Ireland is already a leader in providing statutory guarantees of equality of treatment and I want to build on this.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para9">Improving community confidence in policing generally is an essential priority. The Police Authority has set an objective in the recently published Policing Plan requiring the Chief Constable to raise public confidence in the RUC in the year 1999-2000. However, in view of the recommendations contained in the Lawrence report, I will examine with the Authority and the Chief Constable what more might be needed to promote racial, religious, sex and disability equality and what meaningful measures can be adopted to ensure this happens. There should be no doubt of the Government's commitment to tackling all forms of discrimination.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para10">Turning to the recommendations which affect police complaints and discipline procedures, we are making important changes. On independent investigations, we are pressing ahead with the establishment of a Police Ombudsman. This will provide for completely independent investigation of complaints against the police and will provide a model for other systems. We want this system to be as transparent as possible. We will also be introducing important reforms of the police conduct and performance procedures and will consider the further changes recommended by the Lawrence report in this area.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para11">While first aid training in the RUC generally meets the standards recommended by the report, we are in touch with the RUC to ensure that any steps necessary to reduce intervals between refresher training are advanced as a matter of urgency. In other aspects of training, the police will build upon the initiatives taken as part of the Community Awareness Programme which already uses outside trainers from a wide variety of organisations. On inspection, similar changes to the role of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will be made in Northern Ireland in line with those being made by the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para12">The Report raises issues about communication between the prosecuting authorities and victims. In Northern Ireland, victims or their families are informed about the progress of their case by the RUC at key stages during the process, and by staff of the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland if any decisions are taken once the case has actually come to court. The experience of those victims and witnesses who are made to feel particularly vulnerable because of the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 1999 : Column: 469</I><P>
nature of the offence they are giving evidence about has been considered by a working group since last May. The group will be making recommendations to me in the summer as to how the criminal justice system might better assist such witnesses.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para13">The Stephen Lawrence report highlights the need for co-ordinated action across the public sector if reforms are to be truly effective. For this reason the Government will be seeking to work closely with the new Assembly in Northern Ireland on those recommendations dealing with education and equality law. Consultation with bodies outside central Government will also be required. I have already initiated this action. On the application of the recommendations to those relevant parts of Government that will remain within my area of responsibility after devolution, I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 14 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>145-46</i>.
<P>

<a name="90419w17.htm_para14">The Government consider the protection of human rights, equality of treatment and respect for different cultures as fundamental aspects of the ethos of the police service in Northern Ireland. A service where, as the Chief Constable has indicated, there is no room for prejudice of any kind and cultural diversity is celebrated. The recommendations of the report on Stephen Lawrence will help us in pursuing this aim.
