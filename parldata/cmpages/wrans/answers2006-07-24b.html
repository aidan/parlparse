the Aarhus Convention is an important statement, at international
level, of the rights of the public to be involved in decisions which
have significant environmental effects. The UK&#146;s ratification of
the convention, in February 2005, demonstrates our commitment to the
importance of these principles. A comprehensive guide can be found on
the DEFRA website at:
http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm</p><p><a name="06072411000049">In
addition, DEFRA&#146;s environmental information unit (EIU) provides
advice on the convention and the Environmental Information Regulations.
The EIU has produced leaflets and posters publicising peoples&#146;
rights to access environmental information and provides detailed
guidance on the DEFRA website at
http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index. htm This also
links to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs), the
code of practice and the Aarhus
Convention.</p><p><a name="06072411000050">The code
of practice, (which was laid in Parliament in February 2005) and
guidance have been revised to take responses to a public consultation
into
account.</p><p><a name="06072411000051">Additionally,
the unit offers support to Government Departments and public
authorities on EIRs. This support includes workshops to discuss how
they can raise awareness within their authorities and provides an
opportunity to share good practice. In 2003-04, the Government&#146;s
sustainable development unit worked with the Department for
Constitutional Affairs supporting the freedom of information (FOI) road
shows programme and gave talks to public authorities around the country
explaining how to handle FOI and EIR

include a capital grant scheme for biomass boilers, the establishment
of a new Biomass Energy Centre to provide expert information and
advice, further grant support for biomass supply chains, and a

of the benefits that can be delivered by farming and provides funding
to farmers ad other land managers in England who deliver effective
environmental management on their land. Together with the introduction
of cross-compliance conditions under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS),
this will ensure that the English landscape continues to be protected

Solicitor-General:</b> The Public Prosecution Service conducts
all cases it prosecutes, including those on behalf of the Environment
and Heritage Service, in accordance with the Test for Prosecution. That
test is whether there is sufficient available evidence to afford a
reasonable prospect of conviction and, if so, whether it is in the
public interest to prosecute. If the evidential aspect of the test is
met, there is a strong presumption that prosecution is in the public
interest; the more serious the offence, or its consequences, the
stronger the presumption. The cost of bringing a prosecution does not
weigh in that consideration. The PPS may take into account, in
assessing the public interest, of whether the offence is of such a
nature that it is likely that the court will impose only a very small
or nominal
penalty.</p><p><a name="06072426003156">The
cost-effectiveness of prosecutions is based on the overall efficiency
of the PPS. It is not connected in any way with the fines imposed
following conviction. Such fines are not payable to the PPS. Following
conviction, the PPS will usually ask for its costs to be paid by the
defendant but whether such an order is made, and to what extent, is a
matter for judicial
determination.</p><p><a name="06072426003157">The
cost effectiveness of the PPS and what is being done to maintain and
improve efficiency is the subject of the PPS annual report and business
plan, copies of which are available in the Library of the

Statement (MPS)2 &#147;Controlling and Mitigating the Environmental

planning authorities should take account of the full range of social,
community, economic and environmental issues relevant to the planning
decision. Any adverse effects on local communities, environmental
damage or loss of amenity must be kept to an acceptable minimum. MPS2
advises mineral planning authorities on the use of appropriate planning
conditions, which must be capable of being monitored, to mitigate any
environmental impacts. Where adverse environmental effects cannot be
adequately controlled or mitigated through the design of proposals or
the attachment of conditions, planning permission should be

specialist teacher training for the support of children with autism in

what steps his Department is taking to support specialist teacher
training for the support of children with autism in mainstream
schooling.
[86547]</p><p><a name="06072519002911"><b><a name="06072519005141">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The framework for teacher training ensures that
qualifying and newly qualified teachers, including those who support
children with autism in mainstream schools, are aware of their
responsibilities to children with special educational needs (SEN) and
can plan effectively to meet these children&#146;s needs. Further,
in-service training on particular SEN, such as autism, is a matter for
schools and local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06072519002912">In order
to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status, all trainee teachers must
demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the
statutory Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, know how to seek
advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate
their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN,
and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural,
emotional and social
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06072519002913">The
current standards for teachers are under review. Once revised, it is
proposed that they will be strengthened to include a standard which
requires teachers to know and comply with current legislation 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 835W</b><br>on well being of children and young people and one which requires
teachers to know and understand the role of others when dealing with
children who have special needs and/or
disabilities.</p><p><a name="06072519002914">Induction
Standards require Newly Qualified Teachers to demonstrate that they can
plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN,
with or without a statement, and in consultation with the SEN
Co-ordinator (SENCO), can contribute to the planning for individual
needs.</p><p><a name="06072519002915">The
Department&#146;s published SEN Strategy, &#145;Removing Barriers
to Achievement&#146; recognised the importance of training and
committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency
for Schools (TDA) to ensure that initial teacher training and
programmes of continuing professional development provide a good
grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. We have commissioned the
TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and
strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainees, newly qualified
and established teachers. These initiatives will be implemented over
the period 2005-08 at a cost of approximately &#163;1.1
million.</p><p><a name="06072519002916">All schools
receive a School Development Grant which they are able to use to
support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. Local
authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain
conditions, to provide specific training and development of
SEN.</p><p><a name="06072519002917">In 2002 we
published jointly with the Department of Health, &#147;Autistic
Spectrum Disorders (ASDs): Good Practice Guidance&#148; which offered
a series of pointers to good practice, including pointers on in-service
training. The Guidance advises that,</p><a name="06072519005008"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all those who plan or provide for
children with an ASD should have some knowledge and understanding of
autism&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06072519002918">Many
schools, local authorities and Regional Partnerships have used the
Guidance to develop their autism provision. The West Midlands Regional
Partnership last month published &#147;autism spectrum disorders:
training policy and framework&#148; to ensure more consistency in ASD
training by clarifying the knowledge and skills that courses are aiming
to cover. This has been distributed to all the Regional
Partnerships.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06072519000050">Becta</h3><p><a name="06072519002919"><b><a name="06072519005142">Mr.

2003 to 2006 were derived from the Ofsted database of registered child

the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of
responsibilities for registration and inspection of child care
providers from local authority social service departments to Ofsted in
September 2001, child care places were classified according to the type
of day care provided: full day care, sessional day care, child minder,
out of school day care or crèche day care. Ofsted have produced
figures based on this classification on a quarterly basis from March
2003. Their latest figures were published on 5 May 2006 in their report
&#147;Registered Childcare Providers and Places, 31 March
2006&#148;, which is available on their website, www.

until March 2001, child care providers were classified according to the
type of provider: day nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools, child
minders, out of school clubs and holiday schemes. Figures based on this
classification were published in a series of statistical bulletins,
which are available from the Department&#146;s website,

Dhanda:</b> The Joint Planning and Commissioning Framework for
Children, Young People, and Maternity Services, published in March
2006, aims to help local partners to put in place a unified planning
and commissioning system which will put improved outcomes at the centre
of their thinking, will create a clear picture of what children and
young people need, will make the best use of resources, and will join
up services so that children and young people with multiple needs
experience a seamless
service.</p><p><a name="06072519003212">To assist the
process of joint working, the Department for Education and Skills and
the Department of Health have commissioned a study of good practice in
the provision of speech and language

needs in the age range 0 to 19. A research team from Christ Church
College Canterbury is carrying out this study and the fieldwork is
currently under
way.</p><p><a name="06072519003213">The Department
recognises that early identification of need, early intervention and
early coordinated support are key in improving outcomes for children
with communication difficulties. As part of a major new &#163;250
million investment in improving the quality of the early years work
force, the Department has identified training to support practitioners
working in private, voluntary and independent sector settings in
meeting the needs of disabled children and their families as one of
four priority areas. This is new money and complements the training
resources already available to local authorities through the General
Sure Start Grant. The Department has also funded the development in
partnership with 45 partnership areas of a wide range of practical
resources and training materials through the Early Support
Programme.</p><p><a name="06072519003214">The
Department is supporting a longitudinal study by the university of
Warwick looking into the learning needs of a group of children with
specific language and communication difficulties, the characteristics
of the current provision made for them and its impact, their
aspirations for the future and the ways in which services can best
support them. The results of the study are due to be published in
autumn
2006.</p><p><a name="06072519003215">Parental
awareness of speech and language difficulties is of course very
important. In 2005 the Department published a detailed and well
received information booklet for parents on speech and language
difficulties under the Early Support Programme. This resource was
produced in close collaboration with specialist organisations in the
voluntary sector and the Royal College of Speech and Language
Therapists. It explains how children normally develop communication,
language and speech, how adults can help in this, the difficulties that
can arise and how to seek help from
professionals.</p><p><a name="06072519003216">In the
report of their inquiry into special educational needs published on 6
July 2006, the Education and Skills Select Committee make
recommendations concerning the possible shape and nature of a national
framework on SEN. We are considering the Select Committee's report very
carefully and will respond in due course.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06072519000057">Diplomas</h3><p><a name="06072519003217"><b><a name="06072519005156">Mr.

high level of physical and environmental security to protect against
natural hazards that could interrupt service. Arrangements will be in

contingency plan that would, for example, ensure that a back-up system
is in place.</p><p><a name="06072519003232">We see no
need to introduce specific offences as there are already measures in
criminal law which impose penalties for theft or misuse of data or
unauthorised access to computer records. Mandatory training for all
users and operators of the index will stipulate that the Data
Protection Act provides that a serious offence, with a penalty of a
fine up to the statutory maximum, will be committed where personal data
is unlawfully obtained or disclosed without the consent of the data

access, or attempted unauthorised access to a program or data held on a
computer may be punishable by
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06072519003233">In
relation to question (86901), all index use will be monitored through
the creation of an audit trail record. Users will be required to supply

access to any record will be recorded and reviewed regularly for
suspicious patterns of access. Misuse of the index will therefore be
detected and dealt with through internal disciplinary procedures or the
criminal measures referred

Dhanda:</b> The special educational needs (SEN) code of
practice provides advice to local authorities and schools on their
statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children
who have special educational needs, including children who are
blindor partially sighted. The code sets out a graduated
approach to providing support. Many children who are blind or partially
sighted will have statements of SEN. All statements are reviewed at
least annually. The purpose of the review is to consider a
child&#146;s progress, to ensure they are achieving desired outcomes
and, if necessary, to amend their statements to reflect newly
identified needs and
provision.</p><p><a name="06072519004836">Children
with SEN, including those who are blind or partially sighted, benefited
from the substantial increase of &#163;1,170 in the funding per pupil
from &#163;2,940 in 1997-98 to &#163;4,110 per pupil in 2005-06 (a
rise of nearly 40 per cent.) and from the increase in local
authorities&#146; budgeted expenditure on the education of children
with SEN from &#163;2.8 billion in 2001-02 to &#163;4.5 billion
in 2006-07. &#163;300 million was also made
available from 2003-04 through the schools access initiative to improve
access to mainstream schools for disabled pupils. Recently a further
&#163;100 million per annum has been announced for both 2006-07 and
2007-08. Funds can be used for improving physical access, including
adaptations for sensory disability such as improved colour schemes;
access to the curriculum; access to written information in alternative
formats. This encompasses information, communication technology
equipment (both hardware and
software).</p><p><a name="06072519004837">Decisions
about the support provided for children in Somerset are a matter for
the local authority, taking into account its statutory
duties.</p><p><a name="06072519004838">The
Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a responsibility under the
Learning and Skills Act to support young people and adults with
learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including learners with
visual impairments. Overall, in 2004/05 the LSC supported more than
640,000 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities which
accounted for nearly &#163;1.5
billion.</p><p><a name="06072519004839">Disabled

higher education with the extra costs they may incur on their course as
a direct result of a disability (or specific learning
difficulty).</p><p><a name="06072519004840">DSAs are

year 2004/05 (the latest for which figures are available) 64,200<sup>(1

The expenditure data to 1998-99 are drawn from the annual
&#145;RO1&#146; spending returns which local authorities submitted
to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions. Figures
for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 are drawn from section 52 (table 3) outturn
statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for
2002-03 onwards are taken from section 52 (table A) outturn statements.
The change in sources is shown by the blank
rows.<br><sup>(2)</sup>
School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by
local authority maintained schools. This includes the pay of teachers
and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and
equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital
items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and
charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support
services such as home to school transport, local authority
administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data
are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a
financial year
basis.<br><sup>(3)</sup> From
2002-03 onwards the school based expenditure calculation is broadly
similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and
earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and
Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee
expenses, while from 2002-03 only the schools element of these
categories is included. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately
&#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of
these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of
the England total in 2002-03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had
previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within
the LA part of the form from 2002-03 and would therefore be excluded
from the school based expenditure calculation, though this is not
quantifiable from existing
sources.<br><sup>(4)</sup>
Figures for the primary sector alone were not available until the
inception of section 52 in financial year 1999-2000. The pre-primary
figures are not sufficiently robust to use in this
reply.<br><sup>(5)</sup>
Secondary school based expenditure includes all expenditure incurred
directly by local authority maintained secondary schools. It is not
possible from existing sources to distinguish this expenditure between
expenditure on 11 to 16-year-olds and expenditure on 6th form pupils
attending maintained secondary
schools.<br><sup>(6)</sup>
Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all
expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained
establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in
maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure
and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community
and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Pupil figures include all
pre-primary pupils, including those under fives funded by the authority
and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999-2000),
pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local
authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a
financial year
basis.<br><sup>(7)</sup>
Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local
government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These
were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br><sup>(8)</sup> Figures prior to 1999-2000
exclude any expenditure on service, strategy and
regulation.<br><sup>(9)</sup> The expenditure data for
1999-2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to
local authority
maintenance.<br><sup>(10)</sup>

its agencies for maintaining in its employment those <i> (a)</i> over 50
years and <i> (b)</i> with a disability in circumstances of (i) a period
of sickness absence and (ii) local staff restructuring.
[86040]</p><p><a name="06072425000772"><b><a name="06072425001520">Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) does
not discriminate on grounds of age. From October 2006 staff below
Senior Civil Service grades will no longer have a mandatory retirement
age in DWP. This means that once they have reached the minimum pension
age of 60, staff themselves decide when to
retire.</p><p><a name="06072425000773">Where staff
incur a period of sickness absence the Department provides extensive
support to all staff through its Occupational Health Service contract,
Employee Assistance Programme and generous sick leave provision if an
employee is sick or has an
incapacity.</p><p><a name="06072425000774">The
Department considers reasonable workplace adjustments in all cases
where the Disability Discrimination Act could apply. These ensure the
employee is not placed at a disadvantage in comparison to other
employees. The Department takes seriously its responsibilities for
managing attendance and has developed a supportive policy and
procedures for managing sickness absences. The policy was commended by
the National Audit Office (NAO) as meeting best
practice.</p><p><a name="06072425000775">Disabled
people are included in all restructuring plans in the same way as other
employees. They are guaranteed interviews in selection exercises if
they meet the minimum criteria for the post. All applicants are offered
reasonable adjustments at all stages of the selection exercise. When a
disabled person is successful at the selection exercise our Human
Resources teams work closely with occupational health to ensure that
any adjustments needed, to either the workplace environment or the
post, are put in place quickly to enable the person to commence work
without delay. Workplace adjustments are given priority to facilitate
moves. Should volunteers be called for to move jobs, or compulsory
moves required, the same adjustments are made for any disabled people
included in these moves.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06072425000013">Disability

Projections of numbers receiving savings credit in the future are
subject to a range of uncertainties and a number of factors including
policies on uprating different benefits, and assumptions on rates of
take-up.<br>2. The
assumptions applied here are consistent with those that underpin
published long-run expenditure projections, and are applied to
projections of the number of pensioner households estimated to be
eligible for the savings
credit.<br>3. The
projections of recipients of the savings credit under the current
system and the reform proposals are calculated by applying assumed
rates of take-up, care should be taken when interpreting these
projections. In particular data deficiencies make it difficult to be
confident in the split between the number of people who may be in
receipt of only the guarantee credit and those who may be in receipt of
both the guarantee credit and the savings credit. Also the projections
are sensitive to the assumed take-up
rates.<br>4. Estimates of
the proportion of pensioner households eligible to the savings credit
are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate
micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not
assume any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal
accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for the
savings credit.<br>5. The
projections of the number and proportion of pensioner households
eligible for the savings credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions
and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner
incomes.<br>6. The
projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for the
savings credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and
projections of the number of pensioner households in Great
Britain.<br>7. The reform
projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard
guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings
from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic
state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic
state pension described in the White
Paper.<br>8. The
projections under the current system assume that basic state pension is
uprated in line with prices and the standard guarantee credit with
earnings each year. It should be noted that there is a government
commitment to uprate the standard guarantee credit with earnings until
2008. Treasury projections for the current system assume price uprating
of the standard guarantee credit beyond
2008.<br>9. Estimates are
calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National Statistics range
estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05
Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in
reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges,
they are subject to a margin of
uncertainty.<br>10. The
projections are rounded to the nearest 50,000. Totals are rounded
separately so components may not sum to
totals.<br></td></tr></table><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06072425000038">People

the provisions of the Courts Act 2003, Section 4, the Lord Chancellor
may make orders altering the HMCS areas but, before doing so, must
consult any Courts Board(s) affected. This process has been invoked and
each of the existing Court Boards have been invited to express their
views by 31 July 2006. It is anticipated that the separate Courts
Boards for Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire will continue to
operate in their current form until the end of FY 2006-07. Meanwhile,
arrangements will be made to select members for a new single Courts
Board which will correspond to the amalgamated Dorset, Gloucestershire,
Wiltshire area. This will be done in close liaison with the Chairmen
and Members of the existing bodies. Delivery of the service to court
users in Dorset (as with Gloucestershire and Wiltshire) will not be
affected by the re-structuring, and support to the judiciary at bench
and court level will remain as it is
now.</p><p><a name="0607263000087">The number of

Wiltshire&#151;193. While the precise management structure for the
amalgamated area cannot be determined until a new Area Director has
been appointed in October 2006, it is likely that re-structuring will
directly affect only a very small number of senior management posts and
those more junior staff who directly support them, leaving the courts
operational staff unaffected. It is anticipated that this will be
achieved through a combination of redeployment, natural wastage and
targeted voluntary redundancy. Trades Unions will be consulted, at
every stage.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607263000008">Departmental

Review, the Government re-examined anomalies within the existing
concessionary arrangements, with a special focus on the ARC scheme. In
the March 2006 White Paper, the Government acknowledged the
shortcomings of the scheme but noted that proposals for change focussed
on individual anomalies rather than ways to improve the scheme as a
whole. Previous changes to correct individual anomalies have done
little to improve the scheme as a whole and have tended to create new
problems. We therefore have no plans to amend the scheme, nor to
