<P>
<a name="20315w01.html_wqn1"><B> Paul Goggins:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proposals he has to clarify the conditions of entitlement for the lower rate mobility component of disability living allowance. [44433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w01.html_spnew1"><B> Maria Eagle:  </B> 
Regulations have today been laid before Parliament together with copies of the Social Security Advisory Committee's report on them and the Secretary of State's response to that report.
<P>

<a name="20315w01.html_para0">The regulations make clear that for a severely disabled person to qualify for the lower rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance on the grounds that fear or anxiety prevents them from walking out of doors on unfamiliar routes without guidance or supervision from another person most of the time, the fear or anxiety must be a symptom of a mental disability. This clarification is needed to remove uncertainty and the possibility of misinterpretation of the qualifying conditions in these circumstances. The regulations do not otherwise alter the conditions for entitlement to the lower rate mobility component, and severely disabled people whose physical or mental disabilities alone mean that they cannot walk out of doors on unfamiliar routes without guidance or supervision from another person most of the time will continue to qualify.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions since 1997 he has made representations to his Croatian counterpart regarding the killing of Private Simon Jeans in Split, Croatia, in September 1996. [43302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram:  </B> 
The case was raised at Ministerial level with the Croatian Defence Minister, during his visit to the UK in March 2000. This was in addition to regular dialogue between the British Embassy and Defence Staff in Zagreb and Split, and the Croatian authorities, throughout the course of the trial of those accused of killing Private Jeans.

<a name="20315w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Colerne Airfield</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gray:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what long-term plans he has for Colerne Airfield;  [43522]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has for the re-basing of 21 Signals Regiment from Azinghur Barracks at Colerne; [43515]
<P>
(3) how many civilian staff are employed at Azinghur Barracks, Colerne; [43516]
<P>
(4) if he will make a statement about the future of Colerne Airfield and Azinghur Barracks. [43523]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram:  </B> 
An internal study into the future location of 21 Signal Regiment (AS), currently based at Azimghur Barracks, has been completed recently. The study concluded that in principle there were sound operational and financial reasons to support a move of the unit to Gamecock Barracks, Bramcote where it would be co-located with 30 Signal Regiment.
<P>

<a name="20315w01.html_para1">Colerne Airfield is not part of this work and there are no plans for its closure. The two other units at Colerne&#151;1001 Support Unit RAF and Bristol University Air Squadron&#151;are also not part of this internal study, but as the hon. Member is aware, we are undertaking a separate review of University Air Squadron Flying.
<P>

<a name="20315w01.html_para2">Further work is required before any decision to move 21 Signal Regiment could be finalised, and it would be premature therefore to make a statement about the future of Azimghur Barracks at this stage. The Ministry of Defence will, of course, be consulting with the Trade Unions and the 81 civilian staff who support 21 Signal Regiment in due course. I will write to the hon. Member once a final decision in made and a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gray:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many flights by Bristol University OTC there have been in each of the last five years from Colerne Airfield. [43520]<P>

<a name="20315w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram:  </B> 
The information is not held in the format requested. However, it is possible to provide the number of hours which Bristol University Air Squadron flew in each of the last four years from Colerne Airfield. The Tutor aircraft used by the University Air Squadron are also used by the No. 3 Air Cadet Air Experience Flight and the hours flown by them are also shown.

<P>
<P>

There are no plans for Colerne Airfield to close, so no assessment of alternative locations for Bristol University Air Squadron to train has been undertaken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Waterson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her role is in authorising Insolvency Practitioners; and what representations she has received about changing this procedure. [42078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
Under the provisions of Section 392 of the Insolvency Act 1986, the Secretary of State may directly authorise individuals to act as insolvency practitioners and 133 are so authorised. Section 391 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that the Secretary of State may also recognise bodies as able to authorise their members to act as insolvency practitioners.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para0">The regulation of insolvency practice was the subject of a review during 1997 and 1998. The report of the review committee was published in February 1999.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Waterson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what training is provided to the staff responsible for the operation of the Insolvency Service hotline; and what the total training cost for the team has been since the hotline's introduction. [42073]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
The hotline team currently comprises four Official Receiver trained staff with substantial experience of insolvency related matters. They do not require specific additional training.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Waterson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what meetings she has had since 2001 with representatives of the Insolvency Service and if she will publish the minutes of the meetings. [42082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
I regularly meet officials from The Insolvency Service. Under Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information minutes of those meetings are not published.

<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Waterson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps her Department is taking to publicise to directors their insolvency liabilities; and how much this advertising has cost the Insolvency Service each year since 1997. [42066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
The Insolvency Service produced a number of guidance leaflets regarding various insolvency related matters, which are available on its website, including a guide for directors which describes the various procedures in detail and informs directors what duties and responsibilities they have if their company is subject to insolvency procedures. The Insolvency Service has also ensured that the information provided by Companies House to the officers of newly formed companies contains details of their responsibilities whilst managing limited companies.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para1">In addition, when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry successfully applies to have an unfit director disqualified from acting as a director, or accepts an undertaking not to act in that capacity, press releases are issued in local newspapers and trade journals relevant to the insolvent company. Details of the director's misconduct complained of in the application to disqualify are provided. Public reporting thus also assists greatly in the drive to increase the business community's awareness of the dangers of running a company whilst insolvent.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para2">Publicity costs have been &#163;155,000 in 1999&#150;00; &#163;112,000 in 2000&#150;01 and &#163;66,000 in 2001&#150;02 (11 months). Costs for the period prior to 1999 cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
To monitor customer service standards The Insolvency Service has an audit process through which performance against its published service standards (set in accordance with Charter standards) is measured and monitored both locally and centrally within the Agency.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para3">To further enhance customer service standards The Insolvency Service has: a National Consultative User Group and a Central Accounting Unit User Group; user comment cards and a website pop-up questionnaire; a complaints process; a staff New Ideas Scheme and an e-business strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on her Department's policy on the development of Fallow Field oil and gas exploration licences. [42718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Wilson:  </B> 
The UK cannot afford to have petroleum discoveries or areas of the Continental Shelf lying fallow. We believe that petroleum licences should be in the hands of those companies that are committed to undertaking appropriate work to find, test and develop effectively the UK's petroleum resources in the shortest possible time span.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para4">The DTI has worked with the oil and gas industry in PILOT to establish a robust mechanism that will encourage companies holding fallow blocks or discoveries to decide within a reasonable time scale (15 months for fallow blocks and just over two years for fallow discoveries), whether to be active and move towards development or relinquish the licences on which they sit so that others have an opportunity to act.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para5">Officials in my Department have identified some 120 fallow discoveries and 160 fallow blocks on the UKCS where the current owners do not appear to be doing all that they can to generate activity. These fallow assets could encompass 250 undrilled structures and contain reserves equivalent to around 1.5 billion barrels of oil.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para6">The mechanism was launched on 5 March and we immediately wrote to each licensee that has been identified as holding fallow blocks and discoveries to initiate the first stage of the process.
<P>

<a name="20315w02.html_para7">The performance of companies holding fallow assets will be reviewed every year to ensure that they remain focused on bringing forward activity.

Independent inspectors were appointed under Companies Act powers to investigate and report on the affairs and membership of Mirror Group Newspapers plc. They were asked to look, in particular, at the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers on 30 April 1991.
<P>

<a name="20315w03.html_para3">Following receipt of the report, the DTI's Companies Investigation Branch sought legal advice on whether disqualification proceedings should be instigated under the Company Directors Disqualification Act against any of those involved.

<P>

<a name="20315w03.html_para5">Important lessons have been learnt from the Mirror Group Newspapers affair and, as the inspectors themselves noted, a number of important changes were made prior to their final report. The report made a number of further recommendations which have all been passed for consideration to the different Departmental bodies and regulators that hold responsibility in these areas.
<P>

<a name="20315w03.html_para6">As the inspectors suggested, the Company Law Review considered a number of issues and the Government will be announcing their response to these and the rest of the Review's recommendations in due course. I have recently announced the setting up of a group jointly with the Treasury and including other regulators to oversee and co-ordinate the response in the UK to auditing and accounting issues raised by the collapse of Enron. This work is also relevant to the concerns expressed by the inspectors on the independence of auditors. I have also announced an independent review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors in the UK. The review will report jointly to me and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

After this, a formal negotiating mandate would be adopted, if possible at the JHA Council on 25 April 2002. There was general agreement in the Council that particular attention would need to be given to human rights safeguards in relation to issues such as the death penalty and special courts and to data protection.

A list of all those statutes which make an explicit reference either to the police or to police authorities has, due to its length, been placed in the Library. Additional statutes relating to the criminal justice system have also been included. Other statutes may also affect the police service as they do a wide variety of other bodies and organisations, although their provisions do not deal specifically with policing or criminal justice issues. However, an investigation of all Acts of Parliament since 1990 to assess their possible effect on the police in this way is not possible without disproportionate cost.

Details are given in the table. Details for Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership areas have been collected centrally since 1 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="20315w04.html_para6">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which expanded the offences covered, and placed a greater emphasis on counting crimes in terms of numbers of victims. Numbers of recorded crimes after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years. Over England and Wales as a whole, the change in counting rules caused an increase in total recorded violent crime of 83 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20315w04.html_para7">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. The 2001 British Crime Survey found that, over England and Wales as a whole, reporting to the police of violent offences in total rose from 37 per cent. in 1997 to 45 per cent. in the 2000 calendar year.
<P>

<a name="20315w04.html_para8">The British Crime Survey has also shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, the number of violent crimes recorded in the survey decreased by 23 per cent. between the 1997 and 2000 calendar years, whereas violent crime recorded by the police increased by an estimated 14 per cent. Violent crime recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of real changes in the level of violent crime.

Studies were undertaken by both Railtrack and London Underground Limited in 1999 when they were discussing Railtrack's proposals for the sub-surface infrastructure company under the PPP. It was concluded that: such a proposal would provide no additional net capacity; it would give rise to substantial costs in restructuring infrastructure and rewriting contracts; and, the interworking of mainline and existing tube rolling stock would give rise to technical and operational difficulties. Railtrack's proposals were subsequently abandoned.

Under section 1(1) of the Fire Services Act 1947, it is the duty of the fire authority to make provision for fire-fighting purposes and, in particular, to secure for its area the services of a fire brigade and equipment to meet efficiently all normal requirements. Fire-fighting purposes is defined in the Act as "the purposes of the extinction of fires and the protection of life and property in case of fire". Under section 3(1)(e) of the Act the authority also has the power to use its brigade and equipment for purposes other than fire-fighting (which are commonly known as "special services"). Brigades attend road traffic accidents primarily for firefighting and rescue purposes. Operational procedures for dealing with road accidents are matters for fire authorities to determine locally in consultation with the relevant police authority.

Significant variances in the per pupil figures for Standards Fund are due to: grants where one authority is acting as a co-ordinator for others in its area; or grants allocated to particular types of school; and grants that are allocated to respond to needs, which may not be reflected equally in all authorities. The per pupil figure for each of these types of grants for Dorset, Poole and Bournemouth are shown in the following table:

For other Standards Fund grants the total per pupil distribution is: &#163;244, &#163;251 and &#163;247 for Dorset, Poole and Bournemouth respectively. The smaller differences are due to variances in the level of free school meal eligibility and the balance between primary and secondary pupils.<P>

Deloitte Touche is one of five companies who have framework agreements with DCMS for consultancy support to Quinquennial Reviews of DCMS funded bodies. These are not contracts as such, as any review work would be competed between the five companies and lead to an individual contract. Use of the framework agreements resolves some contractual issues and simplifies the tendering process. To date Deloitte Touche have not won any of the competitively tendered contracts under their agreement. The work awarded to the companies has, in the majority of cases, been research or consultancy work rather than accountancy.<P>

Complaints made to the Lord Chancellor's Department about solicitors can come up in many different contexts and no information is kept centrally about the number that relate to quality, conduct or any other matters.

The legal profession is self-regulating. The conduct of solicitors is a matter for their professional body, the Law Society. The Office for the Supervision of Solicitors (OSS) is a separate organisation, set up by the Law Society, to handle complaints against its solicitors.

The Ombudsman, who is a lay person, may consider complaints about the decisions reached by the OSS and also has the power to investigate the original complaint. The Ombudsman is required to make an annual report to the Lord Chancellor on the discharge of her functions during the year to which the report relates. In her report the Ombudsman will also bring to the attention of the Lord Chancellor any wider concerns she has about the nature and level of complaints against members of the legal profession. A copy of this report is laid before each House of Parliament.

I represented the UK at Environment Council on 4 March, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister for the Environment in the Welsh Assembly Government, Sue Essex. This was the first Environment Council of the Spanish Presidency. A Council decision on ratification of the Kyoto Protocol was agreed; the UK voted in favour. Four sets of Council Conclusions were adopted. Council also held a public debate exploring key aspects of a recently adopted Commission proposal for a directive establishing a regime for environmental liability.
<P>

<a name="20315w09.html_para0">The agreement of the Council decision on ratification of the Kyoto Protocol will enable the Community and member states to ratify the Protocol in time for it to enter into force before the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in August, subject to sufficient ratifications by other signatories. A legal base requiring a qualified majority (Article 175(1) of the Treaty) was agreed for the decision; at the UK's request a recital was added making clear that the legal base chosen for this decision should not be taken as a precedent for future decisions on burden-sharing. A declaration was also agreed noting Council's intention to agree future burden-sharing decisions by consensus. Council also adopted Conclusions reacting to the US climate change plan. These included a call upon Parties to the UN framework Convention on Climate Change&#151;including the US&#151;to live up to their responsibilities under the Convention, and a confirmation of the EU's willingness to continue dialogue through the EU-US High Level Group.
<P>

<a name="20315w09.html_para1">In preparation for WSSD, Council Conclusions were adopted setting out the EU's priorities including poverty eradication, access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and ways of giving special attention to Africa. Council reaffirmed the Gothenburg 



<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2002 : Column 1286W</I><P>
commitment to reach the UN target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of GDP and called for integration of sustainable development in bilateral and multilateral co-operation agreements. Council welcomed the Commission communication "Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development" and its proposals for the components of a Global Deal at the Summit. The Conclusions identified EU actions in the run up to Johannesburg and beyond including the early ratification of several international environmental agreements. The Conclusions also stressed the need for integration and coherence of internal and external policies to ensure that the EU's economic, social and environmental objectives were mutually supportive and that the EU effectively contributed to sustainable development at all levels. The global dimension should be regularly addressed as part of the overall Sustainable Development package at Spring meetings of the European Council.
<P>

<a name="20315w09.html_para2">Council also agreed Conclusions on the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, to be submitted to the Barcelona European Council. The Conclusions took note of the Commission's synthesis report for 2002 and stressed the need to reflect environmental issues more extensively and to treat the three dimensions of sustainable development in a more balanced way. Council called on the Commission to put in place a system of Sustainability Impact Assessment as soon as possible and emphasised the importance of the EU becoming a highly eco-efficient economy.
<P>

<a name="20315w09.html_para3">Council Conclusions were adopted setting out the EU negotiating position for the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, taking place in the Hague between 7&#150;19 April. The Conclusions stressed the need for early ratification by the Community and member states of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the International Treaty on Plan Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Council also supported the preparation of an action plan for capacity-building for access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing. The Conclusions also called for increased co-ordination between international organisations and conventions, including the World Intellectual Property Organisation Inter-Governmental Committee, and the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
<P>

<a name="20315w09.html_para4">In the public debate on the proposed environmental liability regime, principal concerns expressed by other member states were the generous extent of the defences available to polluters, the potential burden on member states if polluters failed to act, and the scope of the directive. Several member states thought that there was a need to consider whether there was a gap in the proposed regime concerning damage caused by genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Beyond this, member states were evenly divided on whether the scope should be extended and on the need for a common framework for insurance. I underlined the complex nature of the proposal and the need to take on board the views of stakeholders. I argued that we would need careful examination of the associated costs and benefits of any proposed change to its scope, the defences or insurance arrangements.

The Commission presented proposals allowing Community implementation and ratification of the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety. The Commission also updated Council on progress on chemicals legislation, a proposed directive on recycling of batteries and accumulators, and a proposed White Paper on integrated product policy.

Contributory causes appeared to be ozone, particulates and nitrogen oxides. The Commission welcomed the dissemination of the research, and noted that it would shortly publish a Communication on children's health and the environment.

In February 2000, the Agency published its "Scope and Methodology Document", describing its plans for the re-examination of radioactive discharge authorisations at Sellafield, including technetium-99, and sought public comment. In November 2000 the Agency published its "Explanatory Document" setting out its analysis of the situation concerning technetium-99 discharges, abatement technologies and a range of future approaches that might be taken. Public consultation on this document finished on 5 March 2001. The Agency took into account the responses that it had received and, in September 2001, published its proposed decisions on the future regulation of technetium-99 discharges. My right hon.

<a name="20315w10.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to improve physiotherapy services <i>(a)</i> in London and <i>(b)</i> in general. [39029]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton:  </B> 
The NHS Plan sets out targets to provide 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals and 4,450 more therapists and other key health professional training places by 2004. Further plans to increase the number of physiotherapists working in the NHS by 59 per cent., from 15,600 in 2000 to 24,800 in 2009, were announced in the follow-up document to the NHS Plan, <i>Investment and reform for NHS staff&#151;taking forward the NHS Plan, </i>(published 15 February 2001).
<P>

<a name="20315w10.html_para0">Between 1999 and 2001 the number of qualified physiotherapists in England increased by 1,140 (from 15,070 in 1999 to 16,210 in 2001). Of these the number working in the London regional office area increased by 90.
<P>

<a name="20315w10.html_para1">Between 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 the number of physiotherapy training commissions increased by 127 (9 per cent.) and further increases are planned.
<P>

<a name="20315w10.html_para2">In September 2001, as signalled in Meeting the Challenge: A Strategy for the Allied Health Professions (AHPs), 10 Workforce Development Confederations (WDC's) began working with 13 Higher Education Institutions in a first wave of modernising pre-registration education and training for the allied health professions, starting with Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Radiography, Podiatry and Speech & Language Therapy education. These first wave courses will be established from the 2002&#150;03 academic year and will feature wider entry gates to professional training, more part-time courses, the possibility of stepping on and off programmes, and more opportunities for shared learning. Several HEIs in England offer accelerated pre-registration courses in physiotherapy for existing graduates.
<P>

<a name="20315w10.html_para3">Individual health authorities are also responsible for assessing the broad health care needs of their population, and securing a range of hospital and community health services such as physiotherapy services to meet those needs. Decisions about the health care provision and the use of resources are best taken at local level because it is there that people's needs are best known and services can be tailored accordingly.

<i>[holding answer 7 March 2002]:</i> There has been a significant increase in pharmacy student intakes over recent years, with 27 per cent. more new students starting their training in 2000 than in 1993. This points to a significant medium-term growth in the pharmacy work force, despite the change to a 4-year undergraduate course in 1997. Full figures are not yet available from the Pharmaceutical Society for 2001 as returns are still awaited from two schools of pharmacy. Work force modelling undertaken by the Department suggests that there will be a 12 per cent. increase in the pharmacy work force across the National Health Service and private sector between 1998 and 2003.

<i>[holding answer 14 March 2002]:</i> Regulations were introduced on 28 January 2002 that increased the tariff and ceiling of charges for the recovery of National Health Services costs following road traffic accidents. The tariff was increased from a flat rate of &#163;354 to &#163;402 for treatment without admission and from a daily rate of &#163;435 to &#163;494 for treatment with admission. The ceiling of charges in any one case was increased from &#163;10,000 to &#163;30,000. The regulations were revoked on 7 February 2002 following representations from and on behalf of the insurance industry that they were not given adequate warning of the intended increases.
<P>

<a name="20315w11.html_para0">The increase in the ceiling of charges in any one case was proposed in the light of operational experience. Although the new scheme was intended to recover the full cost of treatment in the relevant cases a threshold had always existed but had failed to keep pace with the rising cost of medical treatment. Our data for the year from 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2002 show that 1,237 patients received treatment following a road traffic accident which cost in excess of &#163;10,000 with 248 of these costing in excess of &#163;30,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 5 March 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 208W, on Zimbabwe what estimate his Department has made of the number of British citizens owed public sector pensions in relation to service in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe who are resident in the United Kingdom and whose pension payments have been suspended. [41867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20315w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. MacShane:  </B> 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not hold a record of British Citizens resident in the UK who are former public sector employees of the Rhodesian authorities and entitled to pension payments in respect of their service. Nor does it hold a record of those pensioners whose pension payments have been delayed or suspended by the Zimbabwean authorities.

<a name="20315w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw:  </B> 
The Government have worked tirelessly on behalf of Mrs. Gilbey and the other British family members of victims of the 11 September atrocities. The British Embassy in Washington has worked with the White House, the State Department and Congress to ensure the fair and sympathetic treatment of British family members whose immigration or residency status in the US may have been affected by the terrorist attacks. The British Ambassador in Washington raised these cases with the Chair of the US Senate Judiciary Committee on 9 October 2001. Following this, the US Congress passed, and President Bush signed, anti-terrorism legislation (the Patriots Bill) that allows all British family members affected by 11 September to continue living and working in the US.
<P>

<a name="20315w11.html_para6">The US Immigration and Naturalisation Service have assured Mrs. Gilbey that does not face deportation.

Following the death of Jonas Savimbi, the UK joined the EU partners in issuing a declaration urging both parties to put an end to the conflict in Angola. The Prime Minister has written to

<P><I>15 Mar 2002 : Column 1296W</I><P>
President dos Santos to encourage him to take steps to begin a process of national reconciliation and to address Angola's very serious humanitarian situation.
<P>

<a name="20315w12.html_para0">Her Majesty's Government believe that freedom of expression is essential to a functioning democracy. It is important for the improvement of human rights in Angola. The UK makes regular representations to the Government of Angola, bilaterally and through the EU, urging them to address human rights and humanitarian issues in Angola. We condemn human rights abuses by UNITA. UK support for sanctions against UNITA is a strong signal that their behaviour has been unacceptable.

<a name="20315w12.html_para1">The next opportunity for HMG to discuss Angola's human rights record will be the visit of Foreign Minister Miranda to the UK at the end of March, when he will meet the Foreign Secretary, Baroness Amos and the International Development Secretary.

The Burmese Government are aware of our view that all restrictions on ASSK should be removed. An EU Troika mission is visiting Rangoon from 13&#150;15 March to gauge the latest developments and explain EU policy.

The FCO does not keep information centrally about the funding of NGOs and nor do FCO Commands keep that information broken down on a regional basis. It would be difficult to arrive at a precise answer because the FCO could be said to "fund" NGOs in a great variety of ways&#151;some are contracted to provide specific services in relation to projects funded by Command Programme Budgets and specific Programme funds (e.g. Human Rights Project Fund), others may well receive financial support to attend conferences etc as guests of HMG. In some cases posts overseas may use local budgets to pay, for example, for accommodation of NGO visitors on official business.

As the then Foreign Office Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd) made clear on 10 July 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column 687, many countries including the UK have in place strict controls on the export of nuclear-related goods to India and Pakistan. The UK also exercises caution over contacts between personnel from the British nuclear industry and their Indian and Pakistani counterparts. Current tensions between India and Pakistan demonstrate the need for both countries to exercise restraint.
<P>

<a name="20315w12.html_para3">The events of 11 September highlighted the fact that some terrorist groups will use any means to achieve their ends. We know that Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network have shown an interest in developing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. To ensure that such ambitions are not realised, we are encouraging all countries, including India and Pakistan, to take all steps necessary to ensure the better physical protection of their nuclear assets. We will be encouraging both countries to consider measures which contribute to the safety and security of their nuclear programmes.

Licences may be issued if there are no end use concerns. Consistent with our obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, licences may also be issued in exceptional cases where the Government is satisfied that the proposed exports will contribute to the physical protection or security of civil or military nuclear facilities or assets in India and Pakistan;</FONT></UL>
