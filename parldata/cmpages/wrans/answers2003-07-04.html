[121289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary gave on 26 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 938W to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what representations he has made to the USA concerning incidences of 'friendly fire' against British troops in Iraq.  [108850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We worked closely with the United States to ensure that effective Combat Identification arrangements were in place before the start of operations in Iraq. United Kingdom forces' Combat Identification capability is compatible and comparable with that of our US allies, but regrettably no system can be 100 per cent. fail-safe.
<P>

<a name="30704w01.html_para2">Both incidents of "friendly fire" that occurred during operations against Iraq involving US and UK forces are the subject of Boards of Inquiry, which have now convened. But we will be looking to ensure that all parties absorb any lessons identified.

 Our information on the health situation in Monrovia is provided by the UN, and international agencies maintaining a presence there, and the current assessment is that the situation is critical. In those areas that can be reached by humanitarian agencies, conditions are very poor. It is likely to be far worse in those areas of the country that cannot be reached. Only one hospital is functioning in Monrovia, currently run by ICRC, and a few additional clinics have been set up there following a lull in the fighting this week. Sanitation is virtually non-existent and water supplies are inadequate. A major cholera outbreak is likely in these conditions; health NGOs that remain operational are preparing to respond to this.

 As part of its role in supporting all 13 to 19-year-olds, the Connexions Service has a particular role to play in supporting young people with disabilities making the transition from compulsory education. Personal advisers will work with young people to help them identify their aspirations, including on careers, and how to work towards them. Government guidance to the Learning and Skills Council makes it clear that, in making its decisions on funding post-16 education and training provision, it should take account of any assessment made by the Connexions Service. We have made legal provision for Connexions support to continue up to the age of 25 for those young people with disabilities who are not in a position to receive appropriate support from adult guidance services. Given its importance, we are monitoring closely the impact Connexions is having in this area.

 All the information requested is not available.

National estimates of fraud and error for 2002&#150;03 are expected to be published in December 2003 with further, more detailed, analysis following in early 2004. However, the sample sizes used may allow estimates to be broken down to regional level but not local authority level.

 The Department for Work and Pensions has already published some extracts from its Sustainable Development Strategy, as responses to the published targets from the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. The full strategy is currently being developed by the Department's dedicated Sustainable Development Team in consultation with officials from across DWP and its Executive Agencies. It is intended that the strategy will be published using the web site by the beginning of 2004, with subsequent additions being made as further targets are published under the Framework.
<P>

 The social care sector and the methods of delivery of local authority social services are constantly changing, with new initiatives emerging that might necessitate giving additional functions to the Commission for Social Care Inspection. Such additional functions cannot yet be identified and therefore cannot be dealt with on the face of the Bill itself or described here.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health under Clause 82 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, what the procedure is for lodging a complaint against the CSCI; who will be responsible for investigating complaints against the CSCI; whether complaints against the CSCI will be made public; whether the Secretary of State will make public a direction in writing when the CSCI has failed in its discharge of functions; and whether the Secretary of State is able to remove the chief executive where a significant failure of a discharge in the CSCI's functions has occurred.

 Complaints about the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) would in the first instance be made to CSCI itself, which would carry out an internal investigation of the complaint. It would be for CSCI itself to develop detailed protocols for how such complaints should be managed. If the complainant remained dissatisfied with the outcome of such an investigation, then their complaint could be referred to the Parliamentary Ombudsman. The Bill would not place a duty upon CSCI to make public complaints that have been made against it. However, in its annual report to Parliament CSCI would have a duty to report on the way it has exercised their functions over the course of the year. This report would be expected to give general details of the number and type of complaints that have been made.

<a name="30704w09.html_para3">The Bill would not place a duty upon the Secretary of State to automatically make public any direction that he issues to the CSCI. He would decide on a case by case basis whether it would be appropriate to publish such a direction.

However the Government Actuary's forecast for the number of live births predicts a small increase in the birth rate over the next ten to fifteen years.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA), in conjunction with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, has obtained samples of salmon from 15 fish farms in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The preliminary results of the analyses of these samples show that the concentrations of technetium 99 are very low. The FSA has published data on technetium 99 in other marine species in its annual "Radiation in Food and the Environment" reports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many children were diagnosed in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> each region and <i>(c)</i> each LEA as being clinically obese in each of the last 10 years.  [121063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w12.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Figures for the numbers of children diagnosed as being clinically obese are not available. Obesity is normally measured in terms of body mass index (BMI). There are emerging international standards to define childhood obesity but they were developed among a population that was not representative of English children. An alternative method monitors the percentage of children who are above the 95th percentile of the 1990 BMI reference data. According to this method, five per cent. of children in 1990 had a BMI above this level and were thus classified as obese.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para0">Increases over 5 per cent. in the proportion of children who exceed the reference 95th percentile over time indicate an upward trend in the prevalence of obesity. When applied to Health Survey for England data, this method suggests that between 1996 and 2001 the percentage of children (aged 6&#150;15) with a BMI above this threshold (representing the prevalence of obesity) increased by 3.5 percentage points, from 12.1 per cent. in 1996 to 15.6 per cent. in 2001.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para1">There is no data available by region, using this definition. Regional comparisons of the percentage of children in BMI quintiles were published in "The Health Survey for England&#151;The Health of Young People 95&#150;97", table 3.17, a copy of which is available in the Library. No information is available by local education authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many and what proportion of <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women were classified as (i) obese and (ii) overweight in each year since 1980.  [121064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w12.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Figures for all years since 1980 are not available but the table shows estimates from a population survey, the Health Survey for England, from 1991, when the survey began. Although earlier surveys have information on overweight and obesity comparisons are difficult because of different survey methodologies. The Health Survey covers ages 16 and over.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans the Government has to review the role of the food industry in reducing obesity levels.  [118964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w12.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The effective prevention and management of obesity requires an integrated, cross-government approach, working with a range of partners on programmes to improve diet and increase physical activity levels. The Department of Health, together with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and other Government departments, are working with the food industry&#151;producers, manufacturers, retailers and caterers&#151;to improve the overall balance of diet, including salt, fat and sugar in food.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para3">The Department of Health is leading the development of a cross-Government food and health action plan. Although the plan will be Government led, it will aim to include actions bya range of organisations including the food industry. The plan will address food production, manufacture and preparation, access to healthier food and provision of information for consumers about healthy eating and nutrition. The plan will address healthy eating at all stages of life and will build on existing work to improve diet and nutrition.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para4">The FSA has commissioned a review on the evidence available on the effect of promotional activities on the eating behaviour of children. This will critically appraise the available evidence and draw conclusions on their effect relative to other influences on eating behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice the Government issues to healthcare professionals regarding the health risks of obesity.  [118966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w12.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Action to address obesity in England is being taken forward through the national service frameworks (NSFs) for coronary heart disease, older people and diabetes. The forthcoming NSF for children will address the health and social care needs of all children and will include the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para5">The Health Development Agency (HDA) is setting out the evidence base for effective interventions on the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity, and the maintenance of weight loss. The HDA is also undertaking "evidence into practice" work following their review of effective interventions.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para6">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued guidance on the anti-obesity drugs orlistat and sibutramine, treatment with which should be accompanied by specific concomitant advice, support and counselling on diet, physical activity and

behavioural strategies. In July 2002, NICE also issued guidance which confirmed that surgical intervention was an appropriate treatment in some cases for the treatment of morbid obesity, when other options have proved unsuccessful. There is also a national quality assurance framework for exercise referral systems to promote physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para7">The Department of Health has also supported the development of guidance for professionals in primary care on weight management in children and adolescents, and contributed through the Section 64 Grant Scheme to the funding of the charity Weight Concern to develop a "toolkit" on obesity, for professionals to use with patients in a group setting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which primary care trusts authorise the use of orlistat to children in the treatment of obesity.  [122407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30704w12.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance issued to the National Health Service states that orlistat should only be prescribed for people between the ages of 18 and 75 years. Orlistat is prescribed to children at the discretion of the local clinician and primary care trust (PCT). In 2002, 541,400 prescription items of orlistat were dispensed in the community in England. Of that total approximately 3,000 were dispensed for children.
<P>

<a name="30704w12.html_para8">Information is not available on how these 3,000 items for children were spread across PCTs. However, orlistat prescriptions (not just for children) were prescribed in general practitioner practices in all PCTs in 2002.

 Those prisoners experiencing dental pain receive treatment without delay, where necessary accessing outside services. Information about routine dental treatment is not comprehensively available. For specific treatments, prisons report waiting times of between one and 55 days. Routine appointments typically take longer.

 Figures are not held centrally showing how many national health service patients with a sensory impairment are treated for conditions other than their impairment. The table shows the number of finished consultant episodes in 2001&#150;02, for which the primary diagnosis was sensory loss. The figures given are very much an underestimate because they relate specifically to sensory loss. Many other conditions may well cause sensory loss, but that is not the primary diagnosis. For example, there were 265,123 finished consultant episodes in the same period for patients whose primary diagnosis was 'disorders of the lens', including cataracts.

 The Experience Corps is a national initiative with the aim of encouraging more people aged 50 and over to become or to remain active in their local communities.
<P>

<a name="30704w13.html_para5">The latest figures supplied by the Experience Corps show that around 111,560 volunteers have been recruited since the initiative began and that they have placed over 70,000 volunteers. They report that the average age of the volunteers is just under 61. They have over 423,000 opportunities available in a wide range of

<P>

<a name="30704w13.html_para6">The effectiveness of the Experience Corps will be determined by the extent to which they achieve targets set in respect of the recruitment and retention of volunteers. The main one is that by 2004 they should recruit 250,000 volunteers reflecting the diversity of people over 50.

A recent evaluation of the Experience Corps raised some concerns surrounding their figures on volunteer recruitment. In the light of this we are currently considering options for funding beyond that date.

<a name="30704w14.html_para2">The tables show the council tax requirements for each English unitary authority and county council in 2000&#150;01 and 2003&#150;04. These are not the same as the amounts actually collected. In any given year, the amount actually collected in-year is slightly lower than the council tax requirement. In addition, amounts of council tax are also received in respect of previous years.

 The Housing Corporation's rent influencing regime for implementing the rent restructuring framework sets out the requirement that in any one year an individual rent does not change by more than &#163;2 a week, in addition to the guideline limit of Retail Price Index plus 0.5 per cent. So the maximum rent increase for a housing association tenant in any one year is RPI plus 0.5 per cent. plus &#163;2 a week.

 The proposed new powers to move illegally camped Gypsies and Travellers to authorised sites will only be available to police services. The power will also be dependent on local authorities providing adequate sites in their areas to enable the police to move Gypsies and Travellers on to.

answer to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) of 12 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 77&#150;8W, what the total annual budget is for the Global Conflict Prevention Pool; whether the GCPP will have a role in <i>(a)</i> Iraq and <i>(b)</i> other war zones; whether the report on the activities of the GCPP will list all its current projects; and when the report is due to be published.

<P>
<a name="30704w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 For the three year Spending Round 2003/04&#150;2005/06, the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) has a programme budget of &#163;74 million each year.
<P>

<a name="30704w15.html_para1">The funds allocated to the 14 strategies in the Pool for 2003&#150;04, as set in March by a Ministerial Committee chaired by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, total &#163;87.96 million. This figure is higher than the budget mentioned above, because it incorporates funds carried over from previous years under End Year Flexibility arrangements, as well as an element of over programming built into the individual strategies to provide in-year project management flexibility.
<P>

<a name="30704w15.html_para2">For a full list of the strategies and their allocations I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given by the Foreign Secretary to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) on 10 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 798W. The country/regional strategies are: Afghanistan, Belize/Guatemala, Central and Eastern Europe, India/Pakistan, Indonesia/East Timor, Middle East and North Africa, Nepal, Russia/Former Soviet Union, Sri Lanka, the Balkans. Programmes in these areas cover conflict prevention and reduction, support to peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction.
<P>

<a name="30704w15.html_para3">A new strategy to support reconstruction and conflict prevention in Iraq is being developed by the three departments which jointly manage the GCPP. An allocation has not yet been set, but funds are available in the GCPP Reserve, and urgent projects for Iraq will be considered for funding from the GCPP Quick Response Fund (QRF) in the meantime.
<P>

<a name="30704w15.html_para4">We expect to publish a Report on the GCPP in September and copies will be sent to Members and also placed in the Library of the House. It will give an overview of the operation of the GCPP strategies and the projects which are being funded under them, but it will not include a comprehensive list of all projects, as they are too numerous.
