To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he proposes to publish the revised guidance in WMP4; and if he will make a statement on its impact on rural areas. [29547]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Section 51 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a duty on waste disposal authorities (eg County Councils) to arrange for places to be provided at which persons resident in their area may deposit their household waste free of charge. The fulfilment of this duty is a matter for each authority.
<P>

<a name="80219w01.html_para0">The previous Government initiated a consultation exercise on a proposal to amend the guidance in Waste Management paper No. 4 (WMP4) as it relates to the waste management licensing of sites provided under section 51 of the 1990 Act. These sites are known as "civic amenity sites". The effect of the proposal would be to give the Environment Agency, in England and Wales, and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, in Scotland, discretion to license un-manned civic amenity sites in rural and remote areas in certain circumstances. The representations made in response to the consultation exercise are being considered and our conclusions on the proposal to amend WMP4 will be announced as soon as we are in a position to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to encourage a reduction in the amount of container refuse distributed by fast food outlets.  [29701]

<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Fast food outlets are likely to incur an obligation to contribute to the cost of disposing of the containers which they sell as a consequence of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 which came into force in March last year. The regulations place obligations on producers of packaging, from raw materials manufacturers to sellers, to recover and recycle specified tonnages of packaging waste based on the amount of packaging they handle. The targets set by these Regulations, taken from the EC Directive on packaging and packaging waste, will require the UK rate of packaging waste recovery to almost double to 50% by 2001 (it is currently around 27%).
<P>

<a name="80219w01.html_para1">To be obligated, businesses must have a turnover of more than &#163;5 million and handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging annually. In 2000, the former threshold will go down to &#163;1 million. These Regulations therefore ensure that businesses that place packaging on the market, including fast food outlets, make a substantial contribution to the costs of disposal of these products and this obligation acts as an incentive to minimise the weight of packaging used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many road deaths were attributable to drink driving in the last year; and in how many of those cases the driver was above the 80 milligram limit by a factor of two or more.  [29764]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It is provisionally estimated that, in 1996, there were 540 deaths in a drink-drive accident, defined as a road accident in which at least one driver failed a breath or blood alcohol test, or refused to provide a test specimen. In drink-drive accidents where the driver was killed and subjected to a blood alcohol test, it is estimated that about half the drivers involved exceeded the 80 milligram limit by a factor of two or more. Information is not available on the extent to which drivers who were involved in fatal accidents but were not themselves killed, and who failed a breath test, exceeded the legal alcohol limit.

<a name="80219w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A table giving the estimate of costs for the provision of Emergency Towing Vessels is included in the Cost Benefit Analysis (paragraph 9), which was undertaken by the Coastguard Agency. A copy was placed in the House Library on 10 February 1998.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The land take of roads is estimated to be approximately 1.4 per cent. of the total land area of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he is taking to ensure the continuation of monitoring and research into the long-term effects and impact of oil spillages on the British coastline.  [29818]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w01.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The UK Government have recognised the need for a plan to minimise the effects of oil spills since 1967. This National Contingency Plan was developed in consultation with all interested parties and is operated by DETR's Marine Pollution Control Unit.
<P>

<a name="80219w01.html_para2">In the event of a major spill, the Marine Pollution Control Unit establish, in consultation with the various authorities, whether to initiate sampling of sea water, sediments and flora/fauna over an extended period to determine the long-term fate of the oil and its consequences for the environment. They also recommend if resources need to be made available for longer-term ecological studies (including the shoreline) if appropriate.
<P>

<a name="80219w01.html_para3">The Government have been alive to the need to develop a comprehensive view of the environmental impacts of major oil spills. Following the wreck of the <i>Braer</i> in 1993, the Government funded the work of the Ecological Steering Group on the oil spill in Shetland and is continuing to monitor and to research into the environmental effects. Following the grounding of the <i>Sea Empress</i>, we funded the work of the Sea Empress Environmental Evaluation Committee (SEEEC). The SEEEC report was published on 11 February.
<P>

<a name="80219w01.html_para4">The Government are considering SEEEC's recommendation that an Environmental Impact Assessment Group should be established whenever a serious oil spill occurs. We are also considering what further monitoring and research should be set up to establish what the long-term effects of the <i>Sea Empress</i> spill are and what measures may be needed to alleviate any possible consequences.
<P>

<a name="80219w01.html_para5">My Department continues to fund the Continuous Plankton Recorder operated by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation. This was started in 1931 and provides a unique insight into the effects of all pollutants on these "indicator" species. More recently, the Department has funded a research contract into the biological fate of dispersed oil which assesses the nature, rate and extent of the biodegradation of oil droplets. The final report of this contract is expected shortly. In addition, monitoring of the long-term effects and impact of oil spillages (and other substances) on the British Coastline is carried out under the auspices of the Marine Pollution Monitoring Management Group.

<a name="80219w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ian Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to release the report commissioned by his Department on the cost benefit analysis of reducing lead in drinking water.  [30917]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 This report has now been published and I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library of the House. This is an interesting study which attempts to cost the health and non-health benefits associated with reducing levels of lead in drinking water to the 25 g/1 and 10 g/1 levels required by the new EC Drinking Water Directive.




<P>
<P><I>19 Feb 1998 : Column: 773</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80219w02.html_para5">The report indicates that in some circumstances it is cost-effective to replace lead water pipes, although if the cost of pipe replacement could be reduced the case for action would be clearer. It also concludes that it is cost-effective to introduce water treatment to reduce exposure even when benefits appear to be low.
<P>

<a name="80219w02.html_para6">The report provides a useful input to the debate about the costs and benefits of reducing lead levels in water. However, this is a difficult area and further work will be necessary on the assumptions and approaches used.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 4 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>641-42</i>, if he will make a statement on the ethical and wider public interest considerations which he wishes to be taken into account in the revision of Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms; and if he intends to press for a requirement to show a need for the genetically-modified organism.  [29712]

<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The report of the 1997 National Biotechnology Conference published in September last year highlighted that some aspects of the development of biotechnology raise wider issues, including ethical concerns. These included concerns about the spread of genes into wild populations and the effects of the introduction of genetically modified crops into our natural and agricultural environment. Other concerns include whether social need justifies the risk being taken in developing a GMO and whether the technology employed is appropriate and the safest available. The Government are preparing their response to the report of the conference, which should be published shortly. In responding, we shall be considering both how best to address these concerns and the constraints on action and their relevance to the revision of the directive 90/220.

[29711]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My concern has been partly over comitology and the lack of a timetable and transparency of the decision making process, but also about the failure for wider aspects of the public interest to be taken into account.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the average response time to emergency calls by the police, per police force covering <i>(a)</i> urban and <i>(b)</i> rural areas, in each of the last four years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.  [29776]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80219w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The latest complete year for which information is available on the performance of all forces in responding to emergency calls from the public is 1996-97. Details of that year's performance for all forces was published in the annual report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary in October 1997 and in the annual publication of the Audit Commission on local authority performance indicators in January 1998.
<P>

<a name="80219w05.html_para3">Clearly, it is of great importance to the public that the police respond as promptly as possible to emergency calls, having established that the call is a genuine emergency. That is why I decided to keep it as a key objective for the police in 1998-99 to respond promptly to emergency calls from the public.
<P>

<a name="80219w05.html_para4">One of the key performance indicators for this objective is the percentage of responses within the local target time to incidents requiring immediate response. Targets are set locally by individual forces to reflect local circumstances, such as traffic conditions. Some forces set separate targets for urban and rural incidents to take account of the different timescales within which it is possible to respond to such incidents.

 Consideration will be given to making information available on the contract payments once all of the contracts for secure training centres have been awarded. In assessing best value, bids are evaluated on the basis of the quality, performance and safety of the design and construction and operating proposals; the quality of service relative to price, the adequacy and robustness of financing proposals; the deliverability of the whole project; and the degree of risk transfer.

 The law requires owners of conditionally exempt assets to provide reasonable public access. Each case is considered on its own merits, and the factors taken into account include the extent and nature of any existing access. The Inland Revenue's booklet, "Capital taxation and the national heritage", IR67 (available in the House of Commons Library), provides general guidance on matters relating to public access.

 No reliable estimates of manufacturing redundancies in Wales are available.

However, data for the first quarter of 1998 will not be available until late summer. The Spring 1997 survey estimated that 11,000 people in Wales were made redundant in the three months prior to interview.

 The Department has not undertaken any formal evaluation but, together with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, we have commissioned extensive research on road safety and the particular problems on rural roads. This shows that few drivers exceed the national speed limit in these areas, and that accidents tend to be the result of speed which is inappropriate for road conditions. Local Highway Authorities already have powers to lower speed limits on roads where appropriate.

 I am today announcing that Mr. David Rowe-Beddoe will be Chairman and Mr. Brian Willott the Chief Executive of the new organisation when it is established in the Autumn of this year, subject to the passage of the Government of Wales Bill.
<P>

<a name="80219w10.html_para7">I intend to make further appointments to the Board at a later date. The existing Board of the Welsh Development Agency (WDA), the Development Board for Rural Wales (DBRW) and the Land Authority for Wales (LAW) have made a valuable contribution to economic development in Wales and I applaud their achievements. I am, however, keen that the opportunity to serve on the Board of the new Powerhouse agency is canvassed as widely as possible in line with the guidance from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. I therefore intend to advertise these appointments so that the composition of the Board following the merger will benefit from a blend of new talent as well as the experience of existing members. The terms of office of existing Board members will be extended until the merger.

"Immunisation against Infectious Disease" states in paragraph 7.6 that treatment with antibiotics is not a contraindication to immunisation.

<a name="80219w11.html_para12">We are not aware of any concern among the medical profession about this matter, nor of any scientific evidence about such a link. The incidence of adverse reactions following immunisation have been found to be the same in children with or without the following mild illnesses: upper respiratory tract infection; diarrhoea or otitis media (an ear infection). It seems likely that some of the children in these studies were taking antibiotics around the time of immunisation.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Early years settings registered with local authority social services departments under the Children Act 1989 to provide day care are expected to comply with the adult to child ratios set out in Guidance and Regulations issued by the Department. These recommend an adult to child ratio of 1:4 for children aged 2-3 years and 1:8 for children aged 3-8 years regardless of whether they are managed by the private sector or the local authority.
<P>

<a name="80219w12.html_para4">Under the Children Act 1989, where half the staff in these settings are qualified teachers (as recognised by department for Education and Employment) and support is provided by nursery assistants with qualifications in child care and education (and the setting is open during the school term to provide nursery education for 3-5 year olds), nurseries may apply a ratio of 2:26. I understand from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment that the Department of Education Circular 2/73 on nursery education in maintained schools recommends an adult to child ratio of 2:26 for nursery classes attached to primary schools where one adult is a qualified teacher and the other a qualified nursery assistant. It also suggests reception classes should make provision for 4 year olds comparable to that found in nursery classes. There are no recommended adult to child ratios for schools in the independent sector.

<a name="80219w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I have received very few representations on the cost of the use of mobile telephones; these are normally made to the Director General of Telecommunications. In March 1997, following concerns over prices expressed by consumers, OFTEL published a Consultative Document on the Price of Calls to Mobile Phones. This report sought views on the proposal that the price to consumers of calling mobile phones on the Vodaphone and Cellnet networks was too high. OFTEL is considering the responses it received to the consultation and is expected to announce its conclusions shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> The current framework for Structural Fund Community Initiatives is due to expire at the end of 1999. In its communication, "Agenda 2000" published on 16 July 1997, the European Commission outlined its approach to a new regulatory framework for the Structural Funds for the period 2000-06. The Commission has proposed that a new Objective 2 should replace current Community Initiatives that address industrial restructuring, such as KONVER, and it expected to publish the new draft Structural Funds regulations in March or April. In negotiating these regulations, the UK will press for an Objective 2 which allows Member States to target funds effectively at areas of need--such as those which have been subject to industrial restructuring. The Government are currently undertaking regional consultations with interested parties to hear their views on the implications in the UK of Structural Fund reform.

 I very much welcome the initiative of the food industry, including farmers, in tackling consumer concerns on food through the creation of farm assurance schemes. To command the confidence of consumers, such schemes must have measurable standards acceptable to all and be subject to independent third party verification to internationally recognised standards. My officials have been advising, and will continue to advise, the industry on these issues.

 Staff in the Department, including the Agencies, now have access to 130 nursery places at six sites throughout the country and to holiday play schemes at 11 sites. Subsidies for both nurseries and play schemes vary depending upon local circumstances but are generally in the range 25 to 50 per cent. A proportion of the child care places are in inter-departmental nurseries where the Department is not the lead Department and has not therefore awarded the contract. Organisations with which the Department has its own contracts for nursery provision are Childcare Enterprise Ltd. and Kinderquest Ltd. Child care vouchers are not available to staff.

 No, such a system would not be relevant to the present situation. In discussions with the fishing industry, the Government have invited Producer Organisations in the beam trawl and pelagic segments to manage their own fishing effort to meet MAGP IV targets. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Feb 1998 : Column: 821</I><P>
Under these arrangements, it will be for Producer Organisations themselves to determine the basis on which this is done. I shall be announcing further details shortly.

<P>

<P>
<a name="80219w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Overseas Trade Statistics shows that small values of beef, sheep meat, pig meat (including bacon and ham) and poultry meat were dispatched for import into the UK between January and October 1997 from the countries in the table. The values are provisional and subject to amendment. They will be subject to a degree of statistical error. The overall level of errors will be low, but these errors will have a much greater proportional effect on countries with small values of trade. Therefore, great care is needed when interpreting the data in the tables as they will inevitably include a number of errors.

[30214]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 February 1998]:</i> No studies or evaluations have been carried out by the Ministry with the sole objective of measuring the microbiological standards of the finished product from slaughterhouses and cutting plants, against their hygiene Assessment System (HAS) scores. However, as part of a wider MAFF funded research project, Bristol University has published results <i>(Veterinary Record (1996) 139, 587-589, W. R. Hudson, G. C. Mead, M. H. Hinton)</i> of a study which concluded that HAS scores are a useful tool in predicting the ability of an abattoir to produce carcases to sound microbiological status, especially the categories concerned with slaughter and dressing, and personnel and practices.

<a name="80219w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Advisory Group on Quarantine is expected to report by late Spring, after which we plan to hold a full public consultation. Even if the assessment shows that changes to the current quarantine rules appear justified, it is unlikely that any new arrangements could be in place before the end of 1998. It is also possible that any changes could be introduced by EU, rather than national, legislation.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research his Department has conducted into the relationship between the incidence of BSE in foreign countries and <i>(a)</i> the export of meat and bonemeal from Britain for use in animal feed and <i>(b)</i> the use of similar procedures in the production of meat and bonemeal for animal feed in those countries.  [29722]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department is not undertaking any such research as it is up to individual countries to conduct their own research. Alternatively, in the case of BSE in EU Member States, the Commission may carry out research centrally.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para0">In a report of a Commission Mission to France between 17 and 21 March 1997, the French authorities are quoted as attributing at least 18 of their BSE cases to consumption of meat and bonemeal of UK origin.

 I took the opportunity to exchange views with Dr. Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the Polish Defence Minister, during his visit to the UK, from 10 to 12 February, on the crisis in Iraq which has been caused by Saddam Hussein's failure to comply with Security Council resolutions and to cooperate with UNSCOM.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para2">The Government and Poland are clear that the highest priority must be on a diplomatic solution to the crisis. However, the Polish Government support the UK's position that, in the last resort, it may be necessary to consider military action. In that event, the Polish Government have indicated that they would be prepared to make a military contribution, and would be ready to deploy chemical defence specialists to the region.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para3">Dr. Onyszkiewicz and I issued a joint press statement to this effect on 11 February.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para4">Poland is one of a growing number of countries which has either deployed forces to the Gulf to operate alongside US and UK forces or is planning to do so. The precise details of national contributions are properly a matter for the countries concerned, but we understand that Australia already has tanker aircraft and an advance party of troops in the Gulf; that warships from Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium are en route; that New Zealand is planning to deploy troops and surveillance aircraft; and that Denmark, Argentina, Romania, Poland and Norway have indicated they would make military contributions to the coalition. This list is expected to grow.

 I was delighted to be able to welcome my colleague Dr. Janusz Onyszkiewicz to the UK during his visit of 10 to 12 February. I am pleased to say that we enjoyed a frank and open discussion, which touched on a wide range of issues of mutual interest.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para7">Naturally, we took the opportunity to exchange views on the crisis in Iraq. Dr. Onyszkiewicz agreed that, while the highest priority must be to find a diplomatic solution, neither the British nor the Polish Government would shrink from the task should it become necessary in the last resort to consider the military option. In that event, Dr. Onyszkiewicz declared Poland's readiness to make a military contribution and that they would be prepared to deploy a team of chemical defence specialists to the region.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para8">Regarding NATO enlargement, we exchanged views on Poland's preparation's for membership of the Alliance and the future role she might play once she is a member. Britain has been a strong supporter of Poland's NATO candidature and our bilateral defence relationship is excellent. I took the opportunity to reinforce our desire to help Poland integrate into the Alliance as smoothly as possible and to explore new avenues for cooperation between the armed forces of Britain and Poland.
<P>

<a name="80219w16.html_para9">We spoke also of the rapidly evolving trilateral UK/Poland/Ukraine defence relationship, which continues to gain momentum. Following the great success of last year's airborne exercise "Cossack Steppe" in the Ukraine, involving British, Polish and Ukrainian forces, we hope to repeat the exercise this year in the UK during May. During our talks, I suggested to Dr. Onyszkiewicz that he visit me again during May so that we might view the exercise together with our colleague General Olexsandr Kuzmuk, the Ukrainian Defence Minister.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 During the period commemorating the end of the Second World War there was a considerable upsurge in requests to the Army Medal Office (AMO). 



<P>
<P><I>19 Feb 1998 : Column: 828</I><P>
This led to a backlog and a delay of more than 12 months in processing applications. As a consequence my Department received a number of letters from MPs and the public regarding the delay. I have investigated this with the AMO and major efforts are being made to reduce the waiting time which I am pleased to report now stands at 8&#189; months. We are working to ensure a further reduction. My Department has considered, but decided against, employing extra staff to reduce the waiting time as it would take six months to train new staff fully and would divert experienced staff from their primary task of assessing medal entitlements. The Army Medal Office already has a policy in place for processing applications from those ex-Servicemen over the age of 90 or those who are terminally ill. These cases are processed immediately and normally completed within three weeks of receipt.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1998]:</i> My Department takes careful account of national and international epidemiological studies concerning radiation workers and of the professional advice of the National Radiological Protection Board. The Ministry of Defence is a major contributor to the National Registry of Radiation Workers, which provides source data for national epidemiological studies.
<P>

<a name="80219w17.html_para1">The numbers of past and present Rosyth Dockyard employees who have received full medical checks cannot be determined without disproportionate cost. Before 1986, all Classified Radiation Workers at Naval Dockyards were given medical examinations before taking up employment and at least every 14 months thereafter, as the law then required. Since the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1985 came into force, annual health reviews by Appointed 



<P>
<P><I>19 Feb 1998 : Column: 831</I><P>
Doctors have been mandatory for all Classified Radiation Workers; these annual reviews include medical examinations if the Appointed Doctors consider them necessary. Some former and present Rosyth Dockyard radiation workers have sought and received medical counselling, under the scheme available to all Dockyard radiation workers (both classified and unclassified) since 1990 or under the extended scheme which I announced in June 1997.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many nuclear dosage records in his Department are <i>(a)</i> known to be missing and <i>(b)</i> known to be incomplete.  [29455]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1998]:</i> The law requires my Department to keep radiation dose records for Classified Radiation workers for 50 years (formerly 30 years). There is no reason to believe that any are incomplete or missing.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para0">The law requires radiation records for non-classified radiation workers, with annual doses limited to 15 mSv, to be kept for two years only. My Department still holds many, but not all, of their records.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para1">Classified Radiation Workers' records are maintained by Approved Dosimetry Services at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (Aldermaston) and at DERA Radiation Protection Services (Alverstoke). Most are held in computer formats which can normally be searched rapidly: some are held on microfiche or microfilm which take a little longer to search.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para2">These Approved Dosimetry Services also hold the records of some non-classified radiation workers. But, many of their records are held locally in paper form. Searching for the local records has been a difficult process up to now. To reduce delays, I have instigated a programme to store digital images of these records and to index them on a computer database. The pilot for this project, involving all the local records for former Chatham Radiation Workers, has been completed. By the end of this financial year, I expect the project to incorporate local records from the other Naval nuclear establishments will be covered as soon as possible thereafter.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para3">If an investigation into an incident finds that an employee has been significantly exposed to radiation, the law requires it to be entered into his record. Investigation reports relating to the overexposure of individuals are required to be kept for 50 years (formerly 30 years). This has always been MOD's practice. However, it is impossible to be certain that every minor incident was recorded.

<a name="80219w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 February 1998]:</i> MOD plays a leading part in the Government's Foresight initiative which seeks, inter alia, to bring industry, academia and Government together for their mutual benefit. Specifically, MOD is heavily involved in the Foresight Defence and Aerospace Panel, DASP.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para13">DASP Technology Working Parties were set up in eight technology areas which MOD, industry and academia jointly regard as high priority. Their task was to consider the best way forward on a national basis in those technologies. Six have reported already and a further two are expected by mid-1998. A common theme to be found in each of the working party reports is the need for some better means of harmonising technology priorities between Government, industry and academia. A proposal has been made that National Advisory Committees be set up to achieve this aim, under DASP oversight. The MOD fully supports this initiative and is working within the DASP to devise a 5 year plan for the appropriate development of these Committees.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the individuals, with their qualifications, who currently review the defence corporate research programme to identify areas of potential pullthrough into the applied research programme.  [29516]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 February 1998]:</i> Pullthrough from the Corporate Research Programme, CRP, to the Applied Research Programme, ARP, and other programmes is actively encouraged at all levels. Pullthrough takes different forms depending on circumstances. For example, where a CRP project becomes sufficiently applied that it is deemed to be suitable for Applied Research funding, an agreed pullthrough plan will be drawn up between the respective CRP and ARP customers. Continuous dialogue between CRP customers, their stakeholders and Operational Requirements military customers and their supporting scientific staffs identify and agree technology areas and timescales for such pullthrough.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para16">Secondary pullthrough also occurs within the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, where a common research team might typically work on both generic long term CRP projects and shorter term ARP projects. In this instance, technology and knowledge continually feeds directly from the CRP to ARP via the research scientist involved.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para17">Information on the individuals involved in pullthrough activity, both informally and formally, is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="80219w18.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list for the defence corporate research programme <i>(a)</i> scientists from his Department and academic institutions who are currently involved in peer review and <i>(b)</i> the functions of the customer advisory groups, together with current membership and qualifications. [29517]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 February 1998]:</i> Peer review forms a vital component in the selection of quality and relevant projects forming the Corporate Research Programme. Review occurs at various stages within the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, DERA, where senior scientists select projects from sectors within DERA to form a portfolio of bids. Final peer review typically involves detailed assessment of proposal quality, military relevance, value for money and collaborative opportunities, including wealth creation.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para18">The peer review teams differ between DERA technology groups but would normally include; two or three eminent academics with a long association with MOD research programmes, often from the Defence Science Advisory Council, MOD representatives from the central scientific, operational requirements and procurement areas; other MOD HQ scientific staff; DERA scientists, and, if applicable, representatives from DTI and industry. Individuals are selected on the basis of their track record and particular knowledge and expertise in the specific subject areas. Information on the very large number of individuals involved is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para19">Customer Advisory Groups exist to provide guidance on the longer-term focus of research, to ensure that the products of the research are in line with the requirements expressed by the stakeholders. As such, their composition 



<P>
<P><I>19 Feb 1998 : Column: 839</I><P>
varies as a function of the specific technology group. Composition would typically comprise staff from central scientific and technical intelligence, operational requirements and procurement areas. Operational Requirements representation would include those with Applied Research Programme customer responsibilities to maximise future pullthrough opportunities.

<a name="80219w18.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> national and <i>(b)</i> international collaboration has been achieved under the defence research programme's Beacon fund.  [29514]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 February 1998]:</i> The Beacon Fund is aimed at encouraging research collaboration between DERA and industry or academia. It was set up in 1996 as a subset of the Corporate Research Programme, with a &#163;2 million annual budget planned for worthwhile proposals. Such has been the demand that this budget was raised to &#163;4 million in 1997.
<P>

<a name="80219w18.html_para20">There are currently 23 active Beacon projects spanning nearly all areas of DERA's work. The total committed cost to MOD of these projects is around &#163;12 million; industry and academia are committed to nearly twice as much. About three-quarters of this is from national initiatives, with the remainder from international initiatives.

 My Department and its agencies currently provide 13 workplace nurseries offering some 500 fulltime places, as well as a number of holiday play schemes. This is in line with Civil Service policy to establish child care support arrangements for staff where there is a business case and value for money justification. This enables us to help many of our staff to combine their working lives with family responsibilities. Child care vouchers are not issued to MOD staff. Parents are required to make a contribution to the running costs of child care facilities.

 <i>[holding answer 18 February 1998]:</i> The Department's technology strategy is carried forward by a programme of research and technology demonstration incorporating, wherever possible, collaborative work with industry, academia or allies.

<P>

<a name="80219w19.html_para2">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. An Applied Research Programme, ARP, valued at about &#163;420 million. This programme aims to provide technical options at quantified cost and risk for the formulation of operational requirements that best meet the needs of UK armed forces. It applies to equipment planned to enter service over the next 20 years.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. A Corporate Research Programme, CRP, valued at about &#163;150 million, whose primary purpose is to sustain and develop the defence technology base by building on world-wide science and technology. The research includes technologies needed to underpin the systems-oriented work of the ARP; generic technologies which have wide applications across many environments or users; and innovative research which is speculative in nature aimed at MOD's future capabilities. It also provides the means by which the potential military utility of emerging technologies can be investigated and demonstrated at an early stage.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. A Technology Demonstration Programme valued at about &#163;50 million which is primarily intended to reduce areas of high technical risk associated with the known requirements for future equipment, through establishing design options. It is largely driven by procurement pull rather than technology push, and is generally in support of identified equipment or systems applications. It is for the most part let competitively with industry.</FONT></UL>
<P>

I have no doubt that universities and colleges will want to ensure that students are not prevented from taking up a place because they are unable to pay the full fee in a single lump sum; for example, by taking account of individual students' circumstances in allowing the fee to be paid in more than one instalment.

 The reform of student support arrangements will require some changes to the existing arrangements for assessment and administration carried out by local education authorities in respect of new entrants to higher education.
<P>

<a name="80219w20.html_para5">For the academic year 1998-99, new entrants will be liable to contribute to tuition fees. Local education authorities will assess the support from public funds for fees and how much maintenance grant is payable, taking account of the students' own income and that of their parents or spouse. The Mandatory Award Regulations to be laid in due course will set out the relevant conditions. Local education authorities will pay the fee support direct to the higher education institution and will pay any maintenance grant direct to the student in the same way as now. Where the applicant is an EU national seeking assistance with fees only, the Department will assist his authority in making the assessment in 1998-99 and from 1999-2000 will be directly responsible for providing assistance in accordance with regulations to be laid in due course.
<P>

<a name="80219w20.html_para6">For the academic year 1999-2000, new students and those who started in 1998-99 will receive support for living costs solely through loans which will be partly income-assessed. These arrangements will be administered by a scheme involving local education authorities, the Student Loans company and a central unit within the Department. Local education authorities will have an important role in determining the eligibility of 'home' applicants for fees, loans and grants and for carrying out the means test. I am planning to review the current means testing arrangements to allow the system to be simplified wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="80219w20.html_para7">A detailed review will look at the best way of administering higher education student support in the long term. This review is due to be completed in 2000 once the new system of HE student support has bedded down.

<P>
<a name="80219w21.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list those Government records of the 1960s relating to Gibraltar that have not been released after 30 years; and if he will indicate the reasons for not releasing them.  [30399]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80219w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Public records of the 1960s relating to Gibraltar are likely to appear, among the records of a number of Departments, including those of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and its predecessor Departments, of the Ministry of Defence and its predecessors, of the Cabinet Office and of the Prime Minister's Office. There is no pre-existent list of records of this period relating to Gibraltar, and currently no automated means of generating one.
<P>

<a name="80219w21.html_para0">As well, the documentation of withheld records that is maintained by the Public Record Office, and in particular the documentation of withheld extracts from records, is by document reference alone, and not by subject description, so that it is not in a form which would enable a listing of unavailable records of the 1960s relating to Gibraltar to be produced, without disproportionate cost. The catalogues available to the public in the Public Record Office note whole items which are closed or retained, but not the fact of a withheld extract, but because there is no pre-existent list of Gibraltar records, the catalogues could not be used to list closed records on this subject, except at similarly high cost.

<a name="80219w23.html_para2">The methodology for projecting future prison population is based on an analysis of historical trends (calculated by linear regression) of receptions into custody from courts.

In addition, any policy or legislative changes which may impact on future prisoner numbers are factored in as necessary.

 No. Courts can already take account of drug misuse by offenders by, for example, attaching a condition to a Probation Order requiring the offender to address his drug habit. It is also intended that Scottish courts will be able to impose drug treatment and testing orders, provision for which is contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill presently before Parliament. Under these orders serious offenders with drug dependency problems will be placed on specialist treatment programmes aimed at reducing or eliminating their dependency.

 In August 1997 I asked all Health Boards to begin preparing Health Improvement Programmes (HIPs) in collaboration with Trusts and General Practitioners. Greater Glasgow Health Board is close to finalising its HIP. This will set out specific measures to deliver care over the next 5 years effectively and efficiently in a way which puts the interests of patients first. Additionally, the HIP will set out a programme to tackle health inequalities in Glasgow and the causes of poor health in the people of Glasgow.

Studies of aspects of the scheme, including its design and economic development function, are nearing completion and will inform the trunk roads review. If the scheme were to be taken forward as a trunk road, rather than by the present promoters, a decision on whether or not to go ahead would be informed by the findings of the roads review and would depend on a variety of factors, including the resources available and competing priorities.

 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced last week, it is important that decisions on entitlement should be fair and be seen to be fair. From 9 February, no decision to reduce or remove someone's benefit under the Benefit Integrity Project will be taken solely on the basis of the information provided by the claimant--there will always be additional evidence to support the decision.




<P>
<P><I>19 Feb 1998 : Column: 858</I><P>

Payments of Disability Living Allowance are made where an adjudication officer has determined that entitlement exists and has awarded benefit at the rate and for the period appropriate to the claimant's circumstances. If an adjudication officer subsequently decides, whether as a result of the Benefit Integrity Project or not, that the person is no longer entitled to the amount of benefit in payment, there is no legal basis for leaving benefit payments unchanged.

We are aware that as we further tackle our backlog of cases from the Agency's first two years, there is potential for the volume of complaints to rise in the short term.

</FONT></UL><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Separate information on the number of cases where the absent parent admits paternity prior to any court action or DNA testing has only been collected in the current financial year, and this is shown in table 2 below.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The result of DNA paternity testing is virtually conclusive as the chance that two people have the same pattern is extremely low. A detailed breakdown of DNA tests in 1995/96 is not available, but a total of 1,377 cases were referred for discounted DNA testing between July 1995 and March 1996. Figures for 1996/97 and 1997/98 are shown in table 3 below. In 1996/97, paternity was established in 89% of cases referred for DNA testing. In the current year, to the end of January, the figure is 87%. This represents the overall percentage in establishing paternity; a breakdown into each type is not available. Once paternity has been established the Agency will pursue any arrears of maintenance that have accrued.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the end of January 1998, the Agency had 9,141 paternity cases referred for DNA testing awaiting processing, and a further 626 where action had been suspended. Thus, there were 9,767 cases where the question of paternity remained unresolved.
