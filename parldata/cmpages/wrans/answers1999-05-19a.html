I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about reports he has received from Eurofighter manufacturers concerning production delays. The matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Contracts for the production of the first tranche of 148 Eurofighter aircraft, including 55 for the Royal Air Force, were signed in September 1998. Since then industry has not submitted any reports concerning delays to the contracted production schedule. Prior to contract signature, however, industry advised that to maintain the delivery schedule it would be necessary to introduce lower functionality in early aircraft, with a series of increments leading to the full standard. Nations identified functionality standards that would satisfy the initial training requirement, and these were reflected in the contract. The availability of such aircraft will allow conversion training of pilots to go ahead as planned. All aircraft will be upgraded to the final standard within the agreed prices.

<a name="90519w01.htm_para2"><i>Letter from Robert Walmsley to Mr. Mike Hancock, dated 19 May 1999:</i>
<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para3">

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence which asked what percentage of the Scalp EG missile is being built in the UK; and what agreements have been made on the United Kingdom's share of the work. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Scalp EG is being procured by the French government for its own armed forces; it is essentially the same weapon as Storm Shadow, which we are procuring for the UK's forces, although there are certain unique requirements specific to each country. National procurements are being pursued under separate contracts: the UK's contract for Storm Shadow was placed with Matra BAe Dynamics UK Ltd in February 1997 and the French government's contract for Scalp EG was placed with Matra BAe Dynamics France S.A. in December 1997. The two parts of Matra BAe Dynamics act as separate prime contractors and hold the individual Storm Shadow and Scalp EG contracts for their respective national governments.
<BR>
Although a Memorandum of Understanding exists between the UK and France covering co-operation in and co-ordination on technical matters of these missile programmes, this does not allow UK access to details of the French Industries' commercial arrangements and commitments. I am therefore unable to provide the information you seek.
<BR>
I am sorry I cannot be more helpful.

<a name="90519w01.htm_para4"><i>Letter from Robert Walmsley to Mr. Robert Key, dated 19 May 1999:</i>
<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para5">

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the fitting of cockpit voice recorders to RAF Chinook helicopters. The matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Unfortunately, continuing technical difficulties associated with the development of the Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), of which the cockpit voice recorders form an integral part, and with the integration of this equipment onto the Chinook Mk2/2a helicopters, have resulted in further slippage to the programme of which you were advised previously The difficulties have been addressed jointly by Smiths Industries, the prime contractor, and the Defence Procurement Agency. The project has passed key major milestones this year, including Design Acceptance and ground testing, and flight trials will commence shortly. We now plan on having the first six helicopters fitted by late November this year. The plan to fit the remainder of the Chinook fleet by the end of 2000, remains as previously advised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90519w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has for the withdrawal of British army units from Germany.  [84972]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90519w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 I stressed in the Strategic Defence Review that the forward basing of ground forces in Germany would remain a key aspect of British defence policy. 1(UK) Armoured Division, with its three brigades, will continue to be stationed in Germany, together with United Kingdom Support Command (Germany) and the Headquarters of the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) with its signals brigades. But the withdrawal of some units to the United Kingdom will mean that we have a reduced requirement for barracks accommodation and can plan to return to the German authorities at least one Army barracks. The Army has now concluded its studies of its barracks requirement, and I am in a position to give a clearer indication of the likely impact, and timescale, of these moves, which are, to an extent, dependent on the timescale within which refurbished accommodation becomes available in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para6">The process of withdrawal will be phased and we do not expect the full withdrawal of the about 2,500 British troops that I announced to be completed until 2005 at the earliest. However, barracks are now available in the UK to accommodate 1st Royal Tank Regiment, currently located at Paderborn.
<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para7">The plan is therefore to withdraw this unit by August of this year. To make best use of the barracks vacated in Germany, and to meet our operational requirements more effectively, we intend to move 35 Engineer Regiment, currently based in Hameln, to Paderborn. Internal moves within Hameln will be initiated, which will enable the eventual handback of Bindon Barracks to the Federal authorities by 2002.
<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para8">Our plans for the later phases of the withdrawal are much less certain at the moment and many details have yet to be worked out. Our current assumptions are that there will be two further phases, the first involving the surrender of a barracks in Osnabruck following the withdrawal of an armoured regiment from there. We do not expect this second phase to commence before the year 2001, or to be complete until some time after that.




<P>
<P><I>19 May 1999 : Column: 346</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para9">The third and final phase will involve the withdrawal of an armoured regiment from 7th Armoured Brigade which is based in Hohne. In this case, it is expected that there will be a regrouping of units of the 7th Armoured Brigade with the result that the requirement for Trenchard Barracks, Celle, will cease, although some married quarters are likely to be retained. This last phase is unlikely to take place before the year 2005.
<P>

<a name="90519w01.htm_para10">Finally, I should say that these withdrawal plans are predicated on our current level of operational commitments in the Balkans, and that a change in the situation there may affect our basing plans.

 The Crown Prosecution Service has been piloting a number of initiatives to reduce delay as part of the inter-agency Reducing Delays Initiative. The pilots were completed at the end of March of 1999 and are now being evaluated. The evaluation report is expected in July 1999 and Ministers will then take final decisions on national implementation of the initiatives. The CPS is also continuing to make good progress in implementing the Glidewell Report, which made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Service. From April 1999, the CPS has been reorganised into 42 geographical Areas, each headed by a new Chief Crown Prosecutor. This re-organisation, announced when the Government first took office, represents a significant step towards improving the effectiveness of the CPS.

The amendment will be introduced through the Employment Relations Bill which is currently before Parliament. Adjustments to implementation procedures may also be made as necessary.

 <i>[holding answer 17 May 1999]:</i> The Government are keen to provide more information and advice on the environmental merits of different fuel and vehicle technologies, to enable fleet operators and private motorists to select cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Detailed advice on the availability and applicability of alternative fuels is already provided by the Energy Savings Trust's Powershift programme, which is funded by my Department. The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force intends to provide further information later this year about the merits of alternative fuel and vehicle technologies which are likely to emerge over the next decade.

<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para0">Local authorities are not currently required to purchase alternatively fuelled vehicles. They are, however, obliged to review and assess air quality in their areas. Where they conclude that the objectives set out in the National Air Quality Strategy will not be achieved, they must designate air quality management areas and put in place action plans to improve air quality. One measure that local authorities could include in such action plans is to reduce emissions from their own fleets through the use of alternative fuels or cleaner conventionally fuelled vehicles.

 Essex County Council's A130 Bypass PFI project was appraised using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA). NATA requires the problems with the existing road to be stated together with the options which have been considered for addressing them. Essex County Council did consider smaller scale local schemes but concluded they would not provide the regeneration, environmental and safety benefits that the new A130 Bypass will provide. All options were considered at the 1992 Public Inquiry which found in favour of the A130 Bypass route. Given these circumstances, an appraisal summary table was produced only for the A130 Bypass, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.

 We estimate that, as at June 1998, there were 1,850 people sleeping rough in England on any single night, including 621 in Greater London.
<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para9">These figures are the first detailed estimate of rough sleeping in England. They have been calculated on a basis agreed with the voluntary sector, using local authority data from local street counts and estimates provided by local authorities. Full details are given in the table, which includes the results of street counts in every area which has made such a count and (where no count has been made) all estimates above the lowest estimate band of 0-10. Numbers are shown in descending size order, by count and then estimate.




<P>
<P><I>19 May 1999 : Column: 356</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para10">The most robust information available is provided by local single night street counts. In 1996 DETR issued guidance to all local authorities on how to undertake street counts, based on a standard methodology developed in conjunction with Shelter and other voluntary groups. As well as encouraging all authorities to consider the need for counts, the Department has actively pursued this approach in all areas where information suggests there may be a significant number of rough sleepers (ie at least 10 on any single night). As a result of DETR and voluntary sector efforts, counts have been undertaken in 93 local authorities across England since 1996; another 4 authorities undertook counts in 1995 before the guidance was issued. Further information on rough sleeping in other areas is available from the estimates of the number of people sleeping rough on a single night supplied by local authorities annually since 1996 as part of my Department's Housing Investment Programme (HIP); the most recent figures available relate to June 1998.
<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para11">The methodology for producing a national estimate of numbers sleeping rough involves aggregating figures for individual local authority districts to generate a total for England. Wherever street counts have been conducted these data are used, and they are supplemented by figures derived from local authority HIP estimates in all other areas. As HIP estimates are provided within bands rather than as single figures (eg 0 to 10, 11 to 20 etc), these are converted into a single figure by assuming that the lowest point within the band is the most representative figure; this assumption is justified by clear DETR experience that local authorities almost invariably overestimate the scale of rough sleeping in their district until they undertake a street count,
<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para12">The national estimate of 1,850 thus arrived at provides the best possible indication currently available of the scale of rough sleeping. However, the accuracy of the estimate is reliant on the quality of the information reported to DETR by individual local authorities. The Department will continue to seek to improve the quality of information on rough sleeping by encouraging all local authorities to estimate the numbers of rough sleepers in their area; by investigating any claims by local agencies that they have evidence of a local problem that does not show up in the HIP estimates; and by encouraging areas where there is a known rough sleeping problem to undertake street counts at appropriate intervals as shown, depending on the size of the counted local rough sleeping population:
<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para13">

<BR>
(a) Areas with substantial numbers of rough sleepers (20 or more)--At least two street counts a year;
<BR>
(b) Areas with significant numbers (between 10 and 19)--At least one street count a year;
<BR>
(c) Areas with low numbers (under 10) or no rough sleepers--Local authorities to report estimates through the HIP returns, and DETR to ensure that street counts are undertaken in some areas to spot check the validity of estimates, especially in areas which had previously recorded a significant problem.
<BR>


<P>

<a name="90519w04.htm_para14">This approach should provide the basis for discerning trends in the numbers of rough sleepers over time, and thus for measuring the success of action to tackle the problem of rough sleeping. However, DETR will, in conjunction with the voluntary sector, continue to 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 1999 : Column: 356</I><P>
encourage the 32 local authorities who have estimated a significant local rough sleeping population but not yet undertaken a street count to undertake a count to generate more robust information on the scale of the local problem and to improve the quality of the national estimate. DETR will also encourage the 69 local authorities who have neither carried out a count nor provided a HIP estimate to produce better information on the numbers of people sleeping rough in their area.

<a name="90519w04.htm_para15">We will in future publish estimates of the total number of people sleeping rough in England twice a year, showing the position each June and December. To help put this information in context, we will also monitor the number of new rough sleepers coming onto the streets over time, and record the achievements of Government-funded activity in terms of work by voluntary sector agencies to prevent rough sleeping and help people to move off the streets.

<P>
<a name="90519w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 In partnership with the Local Government Association, the Improvement and Development Agency and the Royal Town Planning Institute, I have today issued a leaflet to all councillors in England, giving guidance on the training which they should be undertaking in planning issues. Planning is a crucial local authority function involving the consideration and balancing of complex issues. It has a central and positive role to play in delivering services to local communities. However, it can also raise sensitive propriety issues. It is vital, therefore, that those carrying out this important task are properly equipped to do so.
<P>

<a name="90519w05.htm_para0">The proposed syllabus identifies the key topics on which training should be given. We have also emphasised the importance of councillors being given a continuing programme of planning training to keep their knowledge up to date. The leaflet is being issued as part of my Modernising Planning Initiative to help improve the effectiveness of local authority planning services. It is also intended to help councils implement the recommendation of the Third Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 3702-1) that


<BR>
"All members of an authority's planning committee (or equivalent) should receive training in the planning system  ".

<P>

<a name="90519w05.htm_para1">We have, however, gone further than this. All elected members will have contact with planning and we have therefore given guidance on the training needs of all councillors depending on their particular role.
<P>

 The UN oil-for-food programme is the largest source of humanitarian assistance for the Iraqi people. It was established in 1996 under UN Security Council Resolution 986, and is implemented largely by the Government of Iraq under the supervision of the UN Office of Iraq Programme (OIP). It is much less effective than it could be if the Government of Iraq wished to provide effective humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq. The UK maintains regular contact with the OIP to monitor progress on the oil-for-food programme. We have proposed a number of practical improvements to the programme, many of which have already been accepted by the UN Humanitarian Panel. We have included our proposals in a draft Resolution, which is now before the Security Council for its consideration.

<a name="90519w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 From 1993-1997, (the last years for which figures are available) international donors (bilateral and multilateral) provided an estimated &#163;918 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq. This figure does not include the UN oil-for-food programme, which provides the majority of humanitarian supplies to Iraq, and is funded through the sale of Iraqi oil. International donors usually distribute their aid through UN organisations, such as UNICEF and FAO, the European Commission Humanitarian Organisation (ECHO), and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Non-Governmental Organisations such as CARE International, and Premiere Urgence. The Iraqi authorities permit only seven NGOs to operate in Baghdad-controlled Iraq.

 There has been a marked decline in living standards in Iraq since the Gulf War. The economy has stagnated, public health and education services have declined and infrastructure (water and sanitation, electricity) has seriously deteriorated. Food and medicines have always been exempted from sanctions, but it was only in 1996 that the Government of Iraq agreed to implement the oil-for-food programme. This has provided invaluable humanitarian relief, but has been less effective than it could be because the Government of Iraq have

not implemented the programme effectively. The UK is currently working to achieve an improvement in the operation of the programme.

 The three year public sector investment programme, agreed with the Government of Montserrat (GoM) as part of the Country Policy Plan signed in January this year, includes a project to rehabilitate existing school facilities. The actual detail of this project is still being prepared by the GoM. I will write to the right hon. Member when their plans are finalised.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90519w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The original concept for the new Government Headquarters (GHQ) had been for a basic, only temporary, facility. This was planned in the belief that the Government of Montserrat (GoM) would be able to re-establish itself in Plymouth. However, the subsequent escalation of volcanic activity meant that this would not be possible, at least in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the GHQ needed to be constructed in a more permanent fashion and with more extensive facilities than originally envisaged--thus increasing the cost. An audit, earlier this year, found that most of the increases in cost were unavoidable. I wrote on 15 March to the Chairman of the International Development Committee about the audit and copied my letter and the report to the Library of the House. I will send copies to the right hon. Gentleman. My officials have had on-going discussions with the GoM to ensure that the additional work is completed in the shortest possible time, commensurate with keeping the increased costs to a minimum.

<P>
<P>

<a name="90519w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We spent approximately &#163;2.7 million on consultants from the Montserrat programme in 1997/98 and &#163;1.8 million in 1998/99. We have budgeted &#163;1.8 million for the current year.

<P>
<a name="90519w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 No estimate for glaucoma incidence alone is available, and as treatments for the condition vary widely there is no reliable cost estimate per case. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that glaucoma, cataracts and trachoma account for more than 70 per cent. of the 36 million cases of blindness in the world. Nine out of ten of these cases are in the developing world. We have committed &#163;400,000 to the WHO's Social Change and Mental Health work under which "Vision 2020--the Right to Sight" initiative falls, and which aims to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90519w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We make clear in our White Paper in November 1997 that we are strongly committed to the international goals of universal primary education by 2015 and gender equity in primary and secondary education by 2005. Our education programme focuses on these priorities. They reflect strong international evidence that investment in the education of girls is the single, most effective way to reduce poverty. The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to supporting governments who give priority to the education of girls within their education systems.
<P>

<a name="90519w05.htm_para3">Clearly, as more countries achieve universal primary education there will be greater demand for secondary and higher education. We will work with governments to help find ways to meet this demand. We provide support at higher education level through scholarship schemes and academic links. Our academic links programme has earmarked funds to encourage participation by women and all links are organised to ensure that they are properly represented.
<P>

<a name="90519w05.htm_para4">Our support for the Commonwealth of Learning's efforts to develop ways of delivering education through distance and open learning systems will also facilitate increasing access by women in developing countries to higher education.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked Peter Mathison to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many families have received the increase in child benefit for the eldest child in the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency. As Mr. Mathison is away from the office on leave, I am replying.
<BR>
Unfortunately the information to identify families, by region, who are receiving Child Benefit is not readily available. These figures could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
<BR>
I would like to take this opportunity to explain the current rates of Child Benefit in force from April 1999. They are &#163;14.40 for the eldest child and &#163;9.60 for each subsequent child. The increase for the eldest child includes the extra &#163;2.50 a week announced in the March 1998 budget, in addition to the April 1999 increase. This is an overall increase of &#163;3.25 for a family with two children.
<BR>
I am sorry that I could not be of more help on this occasion but I am glad to have had the opportunity to comment.

 In order to receive contribution-based Jobseeker's Allowance a share fisherman must show that he has not failed to take up a reasonable opportunity of employment as a share fisherman. If he satisfies this condition, Jobseeker's Allowance may be paid.

 The Government, in line with other European Union member states, are committed to a policy of protecting Kosovar refugees in the Balkan region as far as possible. Where this is not possible, and in response to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) requests, the United Kingdom has agreed to the evacuation to this country of refugees. No account is taken of whether evacuees under this programme have documents, and liability under the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 has been waived for these specific flights.
<P>

<a name="90519w07.htm_para3">Kosovans who arrive in this country by their own means will be able to apply for asylum in the normal way. The general policy is to grant refugee status if there is no doubt as to nationality. A person entering clandestinely has committed an offence under section 24 of the Immigration Acts and asylum applications from undocumented applicants may be certified under the provisions of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. But sanction under either provision would only apply if an asylum application were refused. Carriers who bring undocumented passengers to the United Kingdom other than under the agreed UNHCR evacuation programme are liable to a charge under the Carriers' Liability Act. But where such a person is subsequently recognised as a refugee under the 1951 Convention, it is our normal policy to waive the charge or to refund it if it has been paid.

The outcome of the study has shown that although some local examples of good practice exist, much more needs to be done to tackle deliberately started fires. I want this report to mark the first step in the process to rectify that situation.
<P>

<a name="90519w08.htm_para2">The report makes 22 recommendations for putting in place more effective arson control arrangements. A great deal of emphasis in the study is placed on greater liaison and co-operation, so I want to hear the views of all those who can contribute to tackling arson. We will therefore be consulting a wide range of interested parties over the next few months on how to take these proposals forward.

<a name="90519w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, and more recently the Narey Review of Delay in the Criminal Justice System, recommended that defendants should not be able to choose to be tried by a jury in either-way cases which magistrates have indicated that they would be content to hear.
<P>

<a name="90519w08.htm_para3">Having considered this recommendation and the responses to the consultation paper I issued last year on election for trial, I am announcing today that I will be bringing forward legislation when parliamentary time allows to abolish the ability of defendants to elect for jury trial in either-way cases (where the cases are triable either on indictment at the Crown Court or summarily at the magistrates' court).
<P>

<a name="90519w08.htm_para4">The Government readily acknowledge that jury trial is preferable for certain sorts of either-way case. The question is whether it should be available at the choice of the defendant, or restricted to cases which objectively warrant it. In the same way that defendants do not have a choice of which magistrate, or which judge and jury, hears their case, we believe that defendants should not be able to choose a criminal justice jurisdiction where their case is tried. England and Wales is almost alone in allowing defendants a choice of court. In most jurisdictions, it is a matter for the court. In Scotland, it is at the election of the prosecution.
<P>

<a name="90519w08.htm_para5">The majority of cases in which the defendant elects for Crown Court trial result eventually in guilty pleas, but only after greater inconvenience and worry to victims and witnesses, and at considerable extra cost. This Government's proposals will end the practice that many rightly regard as a manipulation of the criminal justice system by defendants demanding Crown Court trial for no good reason other than to delay proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90519w08.htm_para6">But there will be safeguards. In determining where the case should be tried, magistrates' will be required to have regard not only to any defence representations, but also to such factors as the gravity of the offence, the complexity of the case and the effect of conviction (as legislation already requires) and the likely sentence on the defendants livelihood and reputation. Defendants will also be given an interlocutory right of appeal to the Crown Court against the Magistrates' decision on mode of trial.

<P>
<a name="90519w08.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Our White Paper "Modernising Social Services", published in November 1998, set out our strategy for the development of social services for all client groups including people with learning disabilities. They will also benefit from wider developments such as the proposals in our National Health Service White Paper and Public Health Green Paper, and developments elsewhere in Government. We have recently completed a review of learning disability hospital reprovisioning plans and a survey of 21 local authorities and their matching health authorities. The Department has also recently received comments from academic experts on the draft report of an evaluation of the cost and outcomes of different types of residential provision for people with learning disabilities. We will shortly be considering what, if any, further action needs to be taken in the light of this work and of the advice we receive from the Learning Disability Advisory Group set up last November.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90519w10.htm_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Ellman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when the report of the Prior Options Quinquennial Review of the Teacher Training Agency announced on 3 February will be published.  [84971]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90519w10.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The Report of the Prior Options Quinquennial Review of the Teacher Training Agency (TTA) is published today.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para2">The Report concludes that there is no case at present for abolition or privatisation of the TTA. There will continue to be a need for the core functions of the TTA. But the TTA's responsibilities should be redrawn to take account of the General Teaching Councils (GTCs) and the leadership college, and the need to bring some elements of the Green Paper agenda closer to the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE).
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para3">The Report argues that the TTA's current remit is too wide, and that the Agency should concentrate substantially on the two priorities it had when it was established in 1994 (teacher supply and recruitment and initial teacher training). Both areas present key challenges and the TTA will need to devote all of its efforts to meeting the Government's policy objectives in these areas.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para4">Ensuring that there are enough high quality candidates to meet the future needs of schools is crucial to the achievement of the Government's standards agenda. The Report recommends that tackling teacher supply and recruitment should be the TTA's top priority in the next phase of its work. The profile of this work will be significantly boosted, including through the employment of in-house marketing expertise and by taking over the Recruitment Strategy Managers' programme from the Department.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para5">Increasing both the rigour and the flexibility of initial teacher training provision remains vital in order to ensure that each new generation of teachers is properly prepared. The Government wish to build on the start the TTA has made on some elements of the ITT agenda set out in the Green Paper. ITT funding and quality remains core business for the TTA. And it should continue with advisory and developmental work in the area of induction.




<P>
<P><I>19 May 1999 : Column: 384</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para6">Following the formation of the GTCs and the leadership college, my Department will need to provide a coherent and strategic view across teaching issues. A clear division of roles and responsibilities is also needed between the TTA and the GTCs.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para7">Headship/leadership functions should become the responsibility of the National College for School Leadership in due course, with the DfEE taking lead responsibility for work on headship training as a transitional measure.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para8">The GTC for England should have an advisory role across the piece, but no funding functions at this stage.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para9">My Department will now take the lead in policy development to establish a coherent and strategic programme for continuing professional development. The TTA will retain operational responsibility for the NOF-funded ICT training programme.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para10">My Department will continue to take a strategic overview of research, and the TTA will continue to support the Government's drive for a research-based profession. But the TTA will commission research only in areas within its responsibilities. The GTC and the leadership college will maintain research capability reflecting their responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para11">The composition of the TTA Board will need to be changed to reflect the renewed emphasis on teacher recruitment, in particular, and the need for more of an operational rather than policy focus. Teachers need to by more strongly represented.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para12">I have agreed with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales that any final decisions about future arrangements in Wales should be delayed until the National Assembly for Wales is fully established and ready to consider the issue. The TTA Unit in Wales might be placed in the Welsh Office Education Department now. 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 1999 : Column: 384</I><P>
Teacher recruitment in Wales, which is not part of the Unit's responsibility, is currently handled as part of an integrated England and Wales programme by the TTA in London. To minimise disruption, this should remain the case until decisions can be taken by the National Assembly for Wales. Similarly, no change is proposed for the responsibility of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales' for funding and accreditation of initial teacher training.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para13">These conclusions take account of a substantial consultation exercise. In broad terms, the TTA are commended by consultees for their work on developing the link between funding and quality, improving standards in teacher training provision, promotion of teaching as a profession, and for implementing the Leadership Programme for Serving Heads. General criticism is expressed in the Report in relation to some aspects of the TTA's funding and accreditation approach, and over the failure to meet the Department's supply and recruitment targets because of continuing under-recruitment by some ITT providers. There were also some general concerns about the TTA's effectiveness, management and organisation, and how it relates to its partners and stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para14">I have today written to Clive Booth, TTA Chair, to inform him that I have accepted the Report's recommendations in full.
<P>

<a name="90519w10.htm_para15">Copies of the Report will be placed in the Library.

<i>(b)</i> The interpretation of strict confidentiality as requiring lengthy closure of the census returns was not printed on the census forms themselves before 1991, but is part of the Registrar General's policy agreed in 1974 by the then Secretary of State for Scotland and announced in Parliament (Hansard, Official Report Vol 874, no. 46, Written Answer cols 272-3). This confirmed that Scottish census returns for 1901 or later years would not be made available until 100 years after the census to which they relate, and that only in exceptional circumstances could closed census returns be accessed. These public access provisions were affirmed by the present Government in the White Paper "The 2001 Census of Population" (Cm. 4253), published on 4 March 1999. The closure period is intended to safeguard the confidentiality of the personal information collected in the census, and successive Governments have honoured an undertaking that the information would remain confidential. Protection of the credibility of the undertaking is crucial to maintaining the quality of the information collected.

<a name="90519w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Map checks only form a small component of the total number of detailed validation checks on Area Aid Applications carried out under IACS, and it is not possible to separate out exactly how many officials were involved. Map checks have been carried out on all 2,174,843 parcels entered on IACS Area Aid Applications in England between 1995 and 1998, and discrepancies in field numbers and areas have been discovered in 352,941 of these. However, some 73 per cent. of the discrepancies found were of a clerical nature which would have had no effect on any claims made. No separate information is available on the savings resulting from map checks in terms of the adjustment made to the value of claims, but they do not as a rule have a major impact. On the other hand, if the checks had not been carried out there would have been significant risk of disallowance of exchequer expenditure for reimbursement out of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. It is not possible to quantify the net potential loss involved as it is the responsibility of the Commission to decide the amount of disallowance for each individual case. The amount is calculated by determining the risk (real or potential) to Community funds.

 The Government have no plans to contribute towards the costs of those hygiene/welfare inspections conducted at licensed fresh meat premises in accordance with harmonised EU meat hygiene rules. We are obliged by EU law to recover the costs of such inspections from the industry and are not permitted to subsidise such costs. However, the Government's study of the impact of all proposed charges in the slaughtering sector, announced on 21 April, will also look at EU legislation and the way in which inspections are carried out so as to ensure that, when charges are set, they are as low as possible consistent with maintaining public safety and honouring our obligations under EU law.
