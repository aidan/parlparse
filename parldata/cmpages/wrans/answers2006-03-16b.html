The Education and Inspections Bill reinforces the position of local authorities as the commissioners of education in their areas, and places new duties on them to promote choice and diversity and respond to parental demand when carrying out their responsibilities.

<p><a name="st_43"><a name="60316w04.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department does not issue predictions over these time periods. The UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) is funded by Defra and based at the university of Oxford. Their projections for sea level rise were last updated in November 2005 and are given in the form of ranges. For Eastern England these were from 17 cm (low emissions of &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases, lowest estimate) to 77 cm (high emissions, highest estimate), including isostatic subsidence of 0.8 mm per year, for the period from 1975 to 2085.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60316w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_17">These ranges indicate the uncertainty inherent in such predictions which increases the further into the future one attempts to predict. There is significant inter-annual fluctuation in sea levels due to long-term tidal cycles and meteorological effects. It is not therefore helpful to look at relatively short-term changes over a single decade. The underlying rate of relative sea level rise in South and East England that takes account of both land level change and sea level rise has been of the order of 2 mm per year for recent decades.

The Department used the range of estimates published in the UKCIP 2002 report (from 22 cm to 82 cm for Eastern England for the period 1975 to 2085, including isostatic subsidence of 1.2 mm per year) as the basis of recommended allowances for use in the design and appraisal of coastal defences over the next 50 years that aim to balance appropriate precaution with the need to avoid expenditure on unnecessary works. For Eastern England the recommended allowance is 6 mm per year or 48 cm for the period 1975 to 2055 compared to the UK CIP estimate under high emissions of 42 cm for the same period. We are in discussion with the Environment Agency regarding appropriate allowances for the latter part of the century and expect to issue further interim guidance later in the year.

<a name="stpa_18">The changes between the UKCIP 2002 and 2005 estimates reflect changes in the isostatic (land movement) estimates. The main source on long term land movement in the UK, used as the basis for this recommendation and the UKCIP reports is the work of Ian Shennan at Durham university. The Defra recommended allowances have not been changed to reflect the 2005 change in estimate of land subsidence in Eastern England published by UKCIP. This and other evidence will be considered when the allowances are next reviewed but it is clear that they still represent a reasonably precautionary approach to the middle of the century. In view of the long term nature of coastal risk management investments and the time taken for project development, it is desirable that there should not be frequent fluctuations in the Defra recommended allowances.

 Nitrous oxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere. It is produced naturally mainly by the bacteriological breakdown of nitrogen in oceans and the soils of rainforests. Its common name is &quot;laughing gas&quot; and it is best known for its use as an anaesthetic in clinical dentistry. Approximately 65 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions are accounted for by natural processes, the remainder is due to man&#039;s activities such as artificial fertilisers, manure fertilisers, fossil fuel combustion degradation (and nylon production. Other uses of nitrous oxide are as a propellant in aerosol cans, in place of CFCs and it is occasionally used in the fuel lines of racing cars to enhance acceleration.

Drinking water supplies in England and Wales are tested for only those substances of relevance to public health. Tests are done routinely for nitrate and nitrite but not for nitrous oxide.

Likewise there is no standard set in the EU Drinking Water Directive and no requirement in the drinking water regulations for England and Wales for water companies to monitor drinking water supplies for nitrous oxide. Details of nitrate and nitrite standards and concentrations in drinking water are published on the website of the Drinking Water Inspectorate www.dwi.gov.uk.

<a name="stpa_24">Because nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas, environmental scientists have shown an interest in its concentration in the water environment. A correlation between the natural water concentrations of nitrate and nitrous oxide is recorded in the scientific literature pointing towards nitrification in soil as a main production mechanism of nitrous oxide in groundwater. However, nitrous oxide is not only produced as an intermediate step in the process of nitrification of ammonia in the presence of oxygen but it is also produced by denitrification of nitrate in the absence of oxygen. A NERC funded study of groundwater concentrations in the R. Bure catchment area of Norfolk was undertaken by University of East Anglia in 2001. The Environment Agency is responsible for determining the monitoring requirements for rivers and groundwater in England and Wales.

The latter scheme would allow the cost of capital assets to be written off against taxable profits. Regional support grants for capital investment in production plants are already available.

 The Hadley Centre has provided Defra with scenarios of global and UK temperature change, based on possible future greenhouse gas emissions generated by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change marker emissions scenarios; and scaled from the UKCIP02 scenarios for the 21st century. The IPCC emissions scenarios range from a low population growth, clean technology, convergent world (B1), to a high population growth, energy intensive technology world (A1FI). Forecast temperature changes derived in this way are subject to uncertainties in future emissions and in climate modelling. However, they provide a range of plausible futures.

The temperature increases shown below are relative to 1961&#150;90 mean temperatures (effectively relative to 1975 and hence the apparent large initial rise between then and the mid-2010s). The global temperature rise between 1900 and 1975 of approximately 0.2 oC needs to be added in order to estimate changes relative to pre-industrial temperature levels.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">Table 1 provides the most recent ward population estimates for West Lancashire constituency. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">The latest available ward patient register counts are for 2004 and are shown in Table 1 for West Lancashire constituency and Table 4 for West Lancashire district. It should be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons. Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas, population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

This research included a series of Local Authority studies carried out in 2004 which were designed to improve the MYEs in the areas that proved hardest to count in the Census. An extensive review was carried out for 32 local authorities to assess whether there was evidence that the population might have been under- or over-estimated. Included in this review was the Unitary Authority of Blackburn with Darwen, which prior to administrative boundary changes on 1 April 1998 was within the administrative boundaries of Lancashire. Blackpool at this time also became a Unitary Authority.</p>

The aim was&#151;and remains&#151;to create an integrated laboratory where different technical teams can work closely together with greater synergy and thereby improve the support Dstl gives to its customers in MOD and elsewhere in Government.

<a name="stpa_65">The housing benefit/council tax benefit performance standards, against which local authorities are inspected by the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate and assessed for the comprehensive performance assessment, require local authorities to have a strategy to encourage take-up. Their activities should go beyond the first step of raising awareness and should include targeted campaigns and partnership working with other stakeholders such as The Pension Service and voluntary agencies to maximise take up of all benefits.

<p>
<a name="60316w18.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_66">In addition, when pension credit was introduced in October 2003, we invested almost &#163;0.5 billion a year in increasing the amounts on which housing benefit and council tax benefit are based. This meant that around 2 million pensioner households became either entitled to council tax benefit for the first time or qualified for more help.

Notes:<br>

1. Performance against this target is derived by measuring the percentage of calls that are answered, of those available to staff. For CS2, these are calls that connected to the queue for an agent, after navigating the automated/touch tone part of the process.<br>

2. Performance for 2003&#150;04 is only available for the Agency as a whole and cannot be separated down into separate call centres.<br>

3. Robust data for CS2 is available only from July 2003. Therefore the figure for Agency performance in 2003&#150;04 is based on data for July-March only.<br>

4. Percentages are rounded to the nearest 1 per cent.<br>

1. A customer may have an overlapping claim for income support and incapacity benefit. For this reason the proportion moving to an out-of-work benefit due to health condition or disability is 18 per cent.<br>

2. A time period of three months around the date where the claimant&#039;s youngest child turns 16 has been used to assume that any claimant leaving income support in this period is doing so because their youngest child has turned 16.<br>

 The UK believes that the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s recently updated National Drug Control Strategy represents the best means of securing a sustainable reduction on the production and trafficking of opiates in Afghanistan. The strategy highlights four key priorities. These are: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment of problem drug users; and developing effective state institutions to combat drugs at the central and provincial level. The strategy also states that there is a role for targeted ground-based eradication where alternative livelihoods exist, in order to incentivise the shift away from poppy cultivation. As key partner nation for counter narcotics, the UK is committed to helping Afghanistan deliver its National Drug Control Strategy and to co-ordinating international assistance in support of the strategy.

The UK is supporting the Government of Afghanistan to deliver viable commercial crops as feasible economic alternatives to poppy. Farmers also need access to credit, land and markets, alternative employment opportunities, infrastructure, such as irrigation and roads to help grow and transport produce, and Government emergency mechanisms to ensure food security. Targeted ground based eradication is necessary to inject risk into the system and encourage farmers to give up growing poppy.

<p>
<a name="60316w20.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_81">Neither chemical eradication nor incineration of poppy crops are viable options in Afghanistan. Spraying chemicals or burning fields will not give accurate enough targeting to ensure that only those cultivators who have access to alternative livelihoods have their crops destroyed. There would also be concerns about the risks that both chemicals and incineration pose to the environment and human health.

 Offenders on Home Detention Curfew are continuously monitored during their curfew period, which must be for a minimum of nine hours a day. Staff from Group four Securicor will visit the offender at the curfew address on the day of release from prison to install the monitoring equipment. This uses radio frequency transmissions to determine whether the offender is present at the curfew address during the curfew period. Absences during curfew, or damage to the equipment, register automatically at the monitoring centre operated by Group four Securicor, who will respond with a telephone call and a visit if necessary. Once the threshold for breaching the offender is reached, Group four Securicor will report the breach to the Home Office release and recall section for further action.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="60316w26.html_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The consultation period on proposals to increase fees payable to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) ended on 3 February with a total of 66 replies being received. The great majority of responses coming from pharmaceutical companies or pharmaceutical industry associations. Of the 66 responses, 57 stated that they did not support the proposed fee increases. The majority of these responses stated that they supported the work of the MHRA and the need for the Agency to be properly funded in order to deliver its responsibilities effectively, but pointed out that fee increases of the level proposed were not warranted without a commensurate improvement in service levels received by companies. Many responses expressed concern about current levels of service, including slow turnaround of licence applications and variations. A more detailed account of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Mar 2006 : Column 2481W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the responses received can be found on the Agency&#039;s website (www.mhra.gov.uk) and copies of the replies (excluding those which have been made in confidence) can be obtained from the Agency directly.

<a name="60316w26.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">The proposals to introduce a new national scheme for homoeopathic products has been delayed until later this year. The implementation date will be announced in due course. The consultation responses on those fees will therefore be considered separately.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60316w26.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_124">We have considered carefully the replies received to the consultation exercise. There have been a number of enhancements to the ways in which the Agency undertakes its responsibilities to protect public health through assuring the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines in the UK. Some of these have come as a result of revised European legislation, others from improvements in monitoring the safety of medicines, including recommendations from the Health Select Committee Report on the Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry (published 5 April 2005). These changes, alongside infrastructure costs such as pension contributions, and the fact that fee levels were frozen in 2005&#150;06, have led to the additional costs to be recouped from fee income. The Agency, as a Government trading fund, is under an obligation to recover costs fully from its income from fees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60316w26.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_125">I have concluded that the fees increases are justified and have today approved the regulations to be laid before the House, for implementation from 1 April 2006. I have, however, taken due note of the concerns expressed in the consultation about the Agency&#039;s service levels. It is reasonable that in return for increased fees, companies should expect to see improvements in the way that their business is handled. The MHRA will therefore be working with the main industry associations on how to monitor service levels, and how to ensure that changes in the Agency&#039;s information systems and organisational structure deliver the intended benefits in terms of efficiency and speed of decision-making. I will ask the Agency to report to me regularly on progress.
