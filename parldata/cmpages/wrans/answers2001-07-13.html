<a name="10713w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our recent White Paper outlines the threat the digital divide provides to the prospects of poor countries. Our policy is to maximise the benefits to the poor by integrating the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) into our existing development activities aimed at achieving the international development targets. For example effective use of ICT can help improve governance and accountability, improve access to services such as education and health, and boost economic growth.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much debt owed by Belize has been written off by the British Government under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative in each year since 1997; how much debt owed by Belize is planned to be written off by the Government over the next decade; and if she will make a statement.

 &#163;1.146 million in debt relief was granted to Belize in 1998 covering repayments due on past UK aid loans from April to October 1998. Bilateral aid amounting to &#163;1.771 million for poverty-focused projects was agreed in 1999&#151;equivalent to the repayments due between December 1998 and March 2000. This was provided so that the newly elected Government did not lose out on the value of the debt relief but was given time to decide whether it wished to qualify for the benefits of the Commonwealth Debt Initiative. The remaining outstanding debt on past UK aid loans to Belize amounts to &#163;10.470 million, covering a repayment period which lasts until 2008.

<a name="10713w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> The hard strip was suspended while market testing of future Dome use options was begun. Independent professional advice has since been received that completing the hard strip offers maximum flexibility for any future use and does not prejudice the chances of the Dome being used for any particular use. Carrying out the hard strip enhances the prospects of finding a long term sustainable use, and therefore the work is proceeding.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what percentage of <i>(a)</i> local authority and <i>(b)</i> registered social landlord rents in Hammersmith and Fulham he estimates will be in excess of &#163;100 per week in (i) 2002, (ii) 2005 and (iii) 2010.

 Estimates will be available only when the landlords have completed their rent plans, which are due by April 2002. However, later this summer the results will be available from the case study research into the practical issues arising from the rent reforms in west London. These will include initial estimates of the effects of the reforms on the rents of properties owned by London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and Notting Hill Housing Trust.

<P>
<a name="10713w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what consultation his Department has carried out to date over his policy on rent restructuring with <i>(a)</i> local authority tenants, <i>(b)</i> registered social landlord tenants, <i>(c)</i> local authorities and <i>(d)</i> registered social landlords;  [3002]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department's approach to bring a fairer and more coherent structure to social rents is set out in the December 2000 policy statement "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all&#151;the way forward for housing". This drew on response to the April 2000 Green Paper "Quality and Choice: a decent home for all" which almost universally agreed on the need to bring more coherence into the structure of social rents. The Green Paper was sent to all local authorities, registered social landlords and national tenant groups.
<P>

<a name="10713w02.html_para0">We are now in the implementation stage. The Housing Corporation is considering the results to its March 2000 consultation paper on its proposals for implementing the rent restructuring framework among registered social landlords and will shortly be publishing interim guidance. It plans to issue final guidance in the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The December 2000 policy statement "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all&#151;the way forward for housing" stated that from 2002&#150;03 the rents of registered social landlords (RSLs) should, on average, rise by 0.5 per cent. above inflation (RPI + 0.5 per cent.) per annum. Over a 10-year period this will result in average RSL rents rising by around 6 per cent. in real terms. Estimates for housing association tenants' rents in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham will only be available once their landlords have completed their rent plans. However, later this summer the results

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Local authorities will continue to be free to set rents at whatever level they consider appropriate. However the approach to social rent reforms set out in the December 2000 policy statement "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all&#151;the way forward for housing" encourages social landlords to set rents on individual properties which are normally within a band of up to 5 per cent. higher or lower those indicated by the new rents formula.

<a name="10713w03.html_para0">Addressing pilot shortfalls is a key priority for the Government and RAF and a number of initiatives are being undertaken to address this problem. These include the introduction of an in-service degree scheme to attract aircrew at a younger age, fully manning the RAF training systems, and the introduction of targeted financial incentives and the Linkup scheme to help improve retention. A comprehensive review of aircrew retention measures across the armed forces is also being undertaken and will report later this year, hopefully in time to influence the Armed Forces Pay Review Body's deliberations for their 2002 report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence to which military unit the STANOC Centre is attached; for what reason it was transferred from HQ Director Royal Artillery; what the annual cost or saving resulting from the move is; and how many personnel were employed in the centre in <i>(a)</i> 2000 and <i>(b)</i> 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2001]:</i> The Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Night Observation and Counter-surveillance (STANOC) centre is currently part of the Royal Artillery Trials and Development Unit, which is an element of Headquarters Director Royal Artillery based at Larkhill in Wiltshire. As a result of the General Staff Review and a further study into Army Trials and Development Units, it has been decided that the STANOC centre's outputs would most effectively be provided in the future by disaggregating its prime responsibilities to the Land Warfare Training Centre (LWTC) and Infantry Trials and Development Unit (ITDU), both of which are based at Warminster. The current annual cost of the STANOC centre is &#163;242,878. The provision of new infrastructure at Warminster is currently estimated at &#163;65,000. Six military personnel were employed at the STANOC centre in 2000, and from 1 September 2001 three of these posts will be transferred to the LWTC and ITDU at Warminster and the remaining three posts will be redeployed elsewhere in the Field Army. Therefore, there will be no overall saving to the defence budget.

 We continue to discuss missile defence and related issues regularly with the United States.

And we welcome the fact that they are consulting with Allies, Russia and others on this important issue. But it is ultimately a matter for the US Administration to decide what sort of missile defences they will seek to deploy. They have not yet done so, and nor have they made any request for the use of facilities in the UK for missile defence purposes.

<a name="10713w04.html_para1">In addition, the NHS collects information on the number of beds also provided by NHS trusts in wards classified as being for patients who are terminally ill or in need of palliative care in the annual publication 'Bed availability and occupancy&#151;England', copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para2">It is for the NHS locally to make arrangements for financial support for hospices, given the extent of local diversity both of the services provided and of alternative sources of local support. Accordingly we have issued no guidance specifying a set percentage of revenue costs that individual health authorities and primary care organisations should meet. Successive guidance to health authorities has made clear their responsibilities for developing palliative care strategies based on the assessed health needs of the resident population.
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para3">The National Council for Hospices and Specialist Palliative Care Services has estimated that total expenditure on hospice and specialist palliative care for adults is &#163;300 million. Of this, &#163;170 million is provided by the voluntary sector and &#163;130 million through the NHS. Information on the NHS contribution to hospices over the past 10 years is not available.
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para4">The NHS cancer plan set out our commitment to increase NHS investment in specialist palliative care by &#163;50 million by 2004. This will mean that for the first time ever NHS investment in specialist palliative care services will match that of the voluntary sector. Health authority allocations in 2001&#150;02 included a total of &#163;255 million to support the first year of local implementation of the NHS cancer plan. Priorities for this year include the development of costed strategic plans for palliative care.
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para5">Cancer networks are currently developing detailed service delivery plans, which will identify current position and set out action plans for further development across all services including palliative care. These will be completed by the autumn.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> The Department obtains advice on potential health effects risks associated with electromagnetic fields (EMF), such as those from power lines or mobile phone masts, from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para6">Power line EMF has been reviewed in a report published on 6 March by the NRPB's Advisory Group on non-ionising radiation and provides an assessment of the potential risks of cancer. (Documents of the NRPB Vol. 12, No 1, 2001). Copies have been placed in the Library. The board of the NRPB also published a response statement which can be found on the NRPB website www.nrpb.org.uk. The report states that any possible risk of childhood leukaemia relates to those exposed at relatively high levels of domestic magnetic field exposure but that these are not necessarily associated with proximity to pylons or overhead power transmission lines. The conclusions indicate that the question of whether exposure to electromagnetic fields can influence the development of cancer cannot at present be completely resolved.
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para7">Mobile phone base stations (transmission masts) emit radio waves at very different frequencies to those fields generated by power lines. They are therefore being dealt with as a separate issue. The possible public health implications of mobile phone technology has been investigated by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart group). Its report, published in May 2000 concluded that:
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10713w04.html_para9">It also included a recommendation for a substantial research programme to be set up to investigate the possible effects of mobile phone technology more generally. A three year programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has now been launched and has invited proposals relating to all aspects of mobile phone technology including telecommunications masts and handsets. The research is being undertaken under the direction of an independent programme management committee. Details can be found on the Department website www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones.
<P>

<a name="10713w04.html_para10">The Department is also continuing to provide financial support for the World Health Organisation International Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Project which is comprehensively reviewing EMF effects, including those of power frequency fields and radio waves.

There has been no formal approach to Ministers, or the Department. A paper, to be taken in public session, will also include a proposed job description for the proposed new joint chief executive.

<a name="10713w05.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In September 1999 my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister promised that within two years everyone will be able to access national health service dentistry if and when they want it via NHS Direct. All health authorities now have in place dentistry action plans to ensure that everyone in the local area can access NHS dentistry if they want it within a reasonable time and distance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many and what percentage of patients waiting for in-patient treatment have been waiting for more than one year <i>(a)</i> at the latest date available and <i>(b)</i> in May 1997 in each health authority.  [2834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information requested is shown in the table. Waiting time information was not collected on a monthly basis in 1997 and so we have provided figures for the nearest date for which we have data.
<P>

<a name="10713w05.html_para0">In 1997 we promised to reduce waiting lists by 100,000. We have done this and today there are 125,000 fewer patients waiting for in-patient treatment than when we came into power. We are going to build on this. As part of our NHS Plan the National Health Service is working to reduce the maximum waiting time for admission to hospital from 18 months today to six months by the end of 2005. By the same date the maximum waiting time for an out-patient appointment will be reduced from over six months today to three months.

<a name="10713w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Approximately 20 per cent. of households do not have access to gas. The Government, Ofgem and the industry are currently working to facilitate the extension of the network. It is not yet clear how many households will be able to benefit from this work. However the Government hope that as many as possible will have access to the gas network.

 The review of energy policy will be considering what role, if any, the nuclear industry should play in meeting longer term environmental and security of supply objectives. As with other energy sources, the review will take into account all costs which are relevant to these longer-term questions.

<P>

<a name="10713w06.html_para6">However, I can confirm the IRISC has registered 54,938 claims in respect of miners' widows and families, to date. Of these, so far the Department has paid almost 6,000 bereavement and loss of society awards.

 It is difficult to say when all compensation claims for both respiratory disease and vibration white finger, VWF will be settled, not least because new claims are still being received.
<P>

<a name="10713w06.html_para9">With regard to respiratory disease, there are currently 153,200 claims registered and 900 new claims continue to be initiated each week. To date, almost 124,000 claims for VWF have been registered, with an approximate weekly increase of 330 claims per week. While the number of claims continue to increase, the Department is unable to provide, with accuracy, an estimate of the time taken to settle claims.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what was the average length of time taken from an interim payment in respect of a claim for chronic bronchitis and emphysema being offered to payment being received, broken down by area in each of the last three years.  [2779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w06.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Under the respiratory disease handling agreement signed between the Department and the claimants' solicitors, the Department makes the following interim payment:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. an interim payment of &#163;2,000 is made upon provision by a claimant to IRISC of verification of receipt of the Industrial Injuries Benefit, PD D12, subject to confirmation of the number of years of underground work as set out in the handling agreement;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. a bereavement award is payable to the widow upon production of a death certificate for their husband citing one of eight descriptors;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. when a claimant has attended an appointment to undergo the medical assessment process, MAP, and the report has shown that the claimant is exhibiting symptoms of injuries British Coal is liable for the IRISC, the Department's claims handler, is unable to make an offer in full and final settlement, an interim will be made;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. interim payments are made upon completion of screening spirometry with a tariff agreed with the claimants' solicitors in accordance with the criteria set out in the handling agreement.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10713w06.html_para10">The majority of these are made directly by issuing a cheque rather than making an offer and waiting for acceptance. The only interim where there is a prior offer stage is the one in respect of an initiative agreed in May 2001 to make a &#163;2,000 interim to widows in receipt of a bereavement award. The payment of this award is dependent on a response from the claimant and subject to certain criteria. The payment of this interim is also dependent on IRISC, the Department's claims handler, being in receipt from the claimants' solicitors of the requisite documents to ensure that payment is made to the right individual, as determined by the grant of probate. I regret that the Department is unable to provide figures for the turnaround time of these interims broken down by area. This depends, among other things, on the time of responses from the claimant. However, I can confirm that once IRISC is in receipt of the necessary documents, the average length of time taken to making a payment is 1.5 weeks.

process for claimants suffering from chronic bronchitis and emphysema and who have made a claim for compensation in the north-east area.  [2777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w06.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The key to speeding up the compensation process in the north-east lies in the recruitment of more respiratory specialists.
<P>

<a name="10713w06.html_para11">Healthcall, the company contracted to deliver the medical assessment, will move resources to areas where the rate of MAP assessments is unsatisfactory, such as the north-east. Recently, a specialist has been employed in a full time capacity in the north-east and a further specialist has been identified who is prepared to travel from Scotland to work in the Newcastle and Durham area.
<P>

<a name="10713w06.html_para12">Healthcall are also installing extra long function testing equipment at the centre in Durham to increase the rate of assessments still further. The use of one or both of the mobile testing centres in the area is also being investigated.

 At the end of 2000, unpaid fines in respect of parking and other minor traffic violations incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in the United Kingdom totalled 5,889. In May this year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to all diplomatic missions and international organisations in the United Kingdom giving them the opportunity to either pay their outstanding fines or appeal against them if they considered that they had been issued incorrectly. As a result payments totalling &#163;81,120.00 were received, leaving a total of 3,936 unpaid fines for 2000. The table details those diplomatic missions and international organisations that have more than 10 fines outstanding.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the issuing of an export licence in September 2000 for a military-listed chemical to Libya.  [4585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In September 2000 the Government inadvertently issued a licence for a small quantity of military listed chemical to Libya. This was technically in breach of the UK interpretation of the EU arms embargo on Libya. The chemical was for use in the laboratory analysis of water and sewage samples. The goods have now been exported and the licence has been returned as exhausted. As a result of the error we have revised assessment procedures of export licence applications to embargoed destinations. The Government continue to support the EU arms embargo on Libya.

<a name="10713w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Mohamad Fuad Mohd Ikhwan was detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) on 6 July. We are concerned at the recent use of this Act, which provides for detention without trial. We hope that all those detained under the ISA will be either charged or released. We and our EU partners continue to monitor the developments closely and take up the issue with the Malaysian authorities on suitable occasions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> The Connexions Service will provide access to a personal adviser to all young people aged 13&#150;19, including those with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. The personal adviser will provide advice, guidance, support and personal development opportunities based on each individual young person's needs, drawing on specialist services as necessary.
<P>

<a name="10713w08.html_para1">The Connexions Service will be required to arrange assessments for those with statements of special educational needs in the last year of compulsory schooling who intend to leave school, but continue in learning. The service will also have the power to arrange for assessments in other circumstances where they feel it would be beneficial, eg for young people with SEN, but without statements. These responsibilities are designed to ensure more effective transitions for young people with SEN on leaving school and moving through post-16 learning.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2001]:</i> Swimming is a compulsory part of the National Curriculum for Physical Education at Key Stage 2, unless pupils have met the full Key Stage 2 requirements during Key Stage 1. After Key Stage 2 it remains one of six areas of physical activity. The Ofsted report on swimming at Key Stage 2, published in November 2000, showed that well over four out of five schools inspected provided adequate time for swimming and four out of five children are able to swim 25m at the end of Key Stage 2. We acknowledge, however, that we need to work more with schools to make even more opportunities available for more children to be able to swim 25m by the time they reach secondary school.

 The contingency plan for Great Britain was submitted to the EU for approval in 1991 and approved in 1993. An updated version was sent to the EU in July 2000. This plan is very much an outline strategy which in turn is supported by detailed veterinary instructions and regional contingency plans.

 Livestock in Cumbria were culled only where, in the opinion of the Chief Veterinary Officer, the animals had been exposed to the foot and mouth virus. Computer records show that in the cull of animals within 3 km of infected premises in Cumbria, 503,545 sheep were slaughtered on 1,732 farms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> Details of precautionary measures are available from the DEFRA website at http://defraweb/footandmouth/about/index.htm. This includes guidance on taking vehicles abroad, imports and exports and trade issues.
<P>

<a name="10713w08.html_para8">Anyone who intends to import or export products of animal origin should check that they comply fully with the appropriate legal requirements which are in place to prevent the spread of diseases such as foot and mouth.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on slurry lagoons on farms affected by the foot and mouth outbreak.  [1669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> Slurry and liquid manure are normally treated by adding chemicals to raise or lower the pH so as to inactivate any foot and mouth disease virus that may be present. However, on many large farms the volume of slurry involved may make pH adjustment practically difficult and inordinately expensive. Moreover, the ground state may now allow the application of treated slurry. In such circumstances slurry and liquid manure may well be kept in lagoons or holding tanks until it can be applied to the land.
<P>

<a name="10713w08.html_para9">Environment Agency authorisation is always sought about the construction and location of lagoons. Local animal health offices have cleansing and disinfecting teams who can give advice on handling large amounts of slurry and liquid manure. This advice will include the ease with which particular amounts might be treated and the preferred disposal methods taking into account the local ground conditions and the relevant environmental considerations.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2001]:</i> The recommendations in "The Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Foot-and-Mouth Disease", parts 1 and 2, published 7 March 1969 and 3 November 1969 (the Northumberland report), form the basis of the Government's policy for keeping the disease out of the country, and of our contingency plans for fighting an outbreak of foot and mouth. Other reports also contributed to the lessons learned from the 1967&#150;68 epidemic, such as the "Origins of the 1967&#150;68 Foot-and-Mouth Disease Epidemic", by John Reid (Chief Veterinary Officer), 7 February 1968; and the internal Ministry of Defence report on the foot and mouth outbreak 1967&#150;68 in Western Command.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information on pyre and burial sites in Cumbria is being collected as part of a wider exercise relating to the whole of Great Britain. The location of all of these sites will be published once the information has been collated, cross-checked and validated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations the Government have received regarding the efficacy of vaccination in efforts to eradicate foot and mouth disease.  [2580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government and the Department have received representations from a broad cross-section of interested parties, both for and against vaccination, all of which have been carefully considered. The Government have made clear that they consider vaccination to be an option to keep under review as the outbreak develops.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many foot and mouth blood samples are awaiting processing at Pirbright; and what is the time from submission from the farm to confirmed result.  [2738]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As of Friday 6 July 2001 there were approximately 30,000 sera awaiting test. The time between the receipt of samples at the Pirbright laboratory and the submission of confirmed results to DEFRA depends upon the initial result and whether secondary testing is required. Over 40 per cent. of samples were being reported within seven days of receipt.
<P>

<a name="10713w08.html_para10">Testing is also taking place at the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research at Porton Down and the VLA laboratory at Penrith.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment the Government have made of ring vaccination as an eradication policy for foot and mouth disease.  [2575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Vaccination against foot and mouth disease remains an option that is kept under continuous review. Ring vaccination is one possible approach, which aims to control the spread of infection within and outside an infected area. It reduces the amount of virus circulating in the area, as the vaccinated animals will be less infectious.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 2001 : Column: 687W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10713w08.html_para11">We did not ring vaccinate at the start of the outbreak because it was apparent that the virus had potentially been spread across a wide area, due to the large number of movements that had taken place before the first case of foot and mouth disease was identified. This made ring vaccination an impractical option.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many premises that were confirmed as being infected with foot and mouth have subsequently received negative results from blood tests.  [2568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As at 8 July, 382 infected premises in Great Britain gave a negative result when tested for foot and mouth disease in the laboratory. A negative test result does not necessarily mean that the premises was free from the disease. For instance, if the disease is old the virus may not be present in the sample collected, and blood tests from newly infected animals may not give a positive reaction to the laboratory test as antibodies may not yet be present.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make it her policy to allow vaccination, rather than slaughter, where farmers and stockholders request it for those animals suspected of suffering from foot and mouth disease.  [3082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w08.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Our priority is to eradicate the disease and so policy decisions will be based on the expert veterinary and scientific advice on the best way to achieve this. Vaccination protects animals from infection, and so would not be used for animals that are already infected with foot and mouth disease. The policy remains to slaughter animals which are infected, suspected of being infected or which have been exposed to infection.
<P>

<a name="10713w08.html_para13">Any steps to vaccinate need to be undertaken with full consideration of all the implications for the disease, the handling and control of vaccinated animals and products, and wide implications for the EU's 'foot and mouth disease-free, without vaccination' status. A decision to vaccinate against foot and mouth disease must, therefore, be taken at national level and take into account the views and wishes of all interested parties that would be affected by a vaccination programme.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2001]:</i> The Environment Agency conducted a preliminary desktop study of Throckmorton airfield in order to assess its suitability as a burial site for animal carcases. The study included a risk assessment of the geological, hydrogeological and hydrological conditions at the airfield. This assessment was followed up by a full quantitative risk assessment by the agency using site-specific data gained from the site construction phase. The site was shown to be acceptable using the approved methodology.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10713w09.html_spnew6"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The estimated additional cost of this change would be &#163;650 million in 2001&#150;02 (cost net of savings on Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit would be &#163;340 million). However, this change would only benefit carers not in receipt of Income Support (IS) or where the increase is greater than the current value of their IS. 230,000 people would see an increase in their net income.
<P>

<a name="10713w09.html_para5">In April 2001 the Carer Premium paid through Income Related Benefits was increased by an extra &#163;10 per week and the Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) Earnings Limit was increased by &#163;22 per week. We intend to legislate to extend ICA to people aged 65 or over and to enable ICA to continue for up to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for. These changes will help an estimated 300,000 carers at a cost of more than &#163;500 million over three years.

There is a real downward trend in child poverty with 300,000 fewer children living in income poverty in 1999&#150;2000 compared with 1996&#150;97 and there are encouraging signs of improvement in pensioner incomes with the figures suggesting 100,000 fewer in poverty.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has received representations from the chairman of the Coach Tourism Council and a managing director of a north-east of England coach company. It is 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 2001 : Column: 695W</I><P>
the long-standing policy of successive Governments not to offer compensation for consequential losses associated with animal disease outbreaks. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is closely monitoring the effectiveness of the financial assistance measures made available by Government to rural businesses, which is worth over &#163;250 million. This package includes &#163;50 million allocated to the Rural Business Recovery Fund, substantial hardship rate relief and &#163;120 million available in loans under the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme. Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue will also agree to the deferral of tax or national insurance contributions where a business is in serious financial difficulty. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has provided an additional &#163;3.8 million to the English Tourism Council to get the message across that there is plenty for the public to do in the countryside, and &#163;14.2 million to the British Tourist Authority to rebuild confidence in Britain as a tourism destination in our key overseas markets.

 Our best estimate to date is that the loss of revenue in 2001&#150;02 by the English tourist industry is likely to be around &#163;120 million per week averaged over the eight-month tourism season. We are currently updating the assessment on which this is based in the light of the latest available data, including regional estimates made by individual regional tourist boards (these are not prepared on a consistent basis and so cannot simply be aggregated). We have not attempted to apportion the overall estimates to the individual regional tourist board areas, since the available data do not enable this to be done with a sufficient degree of reliability.

<a name="10713w10.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> It is for each Government to apply the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (known as the Valetta Convention) in ways that fit in with national practice and legislation. In broad terms, current measures in place in the UK already meet the convention's requirements. The Government do not believe that additional legislation, requiring a licensing system, is necessary to fulfil article 3. Much archaeological work is already controlled through existing mechanisms. There may be scope for developing a voluntary code of conduct for those who wish to undertake archaeological work outside the existing systems of control.

 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain, the conclusions of any study.

In mitigation, the clinicians' decisions were based upon clinical judgment rather than undisputed or unambiguous facts and the Chief Inspector's view is that the decisions taken by those concerned do not indicate any fundamental disregard for the welfare of the animals. Both infringements will be dealt by means of letters of admonishment to those responsible, none of whom is currently resident or working in the United Kingdom.
