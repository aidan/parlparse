 The role of the Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT) is focussed on future strategic issues and best practice at a national level, so I am satisfied that there is no general conflict of interest. I believe CfIT benefits from the added value of such a senior figure as Chair. However, in the event that CflT&#039;s work was to impinge on TfL&#039;s responsibilities the Chair has made it clear that he would declare an interest and if necessary excuse himself from that work. There are many other commissioners and a Vice Chair of CfIT who in that case would have no conflict.

 No such analysis has been undertaken by the Department of Education. The Post-Primary Review Body, established by the Department in 2000 to consider future arrangements for post-primary education in Northern Ireland, recommended that academic selection should end (Burns Report). The Post-Primary Review Working Group (Costello) established by the Department in 2003 was required to take account of the consultation on the Burns recommendations and to provide advice on options for new arrangements for post-primary education. It advised that no form of academic selection would remove the high-stakes, high-stress element and that academic selection at age 11 is itself educationally unsound, as this age is too young to commit pupils to particular pathways. Accepting the Costello Report&#039;s recommendations, the Government announced in January 2004 that academic selection would end and that the last Transfer Tests will take place in 2008.

<a name="stpa_142">Recognising that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with gene technologies and GM crops, developing countries should be able to make their own informed choices. To this end, DFID worked with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the international community to establish the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the UN convention on biological diversity (CBD). The protocol adopts a strong precautionary approach and aims to ensure that countries are provided with the information necessary to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of genetically modified organisms. It also facilitates the exchange of information on living modified organisms and assists countries in the implementation of the protocol. This means that importing countries are able to make a decision to avoid or minimise potential adverse effects of GM organisms, even if the potential extent of such effects is uncertain.

The population of children of compulsory secondary school age (11&#150;15) started to fall in 2005 and is expected to continue falling until 2014.

Many local authorities are facing falling primary rolls. Funding empty places can represent a poor use of resources particularly where schools with spare places also perform poorly.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60213w20.html_spnew6"><b> Bill Rammell  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 February 2006]:</i> By 2006, the Government will have provided nearly &#163;0.8 billion to higher education institutions through the Rewarding and Developing Staff (RDS) initiative, managed by the Higher Education Funding Council. Developing equal opportunity targets&#151;encompassing the need address equal opportunity issues including equal pay for work of equal value&#151;is one of the six priority areas for RDS. The KPMG evaluation of round 1 of RDS (2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04) showed that approximately &#163;43 million (13 per cent. of the total round 1 allocation) was spent by HEIs on this priority area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_178">Overall funding available to institutions also influences what they can pay their staff. State expenditure on higher education will increase by around &#163;2 billion between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08, taking total investment to almost &#163;9.5 billion. Moreover the introduction of variable fees in 2006/07 will increase the funding available to the sector by an estimated further &#163;1.35 billion per year, when it reaches steady state. It is, of course, a matter for individual institutions to decide how best to use the resources they have. The Government has provided guidance to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), through its Grant Letters, on issues concerning equal opportunities&#151;for example in the most recent letter (January 2006) we have asked HEFCE to continue to support institutions so that they can fulfil their statutory duties. We have not provided specific guidance on equal pay.

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_186">Historically, allocations for school nurses were not determined centrally and until the September national health service work force census, the school nurse establishment was not identified separately from other services for children. The 2004 census showed there were 2,409 (91,619 full-time equivalent) qualified nurses working in the school nursing service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">The Choosing Health White Paper made a commitment to provide new funding for school nursing so that by 2010, every primary care trust (PCT) working with children&#039;s trusts and local authorities, will be resourced to have at least one full-time qualified school nurse working with each cluster of primary schools and its related secondary school. Roll out will start from 2006&#150;07 in the 20 per cent. of PCTs with the worst health deprivation indicators (spearhead PCTs). There are 3,122 secondary schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">The identified funding for school nurses is &#163;20 million in the 2006&#150;07 allocation, and &#163;42 million in 2007&#150;08. The majority of the funding is prioritised for spearhead PCTs in 2006&#150;07, with the allocation for 2007&#150;08 shared among all PCTs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_189">Our aim is to ensure there is sufficient work force capacity to provide high quality health services in schools. There is scope to reinforce the school nurse role by drawing in other workers and the chief nursing officer has been leading work to modernise the school nurse&#039;s role. In the new year, we will be publishing updated material entitled, &#039;School Nurse Development Pack&#039;, which will outline the principles of a modern role and will enable school nurses to expand their knowledge, skills and competencies to further develop their child-centred public health role.

 Based on latest section 52 outturn statements received from local education authorities for the financial year 2004&#150;05, 21 schools in Cambridgeshire had deficit balances totalling &#163;2.7 million; 227 schools had credit balances totalling &#163;17.1 million; and two schools had zero balances. It is for the local authority to distribute funding to its schools using its locally agreed funding formula, and it is for schools governing bodies to decide how to spend their available resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">While schools are responsible for their own financial management, where a school is in deficit, it has to agree a three year recovery plan with the local authority to eliminate it.

The PSA target agreed in 2004 is, therefore, to reduce the 2002/03 level of absence (i.e. both authorised and unauthorised combined) of 6.83 per cent. by 8 per cent. by 2008. Since 2002/03 there has been a reduction in absences of 5.7 per cent. which is over two-thirds of the way towards the PSA target.

We hope that the use of the umbrella term will address the known concern of some Gulf veterans that we have not recognised a link between their ill-health and the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict. The PAT decision also confirmed our position that there is insufficient reliable evidence to indicate that Gulf War Syndrome exists as a discrete pathological entity, or in other words as a recognised disease.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what training courses were provided for <i>(a)</i> magistrates and <i>(b)</i> district judges on domestic violence in each region since 2003; what percentage of each attended courses in each region in this period; and if she will make a statement.  [50581]</p>




<p><a name="st_282"><a name="60213w30.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene. The JSB organises its training for the professional judiciary, including district judges (magistrates courts), nationally rather than regionally. It provides advice and support to those providing training in the magistrates courts but the training is organised and delivered locally. Data on the provision of magistrates training courses is not currently held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Since the amalgamation of the Court Service and the magistrates courts into HM Courts Service on 1 April 2005, the JSB is putting in place processes to monitor and evaluate the training delivered to magistrates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w30.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_253">Domestic violence training is not compulsory for magistrates. The JSB offered training for trainers in each region between October 2003 and March 2004 to enable them to provide domestic violence training for magistrates in their local areas. Representatives from all HM Courts Service regions attended these courses which were supported by the publication of a JSB domestic violence training pack for use in the training of magistrates.

<p>
<a name="60213w30.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_254">All newly appointed fee-paid judges, and all judges who are authorised to take on new jurisdictions, are required to attend a relevant induction course and normally receive continuation training in each jurisdiction they exercise every three years. district judges (magistrates courts) attend dedicated annual courses. Additionally, they are invited to attend specialist family courses on a three-year cycle. The annual DJ(MC) courses run between 2003 and 2005 did not deal specifically with domestic violence, but the courses planned for 2006 will include a domestic violence session and will be run for both full and part time district judges who sit in magistrates courts. Those expected to attend will constitute 99.3 per cent. of the district judge (magistrates courts) bench. District judges who sit in the county courts attend a dedicated annual seminar which included a session on domestic violence in 2003. They also attend civil and (where appropriate) family law continuation courses every three years. These courses include sessions on domestic violence. In addition to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1600W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 As part of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s constitutional reforms and based on the agreement made with the Lord Chief Justice in the Concordat in January 2004, the handling of judicial complaints will be undertaken by the Office for Judicial Complaints from April 2006.

 For 2005&#150;06 employers&#039; contributions for civil servants are payable to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) at one of four rates in the ranges 16.2 to 24.6 per cent. of pensionable pay, based on salary bands. The Scheme Actuary reviews employer contributions every four years following a scheme valuation; last carried out as at 31 March 2003. The contribution rates reflect the cost of benefits as they accrue (net of employee contributions), not the costs as they are actually incurred, and reflect past experience of the scheme. Staff at the Legal Services Commission are not civil servants, and are not members of the Principal Civil Service Scheme, but the Department does contribute to a funded pension scheme.

 The Firefighters&#039; Pension Scheme is an unfunded scheme and pensions are paid by fire and rescue authorities from revenue. There is therefore no employer contribution. The cost of the scheme is currently estimated to be 37.5 per cent. of pensionable pay and has increased from 34.75 per cent. since 1998. Members pay a contribution of 11 per cent. of pensionable pay which has remained unaltered since 1991.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the statutory compensation process is for <i>(a)</i> planning blight and <i>(b)</i> highway developments.  [49689]</p>




<p><a name="st_40"><a name="60213w38.html_spnew11"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Provisions exist in Part VI of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to assist the owner-occupiers of blighted land who cannot sell their property except at a reduced price because some formal plan or document indicates that it may be required by a body with compulsory purchase powers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w38.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_33">Under these provisions the owner-occupier may require the body responsible for the blight to purchase the property in advance by serving a blight notice. The effect of this notice is to bring forward the compulsory purchase procedure to a time of the blight claimant&#039;s choosing. When a blight notice is accepted by the appropriate authority that authority must acquire the interest specified in the blight notice and the purchase is deemed to be a compulsory purchase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w38.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_34">In the case of highway development, the Land Compensation Acts 1961 and 1973 establish that compensation is payable where an interest in land is acquired compulsorily. Following ministerial confirmation of the compulsory purchase order the acquiring authority will take possession of the land and negotiate the level of compensation. The principle underlying the level of compensation is that a claimant should be left no worse off and no better off in monetary terms after the acquisition than before. Compensation may also be available where a reduction in the value of land is caused by the execution or subsequent use of public works.

Note:<br>

The MVA scheme was introduced from 1 April 1999. MVA is the difference between the weekly amount of benefit that would have been paid or would have continued to be paid, and the benefit paid following the decision maker&#039;s decision on the information gathered. It includes both increases and decreases.<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w48.html_para9">
The overall figures for MVA have reduced each year. This is due to a reduction in the amount of Instrument of Payment (IOP) fraud detected over this period. Non IOP related MVA has remained stable at around &#163;6 million. Detected IOP frauds have fallen because of the Department&#039;s success in reducing the prevalence of this type of fraud through detection and, more recently, changes to the methods of payment that prevent this type of fraud. As at April 2005, 98 per cent. of pensioners and 95 per cent. of working age customers were paid by Direct Payment.

<p>
<a name="60213w48.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_102">The MVA figures do not relate to the published fraud and error overpayment figures used for the PSA target. This is because the published fraud and error figures use a sampling system to estimate how much has been overpaid or underpaid in fraud and error. This includes overpayment that has not been uncovered and identified but is estimated to exist. MVAs only relate to adjustments made to a claim after a fraud investigation and so will not include any figures for error, or any estimates of fraud that has not been uncovered and investigated.

<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60213w49.html_spnew2"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The document &#039;Measuring child poverty&#039; published in December 2003 outlines the Government&#039;s measure of UK child poverty for the long term. This measure forms the basis for the Public Service Agreement (PSA) target set in the 2004 spending review to halve the number of children in relative low-income households between 1998&#150;99 and 2010&#150;11, on the way to eradicating child poverty by 2020.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w49.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_105">The new measure will consist of three tiers; absolute low income, relative low income and material deprivation and low income combined. In 2006, we are planning to set the material deprivation and relative low income measures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w49.html_para2">
Across all three tiers income is equivalised, that is, adjusted to take into account variations in both size and composition of the household, and aiming to match current European conventions to make international comparisons easier, as we aim to be among the best in Europe. The modified Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) equalisation scale will be used; this scale is used with income on a before housing costs basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w49.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_106">The Government will continue to monitor progress on an after housing costs basis in order to monitor the impact of high housing costs on child poverty. Meanwhile the new material deprivation tier contains a range of items which capture housing deprivation including: the number of bedrooms for children, heating adequacy, and keeping the home in a decent state of decoration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w49.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_107">Housing is also an important part of the Government&#039;s overall strategy on poverty and social exclusion. Our annual opportunity for all report monitors the proportion of children in non-decent homes, and includes an indicator that monitors the proportion of families with children in temporary accommodation.

Notes to tables:<br>

1. The pre-application stage is where a potential application is screened to establish whether it is valid. Pre-application clearance is where the case either progresses to the application stage, a reduced benefit decision (RBD) is applied, good cause is accepted, or the case is closed.<br>

2. A case enters application stage where it has been accepted as valid at the pre-application stage. An application clearance occurs when a calculation is carried out, a RBD is subsequently applied, good cause is subsequently accepted or the case is subsequently closed.<br>

3. A case enters post calculation stage where clearance at the application stage results in a calculation being carried out. Post calculation clearance is where a collection schedule is set up, an MD arrangement is set up immediately after calculation, a RBD is subsequently applied, good cause is subsequently accepted, the case is subsequently closed, or the calculation is classified as being a nil liability meaning that no further action is required.<br>





4. The first payment stage is the time between a collection schedule being set up and a first payment being made to the PWC, or a Maintenance Direct arrangement being put in place. Additionally, there are a small number of cases where payment was made to the PWC prior to a schedule or Maintenance Direct arrangement being agreed (i.e. voluntary payments), which have been excluded from the analysis aforementioned.<br>

5. There are 161,000 cases received via the Jobcentre Plus interface for which we do not currently have sufficient management information to decide how many of them would or would not fall within the scope of this analysis.<br>

6. Figures are rounded to either the nearest day or hundred cases.<br>

1. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

2. Robust information covering the period May 2003 to February 2004 is not currently available.<br>

3. The above includes those old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment, and those new scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment (an imposed assessment due to the non co-operation of the Non Resident Parent), a small number of which would have deductions from earnings orders in place, are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#039;s target definitions, as are new scheme cases being processed clerically.<br>

4. Compliance is defined here as all those cases that are currently open and have paid money via the collection service over the preceding quarter expressed as a percentage of all those (currently open) cases with a collection service maintenance liability over the same quarter.<br>

 The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) recognises that mental health conditions are one of the major causes of certified sickness absence among working age people. The Department has a number of policies, procedures and other interventions in place which aim to identify and support our own staff who may be suffering from such conditions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w51.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_129">The Department&#039;s Attendance Management policy is designed to help managers deal with all kinds of absences, including those which are due to mental ill health. The policy requires managers to keep in touch with staff while they are absent, and conduct welcome back discussions on their return to work. It also provides guidance to managers on how to spot symptoms of possible mental ill health and how to consider what adjustments might be necessary in order to support the member of staff in doing their job. Adjustments might include changes to the job role or duties, a change of job, additional support or considering part time working or use of the flexible working hours arrangements. The Department&#039;s Occupational Health Contractor (Atos Origin) provides advice on reasonable adjustments and the impact the medical condition may have on the member of staff&#039;s ability to work effectively.

Corecare can also advise and support managers who have staff who are experiencing mental ill health. In addition, DWP introduced a Well-being at work policy in September 2004 in order to prevent, identify and address the causes of work-related stress. The policy is based on the HSE Management Standards and aims to assess stress at both an organisational and individual level.

 As the sponsoring Department for the HSC/E, DWP Ministers are very supportive of the workplace strategy and its themes, and committed to working with the Commission and Executive to facilitate delivery of our targets for health and safety improvement. The strategy has four themes designed to encourage good practice and increase understanding of health and safety requirements: partnership working; effective health and safety management; focusing on our core business and the right interventions; and communicating effectively. A report on the first year of the strategy was published in March 2005 and a report of the second year is due towards the end of March.

<a name="stpa_139">There are several examples of partnership working being successfully employed. The Health, Work and Well Being strategy, HSE&#039;s Stress Management standards and the soon to be launched Workplace Health Connect have all benefited from partnership working across a wide range of stakeholders. These initiatives will help to deliver HSE&#039;s occupational health targets and will also contribute to the Government&#039;s wider health agenda.

<a name="60213w52.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_140">HSE has developed two specific programmes of work to help others benefit from effective health and safety management. The Business Involvement Strategic Enabling Programme promotes effective health and safety management as an integral part of effective business management. HSE has published relevant case studies to help demonstrate this. The Worker Involvement Strategic Enabling Programme encourages more and better worker involvement in sensible health and safety risk management. The Worker Safety Adviser Challenge fund targeting those workers&#151;particularly in small organisations&#151;that do not have access to trade union safety representatives, made &#163;3 million available to partnerships who could demonstrate innovative ways for getting workers and managers to solve health and safety issues together.

The consultation was designed to promote and ensure a coherent overall approach to public safety, with greater clarity of responsibilities for the many agencies involved in protecting the public. The consultation has now closed and HSE will be publishing their findings shortly. HSE have also consulted on how they and local authorities can make best use of their resources to deliver health and safety improvements. This culminated in an account of the regulatory methods they employ, why they intervene and what they aim to achieve with each intervention.

<a name="60213w52.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">Over the last two years, all of this good work has been underpinned by strong HSE communications. This has been evident in their Backs 2005 campaign where they have successfully raised the profile of back pain as a major contributor to work-related ill health and the sensible risk debate they have been running since last summer where they have emphasised the key message of managing risks sensibly, not completely eliminating them. HSE continues to provide authoritative health and safety information using its website as the main point of contact. Since 2002 they have seen a three-fold increase in traffic on their website.

 The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 significantly extended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in a number of important areas.

We have no current plans to make any additional amendments to this legislation.

 Wandsworth has developed robust anti-trafficking measures, using intelligence and visible deterrence including wall patrols and dogs. All visitors to prisoners are warned of the risks they are taking if they try to smuggle drugs. All visitors are subject to standard search procedures using prison staff and passive drug dogs. The prison works closely with the Metropolitan police in action against organised drug gangs. Regular searching of prison staff takes place to check that contraband is not being brought into the prison. Intelligence is assessed against individuals suspected of corruption. A substantial number of mobile phones have been seized over the past 12 months as a result of a combination of searching and intelligence. The number of mobile phones seized has impacted on the trade of drugs. This is evidenced by a year on year reduction in the Mandatory Drug Testing (MDT) rate. MDT failure rates in November 2004 were at 18 per cent. compared with 12 per cent. in November 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he has issued to police on the use of cautions in respect of the offence of having indecent pictures of children.  [48539]</p>




<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60213w61.html_spnew0"><b> Fiona Mactaggart  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 February 2006]:</i> Guidance on the cautioning of adult offenders is contained in the Cautioning of Adult Offenders Circular 30/2005 issued by the Home Office. The circular offers a framework to help police officers exercise their discretion and professional judgment, but does not provide guidance in relation to individual offences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w61.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_11">The questions to consider in each case are whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender, and whether a caution is likely to be effective in the circumstances. Broadly, the criteria for cautioning are that there should be sufficient evidence of guilt and a clear and reliable admission of the offence, that it is in the public interest to use a caution as the appropriate means of disposal, and that the suspect should be 18 years or over.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w61.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_12">Indictable-only cases must be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. If all the above requirements are met, the police officer must consider whether the seriousness of the offence makes it appropriate for disposal by a caution. In order to assist with this decision, officers have been provided with a Gravity Factors Matrix, which is available on the Police National Legal Database. The guidance offers general advice in relation to sexual offences, which include the offence of possessing indecent images of children under 16.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w61.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_13">It advises that a decision to issue a caution in cases involving such offences should not be taken without consulting other relevant agencies. Currently a caution received on or after 1 May 2004 for a relevant sexual offence makes the offender subject to the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 for two years from the date of the caution.

<a name="stpa_22">From 1 December 2005 new provisions contained in the Drugs Act 2005 have been implemented in three police force areas: Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Nottingham. These give police powers to test for specified class A drugs on arrest and to require persons who have tested positive for a specified class A drug to attend an assessment of their drug use (an initial assessment). Whilst the DIP provisions for drug testing are not operational in North Somerset but other key elements of the programme are. Offenders can be tested for drug use as a requirement of a community sentence, either as part of a drug treatment and testing order (DTTO) or, since April 2005, a drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR) of the community order. The number of DTTOs and DRRs made in North Somerset from 2003&#150;05 were:

It is recognised that not all young people will be assessed as needing the rigours of an on-going drug treatment or drug treatment and testing requirement to address their substance misuse.

Further analysis of the 2000 data shows that 27 per cent. of offenders sentenced under section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 reoffended within one year and were subsequently convicted. The corresponding figure for 2002 is 24 per cent. Reoffending data broken down by legislative act is not readily available for other years.

Before owners can regain any vehicle so removed, they are required by law to pay fees prescribed by the Secretary of State to meet the costs of removal and storage. The Government consider it would not be appropriate for such costs to fall on the public purse. We recognise, however, the concerns that have been expressed by and on behalf of the owners of stolen vehicles who have had to pay for return of their own property. Following lengthy consideration of all the issues, we have reached agreement with the Association of Chief Police Officers on recommended best practice in such cases.

Most of these recalls are not the result of new charges but because of breach of conditions or changed circumstances.

Taking account of responses to this consultation, as part introduced a new category M into the drug tariff in April 2005 based on a new mechanism for setting reimbursement prices of commonly prescribed generics. The prices of category M medicines now reflect the average manufacturers&#039; market prices after discount, but leave a margin of unrecovered discount as part of pharmacy funding.

 Through the African HIV Policy Network (AHPN) and partner organizations, the Department has funded the campaign &quot;It&#039;s Better to Know&quot; aimed specifically at increasing awareness of HIV testing among people from African communities living in England. We are working with the AHPN to develop a further HIV awareness raising campaign to be taken forward during 2006. We fund the African AIDS helpline, which provides information in a variety of languages. We have also funded a pilot project exploring the feasibility of providing additional HIV testing facilities outside of the genito-urinary medicine setting. This pilot is currently being evaluated.

 The decision to advertise these posts is sensible contingency planning that does not pre-empt the outcome of the public consultation. If a decision is made to change ambulance trust configuration, it would be necessary to move quickly to establish the new organisations in order to minimise uncertainty for staff and for service continuity. This includes having quorate boards as soon as possible so that decisions can be taken and staff transferred to the new organisations.

 The national health service data spine is the technical architecture that underpins the NHS care records service in England (NHS CRS). Eventually all national health service staff involved in patient care will have access to the NHS CRS. The level of access granted will depend on their role. As at 31 January 2006 there were about 181,000 users registered for access.
</p>

<a name="stpa_99">Access depends on the use of a smartcard with photographic identification and a pass code, which can only be obtained upon verification of identity and through a formal user registration process. This process involves being sponsored by an appropriate user registration sponsor from the organisation in which an individual works and includes determining the level of access that individual will have. Access to a patient&#039;s care record is limited to only as much information as is needed for the purpose of the job role being performed in relation to the patient.

<a name="stpa_100">An audit trail will be maintained of everyone who has accessed a patient&#039;s information. Audits will be carried out to identify suspicious behaviour.

<p>
<a name="60213w77.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_101">NHS staff have a duty of confidentiality to patients, and a contractual obligation to comply with the NHS Code of Conduct on Confidentiality. Accessing the NHS CRS without a legitimate business reason constitutes a breach of the code, which is a disciplinary offence and could lead to dismissal. Patients&#039; rights are also protected under the Data Protection Act 1998, which provides significant penalties for non-compliance.

<sup>(63)</sup> Dentists with a reasonable commitment to the GDS are defined as dentists with GDS earnings equivalent to at least &#163;40,000 in 1993&#150;94 in fees for treatments and patient capitation. This equivalent is calculated each year by adjusting figures to take into account the effect of fee increases. The equivalent figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;59,100.<br>

If a patient suffers injury or illness as a result of a defect in the product, the manufacturer may be liable under the Consumer Protection Act 1987. Similarly, individual doctors prescribe or administer unlicensed medicines to their patients on their own direct responsibility. A claim can be brought against a doctor who prescribes or administers any medicine, whether licensed or unlicensed, if the patient can show the doctor acted negligently. Doctors are required to have in place appropriate professional negligence insurance cover in respect of such claims. Should there be claims for negligence, the court is unlikely to find that the doctor acted negligently if use of the product was supported by a responsible body of medical opinion and the patient consented to treatment. Although each case would depend on its own facts, the fact that the product is licensed in other European Union states and that its

 The pressure on health services from those needing unscheduled care is greater in the winter months. This is planned for, and other types of care scheduled accordingly throughout the year. This winter pressure comes largely from an increase in the numbers of elderly people requiring admission to hospital. As winter progresses, the age and length of stay of those admitted tends to increase as a result.

<a name="stpa_145">The excess in the number of deaths is only a partial marker for this increase in pressure&#151;for two main reasons. Firstly, many of the deaths are relatively sudden, and may not give rise to a hospital admission. Secondly, hospitals tend to have very high occupancy during winter anyway, irrespective of how many excess deaths there are in the community. For primary care services, there is an undoubted increase in the workload originating from older people living at home during the winter.
