To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the cost is of farm-scale trials of GM herbicide tolerant crops; what is the contribution from public funds; and what is the Government's policy with respect to funding such trials.  [116689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Farm-Scale Evaluations of genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops are being organised by the Government, in conjunction with the industry body SCIMAC. SCIMAC are providing the required number of fields of GM crops and equivalent non-GM crops (the crops involved are forage maize, beet, spring and autumn sown oil seed rape). The Government are funding an independent research consortium to carry out ecological studies. The cost of the ecological studies is currently &#163;4.4 million over the period March 1999 to December 2003.
<P>

<a name="00329w01.html_para0">It is usually the responsibility of the organisation applying for consent to place GM crops on the market to provide evidence of environmental impact. This is likely to include the results of studies carried out to support that evidence. In the case of the GM herbicide tolerant crops involved in the Farm-Scale Evaluations programme, the Government and industry agreed that additional research on the environmental impact of growing and managing the crops was required before general cultivation could be contemplated. It was agreed that these studies would be jointly funded as described above. It is anticipated that, in future, applicants will include such evidence in their dossiers when making applications.

For 2001 and subsequent years, MAFF will work with the Commission in order to clarify what types of margins are acceptable for inclusion in aid claims and identify ways of safeguarding environmentally valuable hedges so that we can reach a permanent resolution of this issue.

<a name="00329w01.html_para5"><i>Letter from Robert C. Martin to Mr. John D. Taylor, dated 28 March 2000:</i>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
You recently asked the Secretary of State a Parliamentary Question about Killyleagh Sewage Works. I have been asked to respond as Chief Executive of Water Service with operational responsibility for the provision of water and sewerage services.
<BR>
An appraisal of the options for improving wastewater treatment facilities at Crossgar concluded that the most cost-effective option was to pump wastewater from Crossgar to Killyleagh for treatment. The estimated cost of this is almost &#163;1.6 million. The scheme will also help to improve the water quality in the River Quoile system.
<BR>
In undertaking the appraisal study, account was taken of projected residential and industrial expansion to the year 2021 on the basis of figures provided by the Department of the Environment's Planning Service. These figures allow for an additional 350 houses at Crossgar and 335 houses at Killyleagh. Following the closure of local industry, the wastewater treatment works in Killyleagh is currently operating at approximately 32% of its design capacity. After the transfer of the wastewater from Crossgar, and taking into account the projected increases up to 2021, the Killyleagh works will operate at approximately 71% of its design capacity leaving considerable surplus capacity for additional residential and industrial expansion.
<BR>
No significant development work is required at the Killyleagh Works. Indeed, the key changes envisaged are mainly of an operational nature. In these circumstances the residents of the Killyleagh area were not directly consulted about the project. However, Down District Council was consulted and we received a small number of written representations, about various aspects of the project, from public representatives including the constituency Member of Parliament, Mr. E. McGrady. Our proposals were fully explained to these public representatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if an application for a nursery unit at Kircubbin Integrated Primary School would be eligible for financial support from the childhood funds; and if he will make a statement.  [116087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 No. The deadline for commitment of funds under the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was 31 December 1999, and no new project could be approved at this stage.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. John D. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at which locations nursery units have been provided with financial support from the childhood funds; how many of these units are associated with the Council of Catholic Maintained Schools; how many children of <i>(a)</i> Catholics and <i>(b)</i> Protestant background attend each of the units associated with the CCMS; and if he will make a statement on the impact of the EU package for peace and reconciliation on provision of cross- community nursery units.  [116086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Capital funds under the EU Childhood Fund were distributed on the basis of applications received and considered in the first place by the relevant Area Early Years Committee (AEYC), which made recommendations to the Department of Education. The Department considered and approved applications on the basis of whether the proposed provision: was sited where it would have maximum educational impact, in targeting area of greatest social/educational need; would create access for as many children as possible; and represented good value for money, taking account of viability considerations in particular.

<a name="00329w02.html_para5">When the report was published we made it clear that we wanted to hear the views of chief officers, local authorities, the insurers and all those involved in the administration of justice, all of whom have a crucial role to play in translating the recommendations into action. I am pleased to say that the response to the Scoping Study has provided a strong mandate to carry forward all of its key recommendations and for a refocusing of efforts to prevent arson.

<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para6">I am writing to those same organisations today to explain how we intend to take the recommendations forward. In particular, I want to see the efforts of Government, police and fire authorities, the insurers and other local agencies integrated and co-ordinated as the Scoping Study recommended so that the whole effort achieves more than the sum of its parts. We shall be taking steps to put these arrangements in place shortly. I also accept, with the strong endorsement of the police and fire services and the insurers, the recommendation to create a new Government-led Arson Control Forum to take forward the arson prevention strategy.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para7">Arson prevention must become a core activity of the police and fire services and we must work in partnership with other agencies and with business to eliminate deliberately set fires. The success of this approach will mean a safer society for us all.

<a name="00329w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what priorities will be set for placing juvenile offenders when the Detention and Training Order comes into operation.  [117117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Detention and Training Order (DTO) will come into force on 1 April 2000. It will become the main custodial sentence for juvenile offenders aged 12 and under 18, replacing detention in a young offender institution for under-18s and the secure training order. Detention under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 will remain available for the minority of young offenders aged 10 and under 18 who commit grave crimes.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para8">Subject to parliamentary agreement to an Order laid on 27 March, for under-18s sentenced to custody under the DTO or section 53, and those remanded to Prison Service custody or direct to local authority secure accommodation, new, more co-ordinated arrangements for the juvenile secure estate will start operation in April. The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales will commission and purchase places from the Prison Service, the Secure Training Centre (STC) contractors and Local Authority Secure Units (LASUs). This will give it considerable influence over the management of custodial placements for under-18s, and enable more appropriate and cost-effective use of facilities. The Board has drawn up commissioning and placement strategies to support its proposed new role and a copy of these has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para9">Initially, there will be 13 Prison Service establishments holding under-18s, three STCs and 200 to 300 places the Youth Justice Board expects to purchase from LASUs, through current negotiations (LASUs have 480 places in total, but have to keep enough free for local authority placements for welfare purposes or for those placed in secure accommodation following a remand to ordinary local authority care). So altogether, there will initially be some 3,200 places for youth justice purposes.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para10">Of these places, 2,800 will be provided by the Prison Service. There is &#163;51 million being invested in a substantial capital development programme throughout the juvenile estate, plus improvements in education, training and work designed to prevent re-offending and drawing on "what works" evidence-based research. This 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2000 : Column: 139W</I><P>
will, over time, make its establishments better equipped to deliver the acceptable and positive environment required to meet the needs of those held within them. However, the Government and the Youth Justice Board believe that further steps should none the less be taken to protect the most vulnerable under-18s. Within its total budget for secure placements in 2000-01, the Board will push this process as far as it can during the coming year, particularly in respect of the 100 girls under 18 serving custodial sentences.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para11">Beyond this, what the Youth Justice Board can do to move them elsewhere, and how quickly, depends on the numbers remanded and sentenced to custody by the courts and the physical and financial resources available to cater for them. If the numbers decline, the new powers will provide further opportunities to place more of these vulnerable young people in LASUs and STCs. In all placement decisions, the focus will be on matching the needs of individual young people to the available accommodation, based on the evidence of "what works", not least in reducing crime. The Board will monitor establishments' performance--within the Prison Service, LASUs and STCs--against service specifications to ensure regimes are of an appropriate standard and that the well-being of the young people is being properly addressed.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para12">As to future years, we have previously announced plans for two more STCs providing approximately 80 places. The Youth Justice Board will take over development work on these in April. We will be considering in this year's Spending Review what further provision should be made for new establishments to be commissioned by the Board.
<P>

<a name="00329w02.html_para13">With the improvements to the quality of the Prison Service juvenile estate, the greater flexibility available to place DTO trainees and the consolidation of commissioning and purchasing responsibilities with the Youth Justice Board, the new arrangements represent a significant opportunity to drive up standards and place young people according to their relative needs in terms of welfare and action to prevent re-offending. I am confident that the Youth Justice Board, working with the various providers, will fully seize this opportunity.

 Under the national policy framework for incentives and earned privileges, Prison Service establishments in England and Wales operate local schemes which allow all prisoners to earn a range of privileges through good behaviour and performance.

 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 23 March 2000, c. 672W]: </i>The gross expenditure figure for East Sussex should read &#163;279,979.
<P>

<a name="00329w04.html_para0">Data are available for the 1999-2000 financial year only in relation to the period 1 April 1999 to 5 December 1999. The data for 6 December 1999 to 31 March 2000 are not yet available in full, as not all claims have been received from local authorities. For the period 1 April 1999 to 5 December 1999, those local authorities who received more than their gross expenditure (as defined in the grant report rules) did so as a result of allowable commissioning costs. The grant rules covering this period entitle local authorities to claim the costs involved in commissioning premises to be used to accommodate asylum seekers. At the discretion of the Secretary of State, payment of up to &#163;10 per week for each person supported in such premises was available. The provision was taken up only by a small number of authorities. In some cases, local authorities could not be reimbursed the full amount of their identified gross expenditure for a number of reasons--for example, because they incurred expenditure on items which were not covered by the grant rules or had exceeded the unit costs limits set by the grant report. No estimate has been made for the whole of 1999-2000 and 2000-01 of the cost to each local authority of providing support to asylum seekers for which they are unable to claim from the Home Office under the grant rules.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason, in his Department's monthly asylum statistics published on 24 March, the number of asylum applicants<i> (a)</i> granted asylum or exceptional leave to remain and <i>(b)</i> refused, was listed as not available; on what data the figure for decisions in total was based, and for what reasons this could not be broken down by category; if monthly asylum statistics have been published previously without such a breakdown; and if he will make a statement.  [116693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The figure for total asylum decisions in February was obtained from a manual count by caseworkers and is consistent with figures provided in previous months. A breakdown of decisions, by type, was not available in February due to the transition to a new computer system, the Asylum Cases Information Database (ACID). Although information on asylum decisions is satisfactorily recorded on this system for operational purposes, further quality checks are being carried out to ensure accurate statistical information is published.
<P>

<a name="00329w04.html_para1">It is expected that a full breakdown of the decisions will be published in due course. A preliminary analysis has shown that the breakdown of decisions, for cases considered under normal procedures, in February was consistent with that seen in recent months with a high proportion of refusals of asylum. Monthly asylum statistics have not been published previously without such a breakdown.

<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2000 : Column: 145W</I><P>
22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 559W, on release of prisoners, if he will provide a breakdown by type of offence of the additional prisoners he estimates would be released earlier than now as a result of the electronic monitoring provisions of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill.  [116690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is not possible to give such a breakdown at this stage. The new powers will be carefully tested in pilot schemes before they are made available, and it would be premature to judge the possible outcomes of those pilots. However, there is no question of electronic monitoring being used to facilitate the early release of sex offenders or other high risk offenders. The availability of electronic monitoring for such offenders will not influence the Parole Board when making decisions or recommendations on release. The Secretary of State will be issuing Directions to the Parole Board to make this clear, using the powers available to him under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="00329w04.html_para2">The measures in the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Bill will not change any prisoner's eligibility for release, and any discretionary release decision will continue to be subject to careful risk assessment. These proposals should provide additional protection for the public. High risk offenders--when eventually released at the end of their term in custody--could be made subject to electronic monitoring as a means of reinforcing curfew or exclusion conditions in their licences.

 In the March 1999 Budget material the tax ready reckoner was published on a pre-Budget regime basis. This showed a figure for changing the basic rate by 1p in 1999-2000 of &#163;1.85 billion compared with the estimate based on the current regime of &#163;2.5 billion.

We would expect this to be much lower than the current full-year figure of &#163;1.65 billion, because only around 88 per cent. of the full year would be received in year.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question about the number of single parents in the United Kingdom. I am replying in Dr Holt's Absence.
<BR>
Latest estimates for the period September to November 1999 show that there were 166,000 male and 1,490,000 female single parents with dependent children. The estimates are drawn from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) household databases. Lone parents are defined in the LFS as those who are non-married, which includes single (never married), widowed, divorced, or separated, and not cohabiting.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if, to prevent confusion, he will ensure that the only notice of pay-as-you-earn coding for the tax year 2000-01 pensioners receive before 6 April 2000 is based on the anticipated level of personal allowances for that year for those aged 65 years and over, increased as required by section 257C TA1988.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on workers living and working in London earning less than &#163;4 per hour. I am replying in Dr Holt's absence.
<BR>
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the ONS's major source of labour market data on individuals. It can provide information on the earnings of employees both by their region of workplace and their

<BR>
The LFS is the most appropriate source of data to answer this question. It provides fuller coverage of people on low pay than the other major source of earnings data, the New Earning Survey (NES). In addition the NES can only supply earnings information for the region of workplace of employees.

Given the access which school librarians generally have to ICT within the school library, the Government have decided to give priority for the funding available under this initiative to teachers.

Before this date the entitlement is 14 weeks). Permanent employees are entitled to 52 weeks maternity leave provided they intend to return to work after the birth, are in paid service when the maternity period begins, and agree to refund any Departmental Maternity Pay (see below) if they do not return.

Parents of disabled children are entitled to the leave in days rather than weeks and up to the child's 18th birthday.

Whatever pattern is worked, full-time employees are paid a salary that includes a paid lunch break. The full-time conditioned hours of work are 42 (London pay area 41) hours over a five day week, Monday to Friday (this includes a paid lunch break of one hour a day). The hours of work for people who work part-time will vary and will be agreed with their manager. The hours do not include a paid lunch break but the hourly rate is higher to compensate. Individuals have the right to use the Flexible Working Hours (FWH) scheme if one is operated within their office.

Managers must consider the needs of the individual applying to work from home, including the individual's welfare, the operational needs of the team and environmental issues such as health and safety. As ES is largely a front line organisation, homeworking will be relevant only to a small range of jobs within ES and operational requirements will need to be considered. For the majority of ES employees this flexibility may be considered only for small periods of ad hoc at-home working.

<P>

<a name="00329w07.html_para16">Part year appointments (of which term time is just one option) are open to all employees. Managers should try wherever possible to accommodate individuals' requirements. If however, having assessed all possible options, to do so would leave the office operationally deficient, managers have the right to refuse an application.
<P>

<a name="00329w07.html_para17"><i>(k) Annual Hours Contracts</i>

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on what arrangements have been made to operate the Atomic Weapons Establishment sites at Aldermaston and Burghfield from 1 April. [117045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 21 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1223, that we were reviewing the AWE contract to operate Aldermaston and Burghfield to ensure the pre-eminence of public health and safety. The Government have always made it clear that we would not allow the AWE Management Ltd. consortium to take over the operation of AWE unless we were convinced that safety would not be compromised.
<P>

<a name="00329w08.html_para3">As part of this review each nominee for a director's post at AWE was checked for suitability and to confirm they were not connected with any of the incidents that have caused concern at Lockheed Martin's US facilities or to problems at BNFL Sellafield. The Chief of Defence Procurement also carried out a detailed scrutiny of the terms and conditions of the contract placed with AWE ML. He has confirmed that safety was treated as the highest priority.
<P>

<a name="00329w08.html_para4">The Chief Executive of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) has also confirmed that he is satisfied with the ability of AWE ML to operate the sites safely and effectively. He has therefore issued new nuclear site licences. The Environment Agency (EA) has already granted new site discharge authorisations under the Radioactive Substances Act to take effect from 1 April. As a condition of this the EA require AWE ML to submit a report by 30 April 2000 of any proposed changes to the existing management systems and resources and not to implement any changes without the prior consent of the EA. The NII and EA will of course continue to monitor rigorously the safety performance of the new company. Both have also agreed separately to carry out in-depth reviews of all aspects of safety at AWE and to issue public reports after three and 12 months.
<P>

<a name="00329w08.html_para5">Hugh Collum, the new Chairman of BNFL, is currently preparing a report for the Department of Trade and Industry on management and organisation at Sellafield and he has assured us that there will be nothing in his review that could reasonably be read as detrimental to the safe operation of AWE. The NII has also assured the MOD that the problems experienced at Sellafield will have no application to BNFL's proposed role as a shareholder in the AWE ML consortium.




<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2000 : Column: 160W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00329w08.html_para6">A strict and comprehensive safety regime already exists, monitored by MOD officials as well as the EA and NII. All three authorities carry out regular inspections and have the powers to scrutinise any paperwork, interview any individual, and visit any of the facilities at Aldermaston or Burghfield. They have the authority to close down any part or all of the facilities for whatever reason should safety be put at risk. AWE ML does not have the authority to alter significantly the existing operating procedures without first seeking the approval of the regulators.
<P>

<a name="00329w08.html_para7">In view of the satisfactory outcome of these checks along with the effectiveness of the existing safety regime at AWE, we are satisfied that safety will not be compromised by the implementation of the new contract. This is also the opinion of the EA and the NII. Accordingly, we have decided that AWE ML will take over operation of the AWE sites as from 1 April 2000. However, we will continue to scrutinise closely the safety performance of the new management. We will also be looking to the new operators to preserve and, where possible, extend the policy of openness adopted by Hunting BRAE over the last seven years.

An assessment of possible options for a new generation of high explosive shell to replace existing L15A2 and A3 shells has not yet been undertaken. We do not therefore have an approved L15A4 projectile programme, but any future procurement of a replacement for our existing L15 shells would examine all options, including collaboration.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many (a) former service personnel and medical auxiliaries and (b) members of their families, have made appeals to the Pensions Appeals Tribunal for compensation due to exposure to radiation from British nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific since 1970; how many have been awarded compensation and how many are awaiting adjudication.
<BR>
The War Pensions Agency processes claims for war disablement pensions, war widows and other dependants' pensions and associated supplementary allowances under the provisions of the War Pension Scheme.
<BR>
Details of claims relating to exposure to radiation in certain sites, including the South Pacific, are recorded on a radiation database. The earliest date of appeal recorded on the database is 1989. The database shows that from that date 57 service personnel and 31 widows have made appeals to the Pensions Appeal Tribunals. At the 22 March 2000 there have been 27 appeals allowed by the Tribunal of which 21 were former service personnel and 6 were widows. There are currently 5 appeals awaiting adjudication, 4 from former service personnel and 1 widow.
<BR>
I am sorry to tell you that information relating to appeals in respect of exposure to radiation made before 1989 is not readily available and could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost.
<BR>
If I can be of any further assistance then please do not hesitate to contact me.

The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many mothers he estimates will benefit from the Sure Start Maternity Grant in (a) Barnsley and (b) Doncaster.
<BR>
An estimate is not available in the format requested. It is expected that the Sure Start Maternity Grant (SSMG) take-up will be at approximately the same level as the existing Social Fund Maternity Payment, though because Working Families Tax Credit gives qualification to more mothers than Family Credit did, there could be a small rise.
<BR>
The smallest unit for which we can supply information is at the level of the BA district. Both Barnsley and Doncaster are in the South East Yorkshire District, which also includes Goole. Such information as is available is in the attached table.

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking for the cost of travel and subsistence for officers based in Edinburgh visiting clients throughout the rest of Scotland for each of the last three years; how many visits were involved and to what destinations. Also, how many visiting officers there are in each Benefits Agency (BA) office in Scotland.
<BR>
The BA does not hold data on the cost of travel and subsistence by geographical location. Most visiting officers are based in District Offices and do not make visits outside their home areas. Officers based in Edinburgh who visit customers outside the Edinburgh area

Their travel and subsistence costs cannot be broken down for visiting officers as they are aggregated across the Agency. Figures would include travel for other official duties such as training courses and meetings.
<BR>
The Disability Carer Benefits Directorate (DCBD) has calculated travel and subsistence costs of &#163;8976.24, for the period from April 1999 to date, for their officers in Edinburgh visiting customers throughout Scotland.
<BR>
The BA does not hold information centrally on the number of visits and destinations. These figures could only be obtained at disproportionate cost by manually counting entries in visiting officer's diaries.

The number of visiting officers based in Scotland is as follows:

<P>
<a name="00329w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The priority at present in the Irish Sea (zone VIIa) is to protect cod spawning given the serious state of cod stocks in this area. With this in mind the European Commission decided in February to close the area to most demersal fishing from 14 February until 1 May 2000. Shrimp and nephrops fisheries (in designated areas), however, remain open. I announced on 10 March that a voluntary agreement had been reached between the UK, Belgium and Ireland to withdraw flatfish beam trawlers from the closed area until 1 May. This has been welcomed by the industry.
<P>

<a name="00329w12.html_para0">In conjunction with the Fleetwood Fish Producers' Organisation, CEFAS is conducting trials in the inshore fishery to see what proportion of cod is likely to be taken.

<P>

<a name="00329w12.html_para1">There are a number of conservation closures in place. The Government do not believe it is appropriate to compensate fishermen for a decline in stocks or for conservation measures designed to improve stocks and hence fishing opportunities in the future; there is no history of this under preceding Governments.

 There have never been restrictions on the use of land in the UK as a result of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. However, restrictions on the movement, sale and slaughter of sheep were placed in certain areas of the UK. These restrictions have been progressively lifted from affected holdings so only approximately 430 of the holdings originally under restrictions are still under controls. This represents a decrease of around 95 per cent. Although the Chernobyl incident has undoubtedly affected the husbandry practices within the affected areas, the Government and devolved Administrations operate the Mark and Release Sheep Compensation Scheme to reimburse farmers for any market losses incurred.

 Debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative has been agreed for the first three countries, with Mozambique, Senegal and Tanzania being assessed next. Under the new framework, countries are required to develop poverty reduction strategies to qualify for debt relief. We are concerned that progress in finalising enhanced debt relief is slower than was originally agreed.

 We have recently completed a substantial evaluation of British-funded project support for environmental improvement in five countries including Kenya and Tanzania. The study found that nearly two thirds of these projects achieved their objectives successfully but that they had a limited impact on the livelihoods of local people. Our current environmental policy places much greater focus on the need to improve the livelihoods of the poor to achieve sustainable development.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what measures are being taken by her Department to improve <i>(a)</i> access to and <i>(b)</i> the quality of, primary education in Africa.  [115445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w13.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are committed to the International Development Targets of achieving universal primary education by 2015 and gender equality in primary and secondary schooling by 2005. In our bilateral programmes in Africa, substantial resources are allocated to education for the achievement of these targets. And in my meetings with representatives of African governments, I take every opportunity to discuss their commitment to, and progress in, achieving these targets.
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para4">We believe four things need to be done if these targets are to be met and there is to be significant improvement in access to, and the quality of, primary education in Africa.
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para5">First, we need a real and sustained commitment by African governments to securing universal primary education. We need to work with those governments committed to reform, and help them put in place the structural changes necessary to deliver quality primary education for all their children.
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para6">Second, we need to address the issue of resourcing for education. There is a clear need to increase the level of resources that African governments commit to primary and basic education. Too often, the needs of the primary sector are not funded because the university sector has more vocal and politically influential constituents. In Africa, the public subsidy for a university student is 20 per cent. of a primary school pupil. And investing in primary and basic education should be a vital priority area for development assistance.
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para7">Third, we need to shift from a projects-based approach to a sector-wide approach which gives appropriate priority to basic and primary education. And we need to pull together the work of all the different development donors around a focused, agreed strategy drawn up by the government of the country concerned. This means encouraging and supporting a sound macro-economic framework which ensures a sustainable flow of resources for primary education. And it means help with reforms to ministries of education, to systems of management and teacher training, book production, and tax reform.




<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2000 : Column: 179W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para8">The fourth thing we need to do if we are to achieve universal primary education by 2015 is to link education policy with the wider development strategy of the country, including policies on health, sanitation, livelihoods and rural transport. African governments and donors need to address the serious obstacles that often exist to enrolment, as well as the causes of drop out from school. This is particularly vital in the case of girls, who often face barriers of prejudice and discrimination, as well as economic disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para9">These are our priorities for Africa. This is also the agenda that we will be taking to the World Education Forum in Dakar next month. This meeting provides an important opportunity for African government, development agencies and non-governmental organisations--from North and South--to recommit themselves to a quality primary education system for all Africans.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the impact on children in Africa of the spread of AIDS.  [115447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w13.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 AIDS is now the biggest killer in Africa. A first major impact on children in Africa is that there are now 10.4 million African children who will have lost their mothers or both parents to AIDS. This is 90 per cent. of the global total of AIDS orphans. Many of these orphans are infected with the disease from birth or from breast feeding, reversing the gains made in child survival rates over the last 30 years. DFID is working in collaboration with NGO partners in many countries in Africa to reach AIDS orphans with the care and support they need. We are a significant contributor to UNICEF who have extensive programmes with orphans throughout Africa (&#163;10.5 million contributed in 1998).
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para10">A second major impact of the disease is on young people. About half of all new HIV infections world-wide occur in young people aged 15-24, with girls being particularly at risk to the disease. We need to reach children and young people early on and enable them to make preventative choices. DFID is funding a number of multi-media projects such as the BBC Great Lakes Lifeline service, and a children's radio service for the Great Lakes region, Angola and Mozambique. These services seek to reach young people and children with the right health and sex education information and messages.
<P>

<a name="00329w13.html_para11">Finally, the impact of HIV/AIDS on the education system is staggering. In the worst affected countries, more than 30 per cent. of teachers are infected with HIV, and many more students and teachers are not able to attend school because they are needed at home to care for sick relatives. Girls are particularly affected, often being the first family members to be pulled out of education to help in the home. DFID is working with a number of Governments in sub-Saharan Africa to assess and plan for the impact of the pandemic on their education systems, and to develop effective HIV/AIDS education programmes for schools. DFID is also working with NGO partners to provide support to girls and boys whose involvement in education is threatened by HIV/AIDS.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w14.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The World Education Forum in Dakar from 26-28 April provides an important opportunity for governments, development agencies and non-governmental organisations--from North and South--to recommit themselves to Education for All (including the achievement of universal primary education by 2015, and gender equality in primary and secondary education by 2005). We have seven major priorities for this Forum.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para5">First, we believe there must be collective re-affirmation of the Education for All (EFA) goals, allied to focused strategies for their achievement, and particularly the attainment of the international development targets for education. We know that where there is strong political commitment allied to well-defined and well-managed education strategies, dramatic progress can be made, even in some of the poorest countries.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para6">Second, developing country governments need to give priority to basic education. In many countries, this will require greater efficiency of spending within the education sector and greater focus on basic education; it may also require an increased share of national income to education. But even with the improved mobilisation of resources within country there will be the need for additional funding from development agencies. The Dakar Framework for Action should also make clear the willingness of funding agencies to allocate significant additional resources to support the achievement of Education for All, where governments have developed well-focused education strategies. No government seriously committed to basic education within a sustainable development framework should be thwarted in the achievement of this goal by lack of resources.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para7">Third, basic education should be firmly set within an overall, sustainable education sector framework. Funding agencies should shift from individual projects to broader support for a government-led education sector strategy which is coherent and able to exploit linkages with wider poverty elimination and development efforts.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para8">Fourth, on gender, we must move beyond the language of awareness to the language of action. We have learned that where gender is mainstreamed through government development policy there is progress. Where it is 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2000 : Column: 182W</I><P>
"projectised" the gains are local and slow. The Framework for Action should set out these lessons and their implications for effective gender equity strategies.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para9">Fifth, sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia should be accorded international priority. These regions are where the challenge to meet Education for All goals is greatest; they are also where efforts are greatly impeded by poverty, HIV/AIDS and by conflict.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para10">Sixth, we need better monitoring of progress towards goals and targets. This requires investment in the development of national capacity allied to efficient international monitoring systems. The potential of UNESCO's Institute of Statistics will be important in this field.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para11">Seventh, Dakar should look seriously at whether the existing inter-agency EFA structure will be adequate to its purpose in the future. Dakar should agree on principles for follow-up and monitoring which better engage national governments, civil society, bilateral and multilateral agencies and highlight Education for All as a development priority in all relevant international and regional fora, including the G8 and relevant high level meetings of the United Nations.
<P>

<a name="00329w14.html_para12">These are the priorities which the Government will be pursuing at Dakar.

 Crop failure is a regular occurrence in the Horn of Africa and communities have developed strategies for dealing with its effects.

In 1997, (the latest figures available) the UK share of the EC's &#163;12.39 million aid programme to Cuba was &#163;1.85 million.

 Working through sub-regional organisations and institutions, we support a number of projects aimed at reducing the proliferation of small arms in Africa including through controlling trafficking.
<P>

<a name="00329w15.html_para0">DFID has provided some &#163;300,000 through UNDP for the implementation of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) Moratorium on the importation, exportation and manufacture of light weapons.
<P>

<a name="00329w15.html_para1">This year, we funded the conference on "Tackling Small Arms Proliferation in Eastern Africa and the Greater Horn" which led to an outline Action Plan for the sub-region which will tackle the subject of arms trafficking.

We have also supported the participation of representatives of the sub-region at the UN Firearms Protocol negotiations.

 The UK, with our EU partners, recognises the difficulties faced by some developing countries in implementing WTO Agreements. We are ready to look sympathetically at requests for deadline extensions on a case-by-case basis, and agree that there should be no action to enforce implementation for the duration of negotiations on a new trade Round. Consultations are currently under way in Geneva on this and other implementation issues and I hope that a formally agreed position will emerge soon.

first, whether Agency status remains the most suitable way of delivering the services provided by NWML, considering all the options, including abolition, continued Agency status, market testing, merger or rationalisation, privatisation and strategic contracting out, taking into account NWML's contribution to the objectives of the Department and of the Government as a whole, developments in the national and international legislative, regulatory and commercial environment in which it operates, and the views of its customers and staff; and
<P>
<BR>
second, what additional services and functions could be provided, whether fee income could be increased, whether NWML's call on DTI resources could be reduced, and how its services and functions could be provided more effectively, for example through the increased use of partnership working and better use of information and communication technology, ensuring that lessons learned and best practice are clearly identified in the Report.
<P>
<BR>
The review is to be undertaken in accordance with the latest Cabinet Office guidance. The Reviewer will report at intervals to a Steering Board. It will be the task of the Steering Board to respond flexibly to the Reviewer's proposals during the progress of the Review, each member contributing guidance and knowledge, including where appropriate the good offices of his or her parent department. The Steering Board will ensure that Ministers, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office, and the staff and customers of the NWML are kept informed of the progress of the Review and will facilitate the gathering of information for the Reviewer and his or her communication with staff and customers.

 Recent events at BNFL have clearly been a set back for the company. It is important that BNFL now responds positively to the HSE's reports on the Sellafield site and works to achieve necessary improvements in its safety and commercial performance. This will take time. As a result, it now appears that the earliest possible date for the introduction of any PPP into BNFL could not be before the latter part of 2002. The introduction and timing of any PPP remains subject to BNFL's performance against the targets set by Government as well as the further work being undertaken by the Government and their advisers.

<P>
<a name="00329w17.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on Her Majesty's Government's policy regarding the legality of parallel trading of goods from outside the European economic area markets; and what estimate he has made of the impact on United Kingdom manufacturing if such trading is rendered lawful.  [116589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00329w17.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the Silhouette case [C-355/96] of July 1998 highlighted the extent of powers afforded by European law to trade mark owners. In particular, the Court decided that they can prevent the import into the Community of goods which they themselves have already sold in other parts of the world. This confirmed as a matter of law that the European Trade Marks Directive does allow trade mark owners to use their rights to prevent import of their goods into the Community after they have been marketed elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="00329w17.html_para5">Since this judgment, the European Commission has produced a study [Trade Mark exhaustion--Study on the economic consequences of alternative regimes by National Economic Research Associates for the European Commission] on the economic affects of such rights, and the results which can be expected if trade mark owners were to be denied them. The conclusions of this study are that a move to so-called international exhaustion would create beneficial impacts on the European economy. In particular, prices in some key consumer sectors would fall 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2000 : Column: 194W</I><P>
significantly, and competition in these sectors would increase as brand owners and retailers respond to increasingly competitive markets.
<P>

<a name="00329w17.html_para6">Our own studies agree with the conclusions reached by the Commission. In particular there is likely to be a beneficial, if small, impact on the United Kingdom economy. We expect a maximum of about &#163;400 million of additional imports would be generated by moving to international exhaustion. Total United Kingdom imports are around &#163;220 billion, of which &#163;180 billion are imports of goods. Additional levels of parallel imports would, therefore, be equivalent to approximately 0.2 per cent. of United Kingdom imports. Such imports are likely to arise in a limited number of sectors, principally clothing, footwear, sports and luxury goods for which there is already a strong import market. It seems likely that parallel imports would take market share from existing imports rather than domestic manufacturers.
<P>

<a name="00329w17.html_para7">In the light of these studies, we are discussing trade mark rights with our European partners with a view to changing current legislation. However, in some sectors where the Single Market is not yet complete or which are subject to other special conditions, for example pharmaceuticals, the benefits of international exhaustion are not clear, and care will be needed to ensure that unwanted results do not arise.

<BR>
The Minister of State, Cabinet Office has asked me in my capacity as the Chief Executive responsible for the Government Car Service to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the number of cars available to ministers.
<BR>
The Government Car Service (GCS) provided 85 vehicles allocated permanently to Ministers' Private Offices. In addition, GCS has a fleet of 28 "pool" cars which Ministers may use if their usual car and driver is unavailable.
<BR>
Ministers are not obliged to use GCS and Departments are free to choose other providers of these services.
