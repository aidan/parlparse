To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what changes there have been in the membership of the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment since June 1999.  [153247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10316w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There have been no changes to the membership of ACRE from that agreed at the end of the appointment process in June 1999. The current membership of ACRE was announced on 18 June 1999. One member, Professor Philip Mullineaux, was abroad at the time and could not be contacted and was therefore appointed formally in September. The membership of ACRE, including Professor Mullineaux, was announced again at the time of the Committee's first meeting on 16 September 1999.

 Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 7 per cent. between 1990 and 1998. 1999 emissions of carbon dioxide are provisionally estimated to be 7.5 per cent. lower than in 1990. The 1999 UK air emission estimates for greenhouse gases and other pollutants are due to be published on 28 March 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what steps he is taking to prevent unqualified and fraudulently qualified seamen from sailing ships into UK waters; [153587]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps he has taken <i>(a)</i> to guarantee the proper official certification of serving officers on merchant ships using waters around the coast of the UK and <i>(b)</i> to prevent the sale or exchange of qualifications for seamen. [153589]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10316w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As a signatory to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspects at least 25 per cent. of non-UK ships visiting our ports. An important part of any Port State Control inspection is the scrutiny of the qualifications of the ship's personnel to ensure that the qualifications are genuine and valid. Where there is any concern, the holder is questioned to determine the propriety of the qualification. Where appropriate, prosecutions for fraud have been pursued in close co-operation with the police. The MCA inspects UK ships in a similar manner as under Port State Control. No ship is permitted to sail from any UK port without correctly qualified seafarers.

 After discussions between my Officials, the International Transport Workers Federation and officials in other maritime administrations, the United Kingdom co-sponsored a paper concerning fraudulent certification that was discussed at the Maritime Safety Committee meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 1999. The IMO subsequently commissioned a Research Project by the Seafarers International Research Centre in Cardiff. The UK contributed &#163;5,000 towards the project and participated in the research.

<a name="10316w01.html_para2">The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions also contributed funding to the project. A summary Report will be put forward for consideration by the Maritime Safety Committee at its meeting in May 2001 and the full Report will be considered by an expert sub-committee in January 2002.

<P>
<a name="10316w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> Bidders are required to submit plans covering all NATS' major capital projects in the most integrated and efficient manner. The NSC, as part of the two centre strategy endorsed by the Government, is expected to have the capacity to service the Scottish FIR, the Oceanic region and provide a significant contingency in the case of catastrophic failure of NERC/LATCC.
<P>

<a name="10316w01.html_para3">The two phase strategy for the NSC was announced by the Minister for Transport in April 1999. Phase 1 included development of detailed design of the building and systems, as well as software development, with Phase 2 containing the implementation of these designs, and bringing the centre into operation. This strategy was modified in February 2000, following the signing of an agreement between the systems supplier Lockheed Martin and NATS, and the retendering of the building design and construction contracts. This approach is expected to save over &#163;100 million in comparison with the original PFI proposals for the New Scottish Centre.
<P>

<a name="10316w01.html_para4">Site preparation for the NSC has already started. Detailed design of the building is being carried out by Gibb Ltd., and NATS expects to appoint the main construction contractor by the end of 2001. On the systems side, software design is continuing.
<P>

<a name="10316w01.html_para5">The operational date for the NSC is largely a matter for the Strategic Partner--it will be obliged under the Strategic Partnership to bring the NSC into service by a given date, but may choose to do so before then.
<P>

<a name="10316w01.html_para6">The Government will be carefully scrutinising the bidder's complete investment plans as well as their proposals for the New Scottish Centre (NSC) in particular. This will involve a careful analysis of their strategies for safety management; procurement and financing; software integration; capacity planning; contingency capability for NERC; introduction of new controller tools; transition planning; and the overall impact on the mode of operations and controller interface and training.

<a name="10316w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> British Waterways (BW) closed access to all its waterways located in affected and restricted areas from the beginning of the month to help limit the spread of foot and mouth disease. The closure applies where county councils have taken powers to close rights of way and prevents all non-essential use of the waterways concerned.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para0">The Government have established a task force chaired by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment to consider the implications of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease for the rural economy. The implications for the canal network (and other waterways) will be within the ambit of this group which will be considering whether and where it is safe to reopen rights of way, including waterways. The task force will also help those caught up in the crisis and measures to help the rural economy once the outbreak has been eradicated.

<a name="10316w02.html_para6">A modern communications system brings massive benefits to people and businesses alike. Nearly 40 million people--60 per cent. of the UK population--use mobile phones. They enjoy the convenience and accessibility they provide. Parents and children feel more secure because of them. Mobile phones have saved lives--they allow the emergency services to be called immediately when they are needed. None of this could happen without the masts and other infrastructure which enable the service to be delivered.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para7">But people are concerned about where masts are located. It is vital that masts are designed and sited sensitively so that their environmental impact is kept to a minimum. Local people must have a better opportunity than now to have their say on proposals for mast development.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para8">We recognise too that there is public concern about the possibility of health effects associated with mobile phone masts. That is why the Government set up the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (chaired by Sir William Stewart) which published its report in May last year. The report suggested that the current planning requirements for masts of 15 metres and below did not allow adequate public consultation. It further suggested that lack of consultation was a major cause of grievance in people who suffer a loss of amenity when base stations are erected.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para9">We therefore intend to strengthen the current public consultation requirements for masts of 15 metres and under to incorporate exactly the same requirements as for masts over that size and for other development requiring applications for planning permission.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para10">To give local planning authorities more time to consult local people we shall increase the amount of time they have to determine prior approval applications for ground-based masts and those on buildings from 42 and 28 days respectively to a uniform 56 days. In addition, we shall extend the prior approval arrangements to cover antennas on roofs where the height of the antenna (including any supporting structure) would exceed 4 metres.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para11">Under the new arrangements, local planning authorities will be expected to make their decisions within 56 days. Authorities will still be able to turn down mast applications where they do not consider amenity aspects have been adequately addressed. If they have not made a decision within 56 days, approval will be deemed to have been granted. This discipline is needed because many authorities are failing to meet their Best Value target to determine 80 per cent. of planning applications in eight weeks and delay cannot be justified.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para12">In recognition of the extra demands which improved consultation will make of authorities we propose to increase the fee payable by developers for prior approval applications from &#163;35 to &#163;190 so that authorities have more resources to handle them.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para13">These changes represent a considerable strengthening of the current arrangements. We shall introduce them, and revised national planning policy guidance, at the earliest opportunity. The guidance will underline our commitment to encouraging mast and site sharing, where that represents the best environmental solution, to minimise proliferation of masts. It will also emphasise the 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2001 : Column: 750W</I><P>
Government's view that telecommunications development must be taken forward through partnership between the operator, the local planning authority and the local community. The revised guidance will make it clear that governing bodies must be consulted on all proposals to site masts on or near schools and colleges.
<P>

<a name="10316w02.html_para14">We welcome the commitments which the operators have made to develop, with other stakeholders, clear standards and procedures to deliver significantly improved consultation with local communities. For example, operators will initiate the process as early as possible by discussing optimum design and siting solutions even before applications for masts are submitted. We shall want to ensure that these commitments are implemented and followed in every case. We will underpin the arrangements with a new Code of Practice developed with the operators and representatives of local government. I intend to call in the operators shortly to discuss next steps.

"the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of the guidelines."
Gaps in scientific knowledge led the Group to recommend a precautionary approach to the use of mobile phone technologies, comprising a series of specific measures, until more research findings become available. We agree with this approach.

This view will be reiterated in our revised planning policy guidance.

 I assume that this question refers to the contract recently placed in keeping with the existing procurement strategy for the Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture (DFM) Phase of the Type 45.
<P>

<a name="10316w03.html_para33">In November 1999, BAE Systems was nominated as the Prime Contractor for the Type 45 Programme following the end of the tri-national Horizon Programme. BAE Systems was nominated because of the previous involvement of GEC Marconi in the Horizon International Joint Venture Company, so it could make maximum re-use of the outputs of the Horizon definition work, and they demonstrated an ability to resource the programme to achieve the timeliness in partnership with the IPT. A competition to select the Type 45 Prime Contractor risked delaying the ISD by at least six months and probably longer.
<P>

<a name="10316w03.html_para34">The criteria under which BAE Systems was contracted in December 2000 for the DFM Phase are to deliver the first three Type 45 Destroyers, on schedule and to time.

<a name="10316w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the emerging findings of these reviews are being published today for public consultation. I appreciate that both reviews are taking longer than originally intended, but they have raised complicated issues and I am determined that we should find the right package of benefits appropriate for our Armed Forces in modern society.
<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para8">The review teams have carried out detailed analysis of the current arrangements and the options for modernisation. They have set out options in each area, working closely with the Services personnel staff. The next stage in the review process is to seek the views of individual Service personnel, ex-Service and Widows organisations and the general public. This will include wide circulation of material describing the proposed changes, both in hard copy and on a range of websites. We will also be going out to interested organisations to explain our proposals, answer any questions and seek views. Because of the complexity of the proposals I have allowed over four months for consultation. After this time we will publish a summary of the responses and consider how to take the package forward in the light of them.
<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para9">Copies of the consultation documents will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will also be available on the MOD website. The Joint Compensation Review consultation document will also be available on the DSS War Pensions Agency website.

<a name="10316w04.html_para10">The period for which a war disablement pension is awarded represents the length of time over which it is judged that the assessed level of service-related disablement will remain stable.

<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para11">Regardless of the length of any award, if at any time the war pensioner believes that their pensioned condition has deteriorated, he or she may request a review of the award and the assessed level of their service-related disablement, by the Secretary of State for Social Security.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10316w04.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to change the capacity penalty arrangements applying to the transfer and aggregation of fishing vessel licences; and if he will make a statement.  [154475]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10316w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The operation of fishing vessel licensing arrangements has been recently reviewed by a joint industry/departmental working group and a copy of the group's report is being placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para13">The working group has recommended that the existing capacity penalty arrangements should be maintained for the time being but that the penalty relating to the uprating of an existing engine, or to an increase in power following its replacement, should be based on the increase in the vessel's capacity rather than its overall capacity. The Fisheries Departments in the UK agree and arrangements are being made to notify the owners of licensed fishing vessels.
<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para14">As of today a 20 per cent. capacity penalty will operate for the uprating or replacement of an existing vessel engine provided the resulting increase in engine power does not exceed 35 per cent. This penalty will be reduced 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2001 : Column: 758W</I><P>
to 10 per cent. where an engine is uprated or replaced before 31 December 2001. However, except in the case of pelagic vessels, where vessel capacity units (VCUs) are taken from vessels under 18 metres in overall length and aggregated onto licensed vessels measuring 18 metres or more in overall length, the capacity penalty will be 30 per cent. Provision will also be made for the splitting of fishing vessel licences for the purpose of engine power adjustments.
<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para15">The Fisheries Departments, in conjunction with the European Commission, are also prepared to consider, on a case-by-case basis, waiving capacity penalties and compliance with tonnage rules for vessel improvements which relate exclusively to improved safety and which will not result in an increase in a vessel's fishing effort. Under EU legislation member states may apply for an increase in tonnage objectives under their relevant Multi Annual Guidance Programme to take account of increases in vessel capacity resulting exclusively from safety improvements. Advantage is now being taken of that facility.
<P>

<a name="10316w04.html_para16">In the longer term the Fisheries Departments in the UK wish to simplify the present capacity regime and, with the exception of engine power adjustments, plan to return to a situation where a single penalty applies. The present capacity penalties will therefore end on 31 March 2003 and be replaced on 1 April 2003 by a single penalty which will also apply to tonnage and engine power as well as vessel capacity units. Since two years' notice of these changes is being given, no provision will be made for so called pipeline cases. The views of the fishing industry and other interests are being sought on the level at which the capacity penalty should be fixed and whether this should apply to both licence transfers and aggregations or to aggregations alone.

 We shall lay before the House regulations to increase National Health Service charges in England from 1 April 2001. There will be a cash increase in the charge of 10 pence (1.67 per cent.) from &#163;6.00 to &#163;6.10 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.

Following a review of standards in 1996 ambulance services were required to introduce systems to prioritise emergency calls. The new prioritisation procedures require that all emergency calls are classified as either immediately life threatening, Category A, or other emergency calls, Category B/C. A new standard was introduced which requires that, by the year 2001, ambulance services reach 75 per cent. of Category A calls within eight minutes. For Category B/C calls and urgent patient journeys the previous standards continue to apply. Avon Ambulance NHS Trust moved to the new system from 1 October 1999 and the following table contains information about the percentage of responses against these targets from 1 October 1999 to 31 March 2000.<P>

 As decided in the last Parliament, the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) now carries out regular reviews of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF), generally timed to coincide with the triennial valuations of the PCPF by the Government Actuary. The SSRB has published its report today, and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House. Copies are also available in the Vote Office. I am most grateful to the Review Body for their thoughtful and thorough report.

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) that the rules should be amended to remove the provision for curtailing the pension of a widow/widower of a deceased Member on remarriage or cohabitation. Any consequential increase in the contribution rate should be borne by the Exchequer;</FONT></UL>

As is customary, the Government will hold a debate on an amendable motion.

<P>

<a name="10316w06.html_para3">It will be helpful for the House to know that the Government are proposing to accept all these recommendations except for recommendation 2.

 The Royal Parks Constabulary is a non-Home Office police force; the sponsor Department with responsibility for this Constabulary is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The recent review of the Royal Parks Constabulary recommended that the Constabulary should either become a ring-fenced division of the Metropolitan Police Service or that funds should be provided to allow proper management, accountability and policing by the Royal Parks Constabulary. The recommendation is currently being considered at official level with the Royal Parks Agency and the DCMS.

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> The Survey of Pay, Hours and Length of Service, conducted annually by statisticians from the Office of Manpower Economics for the Police Negotiating Board (PNB), provides figures on the average earnings of police constables, including pay, allowances and overtime. The November 1997 survey showed that the average earnings of a police constable in the United Kingdom were &#163;516.28 per week (or &#163;26,933 per annum). The most recent data available are from the PNB survey undertaken in November 1999 and this showed that the average earnings of a police constable were &#163;550.03 per week (equivalent to &#163;28,693 per annum).
<P>

<a name="10316w07.html_para1">The PNB makes recommendations to the Home Secretary on all matters concerning police pay and allowances. Police pay is increased every September through a pay award based on the median percentage of the Manpower Index for non-manual workers, a formula introduced in 1994. In 1996 and 1997 the increase was 3.5 per cent; in 1998, 4.0 per cent; in 1999, 3.6 per cent. and in 2000, 3.0 per cent. The pay scale for constables at 1 April 1997, the current pay scale and the percentage increases are detailed in the table (the length of the pay scale was reduced in September 1997).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what estimate he has made of the cost of detaining all new asylum applicants in secure conditions for <i>(a)</i> the period covering initial decisions and appeals and <i>(b)</i> the period following refusal of asylum and removal in the current financial year;  [153823]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10316w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> The answer to these questions depends on a number of variables, in particular the number of asylum applicants and the length of time taken to complete the process to removal. Based on forecast asylum intakes, and detention 



<P>

of up to six months, the cost could be more than &#163;2 billion in start-up costs and annual running costs of over &#163;1 billion. It is estimated that a further 32,000 detention spaces would be required. This would equate to a further 64 detention centres each with 500 beds. None of the costs quoted take account of the management overheads of running this size of detention estate. No estimate has been made of the cost of detaining asylum applicants in the period between refusal of asylum and removal.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> For all nationalities there are the practical difficulties of locating those who have absconded.
<P>

<a name="10316w07.html_para2">There are also the practical difficulties of arranging flights, the handling of last minute representations and legal challenges.
<P>

<a name="10316w07.html_para3">Many asylum seekers arrive without a valid passport. In order to effect their return it is necessary to obtain a passport or other travel document from their national authorities. This can be a lengthy and difficult process as it is often necessary to provide detailed evidence of the applicant's identity and nationality before a travel document can be issued.
<P>

<a name="10316w07.html_para4">We are not currently seeking to return failed asylum seekers where country conditions are not conducive. In addition returns to three of these countries (Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan) are complicated by the absence of direct international flights from the United Kingdom to those countries. Thus removals to those countries require the agreement of third party states to enable transit through their territory. We are currently investigating the potential for reaching such agreements with appropriate states. For some nationalities we are unable to effect removals without having first obtained a travel document from that country's Embassy or High Commission.

 The Court of Appeal allowed this appeal challenging the Government's decision to maintain the certificates issued under Section 2 of the Asylum and 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2001 : Column: 768W</I><P>
Immigration Act 1996 to return Kosovar Albanian asylum applicants to Germany under the Dublin Convention. The appeal was allowed on the basis of an assertion by the Court that the applicants had formed a legitimate expectation that their claims for asylum would be substantively determined in the United Kingdom. The Government are considering whether to petition the House of Lords for leave to appeal against the judgment.
<P>

<a name="10316w07.html_para5">The Court of Appeal found in favour of the Government regarding their powers to review and maintain such certification decisions. It also found that the Dublin Convention conferred rights upon member states rather than upon individuals. This case related to decisions made before 25 March 1999 under provisions of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 which have subsequently been repealed. Its effect is limited to a small number of cases. For these reasons the judgment does not affect the general policy of the Government regarding the transfer of asylum seekers to safe third countries under the Dublin Convention; nor does the judgment affect the operation of Section 11 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 5 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 37W, under which circumstances the civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 are pursued against the operator of a hired vehicle used by persons seeking to enter the United Kingdom clandestinely.  [154244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10316w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) are pursued against the operators of hired vehicles, be they the owners, hirers or drivers of vehicles found to have carried clandestine entrants if the operators fail to establish a defence as set out in Section 34 of the 1999 Act. Section 34 (2) of the 1999 Act allows for a defence of duress and Section 34 (3) provides for a defence that the operator did not know or suspect the carriage of a clandestine entrant, had an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants (having regard to the code of practice issued in accordance with Section 33 of the legislation) and that on the occasion in question the effective system was operated properly.

<P>

<a name="10316w09.html_para1">The allegations recently published by Mr. Nicholas Jones contradict nothing that was said at the time. From my first answer on this issue, on 23 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 259W, I made it clear that we had responded to leaks by others to the press, that the FCO had received a copy of the final Report at 0800 on 9 February, and that subsequently the press were briefed orally on my initial reaction. There is therefore nothing to add to the evidence provided to the Standards and Privileges Committee or to my answers to Parliamentary Questions at the time.
