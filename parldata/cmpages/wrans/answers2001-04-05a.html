To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the additional costs of benefit entitlements by contractors deemed to be employees under IR35.  [157110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10405w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 IR35 does not affect the employment rights of any worker employed through a personal service company in any way.

<a name="10405w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what revisions he plans to make to the Inland Revenue rules consequent upon the judgment of the IR35 case.  [157099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10405w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The court dismissed the challenge to the legislation on service provision by intermediaries. The Inland Revenue will review the guidance material used by its staff regarding the interpretation of the law.

<P>
<a name="10405w01.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what response the Inland Revenue has made to the representations from foster carers' organisations and the Department of Health regarding its proposals for taxing payments to foster carers.  [157067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10405w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue is working with the Department of Health and a number of organisations representing foster carers to design a simple method by which foster carers can choose to calculate the income tax due on the reward element of their payments using standard, agreed, costs. Alternatively, foster carers would be able to rely upon actual costs. The Inland Revenue plans to introduce the new arrangements as soon as practicable. In the interim, the Inland Revenue will maintain existing agreements for calculating the reward element of payments, in accordance with representations made by care organisations.

<P>
<a name="10405w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2001]:</i> The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has not received any requests from Byker employees or trade unions for advice on the potential health effects of working with incinerators or for requests for studies into the health of employees. HSE considers that the Environment Agency's current legislation is such that the potential exposure of employees to dioxins is very low.
<P>

<a name="10405w03.html_para3">Exposure to dioxins (both environmental and workplace) can be measured using blood tests. Blood tests are invasive and are not normally carried out unless there is a clear need or concern expressed by those involved. They are also time consuming and expensive. Under these circumstances, they are unlikely to yield useful information. Consequently HSE has not carried out dioxin tests on employees at incinerator plants or those involved in the demolition of these plants and does not believe that random blood tests are necessary.
<P>

<a name="10405w03.html_para4">The only health effects from dioxins which could be detected by health checks is the skin condition, chloracne. This only occurs at high exposures, for example as a result of industrial accidents, and consequently checks for this condition would not be of value at exposure levels associated with incinerators.
<P>

<a name="10405w03.html_para5">In the absence of investigations due to accidents, reports of ill health and complaints, HSE's inspectorates carry out its elective work guided by priorities. In 1995 HSE's inspectorate rated the health risks at the Byker plant as 'medium' and on reassessment in 1999 and 2000 as 'low'. The assessment included examination of the general standards of ventilation and cleanliness etc. at this medium-sized plant which employs approximately 20 people. These ratings did not indicate a need proactively to supply information to Byker employees or trade unions on the potential health effects of working with incinerators.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the burial sites <i>(a)</i> in use and <i>(b)</i> being constructed for the purpose of burying the carcases of animals in connection with the prevention of foot and mouth disease comply with (i) the provisions regarding the protection of groundwater in the EU Groundwater Directive of 1978 and (ii) the provisions of the EU directive on the landfill of waste of April 1999 concerning arrangements for the protection of soil and water via leachate collection and bottom sealing.  [156820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10405w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the need to comply with all relevant EU Directives during the current foot and mouth outbreak. The principal Directive concerning animal burial is the Animal Waste Directive (90/667/EEC), Article 3(2) of which contains requirements for environmental protection. These requirements are met through close co-operation between this Department, MAFF and the Environment Agency, and through the authorisation procedure in the Groundwater Directive. The Agency continues to carry out an assessment of both existing and proposed burial sites and, subject to the risk, authorises the burial imposing any necessary conditions for the protection of groundwater.

<sup>(3)</sup> The figures reported for 1997 and 1998 show the instances where in the opinion of the HSE inspector releases were not being carried out in accordance with the release consents. Details were provided in my replies of 17 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 630W, and 4 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 720W, to the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker).

<P>

The breach of consent in 2000 was reported by Aventis at two of its small-scale research and development trial sites of GM sugar beet (consent reference 00/R33/02). This consent authorised the release of sugar beet plants genetically modified for tolerance to glufosinate herbicide. At the end of the trials approximately 0.5 per cent. of the plants were found to be of a GM line that was also tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate and were not covered by the consent. CSL investigated this matter to ensure that volunteer GM beet plants were controlled and that measures are in place to prevent a recurrence. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment was informed and concluded that there was no increased risk to human health or the environment. Aventis will be required to conduct additional monitoring of the affected sites in 2001.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> The Foreign and Commonwealth Office complies fully with the phase-out timetable as agreed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987, and the subsequent revisions laid down by European Commission Regulation 594/91. With the exception of domestic refrigerators (which will be replaced at the end of their natural cycle) all CFC refrigerants and Halon firefighting equipment have been replaced in FCO buildings both at home and overseas.
<P>

<a name="10405w06.html_para2">To date resources have been committed to the eradication of chlorofluorocarbons and Halons, but work is now commencing on the eradication of hydrofluorocarbons. Currently, HCFCs are used extensively throughout the FCO estate, almost exclusively for domestic refrigerators and air conditioning equipment. But extensive use is made of hermetically sealed units which cannot be topped up and therefore pose a minimal risk to the Ozone Layer.
<P>

<a name="10405w06.html_para3">The consortium constructing the new GCHQ building in Cheltenham is using HFC 143A--a zero ozone depleting product which is considered a long-term replacement for CFCs and HCFCs. It is FCO policy that all new buildings under FCO control are charged with synthetic refrigerants. Use of synthetic refrigerant gas is also increasing in larger air conditioning systems, as new or replacement equipment is installed, although progress has been restricted to date by the limited alternatives available in the marketplace.

 I have had no discussions with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning the Inland Revenue's occupation at Somerset House. The Inland Revenue occupy accommodation in the New, West and East Wings of Somerset House under the terms of a 25 years lease from the Somerset House Trust, who are responsible for the overall management of the building. The Inland Revenue are aware of a proposal made to the Somerset House Trust by Christies to take over the existing lease on the New and West Wings. The response to this proposal is a matter for the Trust in the first instance.

 This is a matter for the BBC and Channel 4. I understand, however, that the BBC is considering how best to raise public awareness of the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting Project) logo, which distinguishes digital TV sets from analogue TV sets, as part of its ongoing promotion of digital services. Channel 4 has also been promoting its digital services in recent months and has indicated that it is prepared to participate in pan-industry initiatives to promote digital television, including the use of the DVB logo.

 Ministers regularly visit staff within Benefits Agency offices.
<P>

<a name="10405w07.html_para1">Suitably trained and experienced staff make decisions. Staff are not recruited specifically as decision makers and may be of various grades; therefore, exact numbers are not available. The salary level of decision makers will vary according to grade.
<P>

<a name="10405w07.html_para2">Since the Benefits Agency was established in April 1991, it has never been possible for the Chief Executive to change a benefit decision made by a decision maker. It is only possible to change a benefit decision in accordance with the legislation.
<P>

<a name="10405w07.html_para3">Benefit decision notices encourage customers to contact the appropriate office if they want to know more about a decision or think it is wrong. Any queries received are directed to an appropriate officer to respond. If necessary the query will be directed to a decision maker to provide a response. Queries from customer representatives are dealt with in the same way.
<P>

<a name="10405w07.html_para4">Hon. Members are of course free to write to whomever they wish. However, it has been the accepted practice that, where a response is required on an individual case, the approach is made to the local office manager.

<a name="10405w07.html_para5">The Social Security Act 1998 transferred the functions of adjudication officers to the Secretary of State. Under new arrangements, all first instance Social Security decisions are made by officers acting on behalf of the Secretary of State.

 We aim to give everyone the chance to make their own choices about how they want to provide for their own retirement. The basic state pension is a secure foundation but, by itself, it was never meant to support the lifestyle most people want today. We believe the best way to have a secure retirement is to build up an extra amount on top of the state retirement pension.

 Following successful implementation of the Narey fast tracking arrangements for magistrates court business in 2000, the Crown Prosecution Service and magistrates court managers in Buckinghamshire have worked hard to promote efficient listing practices in the magistrates courts.

 Over the last three years the service has improved its performance in relation to eight key measures: the proportion of advance information sent to the defence within agreed time scales rose from 77.3 per cent. in 1997-98 to 86.6 per cent. in 1999-2000; the proportion of committal papers served on the defence within agreed time scales rose from 50.6 per cent. in 1997-98 to 76.6 per cent. in 2000-01; and the proportion of briefs sent to counsel within agreed time scales rose from 66.3 per cent. in 1997-98 to 77.1 per cent. in 2000-01.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are local, relevant and accessible organisations to both the community they serve and the clinicians who provide the care. PCTs have a range of freedoms and flexibilities greater than any other health service body. They provide improved support to practices and clinicians, commission and deliver improved services through the integration of primary and community health care and shape services in response to the needs of their local populations. They bring decisions about services closer to patients and local communities, ensuring that they are taken by those who understand their patients' needs. PCTs are demonstrating an ability to balance local knowledge against capacity to manage the provision of services and the management resources to deliver. Owing to the flexibility PCTs have to form responsive local services, there exists a large variety of initiatives across the country.
<P>

<a name="10405w11.html_para2">One hundred and twenty-four new PCTs became operational on 1 April 2001 bringing the total number of PCTs to 164. In two years, the percentage of the population in England whose healthcare is being delivered by a PCT has risen from zero to approximately 48 per cent. The benefits of PCT status for services to patients, the public and for healthcare are being realised now that the first 17 PCTs have completed their first year of operation.

 Currently there are two GCSE examinations: GCSE English--which covers the full National Curriculum programme of study in English, including the literature requirements--and GCSE English Literature which ranges more widely. The proposal to review the GCSE in English arose from a review of examination standards over time commissioned and published by the previous administration. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has been consulting widely on how to take forward recommendations from the SCAA/Ofsted report "Standards in Public Examinations 1975 to 1995"

 <i>[holding answer 28 March 2001]:</i> In England and Wales students on undergraduate courses and their families are expected to make a contribution towards their tuition fees and living costs (maintenance) only if they can afford to do so.
<P>

<a name="10405w12.html_para0">In academic year 1998-99, the latest year for which data are available, the proportion of higher education students whose parents were assessed to pay towards their support under the Education (Student Support) Regulations and who were assessed to contribute towards their fees was 65 per cent. Of these, an estimated 41 per cent. were assessed to pay the full support (&#163;1,000 in 1998-99) and 24 per cent. were assessed to pay a partial contribution towards fees.
<P>

<a name="10405w12.html_para1">Data on parental contributions to tuition fees and to students' maintenance are available from the Student Income and Expenditure Survey in 1998-99. Based on a nationally representative sample of just over 2000 full-time students the survey estimates that the parents of 42 per cent. of students were assessed to make a contribution towards maintenance. Of these students 50 per cent. received more than the assessed amount, 20 per cent. received the exact amount, while the remaining 30 per cent. received less than the assessed amount.
<P>

<a name="10405w12.html_para2">The new student support arrangements introduced in 1999-2000 more than doubled the maximum amount of student loan from &#163;1,685 to &#163;3,635, in order to ensure that parents pay no more in upfront contributions than under the previous system. The value of the loan under the new arrangements increased, in cash terms, by 62 per cent. between 1997-98 and 1998-99 (the transitional year) and by 116 per cent. between 1997-98 and 1999-2000 when support for living costs was solely through loans (except for students in vulnerable groups who are also eligible for supplementary grants).
<P>

<a name="10405w12.html_para3">In 1998-99 only first year students were liable to pay tuition fees. In the Student Income and Expenditure Survey 42 per cent. of first year students said that their parents had been assessed to make a contribution towards fees, and of these four in five said that they had received the full amount. The one in five students who reported 



<P>
<P><I>5 Apr 2001 : Column: 279W</I><P>
receiving less than the full parental contribution to fees is based on a small sample of students (237). This small number, although the result of a nationally representative sample, is subject to sampling error.
<P>

<a name="10405w12.html_para4">Universities UK (formerly the Committee of Vice- Chancellors and Principals) conducts periodic surveys of fee payment to higher education institutions. The latest, in November 2000, estimated that 97 per cent. of students' fee contributions for the previous academic year would be paid by the end of October 2000.

However, since 1996 the percentage of primary and secondary schools in England with internet connections has increased from 5 per cent. to 86 per cent., and from 47 per cent. to 98 per cent., respectively. I am confident therefore that we are on track to meet our target of connecting all schools to the internet by 2002 and, in doing so, to enable all pupils to benefit from access to resources that will enrich their learning and help to improve standards.

<a name="10405w12.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 When an employer signs up to New Deal they sign an employer agreement which states they have not made anyone redundant or displaced to create the vacancy. The agreement is usually signed on behalf of the Employment Service by the local Business Manager who initiates action if an employer is found to have contravened the agreement. If this proves to be the case, the Employment service would refuse to service any further vacancies for that employer.
<P>

<a name="10405w12.html_para5">The New Deal Strategic Partnership would not normally be involved in issues to do with the displacement of existing employees by New Deal participants. Their role includes producing local strategic plans, monitoring delivery and harnessing local support for New Deal.

 The movement of sheep has been a key factor in the spread of foot and mouth disease. We estimate that some 700,000 sheep were sold through livestock markets in Great Britain in February before movement restrictions were imposed. The total movement of sheep in this period will be very much higher. I have launched a consultation on the issue of a standstill period following movements of sheep, goats and cattle, and will also be looking at questions such as traceability, the operation of markets and, in particular, out of ring sales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10405w13.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Farm incomes have been seriously depressed. Average income from farming in 2000 was &#163;8,500. This represents a drop of 25 per cent. in real terms as compared to 1999.
<P>

<a name="10405w13.html_para0">At this stage it is not possible to quantify the impact the foot and mouth outbreak may have on the incomes of the industry as a whole though it clearly has had a very serious impact on those farmers directly affected. That is why the government have already responded by introducing a number of targeted measures to assist the livestock industry. Overall, we expect the agrimonetary compensation and the welfare disposal scheme to provide over &#163;400 million to livestock farmers.

 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> In England, the regulations which govern the on-farm burial of animal carcases are the Animal By-Products Order 1999, the Water Resources Act 1991 and the Groundwater Regulations 1998.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he has carried out an assessment of the risk due to BSE infectivity from disposal of cattle during the present outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  [157585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10405w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 On 30 March, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered the independent assessment from DNV Consulting of the public health risk due to BSE infectivity from burning cattle during the present foot and mouth disease outbreak. This assessment was placed in the Libraries of the House on 15 March. Taking account of comments from SEAC and the Environment Agency, this assessment has been revised to include the possible BSE risks from burying cattle carcases on farm and in landfill. Copies of this 1 April revision of the DNV risk assessment have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and are today being published on the MAFF Foot and Mouth Disease internet site.
<P>

<a name="10405w13.html_para1">SEAC advised that the risk from burning (or burying) cattle born on or after August 1996 would be at least 400 times lower than the risk from burning (or burying) a similar number of cattle born before this date. In the light of SEAC's advice, the Environment Agency is advising that, depending on local hydrogeological and other factors and subject to site specific risk assessments, cattle born on or after 1 August 1996 may be buried.

 Payments of the &#163;156 million optional agrimonetary compensation to livestock farmers will begin later this week following accelerated approval by the European Commission. Sheep farmers are already receiving the payments due to them in compulsory agrimonetary compensation, and payment of their optional amounts will be under way during April. Dairy producers can expect to receive the bulk of their agrimonetary payments during April and May, with residual balance payments being made to them later in the year. Payments to beef producers will begin in May.

 Livestock farmers will receive some &#163;735 million in 2000-01 by way of payments under the principal EU livestock schemes--for suckler cows, beef cattle and sheep. In the present difficult circumstances, we have taken steps to ensure that farmers who have lost animals as a result of foot and mouth disease preserve their entitlement to premiums. In addition, the Government are paying compensation at full market value

 Farm incomes have been seriously depressed latterly, principally as a result of the weakness of the Euro against sterling, low world commodity prices, the impact of BSE and now the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. There are also longstanding structural weaknesses in the agricultural sector arising from the tradition of production-based subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy. That is why the Government are firmly committed to securing further reform.

 The Government are committed to further expansion of rural development measures: the "second pillar" of the CAP.

We have attempted to estimate the value of agricultural hereditaments for rating purposes on several previous occasions. However these calculations rely on a number of assumptions and are constrained by the availability of information on the value of agricultural properties at the time the calculation was made. Further, the basis used to calculate business rates has changed since 1980. As a result our previous calculations do not provide a reliable basis for estimating the increase in the notional value of agricultural hereditaments over a period of time.
