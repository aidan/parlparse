emergencies and electively, at other NHS hospitals. The decision to do
this is based on relative waiting times and on convenience for the

When approval is sought, all factors, will be taken into account. In
particular, any decision will be made in the context of our defence
industrial strategy, a key element of which is to retain onshore the
ability to deliver a number of strategic capabilities, including those
required to build and integrate complex ships in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06051132000425">To that end,
we are working with industry to develop a common understanding of the
core load required to sustain the industrial capabilities we identified
as important to sustain in the DIS. We expect industry to restructure
itself to improve its performance and address the fundamental issues of
affordability and productivity to deliver the equipment we need; to
sustain onshore the industrial capabilities we require for national
security; and to provide a sustainable and profitable industry, with
clearer employment prospects.

in Northern Ireland men were accommodated in the Working Out Unit,

is now the case that individuals in Northern Ireland who are detained

Such individuals are transferred to a detention facility in Great
Britain either on the day of detention or within 24 hours. In the
majority of cases individuals will, initially, be detained at Dungavel
House Immigration Removal Centre. Individuals whose asylum applications
are straightforward and capable of being decided quickly may be held at

simply have served to prolong the routine use of prison places in

Loughton:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
the Home Department what plans he has to alter the Criminal Records
Bureau registration system following the Bichard Inquiry
recommendations. [69443]</p><p><a name="06051132000689"><b><a name="06051132003066">Joan
Ryan:</b> In 2004 the Criminal Records
Bureau (CRB) undertook an exercise to evaluate the compliance of
Registered Bodies with the Bureau's Code of Practice. This identified
risks to the Disclosure service posed by an increasing and remote
Registered Body network. Although the CRB and the Bichard Inquiry
recognise the vital role of Registered Bodies in the Disclosure
service, both share concern over the high numbers and proficiency of
the existing Registered Body
network.</p><p><a name="06051132000690">The CRB will
consequently reduce the number of Registered Bodies to work with those
that remain to make the network more professional and more experienced
in the Disclosure process. This will allow the CRB to ensure that the
network of users is fully proficient in the security and policies of
the CRB. A minimum threshold of 100 applications per year, per
Registered Body has been set. The CRB will provide advice, guidance and
support to organisations that do not meet the volume criteria about how
they can access the Disclosure service in the future before their
registration is
cancelled.</p><p><a name="06051132000691">The
CRB has developed an alternative distribution network, through the
Umbrella Body (UB) network to ensure cancelled organisations maintain
full access to the Disclosure service. The CRB has been working closely
with the existing UB network to ensure that they are able to provide an
effective, robust and efficient service and have the capacity to absorb
the increased volume of applications from new and cancelled
organisations.</p><p><a name="06051132000692">The CRB
have developed a 'controlled roll out programme' to ensure that UB's
can manage any increased volume with ease. The CRB have also been
encouraging those organisations that remain part of the Registered Body
network to become UBs. The UBs are able to offer a great deal of
experience in handling and processing CRB checks that can also pay
dividends in ensuring that the check is completed as quickly as
possible. In addition, improved UB web pages have been developed and
implemented on the CRB website, which provides an enhanced search
facility to enable eligible organisations to find a suitable Umbrella
Body.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051132000056">Dental Care

Sutcliffe</b><i>[holding answer 3 May 2006]: </i>In England,
resources previously held by the Home Office for the dental care of
prisoners have been devolved to those primary care trusts (PCTs) that
host a publicly managed prison. This forms part of their general
allocation to commission appropriate healthcare services for prisoners.
These resources are not ring fenced, and PCTs as part of their
commissioning role are able to move resources from one healthcare
service to another to meet their specific local needs. It is therefore
not possible for us to identify centrally how much is spent on
dentistry in prisons.</p><p><a name="06051132000695">The dental
services provided to prisoners are an integral part of primary dental
services under the new contractual arrangements for national health
service dentistry. PCTs are required to provide all dental services
required to meet the reasonable needs of their resident population,
including prisoners. In Wales, these resources have been devolved to
local health boards. Arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland are
a matter for the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland office
respectively.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051132000057">Domestic

local communities to reduce re-offending.</p><p><a name="06051132000702">These are now
being rolled out across the nine regions and Wales by Regional Offender
Managers (ROMs). The ROM in the East Midlands, along with the Local
Government Association and Society of Local Government Chief
Executives, is leading a demonstration project on how NOMS will work
with local Strategic Partnerships and Crime and Disorder Reduction
Partnerships (CDRPs) through local area agreements to reduce
re-offending in local communities. To date no evaluation of the
effectiveness of CDRPs&#146; involvement specifically in the
resettlement of ex-prisoners has been completed. However, work has
recently begun in London to examine the operation of a scheme aimed at
meeting the needs of prisoners resettling in eight London
boroughs.</p><p><a name="06051132000703">The
scheme&#151;the London Resettlement Pilot&#151;forms part of the
London Resettlement Strategy published in September 2005. The Crime and
Disorder Reduction Partnerships in the eight boroughs (Hammersmith and
Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Brent, Barnet, Hillingdon, Hounslow,
Harrow and Ealing) are working with Wormwood Scrubs prison in west
London. They have nominated local strategic leaders who are working to
develop enhanced and co-ordinated responses to the needs of resettling
prisoners. An action research project has been commissioned which will
report in summer 2006 on the resettlement pilot and will include an
assessment of progress being made through working with local
partnerships in this way.</p><p><a name="06051132000704">An evaluation is also currently
underway of the impact of Prolific and other Priority Offenders
Programme (PPO), which is being implemented by CDRPs and local
Strategic Partnerships. One strand of the programme is aimed at
rehabilitating and resettling PPOs who are in custody or serving
sentences in the community, through closer working between all relevant
agencies and continued post-sentence support. A final report on this
work is due in autumn 2006.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051132000060">Foreign

the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. Recent meetings have
not covered the effect of 'churn' specifically, but have focused on the
establishment of the Offenders Learning and Skills (OLASS) project,
which will introduce a new service of education and skills for
offenders in both custody and the community.</p><p><a name="06051132001333">There have
also been discussions about the Reducing Reoffending through Skills and
Employment Green Paper launched in December 2005, which looks at
strengthening the link between education and employability for
prisoners. The Department for Education and Skills, the National
Offender Management Service and the national probation directorate
(NPD) are working closely to ensure that all prisoners have education
opportunities in prison and in the community after release. The
throughput of prisoners in establishments (i.e. numbers of prisoners
received and discharged on a daily basis, also known as "churn") has
increased
significantly.</p><p><a name="06051132001334">It
has had some impact on establishment performance, particularly in hard
pressed local prisons. However, since April 2002, over 150,000 basic
skills qualifications have been achieved by learners in prison. (In the
last year, the NPD in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council

by finding sufficient work that generates income to support such
schemes. Under present legislation prisoners cannot be required to
contribute directly to the cost of their stay in prison. Section 51 of
the Prison Act 1952 requires that all expenses incurred for the
maintenance of prisons and prisoners are met from public funds. However
some schemes do exist that enable prisoners to make voluntary
contributions to a variety of charitable causes, including those for
victims. The Prisoners' Earnings Act 1996, which would, if implemented,
allow deductions to be made, is very complex and prescriptive and would
cost substantially more to administer than it would raise in

affect on the employability of those on work permits since their
employability is linked first and foremost to the skills that they

a work permit and to pay a fee. We wish to maintain the attractiveness
of the UK as a destination for investors. But our assessment is that
the length of the qualifying period for settlement is of marginal
importance in inward investment decisions compared with economic
factors and the specific investment opportunities available. The

available from civil servants. In addition consultants have been
engaged by ODPM to support the delivery of projects to enhance the
ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents.
The work undertaken by consultants includes radio engineering expertise
for the new radio systems for the Fire and Rescue Service; also,
logistical support and design for responding to a chemical, biological,
radioactive or nuclear incident and search and rescue incidents. Some
60 per cent. of expenditure has been in support of these
projects.</p>

the principles promoted in &#145;Securing Better Mental Health for
Older Adults&#146; (July 2005). One of the main aims of the guide is
that older adults with mental health problems and their carers have
their needs met wherever they are in the system, including where
possible being supported and enabled to live independently at

provide over the course of a year taking into account the aim of

of the dairy market. However, the Milk Development Council publishes a
report on an annual basis which examines dairy supply chain margins.
The last report covering 2004-05 showed that dairy supply chain margins
did not change significantly from the year before. Dairy farm income
rose slightly as a result of marginally higher farmgate prices and the
payment of the dairy premium. Processor margins varied during the

a regulatory body to oversee the dairy industry. It is difficult to see
how a regulator could determine a fair price other than by reference to

reforms and improvements. For example, action on sustainable
development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and
production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities,
and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of achievements
relating to these policy areas can be found at:
http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm. I am confident that
the West Lancashire constituency will have benefited from
these.</p><p><a name="06051216000064">In particular,
the West Lancashire constituency has benefited from funding through the
National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund as well as the Waste
Performance and Efficiency Grant to deliver household

West Lancashire has received more than &#163;7 million to support
progress in this area in the last three
years.</p><p><a name="06051216000065">Under the
Nitrates Directive, around 80 per cent. of the West Lancashire
constituency was designated as an Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in
2002; currently about 55 per cent. of England is designated. Farmers in
NVZs are required to follow an action programme aimed at reducing the
risk of nitrates loss; for example by limiting the amount of Nitrogen
applied on the farm during the year and by not applying manure or
fertilisers during certain times of the
year.</p><p><a name="06051216000066">Since
2003, local authority performance on street cleanliness has been
measured through best value performance indicator BV199. This assesses
the percentage of survey sites in each local authority area with
unacceptable levels of litter and detritus. In 2003-04 West Lancashire
scored 18.2 per cent. against a national average of21.2 per
cent., and in 2004-05 19 per cent. against a national average of 18.1
per cent. These results are for West Lancashire district, comprising
the constituencies of West Lancashire and South Ribble. Data are not
available at the constituency
level.</p><p><a name="06051216000067">In
March 2005 we announced that Lancashire would be one of eight rural
pathfinders in England. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the
Government's Rural Strategy and reflects the Government's commitment to
devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The
Lancashire rural pathfinder is helping to ensure greater co-ordination
of rural delivery programmes, including testing new and innovative
methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to
rural communities and
businesses.</p><p><a name="06051216000068">Lancashire
has also proved to be a fertile ground for our Defra's Project Based
Schemes which are generally available to farmers to help them develop
new business opportunities and widen the skills they already possess.
For example, Farmer Ted's Farm Park, located at Worral House Farm just
outside Southport, was opened in 2003 with the help of funding from the
Rural Enterprise Scheme. In the first 18 months it received over 38,000
visitors including 480 school trips. The attraction also contributes to
the local economy by employing 10 full-time and 30 part-time
employees.</p><p><a name="06051216000069">The RPA

selection rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England
and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that
comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be
interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality
statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications
in 1984 and 1994*. The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death
in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data
for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and
after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. An
article specifically examining the effect of the change in
classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics
Quarterly 23**. More information about these changes, as well as the

allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your
questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are
most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is
not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and
ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by
different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and
Northern 
<br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 451W</b><br>Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office
for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and
for England &amp; Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the
Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate
(rather we publish local/European electorate and separately
Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001,
data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate
'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you
requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from
Denbighshire to collate the necessary
data.</p></ul><a name="06051221001163"><ul><p class="tabletext">Historical UK Electorate
by LA</p></ul><a name="06051221001164"><ul><p class="tabletext">Electoral data
are available on the number of people registered to vote in
Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to
vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only
available on a "usual residence" basis: the mid-year population
estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year
population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to
calculate an estimate of the 'registration rate&#146; using "the
percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are
registered to vote&#148; as either Parliamentary or local/European
electors).</p></ul><a name="06051221001165"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is not
possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order
to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold
data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce
such a
&#145;split&#146;.</p></ul><a name="06051221001166"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information,
for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual &#145;usual
resident&#146; mid-year population; (ii) the size of the (a)
Parliamentary electorate and (b) local/European electorate; and (iii)
the percentage of the "estimated usually resident population" aged 18
and over who are registered to vote as (a) Parliamentary electors and
(b) local/European electors. These are labelled as &#145;registration
rates&#146; on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of
this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to
the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the
percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the
resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of
people eligible to
vote.</p></ul><a name="06051221001167"><ul><p class="tabletext">This
'registration rate' is not a published National Statistic: there are a
number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the
data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local
authorities where the usually resident population differs radically
from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local
authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States
Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who,
as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are
however included in the population estimates as they are usually
resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for
Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident
population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to
vote, does calculate 'registration rates' on occasion in the manner
outlined above.</p></ul><a name="06051221001168"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered
electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to
mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all
local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against
Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European
electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs
by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also
differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are
held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for
more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary
electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by
reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve
disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary
electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with
an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern
Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently
available.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 452W</b><br><a name="06051221001169"><ul><p class="tabletext">In order to give an estimate of

local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary
electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are
included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the
local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties
remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is
usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of
the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people
who have more than one address may register in more than one place
(e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These
factors may have a differential impact from place to
place.</p></ul><a name="06051221001173"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is also
inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both
parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers
vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they
have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main
reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per
cent.</p></ul><a name="06051221001174"><ul><p class="tabletext">In order to aid
comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated
'registration rates&#146; for all ten years. Table A shows these
rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European
electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be
made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU
expansion) can change the size of the
electorate.</p></ul><a name="06051221001175"><ul><p class="tabletext">A copy of
the tables will be placed in the House of Commons
Library.</p></ul><a name="06051221001176"><ul><p class="tabletext">The tables

otherwise)&#151;60, with staff having the option to continue working
up to 65 if they wish, subject to continued capability and satisfactory
service; (ii) for the senior civil service&#151;60. We have
flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 in
certain circumstances if it is judged to be in the public interest, and
similarly, exceptionally, staff below the senior civil service beyond

2006, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations come in to force,
introducing wide ranging provisions against discrimination on age in
employment and vocational training. The Regulations introduce a default
retirement age of 65. DFID is presently considering what its retirement
age should be from October 2006. For the senior civil service, it will
be 65, in line with the default retirement age. DFID retains its
delegated authority to set the retirement age for staff below the
senior civil service and will decide shortly whether to adopt the
default retirement age of 65 or to have no retirement age at all. The
Age Regulations also introduce a "duty to consider" procedure to ensure
retirements at whatever age are fair. This will allow employees to
request to work beyond the normal retirement age, and require
discussions between DFID and the employee about when the employee will
retire. Both parties will have to give adequate notice in order to
ensure the retirement constitutes a fair dismissal in employment

strategy paper of last year, &#145;Girls' education: towards a better
future for all' recognised that certain groups of girls are more likely
to be excluded from school on the basis of caste, ethnicity, religion

in particular, constitute a significant group that is denied access to
education. The challenge is to support governments to provide quality
education for excluded
groups.</p><p><a name="06051221000687">It is not
possible, without incurring a disproportionate cost, to identify a
comprehensive list of projects supported by DFID which include
supporting disabled children's right to education. DFID's approach is
to support developing country governments' own education plans rather
than directly manage discrete projects. In India, for example, DFID has
supported through its country programme, the District Primary Education
Programme, which promotes inclusive education, and some states have
been successful in integrating disabled children into mainstream
schools. In Vietnam, DFID has co-financed with the Government of
Vietnam, the World Bank and other donors the Primary Education for
Disadvantaged Children programme, a &#163;243 million project which
was launched in October 2003 and includes a strong focus on primary
education for disabled children.</p><p><a name="06051221000688">DFID also provides funding
through UK non-governmental organisations to support projects that
benefit disabled people and advocate for disabled people's rights. DFID
has partnership agreements with a number of organisations that support
disability-focused activities, such as World Vision, HelpAge
International, Save the Children and VSO, among others. In addition,
through our partner Action on Disability and Development, with whom we
have a six-year Programme Partnership Agreement, we work to promote
greater participation and inclusion of disabled people and their

(India)</h3><p><a name="06051221001109"><b><a name="06051221001299">John
Bercow:</b> To ask the
Secretary of State for International Development what steps are being
taken by his Department <i>(a)</i> to modernise agricultural practices,
<i>(b)</i> to increase productivity and <i>(c)</i> to improve access to
credit for farmers in India.
[68172]</p><p><a name="06051221001110"><b><a name="06051221001300">Mr.
Thomas:</b> Agriculture in India is
generally a success story. India is self sufficient in staple grain
crops in most years and stores a substantial surplus. The so-called
'green revolution' has been the main driving force behind this success,
promoting the use of improved crop varieties and fertilisers in areas
with access to
irrigation.</p><p><a name="06051221001111">However,
the benefits of new technologies have not been equitably distributed.
DFID's focus has been on improving the livelihoods of farmers and other
rural people in rain-fed areas which are not suited to the particular
packages of improvements offered by the green revolution. The focus on
livelihoods, rather than agriculture, recognises
that poor people are often landless and depend on a diverse range of
activities to support themselves. However, DFID-supported projects have
developed and tested appropriate new agricultural technologies and
tools in these areas that have resulted in increases in production and
income, more efficient and sustainable use of soil and water resources
and reduction of hard manual labour, particularly for women. Some
examples are treadle pumps for small scale irrigation, seed drills,
paddy rice transplanters, which have made work easier as well as
contributing to improvements in
production.</p><p><a name="06051221001112">Consistent
with this approach, DFID has concentrated on micro-credit rather than
agricultural credit. DFID is working with the Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to develop the capacity of
micro-finance institutions to on-lend to individuals or groups.
Approximately 45 per cent. of these loans are for agriculture,
livestock, fisheries or related activities. DFID's rural livelihoods
projects incorporate revolving funds at the village level to support
agriculture, livestock and micro-enterprise
activities.</p><br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 463W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06051221000055">Fledgling

Clifton-Brown:</b> To ask the Secretary of State
for International Development pursuant to the answer of 27 April 2006,
<i>Official Report,</i> columns 1231-2W, on fledgling democracies, why
his Department does not track multilateral aid; and what mechanisms are
in place in his Department to evaluate the effectiveness of the
programmes which UK aid funds.
[68210]</p><p><a name="06051221001114"><b><a name="06051221001302">Mr.
Thomas:</b> DFID reviews the effectiveness of all bilateral
projects over &#163;1 million at least once a year. This includes
money which DFID country programmes channel through multilateral
agencies since according to international convention this aid is
classified as bilateral. DFID has a public service agreement target to
achieve a sustained increase in the quality of DFID's bilateral
projects. DFID reports progress towards this target in the Departmental
Report and the Autumn Performance Report. This year's Departmental
Report will be published on 9<sup>(th)</sup>
May.</p><p><a name="06051221001115">This monitoring
system cannot track core contributions to multilateral agencies because
these funds are pooled. However, DFID uses a Multilateral Effectiveness
Framework and other assessments to evaluate the performance of the
multilateral agencies. During 2004, DFID used the Multilateral
Effectiveness Framework to assess 23 multilateral agencies against
their objectives. These objectives were agreed jointly with DFID and
set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper. These institutional
strategies are publicly available. DFID uses the results of the
Multilateral Effectiveness Frameworks and other mechanisms to inform
decisions around funding for the multilateral
agencies.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051221000056">HIV/AIDS</h3><p><a name="06051221001116"><b><a name="06051221001303">John
Bercow:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
International Development (1) what estimate he has made of the
percentage of pregnant women with HIV/AIDS in developing countries who
receive <i>(a)</i> information, <i>(b)</i> drugs and <i>(c)</i>
antenatal treatment in order to prevent transmission of the virus to
the child;
[68161]</p><p><a name="06051221001117">(2)
what steps are being taken by his Department to link HIV/AIDS and
family planning policies, with particular reference to the use of
condoms;
[68162]</p><p><a name="06051221001118">(3)
what assessment he has made of the relationship between steps taken to
improve maternal health and the achievement of HIV/AIDS targets.
[68163]</p><p><a name="06051221001119"><b><a name="06051221001304">Mr.
Thomas:</b> There is a close relationship in action to improve
reproductive health and family planning, maternal health and to make
progress on HIV and AIDS. Closing the gap in unmet needs for family
planning would make a big contribution to helping to lower maternal
mortality. Sexual and reproductive health services are vital in
ensuring that women have a choice about if and when to have children,
and play a key role in helping them avoid sexually transmitted
infection including HIV, including through condom provision.</p><br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 464W</b><br><p><a name="06051221001120">HIV Pregnant
women with HIV and AIDS are four times more likely to die in pregnancy
and childbirth than un-infected women. Women with HIV need care and
services in pregnancy to help protect their own health and to help
prevent transmission of HIV to their babies. The United Nations
Secretary General's progress report on the 2001 Declaration of
Commitment in HIV and AIDS, released in April, estimates that only 9
per cent. of HIV positive women in low and middle income countries
currently receive antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother to child
transmission of HIV. In countries with weak health systems this falls
to less than 1 per
cent..</p><p><a name="06051221001121">DFID is working
to support stronger health systems, with more adequate staff, equipment
and drug supplies that are needed to improve access to HIV treatment,
as well as to provide women with the care needed in pregnancy,
especially when complications arise. Sustained improvements in maternal
health and AIDS prevention, treatment and care will in large part
depend on strengthening basic health services. Access to sexual and
reproductive health and family planning services must be an essential
part of this effort, and we are working to ensure that the forthcoming
United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS in June
gives a clear and strong message on the importance of sexual and
reproductive health to efforts to make progress in HIV and
AIDS.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051221000057">Palestine</h3><p><a name="06051221001122"><b><a name="06051221001305">Mr.

of Thailand about the treatment of Shan refugees living in Thailand is
carried out by the British embassy in Bangkok through the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). The UNHCR's advocacy
efforts with the Government of Thailand aim to improve the situation in
the Burmese refugee camps in Thailand and to bring about a relaxation
of the regulations prohibiting freedom of movement and employment
outside the camps. In light of the fact that the Government of Thailand
have agreed to expand resettlement opportunities from the camps, the
UNHCR is stepping up its efforts to promote alternative solutions for
Burmese refugees.</p><br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 465W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06051221000059">Staff

its expenditure on staff away days and staff team building exercises,

is committed to ensuring staff have the right skills and expertise to
meet our commitment to the internationally agreed Millennium
Development Goals. In November 2005, DFID launched a new &#147;People
Strategy&#148;, which outlined our vision and commitments on how we
will lead, manage, develop and support our people over the next three
years. Individual Departments-within DFID plan and manage development
away days and team building exercises for their staff in accordance
with their specific needs in the context of business planning,

[67818]</p><p><a name="06051221001130"><b><a name="06051221001312">Mr.
Thomas:</b> DFID provides some support to sub-Saharan African
countries for the development and facilitation of their national
policies on trade, and specific issues like tourism, through its
bilateral programmes. Much of DFID's support on trade to Sub Saharan
Africa is provided regionally through programmes such as the
Capacity-Building for Trade Policy and Negotiations and the Southern
Africa Trade and Poverty Programme, and multilateral through
institutions like the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP).</p><p><a name="06051221001131">Governments
can access funds for trade delegations to the UK and other destinations
from a variety of sources, many supported by DFID funds, such as the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trust Fund for Least Developed Country
Travel managed by UNCTAD. This information is not held centrally and
would involve a disproportionate cost to collect. For example, a
delegation of developing country trade negotiators including from
sub-Saharan Africa came to the UK at the end of last year. This was
funded by the European Development Fund, to which the UK makes
subscriptions.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051221000004">Solicitor-General</h3><h3 align="center"><a name="06051221000061">Departmental

of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3. QCA is also revising the
criteria for food related GCSEs to put a greater emphasis on diet and
health, consumer awareness, food safety and hygiene and food
preparation skills. The Training Development Agency is aiming to
increase the number of food technology training places in initial
teacher training. We have invested &#163;1.5 million in professional
development for primary teachers through our Food in Schools programme.
However, in each school, Headteachers and governors set priorities for
professional development and it is for them to decide whether further
food education provision is needed for their
staff.</p><p><a name="06051222000165">In
addition, our aim is for all schools to be working towards Healthy
Schools status by 2009. The programme now includes a compulsory healthy
eating strand. Schools develop whole school food policies, linking what
is taught across the curriculum with the food children eat at school,
to ensure that consistent messages about healthy food choices run
throughout all aspects of school life. Healthy Schools co-ordinators
are being trained to support schools, including on healthy

progress is being made towards the PSA target. The 2004/05 school sport
