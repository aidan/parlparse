<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 No specific studies have been undertaken in this area. However, in the Type 45 Land Attack Lethality Package work conducted last year, interoperability of ammunition was recognised as a potential benefit both in the allied naval and United Kingdom land environments.

<p><a name="40715w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment has been made of the long-term requirements of guns for the Type 45 Destroyer. [183144R]</p>








<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Ministry of Defence staff are presently conducting an assessment into the future Naval Fire Support (NFS) requirements of the Fleet in order to support the MOD&#039;s expeditionary strategy as outlined in the Defence White Paper of December 2003. This assessment will take into account the need to provide an enhanced NFS system to the Type 45 destroyer as well as other platforms in the Fleet. The six type 45 destroyers on order have all been programmed to receive the 4.5&quot; Mk8 Mod1 gun system.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what additional capability will result from the improvements to the 4.5&quot; Mk8 Mod1 gun; what the projected cost of improvements is; and what alternatives have or are being explored. [183145R]</p>








<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Improvements to the 4.5 Mk8 Modl gun system are aimed both at increasing its reliability and extending its range, by around 30 per cent., through the introduction of improved ammunition. An engineering update programme is under way concerning 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jul 2004 : Column 1235W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the design and construction of the mount to remove obsolescence, to improve reliability and maintainability and to reduce the quantity of hazardous materials and fluids. At present, six ships have been upgraded, with the majority of the remaining gun-fitted ships to follow in the near future. Early results have shown significant improvements in reliability as a result of this upgrade. The modified guns are designated 4.5 Mk8 Mod 1 and, on the basis that the programme is to improve reliability, it is wholly funded by In Service Support funding.
</p>


<p>

The new improved ammunition was introduced during April 2004.
</p>


<p>

<i>[holding answer 7 June 2004]:</i> To provide the information requested, it is necessary to scrutinise every unit record produced during operations in Iraq. This is a considerable task and, although we have devoted all available resources to the work and it has been on-going for a number of weeks, it remains some way from completion. I will write when I am able to respond substantively to the hon. Member.

<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram </b> 
<i>[holding answer 5 July 2004]:</i> Military commanders became aware that the practice of hooding could be harmful to prisoners, especially if it was applied inappropriately. They judged that these concerns outweighed the military justification for the continued use of hooding as a means of blindfolding, and that the most prudent, immediate response was to introduce a ban. The incident that gave rise to these concerns has been the subject of an investigation.

<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister copied his letter to the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee to the Defence Secretary on the 25 May 2004.

[175067]</p>








<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Coercion of prisoners of war, internees and detainees is specifically prohibited under the terms of the Geneva Conventions and Protocols.

[166998]</p>








<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Members of the United Kingdom armed forces are liable under both UK and international law for their conduct while on operations in Iraq. As such, military personnel are fully informed of their responsibilities and obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, not only through training received prior to deployment, but also through specific Standard Operating Procedures. All UK military personnel deploying to Iraq receive an Aide Memoire card on the Law of Armed Conflict, which clearly states that prisoners, detainees and civilians must be treated with dignity and respect, and must not in any way be subject to abuse, torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.

Any credible allegations of abuse by UK forces are investigated. Allegations made against other coalition nations are a matter for them.

<p><a name="40715w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Service personnel, both Regular and Reservist, returning from current operations in the Gulf undergo a two to three day period of &#039;normalisation&#039;. During this period, they receive a post-deployment briefing package. This package includes two leaflets and a presentation, covering post traumatic stress reactions, and the problems that may be encountered on returning home to families and friends. Personnel also receive guidance on who to consult (including their commanders, padres, social workers or medical officers) if they experience post traumatic problems. Commanders also receive training on how to identify signs that an individual may be experiencing problems in order that they can encourage them to seek help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w01.html_para5">
There is no mandatory mental health assessment for Service personnel returning from current operations in the Gulf, it is considered that the detection of mental health problems is not best served by a standardised &#039;one size fits all&#039; assessment process as such conditions can manifest over a period of time and affect individuals in different ways. Therefore, an enforced assessment could, in the longer term, be potentially counter productive.

 It is for local authorities with social services responsibilities to determine the point at which an application is made to the court for an order under section 31 of the Children Act 1989.

In some cases, it will be appropriate for an order to be sought immediately regarding a child with whom the local authority will not previously have had contact. In other cases, social services may have been involved with a family over many years before concerns arise that the section 31 threshold of significant harm has been crossed.

<p><a name="40715w04.html_spnew7"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The budget for the new Aimhigher programme is &#163;139 million for the academic year 2004&#150;05. The budget for future years is being considered as part of the Spending Review.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills which areas are included in the Aimhigher programme; and how they were chosen.  [183625]</p>









<p><a name="40715w04.html_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The White Paper &quot;The Future of Higher Education&quot; announced the bringing together of the Department&#039;s Excellence Challenge programme with Partnerships for Progression, an initiative funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), to create a new, national outreach programme called Aimhigher. The new programme will cover all areas of the country from August 2004, and will operate most intensively in disadvantaged areas.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what effect he anticipates the new regulations on tuition fees will have on the Aimhigher programme.  [183626]</p>








<p><a name="40715w04.html_spnew9"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The measures contained in the Higher Education Act 2004, together with other elements of the new student support package, will support Aimhigher by ensuring that more able young people from disadvantaged backgrounds can access the financial help they need to take up higher education opportunities:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Up-front tuition fees will be abolished, and all full-time undergraduate students will be able to defer paying their fees until after they graduate;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Graduates will only start making repayments on their student loan once they are earning over &#163;15,000 and then, at an affordable rate linked to their income, and outstanding loan amounts will be written off after 25 years;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Around 30 per cent. of students from less well off families will receive a minimum of &#163;3,000 per year in grants and bursaries.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w04.html_para3">
As a further safeguard, institutions will only be allowed to charge higher tuition fees if they have an Access Plan approved by the Director of the proposed Office for Fair Access. Access Plans will focus on what institutions are doing to encourage more people from less advantaged backgrounds to apply: they will have to say how they will provide bursaries and other financial support to students from lower income backgrounds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w04.html_para4">
Evidence shows that young people need clear information about the costs of higher education and the financial support available. Aimhigher seeks to raise awareness about, and understanding of, higher education opportunities and will play an important role in providing this information. Through the Aimhigher 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jul 2004 : Column 1247W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="40715w04.html_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 A number of factors influence a person&#039;s decision to enter higher education including their pre-entry qualifications, the availability of jobs, the influence of family and friends, and their involvement in attainment and aspiration raising activities such as those funded by Aimhigher and its predecessor programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w04.html_para5">
The national Aimhigher programme starts in August. The two predecessor programmes; the Department&#039;s Excellence Challenge, operational since September 2001, and Partnerships for Progression, run by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), operational since April 2003. It is too early to assess the impact on entry to Higher Education (HE), particularly since most activities involve young people aged 13 plus, many of whom will not yet have reached the applications stage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w04.html_para6">
However, there are early indications of a rise in applications in Excellence in Cities (EiC) areas where the Excellence Challenge programme operated. In Excellence in Cities areas, applications for 2003 entry were up 4.2 per cent. compared to 2002. Applications from non EiC areas were up only 1.6 per cent. in comparison. In 2003, university acceptances rose by 1.4 per cent. for applicants from EiC areas, compared to a decrease of 0.6 per cent. in non EiC areas.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what programmes the Government are supporting for the eradication of malaria; and what means are being used to remove malaria breeding grounds in Africa.  [183593]</p>








<p><a name="40715w07.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 There is no magic bullet for eradicating malaria. Removing malaria-breeding sites has proved to be a poor strategy for most countries in Africa. A few have tried, using approaches such as larva eating fish in water tanks and water management programmes, but the results have been mixed. Early attempts in the 1950s to eradicate malaria have been tempered by the complexities of the disease and its vector&#151;the mosquito. The global strategy has shifted to one of control rather than eradication: to &#039;roll back&#039; malaria. Any strategy needs to take into account many factors: man, climate, mosquito and parasite. The main components of an effective response are to ensure early effective treatment, and to prevent mosquito bites through the use of insecticide-treated bed nets. Malaria parasites are developing very high levels of resistance to one drug after another. Therefore, continued drug research and development is necessary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w07.html_para5">
Nevertheless, effective low-cost strategies are available for malaria treatment, prevention and control. The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) global partnership is vigorously promoting them in Africa. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) can reduce malaria transmission, and lives can be saved by prompt access to treatment with effective up-to-date medicines such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The Department for International Development (DFID) is actively engaged in the international effort to control malaria. DFID is providing &#163;48 million to RBM for the period 1999 to 2004 and has have pledged &#163;140 million for the period 2005&#150;08 to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Since 1997, DFID has committed &#163;1.5 billion to support health systems strengthening globally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w07.html_para6">
While national governments determine their own drug policies, DFID fully supports the World Health Organisation&#039;s recommendation to scale up the use of the more effective ACTs as the first line of treatment where there is significant resistance to traditional anti-malarial drugs. DFID is also supporting the RBM Partnership in developing a &quot;road map&quot; to increase

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what his Department&#039;s policy is on eradicating polio in Africa.  [183714]</p>








<p><a name="40715w07.html_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK is fully committed to eradicating polio. DFID has been working with G8 partners, other donors and the World Health Organisation-led Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) to help ensure that there is sufficient financial and political commitment to eradicate polio by end 2005. Since 1988 the UK has contributed some &#163;225 million (including bilateral commitments) to the PEI out of a total global commitment of US $3 billion. Through DFID&#039;s country programmes, we support national efforts in Africa to step-up polio immunisation, and strengthen health systems and routine immunisation. Since 1997, the UK has committed &#163;1.5 billion to strengthening health systems globally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w07.html_para7">
Already millions of children have been spared the crippling effects of polio and only six countries remain polio-endemic (including Egypt, Niger and Nigeria), compared with 125 in 1988. However this progress is now at risk following the importation of the poliovirus into 10 previously polio-free countries across Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w07.html_para8">
DFID welcomes the decision by 22 African nations in May, to launch a massive immunisation effort to prevent a possible epidemic in the region. DFID has been working closely with the PEI and other donors to secure the funding and political commitment necessary to support the efforts of affected countries and to resolve the risks to the polio eradication campaign. At the Sea Island summit in June, G8 members including the UK promised to take all necessary steps to eradicate polio by 2005. The UK holds the G8 Presidency in 2005 and we shall maintain the momentum needed to ensure that the G8 and other public and private donors provide sufficient political and financial resources to eradicate polio once and for all.

<p><a name="40715w08.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 A comprehensive review of all operational activity over the past five years has been undertaken by West Yorkshire Fire Authority. A formal consultation exercise is currently ongoing in relation to the findings of this review. It concludes on 13 September and includes representative bodies, local authorities and neighbouring brigades. Standard operating procedures relevant to high rise, commercial and residential properties are not based upon the use of an aerial appliance, however, if one is needed it can be called upon. Occupiers&#039; fire safety plans have no dependence on the attendance of an aerial appliance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w08.html_para2">
One of the key features of the Thames Gateway as a suitable location for sustainable development is the presence of a substantial reservoir of previously developed and brownfield land. The Gateway is estimated to contain some 2 per cent. of the land area of the South East but 17 per cent. of its current supply of previously developed land. In all, it contains 3,000 hectares of brownfield sites&#151;the largest such resource of previously developed land close to a capital city in Europe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w08.html_para3">
The national target for development on previously developed land is 60 per cent. In the period 1997&#150;2000, an estimated 80 per cent. of new dwellings in the Gateway were built on previously developed land. The targeted investment now being mobilised through funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Department for Transport and Regional Development Agencies aims to maintain this trend by increasing the viability and potential development density on key sites in the Gateway.

 Social housing waiting lists are a key part of the evidence considered by local housing authorities in preparing assessments of local housing need. These assessments are used by the authorities in developing their housing strategies. The provision of new affordable housing is the number one priority of the South West Housing Body who will be investing &#163;188 million in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 to deliver over 6,000 affordable homes across the south-west region.

<p><a name="40715w09.html_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The term &quot;local community partnerships&quot; covers a wide spectrum of arrangements for partnership working, not all of which are subject to guidance from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. However where we have the lead on local partnership working, guidance always stresses the need for community consultation, involvement and engagement. Any project which involves development will be subject to approval through the planning system. There are extensive requirements for public consultation and engagement in planning decisions. New requirements are being introduced under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 for each local authority to produce a &#039;Statement of Community Involvement&#039; setting out how it will engage the community in both plan making and major decisions. For Neighbourhood Renewal policies and programmes&#151;such as New Deal for Communities or Neighbourhood Management&#151;community involvement is an indispensable element and partnerships could not expect continuing support if they failed to apply guidance.

 The great majority of employers are complying with the requirement to designate a stakeholder pension scheme. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) has taken a proactive approach, engaging with employers to encourage them to comply with the law, rather than resorting to legal proceedings.

 The Department has not commissioned research of this kind.

It was launched in spring 2003 and offers diversionary activities aimed at young people who are most at risk of offending. The programme provides the opportunity for them to participate in positive activities (throughout school holiday periods) that will both reduce their chances of offending and enable them to fulfil their potential in education, training or employment. The programme aims to provide 22,500 full-time equivalent places with key worker support for up to 7,500 young people. Success is measured by subsequent entry into education, training and employment.

 There is no statutory obligation for airlines to provide financial protection. Air travel organisers offering air travel packages or, in certain circumstances, seat-only flights have to hold an ATOL and secure a financial bond. The protection travellers enjoy when using a credit card in certain circumstances arises from the 1974 Consumer Credit Act rather than the ATOL scheme. The Act provides financial protection for purchases over &#163;100 made using a credit card, but there are certain exclusions. There is no protection if the payment is made to an agent rather

The Government have provided the underground with an unprecedented level of stable funding of, on average, more than &#163;1 billion a year for the first seven and a half years of the PPP contracts.

 The independent Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England takes a deliberately forward-looking and pre-emptive approach to delivering stability and growth, setting interest rates in order to maintain low and stable inflation. And the excellent job that the MPC has done, supported by our new fiscal framework, has delivered stability and rising prosperity: since 1997, real household disposable income growth has averaged 3.1 per cent. per annum, compared to an average of 2.3 per cent. between 1992 and 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w15.html_para7">
Despite the recent changes, interest rates are still low by historical standards. Low interest rates have ensured that the ratio of interest payments to household disposable income has remained close to 7 per cent. since 2002, compared to a peak of over 15 per cent. in 1990 when consumers were hit at the same time by rises in interest rates, well into double figures, and rapidly rising unemployment.

However, about &#163;30 million of that cost is accounted for by arrangements for testing of cattle for BSE and the costs are borne by Government. The rest is borne by industry, although it should be recognised that many livestock producers were already disposing of their fallen stock by means other than burial before the regulations came into force so that the regulations did not impose an additional cost. The national fallen stock scheme due to start in the autumn will also benefit from &#163;20 million of Government funding over three years to assist with the costs to the industry of complying with the regulations.

 The Government recognise that with the reduction in the number of landfill sites taking hazardous waste from 15 July 2004, hazardous waste could travel further in the short term. Nevertheless, it is recognised that even under the present system, significant amounts of special waste travel across the country. In 2002, 42 per cent. of hazardous waste crossed a regional boundary. Government have not commissioned any specific studies to evaluate the forthcoming changes on this specific issue. Clearly in the longer term, the implementation of the Landfill Directive requirements will see an increase in treatment costs, which in turn will provide a greater incentive for hazardous waste minimisation, the use of more sustainable treatment technologies, and an overall reduction in our reliance on landfill.

 The Local Environmental Quality Survey of England for 2002&#150;03 compiled on behalf of Defra by ENCAMS (Keep Britain Tidy) shows that overall levels of littering across all land use classes have remained unchanged compared with figures from the previous year. However, within that position, the survey records a 12 per cent. increase in fast food packaging litter. However, significant improvements to the quality of the local environment can be made where action is taken. For example, at a local level in Stoke on Trent, fast food littering was reduced by 20 per cent. through their initiative &quot;Eat Neat&quot;. One way we hope to tackle fast food litter is through the development of a voluntary code of practice for the fast food industry, which we hope to launch in the autumn.

<p>
<a name="40715w20.html_para0">
We are working to reduce overall levels of littering in a number of ways including revising the Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse, and through initiatives dealing with chewing gum deposition and drugs related litter. We have also allowed local authorities to keep receipts for fixed penalty notices issued in respect of littering and dog fouling. We hope this will lead to greater use of such penalties by local authorities. Data collected through the introduction of the new cleanliness BVPI&#151;BV199 in April 2003 will enable local authorities to assess the level of littering in their area and target cleansing and enforcement more effectively. We also continue to work with ENCAMS in campaigning to stop people dropping litter.

Notes:<br>

1. PDS figure covers dentists not already working in the GDS.<br>





2. Dentists in the GDS include principals, assistants and vocational dental practitioners. These figures are on a headcount basis rather than whole time equivalent basis and therefore take no account of part-time working. In the GDS, the amount of time spent working in the national health service varies greatly with a large proportion of dentists doing some private work.<br>

3. Dentists working solely in private dentistry are not covered by these figures.<br>

None. It is for head teachers and school governors to decide how and when drinking water should be made available to pupils.

<p><a name="40715w24.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Department has had regular meetings with representatives from the health care professions to discuss the national health service e-recruitment project and will continue to work with them. In addition, the Department and the Department of Trade and Industry are working with members of the periodical publishers association to share information about the development of the service, assess its impact and explore ways in which the service and the health journals can work together to support cost effective recruitment into the NHS.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he is taking to encourage young people <i>(a)</i> to enter the nursing profession and <i>(b)</i> to work for the national health service in non-clinical jobs.  [184041]</p>








<p><a name="40715w24.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The NHS Careers service, information available on their website at www.nhscareers.nhs.uk, provides information about jobs and careers, clinical and non-clinical, within the national health service. The service is supported by national and local initiatives to promote careers in the NHS to young people including: 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jul 2004 : Column 1318W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
a competition in secondary schools and colleges of further education to encourage more young people to consider a career in the NHS; an annual, multi-media, high profile recruitment campaign; and NHS Job Shop Day, to be held on 23 September this year. In addition, NHS bursaries are available to nursing and midwifery students undertaking degree or diploma level pre-registration courses. The Department, in collaboration with the Royal College of Nursing, has also developed a dedicated website, at www.learnaboutnursing.org, and package of activities aimed at raising the profile of nursing among schoolchildren.
</p>






<a name="40715w24.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>NHS Staffing</h3>





<p><a name="40715w24.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Baron: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many staff left the NHS in each year since 1991; and what percentage of the total number of staff this represented in each case.  [184211]</p>








<p><a name="40715w24.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally. The Department&#039;s workforce censuses collect information on the number of staff employed in the national health service each year; consecutive years&#039; data therefore show the net change in the workforce, taking account of leavers and joiners.
</p>

<p><a name="40715w24.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The independent sector treatment centre (IS-TC) programme is part of a major initiative to create additional capacity within the national health service to reduce waiting times and introduce choice for patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para2">
When fully operational we expect IS-TCs to provide NHS treatment for up to 250,000 patients per annum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para3">
Information about the number of NHS patients treated in private clinics is not currently available. However, the Department&#039;s ongoing capacity planning exercise will give us a better understanding of the shape of procurement plans over the next five years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para4">
We expect the number of NHS patients who receive treatment through the independent sector to increase over the next five years.

<p><a name="40715w24.html_wqn5"><b> Clive Efford: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what discussions his Department has had with other governments on preventing companies from overseas advertising, selling and exporting to the UK drugs which are only available with a prescription from a general practitioner.  [183494]</p>








<p><a name="40715w24.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The legal controls on the retail sale, supply and advertising of medicines are set out in the Medicines Act 1968 and supporting regulations. They apply without distinction to medicines advertised, sold or supplied through the internet and by mail order.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para5">
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) replaced the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) on 1 April 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para6">
In 1998, the MCA co-ordinated the initial conference of the permanent forum on international pharmaceutical crime (PFIPC). The most recent meeting was in June 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para7">
The enforcement group of the MHRA has now established links through the PFIPC with senior enforcement officers from a number of regulatory agencies world-wide, including the United States, Australia, Singapore, South Africa and many European Union countries. Internet related issues are of common concern. Co-operation has been agreed between agencies to assist where possible on criminal investigations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w24.html_para8">
International co-operation on this issue is challenging because the way medicinal products are supplied, with or without prescription, varies between countries, and variation in national legislation also means that what may be an offence in one country is not necessarily an offence in another.

<p><a name="40715w26.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 The Department has not received any representation about the accuracy of the fish counter at Sion Mills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w26.html_para0">
<i>(a)</i> There are three separate channels that are monitored by fish counters on Sion Mills weir. These facilities have been monitored by video camera and through graphical output of changes in resistance caused by fish migrating over the counter strips. In addition one of the channels has a facility for the installation of a trap upstream of the counter and this has been used to further validate the counts. In the most recent trapping exercise earlier this year five fish were counted electronically and five fish were trapped during the test period. These validation procedures would confirm that the counter is operating efficiently.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40715w26.html_para1">
<i>(b)</i> During certain water conditions on the River Mourne salmon can pass over the weir without passing through the fish counting channels. This situation has been recognised since the initiation of the use of fish counts from Sion Mills as the primary management tool for the achievement of escapement targets for the salmon stocks of the area in the 1970&#039;s. In such conditions Loughs Agency staff are deployed to undertake visual counts of fish migrating over the weir and not passing through the counting channels. The protocol which continues to be applied to these visual counts is that they are multiplied by a factor of three to allow for periods when visibility is such that observations of these movements is impossible (during hours of darkness).

<sup>(42)</sup> Faughan&#151;The Faughan Counter was inoperable during July due to water seeping through to connections and causing corrosion.<br>





<sup>(43)</sup> Finn&#151;This figure is not a total count for the Finn. Field trials were held on the development of a new resistivity counter on Channel 1 and as a result of teething problems an incomplete count was achieved on this channel for June and part of July. The December figure has become negative due to kelts leaving towards the end of the month.<br>

<sup>(44)</sup> Mourne&#151;Sion Mills<br>

Similar to the Faughan water seeped through and caused serious problems with corrosion of metallic connections unfortunately this coincided with the main grilse run at the end of June and the beginning of July so this figure is likely to be a substantial underestimate of the run.<br>

<a name="40715w26.html_para2">
The fish counter in operation on the River Roe as with the others operating in the Foyle Area provides not only numbers of fish migrating over the counter strips on the weir, but also a graphical representation of the changes in resistance measured by these strips when a fish passes through the counter. These graphical outputs are used to ensure the counter is recording fish migrations accurately.

However, further validation of the Roe counts will be facilitated by the installation of video equipment later this month which will monitor fish passage across the weir and relate this directly to the fish counter and the electronic signal generated.

The sewers in the immediate vicinity of the flooding were subsequently inspected and de-silted and a closed circuit television survey was undertaken.
