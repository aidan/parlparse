 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for more than 99% of private businesses, and SME performance and activity is clearly a key driver of the UK economy. If we are to promote growth in the economy, we need to address the challenges that small businesses face: providing a predictable tax system that rewards endeavour; better access to both debt and equity finance; less red tape; a skilled workforce; and support for exports to markets around the globe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="100908w0001.htm_para0"><a name="1009091000338">That is why June's Budget announced a series of measures aimed at helping small businesses, including:</p>
<a name="100908w0001.htm_brev0"><a name="1009091002312"><ul><p class="tabletext">A £200 million extension to the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG), to benefit around 2,000 extra small businesses. In total, the EFG will now support up to £700 million in bank lending to viable small businesses.</p>
</ul><a name="100908w0001.htm_brev1"><a name="1009091002313"><ul><p class="tabletext">A new Enterprise Capita! Fund to support small businesses with high growth potential-combining both Government and private sector funding.</p>
</ul><a name="100908w0001.htm_brev2"><a name="1009091002314"><ul><p class="tabletext">Confirmation of a Growth Capital Fund, to provide funding of between £2 million and £10 million for SMEs with strong growth potential.</p>
</ul><a name="100908w0001.htm_brev3"><a name="1009091002315"><ul><p class="tabletext">Creation of a Regional Growth Fund in 2011-12 and 2012-13, encouraging private sector enterprise to help areas adjust to reductions in public spending, particularly in those places most reliant on public sector employment.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="100908w0001.htm_para1"><a name="1009091000339">Two key areas of concern to small businesses are ensuring that there is less red tape and being able to access the finance they need to grow. We have already committed to introducing a "one-in one-out" rule for new regulations, sunset clauses, a new Reducing Regulation Cabinet Committee and an immediate review of all inherited regulation in the pipeline. We have also published a joint consultation with the Treasury on business finance, aimed at ensuring that the banking system and financial markets meet the needs of the economy over the long term. This is available at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="100908w0001.htm_para2"><a name="1009091000340">We are also making it easier for small businesses to bid for public sector contracts, with an aspiration that 25% of all Government procurement should be from SMEs. Together with the Office of Government Commerce, this Department is taking forward measures in this area. For example, by the end of 2010, businesses will be able to gain free and easy online access to all new central Government tender documents for contracts over £10,000. This will be a significant step forward, as currently only contracts worth over £20,000 are available online.</p>

 This Department recognises the importance to the UK of the advanced manufacturing sector and the high-value jobs it supports. Growth in this sector is an important part of creating a balanced and resilient economy. In a globally competitive market it must ultimately be a commercial decision for individual companies whether to manufacture items themselves or put work into the supply chain, either in the UK or overseas. However, we are committed to working with businesses, including Rolls-Royce, to create conditions that enable UK manufacturers to thrive; to see how we can better support employers and individuals to invest in learning and to develop the skills they and our economy need; and to promote best practice and effective employment relations.</p>

 We want Post Offices to offer a wide range of services-including financial and Government services-to generate revenues in order to help sustain the network. Post Offices already play an important role in putting essential financial services within everyone's reach, in particular those who may have difficulty accessing other providers. The size of the Post Office network means that important services are available throughout the country: the access criteria for the Post Office network ensure that 99% of the UK population are within three miles of their nearest post office outlet, and in deprived urban areas 99% are within one mile of their nearest post office outlet.</p>

 The Government have no plans to prohibit the advertising of legally permitted sexual services in newspapers and other mainstream media. Non-broadcast advertising in the UK is strictly controlled through industry self-regulation, enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Broadcast advertising is similarly controlled by the ASA working in a co-regulatory partnership with Ofcom.

The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided.

Consequently the Defence Training Rationalisation Project continues to benefit from the very latest experience from PFI projects across Government, including that from the Defence Animal Centre project.</p>

The rolling resistance as a performance criterion is taken into account in some, but not all, instances by the OEM, as other vital criteria such as load carrying capacity, vehicle speed, terrain and/or climatic conditions, as well as whole life cost and anticipated life, are equally, if not more important.</p>

 Three potential options were considered for translating the content of Your Freedom in to other languages. Firstly, re-architecting the current system, so that it can handle multiple languages. This would mean that users could view a translated version of the site that would mirror the current site but would not translate any user generated content. While this was the best option in terms of giving equal experience to English and other language speakers, because it would involve significant changes to an off-the-shelf-product, the costs were prohibitive at £120, 000 (more than 37 times the cost of the original Your Freedom application).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="100908w0001.htm_para57"><a name="1009091000662">Secondly, we looked at producing a static page to the existing site copy in other languages and a box into which comments/ideas could be entered. This would have ensured that ideas and comments of those submitting in other languages were gathered. However, the cost of this option was disproportionate at £1, 800 per language, or more than 50% the cost of the original application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="100908w0001.htm_para58"><a name="1009091000663">Thirdly, we considered incorporating a sentence of copy at the bottom of the home page text, linking people to a freely-available online translation tool.

 Local authorities should be able to achieve the necessary savings through efficiencies across their budgets rather than cuts to frontline services. The Area Based Grant is a form of funding where the Department makes specific allocations to local authorities, but where local authorities have flexibility about how they spend it.</p>

The Area Based Grant includes start up funding for extended services through schools-which can include homework clubs, breakfast clubs, and after school activities. The start-up funding is intended to support the co-ordination and advice provided by local authorities that has enabled schools to develop access to extended services. In practice 98% of schools are now providing access to these services, and so there is less need for the start-up funding.</p>

 The current school funding system already includes funding to assist pupils from deprived backgrounds. The targeting of that funding is, however, flawed and insufficiently transparent. We intend to introduce a pupil premium for disadvantaged pupils. On 26 July 2010, the Secretary of State for Education, announced in a written ministerial statement, the launch of a consultation on the introduction of the premium. In that consultation, we have said that for 2011-12 we intend to continue with the current methodology for the distribution of school funding to allow for a clear and transparent introduction of the pupil premium. We also recognise, however, that the funding system should more accurately reflect pupil characteristics and so we intend to review the system for funding schools beyond 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="100908w0002.htm_para18"><a name="1009091001348">As resistant bacteria with NDM and other similarly-broad resistances can spread rapidly and compromise hospital care, guidance highlighting the importance of early identification and reporting of cases and the need for increased awareness and infection control was issued in January and July 2009. The Health Protection Agency and our advisory committee ARHAI (Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection) are keeping the situation under close review and will advise of any further action as necessary.</p>

 At present, there are no validated blood screening tests for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease on the market. The Department, together with the UK blood services, continues to monitor scientific research and development in this area.</p>

 The difference between the ex gratia payment schemes for HIV and hepatitis C reflect the different times when they were set up. When the Macfarlane and Eileen Trusts, which make payments to individuals infected with HIV by contaminated NHS blood and blood products, were established, there was no effective antiretroviral drug treatment for HIV to prevent progression to AIDS, and life expectancy was short. When the Skipton Fund, which makes ex gratia payments to people infected with hepatitis C from NHS treatment with blood, blood products or tissue, was set up in 2004, there were already the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended drug treatments for hepatitis C available.</p>

 Suicide, attempted suicide and intentional self-harm are almost always symptoms of a complex mix of problems like mental illness, personality disorder, social exclusion and poverty. Reducing them is a priority. Equally, we recognise that more needs to be done to reduce the inequality currently experienced by many older people trying to access mental health services and receiving care. We have recently announced that, in the months ahead, we will reshape mental health strategy. The issues of self-harm, suicide and of eliminating discrimination in services for older people experiencing mental health problems will be considered as part of that strategy.</p>

 Guidance on prisoners' pay is set out in Prison Service Order 4460 (Prisoners' Pay), a copy of which has been placed in the House Library.
