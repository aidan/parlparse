<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the current monthly running costs are of the Millennium Dome; for what proportion of these costs the Millennium Commission is liable; and if he will make a statement.  [148522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew1"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2001]:</i> The current monthly running costs of the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) are between &#163;2.5 million and &#163;3.5 million excluding physical decommissioning costs. Monthly running costs are intended to reduce as the company moves towards solvent liquidation. The NMEC is liable for the company's costs but is able to draw on National Lottery grant awarded by the Millennium Commission.

<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to ensure that the contents of the Dome are not sold until the future use of the site has been finalised.  [149341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2001]:</i> Nothing will be sold at the forthcoming auction which would prejudice uses of the Dome including as a visitor attraction. The Government remain in negotiations with the preferred bidder, Legacy plc, in the competition to buy the Dome. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has a timetabled decommissioning programme. Leased assets, such as lighting and sound equipment, have been returned to avoid incurring additional charges. Third party assets, such as Ford's Journey Zone and BT's Talk Zone, are being removed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment he has made of the 



<P>
<P><I>13 Feb 2001 : Column: 68W</I><P>
impact of the Granada/Anglia merger on the location of jobs in television production and quality of programme production.  [149512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew3"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Reorganisation of television production with Granada is a matter for the company itself. The licence commitments of ITV regional companies, which include obligations to provide high- quality programming, remain unaffected by changes in ownership. The recent White Paper, "A New Framework for Communications", announces that the new regulator, Ofcom, will be required to undertake a review of the regional obligations in each ITV licence whenever its ownership changes, and will be empowered to amend licence conditions to meet any concerns arising.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2001]:</i> 140 School Sport Co-ordinators are now in place in 33 partnerships across the country. No money has been committed by the New Opportunities Fund to Sport England for this programme. Direct support for activities within the School Sports Co-ordinator Programme is available under the New Opportunities Fund Out of School Hours Learning initiative.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what powers he has to require broadcasters to ensure the transmission of television programmes on the five terrestrial channels.  [149669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew5"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The responsibility for ensuring the transmission of television programmes on the five terrestrial channels lies principally with the BBC Governors in respect of BBC1 and BBC2, the Independent Television Commission in respect of Channels 3, 4 and 5 and the Welsh Authority in respect of S4C.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will publish the criteria he intends to apply for digital switchover of radio.  [150058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> Digital radio is at a relatively early stage of development with take-up by consumers still very low. We have not therefore determined criteria to be met in order to achieve switchover. However, we shall keep our approach under review as the roll-out of digital radio services and receiving equipment increases.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what advice her Department is giving to people who wish to undertake voluntary work in Gujarat State, India, following the recent earthquake.  [149464]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 India has a great deal of expertise in relief and rehabilitation operations and substantial resources have been mobilised in response to the earthquake in Gujarat, including medical and paramedical personnel, engineers and logisticians.
<P>

<a name="10213w01.html_para3">The Department for International Development has advised those volunteers with specialist skills to contact organisations that maintain databases of suitably qualified individuals, such as RedR (Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief; 1 Great George street, London, SW1P 3AA, 010 7233 3116) and the International Health Exchange (1st Floor, 134 Lower Marsh, London SE1 7AE; 020 7620 3333). These databases are used by the United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and other non- governmental organisations when personnel are needed quickly for short-term missions as well as longer-term assignments.
<P>

<a name="10213w01.html_para4">The DFID encourages people without specialist skills who wish to contribute to do so in cash rather than in kind by contributing towards the operational agencies working in the area. The best way for individuals to help is to contribute to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) at 52 Great Portland street, London W1N 6TB (0870 60 60 90). The DEC is the umbrella organisation that is responsible for co-ordinating the response to emergencies from charitable organisations as well as donations from the public. The DEC appeal has raised &#163;5 million to date.

 The Indian Government have not made any formal request for assistance, but have announced that appropriate support would be welcome.
<P>

<a name="10213w01.html_para5">I refer my hon. Friend to my previous response detailing the material and financial assistance my Department has given to date, given on 5 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 408-09W.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Department for International Development's priority is to ensure that those who have survived the earthquake are cared for until normal services can be restored. The Indian Government are developing plans for rehabilitation and reconstruction; it is expected that these will be largely funded by the World bank and the Asian Development bank. We have offered advice to the Indian Government on strengthening disaster preparedness arrangements, which will include Gujarat.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Department for International Development has made a total allocation of &#163;10 million for humanitarian assistance to Gujarat.
<P>

<a name="10213w01.html_para6">This is being channelled through the United Nations, the Red Cross and a number of non-governmental organisations for the provision of essential relief items such as tents, blankets, medical supplies, food, water and sanitation. All these agencies aim to focus their assistance on the most vulnerable, which will inevitably include young children who have been orphaned as a result of the earthquake.
<P>

<a name="10213w01.html_para7">More specifically we have provided &#163;1 million to UNICEF, part of which will support their child protection programme. This programme aims to identify and care for children who have been orphaned or separated from their families.
<P>

<a name="10213w01.html_para8">We have also contributed &#163;450,000 to Save the Children for the provision of shelter and non-food relief items for children and their families. They will also make efforts to ensure that those children placed in orphanages make contact with any remaining family by offering specialist advice to all organisations working with separated children.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Levonorgestrel is available as a prescription-only medicine, without an age limit. It may therefore be prescribed to women aged under 16 years. When given for the purposes of emergency contraception, prescribers are expected to satisfy themselves, in accordance with guidelines, that the young person understands the advice and it is in their best interests to receive the treatment. From 1 January 2001, pharmacists have been permitted to supply Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg to women aged 16 years and over for use as an emergency contraceptive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 No clinical trials specific to this age group have been undertaken in the United Kingdom. The marketing authorisation granted in 1999 for Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg tablets as a prescription-only medicine was supported by evidence from two large randomised controlled studies, one conducted by the World Health Organisation, and published data from uncontrolled studies. Most women in the clinical trials were aged between 16 and 48, but a few girls aged 14 and 15 were included. There were no data available for girls between aged 11 and 14 years. Age analysis of efficacy and safety in the randomised studies did not identify any population that responded differently to treatment.

 No patients in South Tyneside currently wait over 12 months for inpatient treatment and the South Tyneside Health Care National Health Service Trust has consistently met their over-13-week target for out-patient appointments during the last year.
<P>

<a name="10213w02.html_para9">The South Tyneside Healthcare NHS Trust is implementing several initiatives at the Charles Palmer Community Hospital, Jarrow which will help to reduce waiting times for the local community. These include a new digital X-ray service linked to the district general hospital which will allow specialist and one-stop clinics to be provided in a local setting and a new direct access audiology service which will help to shorten waiting lists and times for ear, nose and throat appointments.

 We recognise that air ambulance services have a role in delivering emergency care especially in rural areas and where road access is a problem. The services can be an effective way of getting better and faster access to hospital, and valuable in supporting inter-hospital transfers.
<P>

<a name="10213w02.html_para10">Information on the number and funding of air ambulances is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="10213w02.html_para11">During the last 12 months the Department has received letters from the general public and hon. Members asking whether the National Health Service should provide and fund air ambulance services.
<P>

<a name="10213w02.html_para12">Evidence supporting the introduction of air ambulances in the NHS, however is not convincing. In 1995, the Department commissioned Sheffield university to report on air ambulances. The report failed to show benefits which would justify NHS investment.
<P>

<a name="10213w02.html_para13">This lack of evidence to support the clinical or cost-effectiveness of these services does not support the funding of these services by the NHS. However, we will constantly review the position.

 There are no centrally held figures for the numbers of patients treated under the terms of the concordat.

 The climate change levy has been designed to safeguard the competitiveness of manufacturing industry as a whole. It recognises the special position of energy intensive industries exposed to international competition, including the steel sector. Sites in these sectors which meet eligibility criteria will, subject to EU state aid clearance, get an 80 per cent. levy discount provided they deliver energy saving targets in negotiated agreements with the Government.
<P>

<a name="10213w03.html_para3">The final impact of the levy on individual steel industry sites will depend on whether they participate in the steel sector's energy saving agreement to get the levy discount; and also on the extent to which they benefit from or take advantage of the various levy exemptions, and also the new scheme of enhanced capital allowances for investments in energy efficiency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many United Kingdom companies he anticipates will be covered by article 3(1) of the Companies (EU Political Expenditure) Exemption Order 2001.  [149925]<P>

<P>
<a name="10213w04.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> The draft Companies (EU Political Expenditure) Order 2001 seeks to exclude activities such as the publication of newspapers from the definition of "political expenditure" under Part IX of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, while at the same time ensuring that the principles of accountability and transparency are properly applied in relation to political donations and expenditure by companies. The draft order would exempt any company or subsidiary undertaking whose ordinary course of business includes the preparation, publication or dissemination to the public of material such as views, opinion and comment on the news, or on public or political affairs and events, from the requirement to seek prior shareholder authorisation in respect of such activities; it would not exempt such companies from the requirement to seek prior shareholder authorisation for donations to political parties and organisations or for other forms of political expenditure.
<P>

<a name="10213w04.html_para21">The order has been drafted so as to take account of possible future technological advances, and the Department does not have detailed information on the number of companies which will come within the exemption. The Newspaper Publishers Association, which represents national daily and Sunday newspapers, has eight members. The database of The Newspaper Society, which represents the regional newspaper industry, indicates that there are currently 106 regional press publishers.

 The Government's aim is to provide a substantive response to standard individual export licence applications (SIELs) within 20 working days.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the quinquennial review of the six grant-awarding research councils will take place; and what the terms of reference for the review will be.  [150466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am today launching the quinquennial review of the grant-awarding research councils.
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para2">Reviews of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are a key part of our programme to modernise government. The Government are committed to achieving better public services that are of higher quality and are more responsive to the needs of the people who use them. Regular NDPB reviews are an important element in ensuring that we have in place the right structures to deliver the Government's agenda effectively and to provide a strong focus on improving future performance.
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para3">The purpose of the six grant-awarding councils is to deliver Government policy for publicly funded research and postgraduate training. It would be impossible to conduct a fundamental review independently from that policy. For this reason, although quinquennial review of the six councils was due in 1999, it has been appropriate to postpone their quinquennial review until the outcome of the relevant policy reviews had been completed, so that the role of the councils could be considered in that context. Together, the White Papers on Science and Innovation ("Excellence and Opportunity"; Cmd 4814) and the Knowledge Economy ("Opportunity for All in a World of Change"; Cm 2250) now provide the context for the review.
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para4">The terms of reference for the review of the research councils are:
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para5"><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The review will consider the six grant-awarding research councils individually and collectively.

<a name="10213w05.html_para6">The review of councils will be undertaken in two stages:
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The first stage will examine the role and organisation of the councils, by reference to their charters and missions, evidence of work already undertaken to review and improve performance, current best practice for NDPBs and the councils' contribution to the delivery of Government policy for publicly funded scientific research and training in the context of the new White Paper. It will set the detailed terms of reference for the second stage.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10213w05.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The second stage will examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the councils' operations. It will look for further opportunities for improving performance by reference to such issues as boundaries between the councils, management structures, aims and objectives, role of funded institutes, performance targets and service standards, use of processes and new technology, delegated authority and accountability and changes to the operating environment since the councils were awarded their royal charters in 1994, including the modernising government agenda.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10213w05.html_para9">The review will consider, in particular, how the councils can best fulfil their strategic role in identifying the key areas for future investment in research that will offer the best opportunities for science, social development, industrial application and economic growth.
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para10">The review will be conducted in accordance with the current Cabinet Office guidance (published on 31 January 2000) and will include consultation, either in person or in writing, with members of council, staff of the executive 



<P>
<P><I>13 Feb 2001 : Column: 83W</I><P>
and the councils' customers and key stakeholders. It is expected that a number of working groups will be established to address key issues in detail in the second stage.
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para11">The review team will be directed by a review board, which is chaired by the Director General of the Research Councils, Dr. John Taylor, and with a membership which will include key representatives of both industry and academia drawn from the stakeholder communities. The review board will ensure that Ministers, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office, and the staff and customers of the councils are kept informed of the progress of the review and will facilitate the gathering of information for the review team and their communication with staff and other stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="10213w05.html_para12">The review team will be supported by officials in the Office of Science and Technology, with specialist advice as appropriate. The aim will be to complete the review within approximately six months, as recommended in the Cabinet Office guidance.

 As part of HMG's initiative to tackle the problem of conflict diamonds, the UK played the lead role in promoting UN Security Council resolution 1306, which was adopted on 5 July 2000 and imposed a ban on the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to the territory of UN member states. The resolution provided for an exemption from the ban for diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone through a certificate of origin regime. This exemption came into effect on 6 October 2000 when the UN

<a name="10213w06.html_para0">It is too early to assess the impact of the new regime on the illicit diamond trade. However, we anticipate that it will enhance the capacity of the Government and people of Sierra Leone to benefit from the country's diamond wealth, while limiting the rebels' income from illegal trade. In addition to the combative systems already in place, the UK is promoting a UN Security Council resolution recommending a package of measures against Liberia, identified as the rebel Revolutionary United Front's primary supporter in a recent expert panel report. We also co-sponsored resolution 55/56 on conflict diamonds, adopted by the UN General Assembly last December, and are working with Governments, industry and civil society to develop an international certification scheme, as mandated by that resolution.

 The Ministry of Defence has for many years conducted research into weapon and armour materials and designs. Research and consultation with allies continues to include the search for potential alternatives to depleted uranium and to identify and characterise their cost effectiveness and environmental impact. Depleted uranium still has a significant margin of operational effectiveness over alternative materials when employed in anti-armour weapon systems. In recent years, a new tungsten round has been developed for the Royal Navy's Phalanx close-in weapons systems that offers superior performance (anti-armour qualities are not important for this weapon system). So, since 1996, all replacement ammunition for the Phalanx system has been of the tungsten variety.

<a name="10213w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The first phase of work to identify a screening programme, which we intend should be equally applicable to Gulf veterans as to those who have served in the Balkans, has been completed. We are publishing today a consultative document setting out the technical issues associated with such a programme, inviting advice and comment in particular from a wide range of expert bodies. A copy of the consultative document is being placed in the Library of the House, and it will also be available on the MOD internet website.

 No alternative military use has so far been identified by my Department.

 No alternative military use for the Greensite at HMS Gannet has so far been identified. The availability of adjacent land has been taken into account, as have the very strict commercial aviation safety regulations which would constrain any development.

<P>

<a name="10213w07.html_para3">The board recommended that consideration should be given to the fitting of either a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) or a radar altimeter (RADALT) to the Hawk fleet. Due to compatibility difficulties with the existing avionics and the anticipated remaining life of the Hawk fleet, the fitting of a GPWS is not being pursued. However, the feasibility of fitting RADALT to the fleet is being explored as a matter of urgency. The board also recommended that a voice channel should be incorporated in the Hawk accident data recorder (ADR) and this is currently being investigated.

<P>
<a name="10213w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> A principal purpose of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Bill now before Parliament is to ensure that UK service personnel are protected from malicious or ill-founded prosecution by the ICC. The Ministry of Defence has been closely involved with the legislative details to guarantee this.
<P>

<a name="10213w07.html_para10">The Bill has been constructed to achieve this protection by using the principle of complementarity embodied in the ICC statute. Complementarity means that individuals cannot be tried before the ICC if they have been subject to genuine and effective national legal investigation or proceedings. Any allegations of war crimes against UK service personnel would therefore be dealt with by the UK and not by the ICC.
<P>

<a name="10213w07.html_para11">All offences included in the ICC Bill are already reflected in international law, and the armed forces are already bound by them in their conduct of operations.
<P>

<a name="10213w07.html_para12">To preserve the principle of complementarity, it is essential that domestic law allows investigation and, where necessary, prosecution of all offences contained in 



<P>
<P><I>13 Feb 2001 : Column: 91W</I><P>
the ICC statute. The ICC Bill accordingly defines offences exactly as in the ICC statute. To do otherwise, or to exclude service personnel from the provisions of the Bill, would leave them without full protection from malicious or ill-founded allegations and prosecutions.

 We have no evidence to suggest that the student support arrangements we introduced are affecting non-completion rates or the demand for higher education.

Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) on the number of people accepted for entry to full-time and sandwich courses in higher education in the UK in 2000-01 show an overall rise of 1.5 per cent. or over 5,000 students compared to the previous year.

 We value the music and ballet scheme, and want to see it continue and develop. The final report on the review was received in summer 1999 and we consulted more than 60 organisations and other interested parties in the autumn of that year. We announced last April that we accepted, in principle, all 20 recommendations in the report: they covered scheme objectives and decision-making, scheme development, and financial arrangements (including the restructuring of the parental contribution scales). In response to one of the key recommendations, we established last summer an advisory group for the music and ballet scheme to advise my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the operation, monitoring and future development of the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w08.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 My Department has not commissioned studies into incentives to move into open employment from supported employment, although my Department and the Employment Service receive regular feedback from providers and clients on this issue. We will continue to provide the training and support people need to progress from supported to mainstream employment. This is an important part of the modernised Supported Employment Programme (Workstep) which I announced on 8 December 2000. We expect that rates of progression from the programme will vary between providers and we will monitor the effects of incentives during the early years to see if there is a need to make any changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w08.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 My Department has not commissioned studies into the nature of open employment undertaken by people leaving supported employment because the numbers making such a move have been very small. One of my aims in modernising the Supported Employment Programme is to introduce improvements which will increase the numbers of people who move from the programme and into mainstream employment. The modernised programme, which will be known as Workstep from April 2001, will be subject to evaluation to provide information about what happens to people who leave it.

 I met with the north west development agency on the 26 January to discuss the agency's activities in Cumbria and my hon. Friend's objections. Considerable time was spent in discussion of the location of the regional and sub-regional offices. The north-west development agency assured me that as well as having a sub-regional office (in Penrith), they will maintain a presence in West Cumbria.

This action plan, to be implemented by the whole of Whitehall, overseen by the new neighbourhood renewal unit, aims to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest of the country so that in 10-20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live.

This set out our plans for achieving this, including the introduction of the "Starter Home Initiative", designed to help key workers in areas of high housing cost such as the south-east. The recently published revised regional planning guidance for the south-east recognises the importance of affordable housing. These issues are highlighted in the regional housing statement, together with the role housing investment can play in regeneration and sustaining rural communities.

 In "Achieving a better quality of life" (January 2001), our first annual report on progress by the country as a whole towards sustainable development, we noted that road traffic levels continued on a rising trend. Road traffic has been rising steadily since the 1950s. In recent decades that growth has been closely associated with the underlying rate of economic growth.
<P>

<a name="10213w12.html_para7">A key objective of policy is to break that link, improving access for people and goods while reducing traffic growth and tackling the impacts of congestion and pollution.

<a name="10213w12.html_para8">The most recent provisional traffic figures, published last week, show that in 2000 road traffic grew by 0.7 per cent. (after adjustment for the effects of fuel shortages in the autumn). This was the lowest increase in traffic for many years, and occurred despite economic growth of 3.2 per cent. during the year.

 The spending plans for 2001-02 to 2003-04 announced following last year's spending review provide for significant increases in housing investment by both local authorities and registered social landlords. These increases, which build on the substantial additional resources already made available through the capital receipts initiative and the 1998 spending review, reflect our commitment to bring all social housing in England up to a decent standard by 2010 and to provide additional social housing in areas where there is a need for it. Allocations for housing capital expenditure by local authorities have been increased from &#163;750 million in 1997-98 to &#163;2.6 billion in 2003-04, while allocations for investment in new housing by registered social landlords will increase from &#163;0.7 billion to &#163;1.2 billion over the same period.

 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2001]:</i> "Transport 2010: The 10 Year Plan" assumes that public expenditure on local transport in England in the period 2001-02 to 2005-06 will total &#163;30.7 billion. Of this, &#163;12.4 billion is capital expenditure, of which &#163;8.4 billion will be provided to local authorities outside London through local transport plans. Public resource expenditure is assumed to be &#163;18.3 billion.
<P>

<a name="10213w13.html_para0">The plan assumes that &#163;2.5 billion of public resource expenditure will be used to support urban and rural bus services in England between 2001-02 to 2005-06. This figure excludes expenditure that the plan assumes the Mayor will provide for bus services in London. In addition, local authorities outside London will be taking forward a number of major bus projects and will be using a significant proportion of the capital resources available to them for smaller-scale schemes on bus-related measures.
<P>

<a name="10213w13.html_para1">Of the &#163;30 billion of public expenditure to eliminate the backlog in local road and bridge maintenance, complete the bridge strengthening programme and replace life-expired lighting on local roads over the 10-year plan period mentioned in paragraph 6.61 of the plan, the plan

<P><I>13 Feb 2001 : Column: 112W</I><P>
assumes that revenue spending on highways maintenance by local authorities will be &#163;10.1 billion in the period 2001-02 to 2005-06. A further &#163;3 billion of capital expenditure for local road maintenance will be provided in this period to local authorities outside London through local transport plans.
<P>

<a name="10213w13.html_para2">Paragraph 6.32 of the plan states that the specific schemes on the strategic road network to be progressed by the Highways Agency over the period of the plan will depend on the outcome of the multi-modal studies and decisions taken in the context of regional planning guidance. The only forecast that can be made about the number of schemes to be started in the period 2001-02 to 2005-06 is in respect of those committed trunk road schemes currently included in the targeted programme of improvements. Contracts for 13 of these schemes will be let in the current financial year (2000-01). The Agency expect contracts for a further 25 schemes, including nine by-passes, to be let in the period 2001-02 to 2005-06, subject to completion of statutory procedures for 13 of these schemes. The 10-year plan anticipates that public expenditure on the strategic road network will total &#163;9.4 billion between 2001-02 and 2005-06. Of this, &#163;5.7 billion will be capital expenditure and &#163;3.7 billion will be resource expenditure.
<P>

<a name="10213w13.html_para3">The most advanced proposals for light rail schemes, which would deliver 13 new lines, are identified in paragraph 6.61 of the plan. The current position on each of these projects is set out in table 1. There are also a number of other proposals which are at a less advanced stage, including new systems in Merseyside and Hull and extensions to Midland Metro, Tyne and Wear Metro, Manchester Metrolink, South Yorkshire Supertram and Nottingham Express Transit. Work on these proposals is not yet at a sufficiently advanced stage to be able to forecast whether they could be under construction by 2005-06 or the level of public expenditure that might be involved. However, the plan assumes that public capital expenditure on light rail outside London between 2001-02 and 2005-06 will total &#163;1 billion. The actual amounts will depend on progress with individual schemes and the funding packages agreed with promoters.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will reach a decision on the order under the Transport and Works Act 1992 that has been requested in respect of the Spinnaker Tower at the Millennium site in Portsmouth; for what reason there has been a delay in the processing of this application; and if he will make a statement.  [149563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We expect to reach a decision very soon. A principal cause of delay has been that on two occasions, in September 1999 and in May 2000, the applicants revised their proposals. We had to ensure that interested parties were given a proper opportunity to make representations on those revisions, and on some further material that was submitted last August about radar impact.

[149562]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Where an application is made for an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992, and objections are received, the Secretary of State may choose either to hold a public local inquiry or to conduct exchanges of written representations between the parties. The choice of procedure will depend upon the nature and extent of the objections made. Either way, the aim is to ensure that the views of interested parties are given a proper airing in the interests of natural justice and informed decision taking. Following receipt of the inspector's report in an inquiry case, or the conclusion of the written exchanges, the Secretary of State carefully considers all the views expressed before coming to a decision.

[149646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have no plans to do so. Where an application is made for outline planning permission, the local planning authority may grant permission subject to a condition specifying reserved matters for the authority's subsequent approval. However, the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 enables authorities to require within a month of receiving an outline planning application further details from applicants where they are of the opinion that the application ought not to be considered separately from all or any of the reserved matters.

<P>
<a name="10213w14.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We attach great importance to early consultation between developers and local planning authorities on development proposals. Pre-application discussions provide an opportunity for proposals to be revised and refined (for example, to reflect local planning policies) before planning applications are submitted and thus facilitate a speedier and more efficient processing of them.

 Streamlined statutory procedures for handling planning appeals were introduced, following public consultation, in August last year.

<a name="10213w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Regulations require that every child must be provided with a seatbelt when a group of three or more children are travelling in a coach or minibus on an organised trip. School journeys where the key element is the transport of children would fall into the category of organised trip. However, seatbelts for children are not required in coaches and minibuses which are providing a transport service for the general public or which are being used to provide a registered local bus service.

<P>
<a name="10213w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 None. Responsibility for providing for television reception is a matter of contract between social landlords and their tenants and residents. Many tenants and residents of social housing are, in common with owner-occupiers, responsible for providing for their television reception. In situations where television reception depends upon shared aerial systems, social landlords may be responsible (as part of tenancy terms and conditions) for the supply and upkeep of those aerials.

 The sub-regional approach draws on the report of the independent panel who conducted the public examination of the draft regional planning guidance (RPG) in March 2000. Their report was published on 3 August 2000 and copies were placed in the House of Commons Library. Chapter 4 of the report sets out their reasoning, including economic issues, which informed the proposals in the published proposed changes to the draft RPG.

 The proposed sub-regions are broad areas which each have key economic features in common and therefore offer a basis for spatial planning.

 The generally accepted theory is that exposure to the rogue prion protein causes the normal protein to convert into the disease or rogue form. The mechanism by which this conversion occurs is not fully understood, but is the subject of research in a large number of laboratories throughout the world. Officials in MAFF keep updated on the progress of this research. They also monitor the progress on other, less widely accepted, theories for the conversion, such as exposure to organophosphates and manganese. Details of all the publicly funded work on prion diseases being undertaken in the UK can be found on the Medical Research Council's website at www.mrc.ac.uk.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what percentage of agricultural land in Leicestershire is subject to set-aside; and what the annual cost was to public funds of the set-aside in the most recent year for which figures are available.  [149986]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w16.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The area of set-aside in Leicestershire on claims made in 2000 under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) was 12,694 hectares or 12 per cent. of the total area claimed for. But because not all agricultural land is either eligible or claimed for under AAPS, the proportion of set-aside in relation to agricultural land in the county as a whole is estimated at around 6.7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10213w16.html_para2">At the 2000 payment rate, the payment for this area of set-aside would have been &#163;2,712,000 from EU funds, to which the UK Exchequer contributes. In addition some &#163;92,000 will be paid shortly as agrimonetary compensation of which half will be funded by the EU and half direct by the UK Exchequer.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> The economic effect of the quota reductions for 2001 will vary according to the extent to which the UK is able to catch its quota allocations. In some cases the quotas for 2001 are higher than the catches made in 2000.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> On 16 January 2001, officials met with representatives of sea angling and vessel chartering interests. The discussion was constructive and covered a number of matters relating to the Common Fisheries Policy including the application of TACs and quotas to landings made by boat anglers. It was confirmed following consultation with the European Commission that account had to be taken of such activity in managing fisheries.

 The Regional Service Centre at Worcester started to make payments on 16 November; the earliest date that payments could be made after the amendments agreed under the Agenda 2000 proposals. To date, the Regional Service Centre has 98.5 per cent. of Gloucestershire's applications processed for payment. This equates to over &#163;18 million. The RSC expects to be able to pay those of the remaining claims that can be paid in the next few days.

<P>
<a name="10213w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The responsibility for deciding which projects to promote and their timing rests with local operating authorities, such as the Environment Agency. I am advised that the agency has no plans to promote such works at Gloucester or Tewkesbury since they would provide limited reduction in flood risk. Consequently the question of discussions does not arise.

<a name="10213w17.html_para3">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than constituency level data, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Morecambe and Lunesdale since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10213w17.html_para4">We are spending an additional &#163;7 billion a year on support for families and children. This includes significant increases in child benefit, which will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from 9 April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Morecambe and Lunesdale 10,850 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10213w17.html_para5">We have launched the New Deals to help lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since August 1998 the number of people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,323,600 to 1,044,900; in Morecambe and Lunesdale the number has reduced from 2,300 to 1,900. The number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased over the same period from 955,000 to 909,200 nationally. In Morecambe and Lunesdale the number has increased from 1,400 to 1,500.
<P>

<a name="10213w17.html_para6">Next year we will be spending &#163;4.5 billion a year extra in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. The Winter Fuel Payment has continued to tackle fuel poverty. Last winter, around 10 million pensioners, of whom 18,900 were in Morecambe and Lunesdale, benefited from the payment. We have now extended the scheme to include eligible people from age 60 so that even more older people will benefit. This winter, households that qualify will receive an increased payment of &#163;200. The Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) targets the poorest 1.6 million pensioner families, 2,800 of whom live in Morecambe and Lunesdale. These pensioners will benefit from our alignment of all MIG rates from April 2001, giving single pensioners at least &#163;92.15 each week--a real increase of &#163;12.45 for the poorest pensioners.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency will consider making a compensatory payment where a client has suffered an actual financial loss due to clear errors or delays on the part of the Agency. In addition, redress can be considered for inconvenience, embarrassment or severe distress caused by the actions of the Agency. These latter (consolatory) payments can be paid over and above any other payments to recognise that some impacts are other than financial. In 1999/2000 these made up 19% of the total compensation paid out.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am sorry I am not able to give you the information in the format that you requested. The Agency does not differentiate between those payments instigated by the client and those by the Agency. However, Table One in the attached annex shows compensation payments made from 1995/1996 to 1999/2000. Table Two shows a breakdown of the payments for 1999/2000.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Guidance has already been issued. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act, employees transferring to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service will do so on terms equivalent to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations. They will retain their current terms and conditions including those relating to mobility and to job security.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department where the workforce for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service will be accommodated after 1 April; and if she will make a statement.  [149556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Nearly all staff transferring to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service will be accommodated in the same locations as they are working in before 1 April. Those few who have to move offices will be accommodated as close as possible to their current location. Self-employed staff and others who work at home will continue to be able to do so.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the anticipated <i>(a)</i> workforce at each grade and <i>(b)</i> caseload per officer is for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service from 1 April; and if she will make a statement.  [149554]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Staff who presently deliver these services are expected to transfer to the Children and Family Court Advice and Support Service and caseloads on transfer are expected to be similar to present caseloads.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 My officials have reviewed the different pay scales of staff who will transfer from the Probation Service, and other employers, into the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). It is clear that there are many variations between different groups of staff. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act, employees transferring to CAFCASS on 1 April will do so under terms equivalent to the Transfer of Undertakings and (Protection of Employment) Regulations. It will be a priority for CAFCASS to negotiate a harmonisation of terms and conditions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service will issue guarantees in relation to detriment and continuity of service for transferring employees; if it will be possible

 Employees transferring to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) will keep their continuity of service. Staff will, of course, be free to apply for posts in the Probation Service in the future. I expect CAFCASS to act as a good employer in relation to conditions of service in the future.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what costs have been incurred to date in establishing the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service; what is the planned budget for the next financial year; and if she will make a statement.  [149553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The costs of establishing CAFCASS amount to a total of &#163;11.6 million for start-up costs. These, together with the staffing costs, have been met from within the provision of the three sponsoring Departments: LCD, the Home Office and the Department of Health. The planned budget for next year is &#163;72 million in running costs plus &#163;9.1 million capital.

<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The service will be established on Sunday 1 April 2001 and will be operational from Monday 2 April as planned. Staff and other main stakeholders are playing an invaluable role alongside my officials in shaping the unified service.
<P>

<a name="10213w18.html_para0">The chair, the board, and the chief executive of CAFCASS have been appointed. All the necessary transfer arrangements for children's cases, and for staff, accommodation, finance and IT, will be in place on 2 April.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what representations she has received on trade union recognition for staff at the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service; what response has been made to those representations; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10213w18.html_spnew7"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Several representations have been received and the CAFCASS chairman-designate, Anthony Hewson OBE, announced on 12 February that the National Association of Probation Officers would be a recognised trade union within CAFCASS. Representations from other trade unions are being considered.
