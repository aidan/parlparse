 We are taking the need to update the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) financial protection scheme very seriously, and are working on what can be done to ensure that it remains relevant to today's travel market.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has overseen a sustained programme of work to tackle racism in prisons. The most recent published assessment is contained in "Race Review 2008", and is available from the House Library. The review, overseen by an independent advisory group and described as 'honest and rigorous' by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, concluded that good systems and processes are in place in prisons and that blatant forms of racism have been largely eradicated. However it also concluded that the experiences of black and minority ethnic prisoners and staff have not been transformed and that there remained evidence of differential treatment of black and minority ethnic prisoners. A further programme of work is set out in "Promoting Equality in Prisons and Probation: the NOMS Single Equality Scheme 2009-2012", also available in the Library, and progress on this will be reported in the 2009-10 annual equalities report which will be published later this year.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the average proportion of working hours spent by probation officers <i> (a)</i> in contact with offenders and <i> (b)</i> on administrative tasks in the latest period for which figures are available. [18324]</p>

 Delivery structures across probation areas vary as do the requirements of specific roles, and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not routinely report on the proportion of working time spent in face to face contact with offenders. In December 2008, NOMS undertook a snapshot survey over a one-week period, based on a small sample of probation officer (PO) and probation service officer (PSO) staff. It reported that across England and Wales 24% of PO/PSO time was spent in direct contact with offenders, 41% was involved in computer activity and 35% of time was spent on non-computer-dealing with correspondence, meetings, travel, etc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="101022w0002.htm_para1"><a name="1010227001171">The reporting of the results against only three main headings means that much of the detail is open to interpretation. For example, it could reasonably be argued that time spent on computer activity involving the production of reports and assessments is work on individual cases. Even if only about three-quarters of this time were included as work on cases this gives a picture of more like 54% of time being spent on work with individual offenders.</p>

For example, we have already redirected Â£150 million to create up to 50,000 extra apprenticeships, which will be workplace-based and employer-led.

 The EU standard, given in Annex VII of Directive 2009/28/EC, is based on the total useable heat delivered, the average seasonal performance factor and the efficiency of electrical generation. As the Commission have yet to establish how member states are to estimate these factors it is not possible to estimate the proportion of installed heat pumps that will fail to meet that standard.</p>

 The potential future demand for housing can be informed by CLG's household projections. The latest projections were published on the CLG website in March 2009:</p>
<a name="101022w0002.htm_brev28"><a name="1010227001701"><ul><p class="tabletext">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/2031households0309</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="101022w0002.htm_para45"><a name="1010227001600">and are based on the 2006-based population projections produced by the Office for National Statistics. They provide a long -term view of the net growth in the number of households given a projected population and previous demographic trends. As such the household projections do not take into account changes in policy or economic circumstances that may have a material effect on future household formation and do not explicitly reflect the different tenure pattern and household formation of migrant groups. The household projections reflect a net position; the number of newly forming households net of those that dissolve. Using the zero net migration population variant it is estimated that net international migration could account, on average, for 40% of the net growth in households in England over the projection period from 2006 to 2031.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="101022w0002.htm_para46"><a name="1010227001601">However, this does not directly equate to the actual effective demand for housing. This will also be determined by factors such as the ability of individual households to meet the cost of housing which is in turn influenced by the wider economic context. These projections also do not take into account the 2008-based population projections, subsequently published by the ONS, which include lower projected levels of net international migration. CLG expect to publish 2008-based household projections in November 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="101022w0002.htm_para47"><a name="1010227001602">Equivalent assessments were made for the household projections from a 2003-base and 2004-base. Using the zero net migration population variant in the 2004-based projections it was estimated that net international migration could account, on average, for around a third of the net growth in households in England to 2026. The equivalent estimate in the 2003-based projections was that net international migration accounted for around a quarter of household growth from 2003 to 2026.</p>

 We appreciate the problems caused by the last Government's increases in the burden of empty property rates, especially given the fact they were imposed at a time when firms faced significant difficulties in renting out empty property. The new Government's ability to take action on this matter is restricted by the high costs-the last Government estimated that the change would increase net tax yield by Â£950 million in 2008-09. As a result, any action will need to be balanced against the overriding need to reduce public expenditure and support the economy generally by reducing the deficit. However, we keep all taxes under review, including this specific issue. We recognise the burden of business rates on local firms, and we have already taken action to increase small business rate relief and scrap the unfair 'ports tax' on firms which threatened to inflict significant harm on Britain's manufacturing sector.</p>
