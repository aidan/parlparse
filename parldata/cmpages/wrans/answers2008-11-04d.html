The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of gaseous (not liquid) oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered. Where air carriers wish to supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, the code acknowledges that it would be possible to make a charge for this service to cover the provision of the oxygen.</p>

 The Department is conducting research on the potential use of fatigue risk management systems with the object of developing guidance for their use by those who employ drivers. The research is expected to be completed in the first half of 2009. Early indications from the project suggest that such systems offer considerable potential as a more effective method of managing fatigue than compliance with hours of work limits alone. They encourage employers to identify fatigue-related risk factors within their business and to consider the full range of potential contributors to fatigue, both work-related (e.g. work practices, shift patterns) and individual (e.g. lifestyle, medical conditions).</p>

<i>  [holding answer 6 October 2008]: </i>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is committed to better, smarter health and safety legislation. In December 2007 it published its second Simplification Plan<sup>(1)</sup>, which set out how it was reducing the administrative burden of health and safety regulation on businesses and making compliance easier, in particular for low risk, small and medium sized enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="81104w0004.htm_para0"><a name="08110442000486">Among the regulatory improvements detailed in the plan was the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007, which consolidated four sets of regulations, and improved the process for proving competency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="81104w0004.htm_para1"><a name="08110442000487">HSE is also improving guidance on regulations to help businesses understand and comply. For example, it has produced 29 example risk assessments for different sectors, showing businesses that a risk assessment does not need to be complicated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="81104w0004.htm_para2"><a name="08110442000488">Finally, the Better Regulation Executive has carried out a review of the health and safety regulatory regime, particularly for lower risk small businesses<sup>(2)</sup>. This has made several recommendations for improvement. Of those addressed to HSE, some are already being addressed through HSE's simplification work. Others will be considered through the development and subsequent implementation of HSE's new strategy.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 November 2008]:</i> Two of the intended effects of the local housing allowance are to promote financial independence and personal responsibility. Therefore payments are normally made directly to tenants so they have personal responsibility for paying their rent. However, we recognise that there will always be a small proportion of tenants who will struggle with this, so there are circumstances in which the local authority has the power to pay benefit direct to the landlord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="81104w0005.htm_para7"><a name="08110442000859">These are if the local authority either considers that the tenant is likely to have difficulty in relation to the management of their own affairs&#151;for example, the tenant is known to have a learning disorder or a drug/alcohol problem that would mean they are likely to have difficulty handling a budget&#151;or considers it improbable that the tenant will pay their rent; for example, the local authority is aware that the tenant has consistently failed to pay the rent on past occasions without good reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="81104w0005.htm_para8"><a name="08110442000860">Additionally, in housing benefit generally, payment direct to the landlord is a statutory requirement if a tenant has built up rent arrears of eight weeks or more, or is having deductions from their income support or jobseeker's allowance to pay off rent arrears. If this occurs, the local authority has the discretion to continue paying direct to the landlord when the level of arrears drops to below eight weeks.</p>

The roll out of Jobcentre Plus in the South East was completed with the opening of our new Portsmouth Jobcentre Plus office on 24 September 2008. The Jobcentre Plus network in the South East currently consists of 73 Jobcentres and 8 Benefit Delivery Centres.</p>

We are, therefore, offering far more of our services, both to employers and individual customers, through our Contact Centre network and the Internet. Customers making a benefit claim or enquiry can call a 0800 number to provide claim details by phone, this is free to landline users, with a call back facility available for those using mobile phones. This reduces the need to call into a Jobcentre and increasingly our offices are used for booked appointments only. In addition, we are providing a more individual service for our most disadvantaged customers, delivered in partnership with the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>

When Sutton DBC was closed the DLA new claims work was transferred to DCPU 5 New Claims Unit. When Newcastle DBC was closed the DLA new claims work was transferred to the Bootle and Wales offices (Bootle North East and Wales North East). When Edinburgh DBC was closed down the DLA new claims work was transferred to DCPU 1 New Claims Unit.  2. The table above shows that for the majority of the units the YTD target for DLA New Claims was met, this despite the target being reduced from 42 days in 2003-04 to 38 days for this year. Over this period all units have seen a steady reduction in their YTD performance ranging from a decrease of 15.9 days at Leeds DBC to 4.8 days at Midlands DBC, from the first quarter of 2003-04 to the second quarter of 2008-09. Also throughout this period the national YTD performance was below target for all of the quarters and reduced from 38.8 days in the first quarter of 2003-04 to 29.8 days in the second quarter of 2008-09, a decrease of nine days.  <i> Source:</i>  RDA 80123 Monthly Reports.<br>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has regular contact with his Chinese counterpart to discuss a whole range of issues, including Hong Kong. He pays close attention to Hong Kong, and comments on developments in the Six-Monthly Report. A particular focus is on Hong Kong's progress towards universal suffrage. On 29 December 2007 the Foreign Secretary released the following comments on Hong Kong's elections:</p>
<a name="81104w0011.htm_brev2"><a name="08110453000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Today's announcement by the National People's Congress that there will not be universal suffrage in the 2012 Hong Kong elections will be a disappointment for all those who want to see Hong Kong move to full democracy as soon as possible.&#148;</p>

</ul><a name="81104w0011.htm_brev4"><a name="08110453000440"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I remain of the view that both China and Hong Kong's interests will be best served by allowing Hong Kong to move to full democracy as soon as possible. The National People's Congress' statement clearly points towards universal suffrage for the Chief Executive election in 2017 and the legislative council thereafter. I hope that all parties concerned can engage in meaningful dialogue to allow this, and that the Hong Kong authorities will now put forward constructive proposals making progress in 2012 to achieve this goal.&#148;</p>

 NATO has come a long way in recognising the importance of expeditionary capabilities in dealing with the broad range of security threats the alliance is likely to face. It continues to make progress, but not as quickly as we&#151;and others&#151;would like. The alliance needs to do more to provide the capabilities it needs for current and future operations, such as strategic and intra-theatre lift and contributions to the NATO Response Force. The UK and other allies have sought to find innovative ways of developing such capabilities through initiatives to make more helicopters and strategic lift available for operations, but ultimately these capabilities depend on sufficient investment by allies in defence, and prioritisation on the capabilities the alliance needs most. NATO Defence Ministers met in London in September to inject more dynamism into this transformation process. NATO's agreement in Budapest the following month to increase targets for the deployability of allies' land forces is a welcome step in the right direction.</p>

 When a petition for divorce is lodged at a court the court requires information to ascertain that there was a valid marriage between the parties, and the grounds on which a divorce is sought. The religious affiliation of the parties is not included on divorce documents. Hence it is not possible to provide any statistics that relate to the parties' religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para3"><a name="08110458000408">Marriages conducted in this country under Sharia law are not recognised in England and Wales unless they also comply with the provisions of the Marriage Acts. Therefore &#147;Sharia marriages&#148; are not a legal reality in this country and we cannot obtain statistics for them. We are aware that many Muslim couples undergo both a civil ceremony in a register office and a purely religious ceremony. The former is recognised but the latter is not. Increasing numbers of mosques are registered so that they can offer a joint civil and religious marriage ceremony. Section 55 of the Family Law Act 1986 allows parties to a marriage to apply for an order that their marriage is valid, or to allow &#147;divorced&#148; parties similarly to test the validity of their divorce. This provision is used rarely, and generally to test the validity of marriages contracted abroad and foreign divorces. A Sharia marriage contracted in this country which does not comply with Marriage Act requirements would not be validated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para4"><a name="08110458000409">&#147;Sharia divorces&#148; conducted in this country are also unrecognised by the legal system. The English courts do not approve divorces or annulments granted by any faith group, therefore no statistics are available for them. A Sharia divorce dissolves the religious &#147;limb&#148; of a marriage but leaves the civil marriage intact. This must be dissolved by a civil divorce. If no civil marriage has taken place then no civil divorce is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para5"><a name="08110458000410">Consent orders differ widely according to what is required in each case.

parent do something or refrain from doing it, an order for expert reports or for contact activities or for review. In financial matters a court can deal with income, capital, pensions, assets and can, among others orders, make periodical payment, secured periodical payment, lump sum or property adjustment orders, pension sharing orders, and asset distribution orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_595"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para6"><a name="08110458000411">The only orders that can be made during an extant marriage are an order for validity of marriage, as described above, or an order for judicial separation, which has similar effects to divorce save that the parties are still regarded as married, albeit legally separated. This type of order is usually used by those with a religious objection to divorce. Neither of these orders is likely to be made by consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_596"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para7"><a name="08110458000412">Consent orders can be applied for following negotiations and an agreement reached by the parties directly, or with the help of lawyers, mediators, or a third party, which might be a Sharia council. Sharia councils operate under the statutory basis of the Arbitration Act 1996, established by the previous Government. The family court would be unable to tell whether an application for a consent order (whether within a divorce or in other proceedings) had been made as the result of negotiations conducted through a Sharia council, by the parties themselves, through mediation or by the intervention of any other third party. Applications for consent orders are generally filed by solicitors. In those circumstances the court can see whether the parties had the benefit of legal advice. However, even if lawyers have represented the parties, the court will still check consent orders to ensure that they appear to be within the range of orders that could be made had the matter been adjudicated in court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para8"><a name="08110458000413">There are many forms of alternative dispute resolution available to assist parties to reach an agreement in family cases, but whichever method the parties use; the principles applied by the court are the same. The court cannot simply &#145;rubber-stamp&#146; an agreement in a family case, whatever the process by which the agreement has been reached, and judges can and do ask for further information where there is any doubt about the propriety of a proposed order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para9"><a name="08110458000414">Any proposed consent order submitted to the court, whether the product of an agreement by the Sharia council or not, might be made by coercion and it is the function of the judiciary to question any order which appears unfair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para10"><a name="08110458000415">An order which on its face involved an undue financial advantage to one party or set out arrangements for children which excluded care by or contact with one parent would be the sort of order which alerts a court to potential coercion and the need to ask for further information and, if appropriate, to refuse to make the order requested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="81104w0018.htm_para11"><a name="08110458000416">Court statistics do not include the ages of the parties at the time a consent order is made, although the information is available to the court when considering the terms of the order, and is one of the factors taken into account in making a decision as to the fairness or otherwise of an order. The Office for National Statistics' records show that between 1996 and 2005 only 18 women and no men under the age of 18 were divorced.</p>

 Restorative justice can be used in relation to shoplifting offences. It is for local criminal justice boards and local criminal justice agencies to consider how best to use their funding to meet their targets and local needs. Restorative justice, for a variety of offences, is an established part of the work of youth offending teams and a number of areas have established schemes to deliver adult restorative justice. Where a scheme is available, its use in relation to a given case should depend on whether the victim chooses to participate and, where appropriate, the sentence of the court.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 The National DNA Database does not record convictions. That is done by the Police National Computer (PNC). When data was last obtained from PNC it showed that at 31 March 2008, 857,366 people on the National DNA Database did not have a current criminal record on the Police National Computer. However, this figure includes those who have been convicted and their records deleted, and those where proceedings are still ongoing, as well as those who have never been convicted.

 The UK and French Governments and police organisations co-operate closely on policing of the channel tunnel. UK and French senior officials and police officers meet regularly in the Joint Security Committee (JSC), which is set up by the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) to ensure continued comparability of security standards for the channel tunnel. Kent police provide a permanent police presence and response to the channel tunnel which is funded under the terms of the Channel Tunnel Act. Kent police, under joint arrangements, also maintain a permanent liaison office in Coquelles that provides direct engagement with the French authorities. Article 4 of the Sangatte treaty further mandates regular joint operational meetings between French and UK agencies. The safety and security of the channel tunnel is supported by other initiatives such as the annual exercise programme, the lead for which alternates between the UK and France.</p>

1. QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004.<br>
2. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part.<br>
3. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health.<br>
4. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices&#146; QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br>
5. The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients.<br>
6. The Quality Management Analysis System captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on&#146; each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.<br>
7. Figures presented here are just the number of patients on the disease register for dementia.<br>

1. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust was set up in 2000-01 by merging St. Albans and Hemel Hempstead NHS Trust and RQL Mount Vernon and Watford Hospital. Therefore figures prior to 2000-01 were provided as the total of RPW and RQL.<br>
 2. Numbers provided are for finished consultant episodes and for cases for patients admitted to NHS hospitals only. They do not represent the number of people as one person can have more than one episode during the year. They also do not represent the prevalence of people with Alzheimer&#146;s disease.<br>
3. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
4. Primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
5. Secondary diagnoses, as well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: these figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br>
7. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis: these figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
 8. Small numbers: due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br>
 9. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
10. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
11. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
12. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE):</i><br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Consultant Main Specialty:</i><br>
This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible for care of the patient is contracted. Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>
<i> Consultant main specialties included:</i><br>
710 = Mental illness<br>
711 = Child and adolescent psychiatry<br>
712 = Forensic psychiatry<br>
713 = Psychotherapy<br>
715 = Old age psychiatry (available from 1990-91)<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>

 Since the EU's tariff schedule includes both ad valorem (percentage of price) components and specific (&#8364; per tonne) components, tariffs are compared using estimates of the ad valorem equivalent (AVE). Calculation of the AVE requires an estimate of the import price. Typically unit import values (the value of imports divided by the volume) are used as the estimate of the price in the conversion process.</p>

lines weighted according to import volumes. Many imports also take place within the context of tariff rate quotas where the applied rate of duty is lower than the bound rate. Further, each commodity has several (and sometimes many) tariff lines, often with very different tariff rates. These lines can be averaged in different ways, for example a simple average could be used, or lines weighted according to import volumes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_719"><a name="81104w0036.htm_para2"><a name="08110499000058">Each method has particular disadvantages. For example, weighting by import volume assigns low weight to tariff lines where the tariff is high enough to eliminate imports. This tends to reduce the estimated tariff rate. Historically DEFRA's approach has been to present the tariff for a 'representative' tariff line which accounts for the bulk of imports, or, when there is no clearly dominant individual line, to present a simple average of several important tariff lines.</p>

 Excavated soil removed from a site is classified as waste under the EC Waste Framework Directive, as some soils are contaminated, which means that certain safeguards are required. Unfortunately, this has led to restrictions on the transfer of good quality soil to other sites and can lead to good quality soils being buried in landfill. To address this, DEFRA worked with the Environment Agency, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and industry to try and agree a Waste Quality Protocol setting out when soil should be regarded as safe and where it would be acceptable for soil to be transferred to another site without the need for treatment or being subject to permitting requirements. However, this ran into difficulties due to the lack of a straightforward way of determining when soil should be regarded as safe. Alternative risk based approaches to managing soil from uncontaminated sites are now being looked at.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 30 October 2008]:</i> The Waste and Resources Action Programme's (WRAP) remit from its Government funders is to help individuals, businesses and organisations to waste less and recycle more and to help support the development of end markets for recycled materials. WRAP describes this role as encouraging &#145;resource efficiency&#146;. WRAP'S work delivers environmental, social and economic benefits, and so its advice, experience and agenda is of interest to policy makers in Government and other political parties.

For this winter only, an extra investment of &#163;575 million will be made to fund an additional payment of &#163;50 to eligible households with someone aged 60-79 and &#163;100 to eligible households with someone aged 80 or over. DWP also fund the cold weather payments, paying over &#163;20 million in total over the last five years to eligible households experiencing sustained periods of cold weather. A further &#163;1.5 billion will be provided over the next three years by the energy companies under their carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) obligations to fund energy efficiency improvements in a priority group of low income and elderly customers. In addition, in April my Department secured the individual agreement of the six largest energy suppliers to increase the level of their collective spend on social programmes, which include social tariffs and rebates, to &#163;150 million a year by 2010-11.</p>

This &#163;910 million is made up of a 20 per cent. increase in funding for the existing CERT programme, with the remainder coming from a new Community Energy Saving Programme to be funded by energy suppliers and electricity generators. Throughout the country, a partnership of local councils, voluntary organisations and energy companies will carry out house-to-house calls to offer energy efficiency help in some of the most deprived areas of the UK. In addition, the Government will be increasing the cold weather payments from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25 per week for winter 2008-09.</p>

 I have had no discussions with universities on the subject requirements for student admissions.

They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority&#146;s previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG&#146;s local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department&#146;s time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

In schools funded through the programme, children receiving reading recovery lessons made on average a gain of 21 months in reading age in four to five months of teaching&#151;well over four times the normal rate of progress.

In the 2005-06 school year literacy progress was compared of the lowest achieving children in 42 schools serving disadvantaged urban areas who received reading recovery compared with those in schools which provided a range of other interventions. At the end of the 2005/06 main study&#151;the literacy achievement of children who had received reading recovery (RR) was in line with their chronological age.

At the end of year two the children who had received RR in year one were achieving within or above their chronological age band on all measures and were still around a year ahead of the comparison children in schools where RR was not available. The RR children had an average word reading age of seven years nine months, compared to six years nine months for the comparison children. The gender gap that was noticeable among low attaining comparison children, with boys lagging behind girls, was not evident in RR schools, where there was no gender gap. Writing achievement showed a significant difference between RR and comparison children. At the end of year two, the children who had received RR were able to write twice as many correctly spelled, words as those children who were in the comparison group.</p>

 The Government believe that there should be more access to project credits in the EU emissions trading scheme than is provided for in the Commission proposal for revising the scheme. This would allow for harmonisation of access among installations in the EU. The UK Government would like to see project credit access in both the EU emissions trading scheme and greenhouse gas (GHG) effort-share limited to 50 per cent. of absolute effort (in the context of the overarching principle that 50 per cent. of absolute emissions reductions from 2005 must take place within the EU).</p>

 There is limited assistance that can be given to park home residents under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) due to the nature of their homes, which make them harder to insulate than many others. Although the Government set the overall CERT target, it is open to energy suppliers how they meet their targets. Suppliers promote the most cost effective energy saving measures including cavity wall and loft insulation. Measures such as external or internal wall insulation for park homes are not currently as cost effective as other energy saving measures, so are less attractive to energy suppliers.

This includes policies to reduce the carbon content of transport fuel; improve fuel efficiency of vehicles; enable individuals to make more sustainable travel choices; and explore the use of emissions trading for transport. In particular, the renewable transport fuel obligation, EU standards on vehicle emissions and research into electric and hybrid vehicles are likely to encourage the development and deployment of technologies that provide alternatives to petrol and diesel and/or reduce CO2 emissions.</p>

 The renewables obligation is the Government's key mechanism for encouraging renewable electricity generation. It will therefore play a key part in meeting the 2020 target but we will need a range of other measures as the EU 2020 target is for renewable energy not just electricity. The European Commission has proposed for the UK to have a 15 per cent target. of all its energy from renewable sources by 2020. This will be confirmed when the renewable energy directive is agreed. The Government have committed to publishing a UK renewable energy strategy once the renewables directive has been agreed next spring on how to meet the UK's share of the EU 2020 renewables target. The consultation document made clear that the EU 2020 target required a step change in our policies to deliver 15 per cent. of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. The consultation on the draft renewable energy strategy therefore set out a wide range of potential measures including new and expanded financial support mechanisms for electricity, heat, transport and small scale generation as well as the approach on tackling key constraints such as planning, grid and supply chain. The consultation document was placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Final decisions on how the renewables obligation and other policies will be implemented to meet the renewable energy target will be set out in the final UK renewable energy strategy next spring.</p>

 The Department has committed over &#163;41 million to support the photovoltaic industry since 2000 through the Major Demonstration PV programme and field trials. The photovoltaic industry currently benefits from the &#163;86 million Low Carbon Buildings programme, along with other small scale technologies. Electricity generated from solar PV is also eligible for support under the renewables obligation (RO), which is the Government's main mechanism for encouraging new renewable electricity generation. Generators currently receive one renewable obligation certificate (ROC) for every lMWh of renewable electricity. Under reforms to the RO, we are proposing that solar PV receive two ROCs per MWh.</p>

 The UK supports article 5(9) of the draft EU Renewable Energy Directive, which allows renewable energy generated by new installations outside the EU, to count towards member state renewable energy targets if it is consumed within the EU. We also support the intention that the directive should incentivise deployment of renewable technologies, outside the EU as well as inside.</p>

 Section 1 of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act provides the Secretary of State with a power to define fuel poverty. This power has not been exercised because since the fuel poverty strategy was published the Government have relied on the following definition:</p>
<a name="81104w0051.htm_brev0"><a name="08110511001190"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A household is said to be in fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain an adequate level of warmth (usually defined as 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms).&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_858"><a name="81104w0051.htm_para4"><a name="08110511001177">The broad definition of spending on fuel adopted in the measurement of fuel poverty also includes spending on water heating, lights and appliances and cooking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_859"><a name="81104w0051.htm_para5"><a name="08110511001178">Section 2 of the Act contains the substance of the Secretary of State&#146;s duties to tackle fuel poverty which includes preparing and publishing a strategy, implementing that strategy and keeping the strategy under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_860"><a name="81104w0051.htm_para6"><a name="08110511001179">From the strategy the Government have implemented a package of measures, set target dates and published annual progress reports. The strategy and annual reports help to communicate to stakeholders on progress and the challenges faced. In this sense, section 2 is an effective provision in ensuring the Government&#146;s approach to tackling fuel poverty is transparent&#151;as Parliament intended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_861"><a name="81104w0051.htm_para7"><a name="08110511001180">Friends of the Earth and Help the Aged brought a claim for judicial review against the Secretary of State alleging a continuing failure to perform his duties in the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000. The case was dismissed on 23 October. The Government remain committed to tackling fuel poverty. While recent energy prices have made the challenge more difficult, we keep the position under constant examination and develop our approach as the situation changes.</p>
