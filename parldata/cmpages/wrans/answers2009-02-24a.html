<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]:</i> We work hard to maintain and build links with our neighbours within the EU, both on a bilateral basis and through European Union institutions. The websites of our embassies to European neighbours such as Ireland, Germany and France detail recent developments on bilateral co-operation. Furthermore, through the EU we regularly meet with EU members at Prime Ministerial, ministerial and official level. The EU today is a unique partnership in which countries work closely together for the benefit of all their citizens, where collective and co-ordinated initiatives can be more effective than individual state action.</p>

 The political situation is undoubtedly complex. Our first priority is to ensure the Gaza population receives humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials, and so we have made available &#163;26.8 million for the relief operation and are pressing Israel to open the crossings more fully. The Egyptian efforts to embed the ceasefire and to bridge the divide in Palestinian politics are at the heart of improving the political situation. We strongly support their efforts. I am travelling to Cairo today to discuss Gaza&#151;and other issues&#151;with Egypt.</p>
