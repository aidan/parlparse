<a name="00207w01.html_wqn0"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what support the Government gives to the work of the East-West Detox organisation in combating heroin addiction; and if she will make a statement.  [108586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The commissioning of services for drug misusers is essentially a matter for local agencies. The East-West Detox organisation receives no financial support from the Berkshire Health Authority. Health authorities and local authorities will receive an extra &#163;70.5 million from 1999 to 2002 to commission and develop drug treatment services. The Government believe that a range of treatments should be available to allow drug misusers to benefit from those most appropriate to their needs and abstinence should be the primary aim of treatment.

 Decisions about the publication of information about internal Departmental histories are a matter for the Department concerned.

Publication of the studies and information about them is therefore better decided when studies are completed and can be assessed.

 In the cases mentioned by my hon. Friend, the Privy Council is acting as part of the judicial structure of the independent state concerned, and not of the United Kingdom.

But we are determined to take a long-term view; it would be wrong to let short-term pressures lead back to policies which produced boom and bust in the past. Short-term fixes would be the biggest threat of all to industry, creating the illusion of temporary relief followed by the reality of long-term damage. The Government's economic policies are aimed at achieving sustained growth.

 Under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, the operators of nuclear facilities in the UK are required to hold third party liability insurance to cover up to &#163;140 million of damage resulting from accidents in nuclear installations. In the event of a severe nuclear accident in the UK, supplementary compensation would be made available in addition to this under the Brussels Convention Supplementary to the Paris Convention, providing an amount of compensation totalling &#163;300 million Special Drawing Rights of the IMF. We are currently considering substantial increases in the amount of compensation available under the Act.

 After a lengthy inter-departmental consultation, I have concluded that the UK should not become a signatory to the UNIDROIT convention due to conflicts with our current law. In order to implement the convention, changes to our limitation periods and to our personal property law would be required, resulting in a special regime for cultural objects and arguably a less generous position for original rightful owners of objects which are later stolen. I will, however, be considering the possible options for an alternative legislative approach which would share some of the objectives of the UNIDROIT Convention.

 On a normal weekday Connex run approximately 3,500 trains. On 25 January they planned to run 449 trains under an emergency timetable, but actually ran 697. Due to the way in which the emergency

 The Government reached a settlement with the Trustees of the NBC Pension Fund in July last year. Responsibility for deciding on, and implementing, the distribution of the settlement now rests entirely with the NBC pension trustees who are independent of the Government. However, I have written to the Trustees to express my deep concern about the time it is taking to resolve this issue. I understand that the Trustees intend to make initial payments to some 8,000 older pensioners in March and April. They are urgently investigating the feasibility of making an initial payment to other pensioners as soon as possible.

 Civilians, including foreign nationals, based in the UK and overseas, played a vital role in supporting British Forces during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, but the precise number seconded (that is attached to British Forces) has not been determined. However, a review of Ministry of Defence (MOD) records shows that on 22 February 1991, 931 MOD civilian staff were reported as being in the Gulf theatre, but not all were working in direct support of British Forces. Of these, 785 were members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In addition, there were a significant number of civilian contractors' employees working in direct support of British Forces in the Gulf theatre. My Department conservatively estimates that the number of civilian contractors' employees involved would have been in excess of 1,000 people.
<P>

<a name="00207w07.html_para0">All civilians (including contractors) serving with any part of British Forces who were on active service would have been subject to military discipline.
<P>

<a name="00207w07.html_para1">The MOD does not normally purchase insurance. In accordance with Treasury guidelines and in common with other Government Departments, the MOD underwrites its own financial risks and pays claims for compensation directly out of current expenditure. When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the MOD has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so. No insurance would have been purchased by the MOD covering British civilians seconded or contracted to British Forces during the Gulf conflict. This would be a matter for the employing organisations and the individuals themselves. The MOD would expect the cost of any insurance to be reflected in the contract price.

Of this, expenditure of some &#163;11 million has been approved so far to fund measures aimed at increasing the laser shot rate, and initial feasibility work related to the second target chamber. Decisions on future UK investment will depend largely on the outcome of the feasibility study, which will also take into account the US Government's assessment of the status of the NIF project.

<i>Official Report, </i>column 383W, on how many occasions he has used Exemption 7 of the Code of Access to Government Information in the past 12 months; and for what reason he used it in relation to the sale of the Old Ranges in Shoeburyness.  [108226]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2000]:</i> Of 3,097 Parliamentary Questions answered in the past 12 months, information was withheld under Exemption 7 of the Code of Access to Government Information on 5 occasions. This exemption was used in relation to the sale of Old Ranges in Shoeburyness to protect commercially sensitive information which could have prejudiced negotiations with the prospective purchaser.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason there were more crashes of RAF aircraft in 1999 than in 1998 and 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [108360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w08.html_spnew9"><B>  Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The number of RAF aircraft accidents in 1999 went against the trend in the accident rate, which has been one of overall decline over the past 10 years. Fluctuations in this trend have occurred before, and we will be looking carefully to see whether there is any significance in last year's pattern of accidents. Initial investigations into the accidents have shown no common causal link.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w08.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Collins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will initiate an inquiry into the reasons for the higher incidence of crashes of RAF aircraft in 1999; and if he will make a statement.  [108362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w08.html_spnew10"><B>  Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As is normal practice, a RAF Board of Inquiry has been convened to carry out a full investigation and establish the cause of each crash. Once all the Inquiries have been completed, their reports will be scrutinised in depth to see whether any overall causal link may be established. Initial investigations indicate no common cause.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w08.html_spnew11"><B>  Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Assessment of the standards of training of RAF pilots is a continuous process. Pass rates are examined to ensure that they are correctly set in order that only suitable candidates graduate to the next stage of training and, eventually, to the front-line. Course syllabi are subject to review by both staff and students at the end of each course.
<P>

<a name="00207w08.html_para0">Last year the RAF adopted the Integrated Training Quality Management System; this assesses the efficacy of the flying training system by questioning pilots at each stage of the training on the suitability of the preceding course in preparing them for the next stage of training.

 The new arrangements for learning and skills will cut through the present duplication and bureaucracy and will secure savings of at least &#163;50 million a year across post 16 learning, which will be invested in improving the quality of learning. The savings come from two main sources. Nearly &#163;15 million will be saved because Government Offices for the regions will no longer need to contract with 72 TECs. The remainder will come partly from operating through fewer local branches--47 instead of 72, and partly from operating through more efficient systems, with less negotiation and contracting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the application of TUPE as it affects existing employees of <i>(a)</i> TECs and <i>(b)</i> the FEFC; and what steps he is taking to encourage a smooth transition of essential staff to the new local learning and skills councils. [107646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w10.html_spnew1"><B>  Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 In respect of TECs, their functions are being split several ways; some will transfer to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), some to the Employment Service and some to other bodies. We expect a significant proportion of TEC staff to transfer under TUPE to these organisations. In respect of the FEFC, some functions transfer to the LSC, some to the Adult Learning Inspectorate and some to OFSTED. Again we expect the majority of staff to transfer under TUPE to these organisations.
<P>

<a name="00207w10.html_para0">We are working closely with partner organisations to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements.

<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2000 : Column: 38W</I><P>
Many of the partnerships also focus on staff development, through joint INSET training, sharing ideas on curriculum development and classroom observation. Some involve joint teaching, particularly in minority subject areas, to provide a broader curriculum for pupils and a wider experience base for teachers in both sectors; but information is not collected specifically on the number of state school pupils taught by independent school staff.

 New Deal is not a job creation scheme. It is designed to help unemployed people improve their skills and compete effectively for vacancies. The latest figures to the end of October 1999 show that this policy is working; in the Blyth Valley constituency, 329 people have found employment through the New Deal (275 young people under the New Deal for young people and 54 people through the New Deal for long term unemployed adults).
<P>

<a name="00207w10.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Ronnie Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the destination of those who have left the New Deal for those aged 18 to 24 years (a) at the time at which they left the New Deal, (b) 13 weeks after leaving the New Deal and (c) 26 weeks after leaving the New Deal, for the parliamentary constituency of Blyth Valley.  [106826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w10.html_spnew7"><B>  Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The table summarises the immediate destinations of the 392 young people who have left the New Deal in Blyth Valley. In addition to those recorded as leaving for unsubsidised employment, many of those recorded as leaving for unknown destinations will have found work but not told the Employment Service.

 At present there are two postgraduate courses in nuclear engineering. These are at the University of Birmingham and the Royal Naval College.

 As independent bodies, higher education institutions appoint their own staff. Like other employers, they are responsible for implementing equal opportunities legislation and fair employment policies. My right hon. Friend has asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England to ensure that all higher education institutions have equal opportunity policy statements and that they are accountable for their implementation. He has also asked the Council to encourage institutions to give proper emphasis to racial equality in their policy statements.

 The Secretary of State and I announced on 3 February a major new advice, guidance and support service for all 13 to 19-year-olds, called the Connexions Service. This will be a universal service but with intensive help for those in greatest need. It will be at the heart of the Government's strategy to prepare all young people for a successful adult and working life.

<a name="00207w11.html_para0">My Department also works through the two relevant employer-led National Training Organisations (National Textile Training Organisation (NTTO) and CAPITB, the NTO for the Clothing Sector).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w11.html_spnew1"><B>  Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The National Training Organisations for the Textile and Clothing industries (NTTO and CAPITB) are refocusing their work in line with the restructuring of the industries, both bodies having recognised that although the demand for traditional skills is declining there is increased demand for specialist skills. Competitive success depends on the development of such skills with marketing very much to the fore. My Department is encouraging the National Textile Training Organisation and CAPITB, the National Training Organisation for the Clothing and Apparel industries, to develop Skills Foresight for their industries. Skills Foresight involves the collection of skills intelligence in a conscious and planned manner, engaging directly with employers. My Department will help the employer-led NTOs to use this intelligence as the basis for Workforce Development Plans, reviewing the study of education and training to meet the ends identified by Skills Foresight, establishing the necessary partnership arrangements needed to ensure the skill needs of employers and individuals are met and ensuring their plans link to the expected strategies of the Learning and Skills Councils, nationally and locally. In addition the Government support the Apparel and Textile Challenge whose activities include developing marketing skills among textiles and clothing suppliers. We also support the raising of the profile and marketing of "generic brands" such as Scottish Cashmere.

 There are no specific police powers relating to crowd control or safety for events on private land. For an organised entertainment event where there are no trespassers, the local authority for the area would be the lead body to ensure public safety, and fire and police services would also be consulted with regard to both safety and emergency planning. Once this consultation has been completed, the local authority can issue a Public Entertainments Licence under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.

 The enforcement of road traffic law is an operational matter for chief officers of police. The legislative provisions governing the removal of vehicles are contained in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978 and the Disposal of Vehicle Regulations 1986. Under the 1986 Regulations, the police have powers to remove vehicles abandoned without lawful authority which are left in breach of local traffic regulation orders or left where they are causing an obstruction or likely to cause a danger. In these circumstances, removal would be arranged as soon as possible.

<P>

<a name="00207w12.html_para1">This provides a total cost to date of &#163;4.238 million. I explained in the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford) on 23 July 1999, <i>Official Report, </i>column 729W, the Metropolitan police service are, in accordance with section 49(5) of the Police Act 1996, meeting the full costs of setting up and establishing the inquiry, together with all costs which directly accrued from Part 1 of the inquiry relating to the police investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. These costs amount to &#163;3.1 million to date of the total costs. The costs of Part 2 of the inquiry, on the future handling of racially motivated crime, will be met by the Home Office as the findings were of more general application.
<P>

<a name="00207w12.html_para2">Arrangements had been made to reimburse the costs arising from the need of 18 families and individuals to be moved by Greenwich Council or to sell their houses as a result of the inquiry's error in publishing Appendix 11 of the inquiry's report in full. The final amount is not yet known but is likely to be about &#163;350,000, which is significantly less than the estimate given in that earlier reply.
<P>

<a name="00207w12.html_para3">I made it clear in the Action Plan I published in March 1999 in response to the inquiry's report that the changes required by the inquiry will work only if they are systemic and implemented within the mainstream of the police service at every level. We have recognised the need for proper investment in the police service to help achieve 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2000 : Column: 46W</I><P>
that, which is why we are investing an extra &#163;1.24 billion in policing over three years following the comprehensive spending review. Several of the changes called for by the report, including some of the most far-reaching, require further study or piloting before they can be implemented on a national basis. It is not, therefore, possible at present to give an overall figure for the costs of implementing the report's recommendations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the total cost of dealing with asylum seeking was in (a) 1997-98 and (b) 1998-99; and what the budgeted and estimated figures are for (i) 1999-2000 and (ii) 2000-01 respectively.  [108159]<P>

<P>
<a name="00207w12.html_spnew1"><B>  Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Figures and estimates are available for the cost of providing support to asylum seekers and the cost of operating the immigration and nationality directorate, which includes dealing with asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="00207w12.html_para4">In 1997-98, the total cost of operating the immigration and nationality directorate was &#163;215 million. A further &#163;375 million was provided for supporting asylum seekers by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health. In 1998-99, the total cost of operating the immigration and nationality directorate was &#163;209 million. A further &#163;470 million was provided by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health for the support of asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="00207w12.html_para5">Responsibility for the budget for supporting asylum seekers transferred to the Home Office from April 1999. It is anticipated that the total cost of operating the immigration and nationality directorate and supporting asylum seekers for the financial year 1999-2000 will be in the region of around &#163;800 million. Estimating costs for 2000-01 is subject to a large number of variables such as the level of new asylum applications, the speed of processing claims and the resources directed at processing cases and other work. Those estimates are currently under review.

In addition, the Government are making available &#163;35 million in 2000-01 as part of the crime fighting fund to recruit 5,000 police officers over and above the number forces would otherwise have recruited over the three years from April 2000. Additional funding will be available in the following two years. All forces will receive a share.

<a name="00207w13.html_spnew0"><B>  Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As a key part of the Government's wide-ranging reforms of the youth justice system the Prison Service is developing a distinct estate for under-18-year-old boys. This forms part of a wider strategy, overseen by the new Youth Justice Board, to improve the coherence of the juvenile secure estate and drive up standards. Initially the estate will consist of 13 establishments, but the Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board have drawn up a strategy for securing further improvements in due course.
<P>

<a name="00207w13.html_para0">One area targeted for improvement is the provision of places in London and the south-east. To ensure that boys from the region can be held closer to home, the option of including Blantyre House within the under-18 estate has been considered. However, the proposal is contingent upon the availability of resources and trends in the prison population and it is not possible to say when a final decision will be taken. In determining Blantyre House's future, the Prison Service will seek to weigh up all the competing strategic needs. This will include the role that Blantyre House currently fulfils as a resettlement establishment.

I am replying to Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.

The information requested is not currently held. However, as part of the Child Support Reforms fraud is a major issue and tough sanctions are proposed for those parents who deliberately supply false information.

Dealing with fraud allows us to play a full part in the Government's plans for tackling fraud and incorrectness, in a way that fits in with our priorities and the Government's proposed reform.

CSA is developing a child support programme review (to determine the level of fraud) and an anti-fraud strategy which will work hand in hand with the Agency's improvements to service delivery.
<BR>
The Agency intends, as part of the CSR reforms, to appoint full time inspectors and issue penalty notices to uncooperative parents and employers. It will also introduce a fraud training and awareness package for all CSA staff., along with clear operational procedures.
<BR>
The current sanctions available to the Agency will be reviewed and a Head of Security will be appointed together with a small team of highly skilled staff to develop and continue the security strategy.
<BR>
To ensure that the security strategy is working, we propose to seek assurance through internal audit, external assistance by BFI and by benchmarking security with other organisations.

I hope that this is helpful.

<P>

<a name="00207w15.html_para4">In the case of Jobseeker's Allowance and certain Training Allowances, benefit will be withdrawn.

The conditions for receiving a hardship payment will be broadly similar to those currently applied to people who are subject to an employment sanction.

 No. The provisions of the compensation recovery scheme apply to miners and miners' widows in the same way as they do for other victims of accident, injury or disease. The compensation recovery scheme is intended to ensure that victims do not receive double compensation for the same need.
<P>

<a name="00207w15.html_para8">Compensation paid in respect of loss of past earnings, cost of past care or loss of past mobility is therefore reduced to take account of benefits paid, but only for a maximum period of five years from the date of claim to benefit in respect of the disease. Whether miners see a reduction in the amount of compensation they actually receive, therefore, will depend on the make-up of their compensation payment. However, compensation awarded to miners and miners' widows in respect of pain and suffering will be paid at the full amount awarded under the terms of the handling agreement and is not subject to any deduction.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2000]:</i> The administrative cost of making benefit payments through automated credit transfer (ACT) is a small fraction of the cost of other methods. For example, it costs 49p every time an order book foil is presented, and 79p per giro cashed, against 1p for each ACT payment. We expect savings in administrative costs of &#163;400 million a year when ACT becomes the norm.
<P>

<a name="00207w16.html_para1">Under and over-payment of benefit may occur for a number of reasons. I am aware of only one occasion (involving nearly 112,000 customers being overpaid a total of about &#163;10.5 million) where the ACT process itself has been the cause of under or over-payment. The Benefits Agency is taking urgent steps to recover the money and to ensure it does not happen again.

 The Funeral Payment scheme was revised in April 1997 to make it easier to understand and to increase the level of help available to eligible people. The previous provision was complex, making it difficult for claimants to work out how much was allowable for individual items which were specified in regulations, and this led to inconsistent decision making. Further changes were made in November 1997 and again in January of this year. The latest revision has reduced the complexity of the scheme further by setting out more clearly the arrangements for meeting burial and cremation charges.
<P>

<a name="00207w16.html_para2">Under current legislation, therefore, where an eligible person is deemed to have good reason for taking responsibility for funeral expenses, the scheme allows for the fees levied by the burial authorities and crematoria (in so far as it is necessary to incur them), specified travel expenses and up to &#163;600 for any other funeral expenses.

 Administration of benefits and recovery of overpayments is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency, Peter Mathison. He will write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="00207w16.html_para7"><i>Letter from Mark Fisher to Mr. Paul Burstow, dated 4 February 2000:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked Peter Mathison to respond to your recent questions about overpaid benefits. As he is unavailable I am replying on his behalf.
<BR>
The Benefits Agency (BA) aims to obtain the recovery of overpayments as quickly and efficiently as possible by the most cost-effective method, without causing hardship, and in accordance with Government Accounting and Departmental Policy.
<BR>
The BA spent &#163;44m on recovering overpayments in the period April to December 1999. A monthly breakdown of this figure is set out in the attached appendix. Some of the information is not available in the format requested. For example, the BA does not break this down by benefit or by the number of overpayments recovered. Prior to April 1999, the BA did not separately identify costs relating purely to overpayment recovery across the whole BA.
<BR>
The BA captures information on the value of recoveries made. The number of overpayments arising during 1998/99 totalled just over one million, and 707,000 have been raised so far this year. A 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>7 Feb 2000 : Column: 61W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>monthly breakdown of the recovery figures for the last 12 months is attached, they also provide a breakdown showing Income Support (IS) and all benefits (including IS) as you have requested.
<BR>
The BA does not normally seek repayment of overpayments less than &#163;25. This is based on cost-effectiveness and in line with Government Accounting. However, there may be occasions when this is not adhered to, for example, when the overpayment has been quickly identified and the sum to be recovered is still likely to be held by the claimant and easily recoverable.
<BR>
The BA recovers overpayments by deductions from ongoing benefits, instalments, by a lump sum, or by civil proceedings. Typically, the BA will firstly invite repayment and in the vast majority of cases, recovery is implemented by mutual agreement between the debtor and the BA.
<BR>
Where the debtor remains in receipt of benefit and is not in a position to repay the overpayment immediately, recovery is normally pursued by deduction from ongoing benefit entitlement. This deduction can also be imposed compulsorily if no offer of repayment is forthcoming. Deductions from benefit, whether voluntary or compulsory, account for 74% of the overpayments currently being recovered.
<BR>
Where customers are not in receipt of any benefit, repayments will be expected. A person's failure to respond to an invitation to repay (or making an unreasonable offer) could lead the BA to 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>7 Feb 2000 : Column: 62W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>consider seeking recovery through a civil action. The threshold for acceptance for civil action is currently &#163;150. There is a six year time limit on proceedings.
<BR>
6.5% of overpayments currently being recovered have been subject to civil proceedings. The remaining are being recovered by other voluntary arrangements.
<BR>
Policy on civil proceedings to recover overpayments is that litigation is not pursued where the debtor remains in receipt of benefit. For those not in receipt of benefit, litigation is pursued as a last resort where voluntary arrangements are unsuccessful or break down.
<BR>
Recovery procedures follow guidance as provided in Government Accounting, where the recovery is likely to be detrimental to the health and/or welfare of the debtor or a member of their family, the Secretary of State has the power to exercise discretion and abandon recovery.
<BR>
Recovery of an overpayment arising as a result of an official error is pursued if the overpayment is identified quickly and it is reasonable to expect the customer to have been aware of the overpayment. Duplicate payments are classed as over provisions of benefit and are recoverable under common law. The Secretary of State has a duty to seek recovery of such overpayments where it is cost effective to do so.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is the cost of providing temporary operating theatres at the NHS site at Ronkswood, Worcester.  [104035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w17.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The cost of providing additional theatre capacity at the Ronkswood site of the Worcester Royal Infirmary National Health Service Trust is &#163;491,000, forming part of an overall development of &#163;1,699,000. The development, which enables certain services to be transferred from the Castle Street site in Worcester, will generate savings of &#163;1,728,000 over a three-year period, thereby paying back the capital investment.
<P>

<a name="00207w17.html_para0">The development addresses a number of clinical safety issues, including the current separation of accident and emergency and trauma services at the Worcester Royal Infirmary, and the need for 24-hour anaesthetic cover and on-site paediatric cover.

[104640]<P>

<a name="00207w17.html_para1">In "Smoking Kills", published in December 1998, the Government announced that up to &#163;60 million would be invested over three years in National Health Service services to help smokers to quit. &#163;10 million has been invested in smoking cessation services in Health Action Zones in 1999-2000. No decision has yet been made about budgets for 2000-01 and 2001-02. It has been estimated that around 12.5 per cent. of the overall smoking cessation budget will be spent on one week's free nicotine replacement therapy for poorer smokers.

 Continuing professional development (CPD) in general practice is important. Learning must be lifelong and cannot cease at the end of formal training. To provide the best possible service to their patients general practitioners should keep up to date with advances in patient care and continually review and improve their knowledge, skills and abilities. We are considering proposals for developing CPD in primary care, building on the many examples of good work already being done by GPs and extending these principles to all primary care staff.

 An estimate of the trend in HIV/AIDS related deaths has been made by looking at the number of deaths reported by the end of the year in which they occurred for the last decade. Since 1990 the number of HIV/AIDS related deaths rose each year until 1994 and then declined so that in 1998 they were less than a third of those in the mid-1990s. This decrease was maintained in 1999, but without further decline from the 1998 number of deaths.

 Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is the most common form of spongiform encephalopathy in people, with an incidence in the United Kingdom and world-wide of approximately one per million of the population, per year. For variant CJD--the form of CJD linked to exposure to the BSE agent--a total of 52 definite or probable cases have so far been confirmed in the UK. The Department publish data on the incidence of all types of CJD in a monthly press release. The next one will be issued Monday 7 February. Copies will be available in the Library.

 Progressively over the last two years the blood service has become more integrated into the National Health Service, building a partnership to ensure a high standard of patient care.

<P>

<a name="00207w19.html_para0">To ensure that there continues to be an adequate and safe supply of blood used effectively in first class transfusion practice, we required NHS trusts to ensure from March 1999 that hospital transfusion committees were in place to oversee all aspects of blood transfusion. We also required them to have agreed by March 2000 local transfusion protocols to ensure the safest and most effective use of blood and we will audit the outcome.

 Form E111 provides entitlement to immediately necessary treatment for conditions arising during a temporary visit to another European Economic Area Member state. Only a minority of emergency treatments involve major surgery. Referrals specifically for treatment of pre-existing conditions require Form E112, and each application is considered individually by the patient's health authority and by the Department. The criteria for a successful application are based on medial and social considerations. Full information is given in the Department's leaflet "Health Advice for Travellers", copies of which are available in the Library. We have received no recent representation on the subject.

 Derogations are normally permitted only to simplify the procedure for charging VAT or to prevent tax evasion or avoidance. It would therefore be inappropriate to seek a derogation for church repairs. EC law does not permit an exemption or a reduced rate for church repairs.

 For the purpose of the Over-30-months scheme the Intervention Board does not take ownership of the cattle until they are presented for slaughter, and it is at this point that eligibility for compensation is determined. Producers have the option of submitting animals into the scheme directly to abattoirs on a deadweight basis, or via auction markets who act as agents for producers in submitting animals into the scheme on a liveweight basis. At auction markets animals undergo preliminary eligibility checks, in particular weighing. A further tag is inserted in the animal's ear at this stage for ease of identification purposes only.

 As indicated in the reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith), 1 February 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 570W, we have placed in the Library of the House a copy of the Government's response to the report of the Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group. This indicates that we have accepted most of the recommendations in the report. Some of these can be implemented straight away but others will require discussions in Brussels with the EU Commission and others (including the industry) before they can be fully implemented. Nevertheless, it is our intention that this should be done as speedily as possible. From April most of the recommendations will be for the Food Standards Agency to carry forward.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the likely impact of the climate change levy on the horticulture sector; and if he will publish the results.  [107236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2000]:</i> It is not possible to say what the likely impact of the levy on the horticulture sector will be. That will depend on a number of factors including future energy consumption and what use the sector makes of electricity generated 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2000 : Column: 80W</I><P>
from 'new' renewable sources of energy or in 'good quality' combined heat and power plants. The use the sector makes of the proposed system of enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments will also have an impact. The horticultural industry, in common with other industries, will also benefit from the lower overall rates of the levy announced by the Chancellor in his pre-Budget report statement.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what progress the Environment Agency has made in implementing its action plan in response to the independent report on the Easter 1998 floods.  [109243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00207w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 While there were no further specific actions timed for completion by the end of December 1999, the Environment Agency has nevertheless kept the Ministry informed of progress up to that date.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para10">For flood forecasting, all of the Environment Agency's regions are working on delivering the first phase of their hydrometric monitoring network improvement programmes by April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para11">The work relating to flood warning is progressing well. The National Flood Warning Centre is established and the necessary relationships with other national bodies are being actively developed.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para12">Flood risk maps have been produced and were disseminated to local planning authorities and emergency planners in September 1999. The Agency is using the 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2000 : Column: 81W</I><P>
maps to identify high-risk properties on a consistent basis to aid targeting of direct warnings and public awareness material. Local authorities are using the maps for both development control and emergency planning purposes. The information in the maps will be made publicly available so that people can make informed decisions about flood risks.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para13">The Agency has further improved liaison arrangements with local authorities and emergency services, at both local and national level to ensure effective response to flooding incidents.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para14">A flood warning public awareness campaign commenced in October. Plans are being developed for revised flood warning codes to be introduced in September 2000, with appropriate publicity.

<a name="00207w21.html_para16">The Agency continues its work in implementing the recommendations in the independent report on its management and skills.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para17">I am pleased to note the Agency's continuing progress in implementing the Easter Floods report, contributing to achievement of the Ministerial priority of a seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response.
<P>

<a name="00207w21.html_para18">I shall ensure that the House is updated on progress in implementing the final phases of the Action Plan, including the introduction of new flood warning codes in September 2000.
