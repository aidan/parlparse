 Cost sharing on animal health issues between Government and industry is a key part of our Animal Health and Welfare Strategy. As there are benefits to herd owners from buying or selling cattle with additional disease assurance, it is right that they should share the cost of tests which are outside the routine surveillance programme. The Government continue to fund the provision of tuberculin and all routine surveillance testing at a cost of over &#163;40 million per annum.

This document ensures that the use of genetic information by insurance companies will be transparent, fair, and subject to independent oversight. It sets out a range of protections against the use of genetic information by insurers and puts in place until November 2011 a voluntary agreement banning the use by insurers of the results from predictive genetic tests, including tests on breast cancer genes, in deciding the premiums of insurance policies.

To date, the only test that has been approved by GAIC is for Huntington&#039;s disease for life insurance polices over &#163;500,000, and no applications for any other tests will be submitted before 2008.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60306w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The definitions of public sector and private sector pension schemes are set out in paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14 of the report &#039;Occupational pension schemes 2004: Twelfth Survey by the Government Actuary&#039;. This follows a classification used by the pension schemes registry. Exactly the same approach was adopted for the previous (2000) survey. Members of schemes are categorised according to the scheme of which they are a member, and not by the sector in which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Mar 2006 : Column 1105W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
they are employed. Those employees in both the public and private sector who are not members of occupational pension schemes are not recorded in the survey.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding the population of each <i>(a)</i> Lancashire constituency <i>(b)</i> each Ribble Valley ward according to figures from (i) the 2001 Census, (ii) most recent electoral rolls, and (iii) most recent figures for health service users; and what projections have been made for the next five years. I am replying in her absence. (55882)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">The tables attached provide the information you have requested. Data for Lancashire constituencies are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Data for Ribble Valley wards are shown in Table 3.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">Electoral rolls provide counts of the number of people registered to vote. Local/European electorate and Parliamentary electorate counts for Lancashire constituencies can be found in Table 1 The 2005 figures are the latest available data. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are a number of reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">The number of people registered with a GP, living in each Lancashire constituency, in July 2004, can also be found in Table 1. It should also be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">The projections in Table 2 for mid-2006 to mid-2010 are based on the mid-2003 population estimates and are the latest population projections available. They assume that trends in fertility, mortality and migration at the time of the mid-2003 population estimate will continue into the future. Population projections are not available for most of the Lancashire constituencies because projections are not routinely produced for constituencies. Local Authority population projections are however produced, and where constituency projections are shown, this reflects that these constituencies have common boundaries with local authority districts.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">Ward data are shown in Table 3; the points set out above also apply to wards. However, there are some further points to note for wards. The local government electorate is definitionally closer to the population estimates; however these data are not available at ward level. Hence, the Parliamentary electorate is shown, the most recent data available are for December 2004.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps were taken to ensure the seafood purification plant project in Warrenpoint does not duplicate services provided by other Government-funded projects in Northern Ireland.  [54648]</p>








<p><a name="st_152"><a name="60306w16.html_spnew8"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The shellfish purification plant currently under construction at Warrenpoint will be the first such public facility of its kind in the Carlingford Lough region. This is an important part of the reconstruction of Warrenpoint harbour area being undertaken with assistance from the Interreg Programme to provide safe, modern facilities for mussel dredgers using the Lough. Since this will be the only public shellfish purification unit in the area, there is no duplication with any other grant-aided projects.

These changes have been cosmetic and do not reduce the number of officers available for front-line duties in each of the BCUs.

If he does not do so, the police will then normally authorise the vehicle&#039;s disposal. In cases where after taking reasonable steps the police have not been able to notify the owner of the recovery of his stolen vehicle, they will normally authorise its disposal on a date not less than 14 working days after the date of its recovery.

The Actual Average Clearance Times (AACT) for JSA is measured from the date the customer first contacts Jobcentre Plus to the date the customer is sent a notice of entitlement. The performance of AACT for JSA has increased nationally from 11 days in April 04 to 15 days in December 05. Initial analysis showed that shortfalls in performance in the &#039;initial contact&#039; part of the process were critical. Delays in contact centres and local service outlets were a contributory factor to the situation as well as the time it can take to gather evidence from third parties before claims can be processed.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">Some of our customers did experience problems getting through to our contact centres over the Summer months. Robust plans were put in place to address this, which resulted in week on week improvements. The most recent performance information for our contact centres shows that in the week ending 3rd February we answered over 94 percent of calls offered.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">To address the issue of fluctuating clearance times in benefit processing a taskforce has developed immediate recovery measures. Building on the taskforce&#039;s work, the Jobcentre Plus Chief Operating Officer launched a National Action Plan in the week commencing 30 January. The Action Plan is built around a mandatory series of health checks&quot;, taking local managers through the whole end to end process, identifying key risk elements and, where a part of the process fails the health check, directing managers to appropriate good practice products and tool-kits. Regular reviews are undertaken to ensure areas of our business do not fall below expectation. We are already seeing improvements following the introduction of these measures.</p>

 It was always our intention to phase the introduction of the regulations needed to implement the Pensions Act 2004. The majority of these regulations have been or will be published broadly on the time scale envisaged&#151;in some cases following consultation. They will come into force in time to ensure the measures in the Act come into effect as intended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60306w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_128">A number of sets of regulations came into force on 30 December 2005 which related to the European Directive on Occupational Pensions (Directive 2003/41/EC). These regulations had initially been expected to be in place by 23 September 2005, in line with the overall timetable for implementing the directive. The delay was necessary in order to take account of the issues raised following extensive consultation earlier in the year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60306w22.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_129">There has also been a delay to our planned timetable for the introduction of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2006. Consultation on the regulations raised a large number of helpful technical comments that need to be carefully considered. Therefore, although these regulations were scheduled for April 2006, they will now come into effect in October 2006. The delay will not have any untoward effects on schemes, as the existing regulations will still apply.

<a name="stpa_130">The Pension Regulator can only publish supporting codes of practice when the relevant regulations have been made and laid.

 The British overseas territories (as listed in annex II to the EC Treaty) were consulted between 1991 and 1995 by the United Kingdom when the WTO was being negotiated as to whether they wished to be covered by it.

 Each fire and rescue authority and county council who have responsibility for the provision of fire services set their own budgets.

Figures for the allocations of formula grant for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 to each authority with fire and rescue responsibilities were laid before the House on 31 January 2006 and are also available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website at: http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/0607/grant.htm

<a name="stpa_153">However, figures on reported budgets at the beginning of each year and total service expenditure, which shows actual expenditure in the year are available. The figures provided are based on the total service expenditure. This is the only definition for which figures are available on a consistent basis from 2000&#150;01 to 2005&#150;06. This is because fire authorities in shire areas were financed largely by contributions from county councils and unitary authorities in their area before 2004&#150;05, and these amounts were netted off under all the other definitions. Since 2005&#150;06 fire authorities have been able to finance their budget directly. Year-on-year percentage change in real terms has been calculated using the HM Treasury&#039;s GDP deflators.

<a name="60306w29.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_163">There remains a great deal to do to secure full respect for human rights in Uganda. We are particularly concerned by the situation in northern Uganda. As a result of the long-running conflict, 1.7 million people are living in appalling conditions in internally displaced peoples&#039; camps and over 20,000 children have been abducted by the rebel Lord&#039;s Resistance Army since 1988.

In June 2005, the constitutional court ruled that mandatory death sentences were unconstitutional. Uganda benefits from an independent judiciary and a relatively free press but concerns do remain regarding restrictions on political freedom and reports of arbitrary detention and torture.

There have been some welcome steps, albeit limited, by the government of Uzbekistan to implement their national action plan on torture based on international recommendations; and President Karimov has announced plans to abolish the death penalty by 1 January 2008. However, overall there has been a clear deterioration in the human rights situation in Uzbekistan. The arbitrary arrest, detention and trials of eye-witnesses to the events in Andizhan of 12&#150;13 May 2005 have been accompanied by increasing restrictions on freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion, by a continuing refusal to register political parties, and by ongoing harassment, detention and trial of human rights defenders, journalists and others.

 We have received reports that Shearia and its surrounding villages, along with other areas in North and South Sudan, have in the last two weeks been subjected to fighting between forces of the Government of Sudan and elements of the Sudan Liberation Army/Movement (SLA/M). The African Union Mission in Sudan is investigating the series of incidents which, if reports are verified, would constitute violations of the Abuja Security and Humanitarian Protocols.

Reports indicate that during the attack, three villagers were killed and a number of others wounded. It was reported that the militias also looted over 600 camels. We have had no specific reports of Amar Jadeed being targeted during the recent fighting.

 The Government of Sudan (GoS) continues to fly helicopter gunships in Darfur, but it is unclear whether they have been active in attacks. The African Union is currently investigating and we await their reports. Offensive military flights by the GoS would constitute a breach of its obligations under the Abuja Security Protocol and, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591, those responsible would be liable to targeted sanctions.

We have received no reports of the Sudanese army making incursions into Chad, although we understand that rebel groups and militia from both Chad and Sudan regularly cross the border. Stability in both countries is vital for the region and we therefore welcome the peace agreement signed by the Presidents of both Sudan and Chad in Libya on 8 February. We hope the parties will work hard to honour it.

He called upon all the leaders of the rebel movements to attend the talks to demonstrate their commitment to a negotiated settlement. Minni Minnawi, the leader of one faction of the SLM/A, returned to Abuja on 20 February, his first visit to the talks since December. Our representative at the Abuja talks regularly presses the SLM/A and the Justice and Equality Movement to continue to maintain a joint negotiating position in the talks in Abuja, and to work together to achieve a peaceful solution for the people of Darfur.

 Under the Austrian Presidency, the European Commission is taking forward the negotiations following the framework agreed on 3 October 2005. It is currently screening Turkey&#039;s legislation against the EU <i>acquis</i> and has completed screening on 9 Chapters. The Commission presented its first screening reports, on Science and Research and Education and Culture, to Member States in February, concluding that Turkey is ready to open negotiations in both chapters. Following the presentation of the Commission&#039;s screening reports it is for Member States to consider whether to set benchmarks for Turkey to fulfil before the opening of chapters, and then decide whether any chapters are ready to be opened. The relevant Council Working Group has recently recommended the opening of the Science and Research Chapter and we expect this to happen during the Austrian Presidency.

<a name="stpa_186">The decision to reduce the length of the deployment in 2006 was taken following a review of the Royal Navy&#039;s standing tasks and commitments. This was explained in the Government&#039;s response to the House of Commons Defence Committee&#039;s Fourth Report of Session 2004&#150;05 on the &#039;Future Capabilities&#039; Command Paper.

Notes:<br>

General<br>

All diagnoses of patients for cerebral palsy (ICD-10 G80 infantile cerebral palsy).<br>

Age of start of episodes = under 17.<br>





Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier Hospital Episodes Statistics identification HESID. This identifier is derived based on the patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

All diagnoses count of patients<br>

These figures represent a count of all patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 200203) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnoses<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

PCT, SHA data quality<br>

PCT and SHA data were added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on the PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;87 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls, that is the data are ungrossed.<br>

The published registration figures reflect those children who attend a national health service dentist at least once within the most recent 15-month period and therefore exclude some children who attend less regularly than every 15 months. The level of registrations will also be affected by parents&#039; perception of whether their children need to have dental treatment, by the availability of NHS dentistry in some areas and by the decision of some parents to choose private treatment for their children.

 Delayed transfers of care have been a priority area for action since 2001 when the health and social care change agent team was created specifically to help local health and social care communities tackle the problem. Delays in the acute sector have fallen since then by over 65 per cent. by December 2005, releasing about 1.5 million bed days a year. Delayed transfers of care are an issue for the whole health and social care system and require concerted action from all parties&#151; acute sector, primary care trusts, local authorities and the voluntary and independent sector&#151;to make sure people get the right care at the right time in the right place. They are expected to work together to agree how resources, such as the delayed discharges grant to local authorities, can be invested to develop services that enable people to be treated at home wherever possible or close to home in intermediate care or other rehabilitation services. The reimbursement scheme provides financial incentives to local authorities to complete their assessments quickly and enable people to move from acute hospital beds at the optimum time. The Government is currently considering an extension to reimbursement to non acute and mental health sectors.

 Since it went live in April 2002, the Communication Aids Project has assisted some 4,000 children of school age experiencing significant difficulty in communicating with those around them. The project has been successful but we have always made it clear, through the referral process and otherwise, that CAP was there to supplement, and not replace, provision made locally. The present tranche of funding is time-limited and comes to an end in March 2006. With other pressures on funding arising from the Government&#039;s ambitious agenda for education, it has not been possible to extend the funding for CAP.

 The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture Media and Sport are jointly implementing the national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy in England. In the five years to 2008 over &#163;1.5 billion is being invested (including &#163;686 million lottery funding) to implement the strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60306w45.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_288">The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60306w45.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_289">Spearheading this strategy is the creation of a national PE/sports infrastructure, by establishing a network of Sports Colleges and School Sport Partnerships (families of schools which work together). There are currently 411 live partnerships incorporating 80 per cent. of schools in England. The 2004/05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils within a School Sport Partnership were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. In 2003/04 this figure was 62 per cent.

We are engaged in early discussions with a number of other organisations, including some hgher education ienstitutions in the North West and will release information about them once they have agreed to be involved in a pathfinder (except in cases where release might prejudice discussions with stakeholders in the project) or if they have agreed to be publicly named as working with the Government to develop the trust school model.

<p><a name="st_413"><a name="60306w46.html_spnew6"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 It will be for individual school governing bodies to decide, following consultation with parents and other stakeholders, whether they want to acquire a Trust and choose whom they want to work with to support them. However there will be safeguards. All Trusts must be charities and the consultation will need to set out who the members of the charity will be. Local Authorities will be able to refer plans to acquire a Trust to the Schools Adjudicator if it is clear the school has not consulted properly, or if they are concerned that the acquisition of the trust would have a negative impact on school standards.

<p>
<a name="60306w46.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_299">Certain categories of people will not be allowed to be involved in a trust. These will include those disqualified under company or charity law and those who have been disqualified from working with children and young people. If enacted, the Education and Inspections Bill will also put into place other safeguards. It would give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations prescribing requirements as to persons to be disqualified from acting as charity Trustees. In addition, it would give the Secretary of State a reserve power, in prescribed cases, to remove any charity Trustee, even if the person is not otherwise disqualified, and to appoint charity Trustees.
