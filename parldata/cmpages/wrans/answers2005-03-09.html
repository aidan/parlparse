<p><a name="50309w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Pay and leave entitlements in cases of transfer are negotiated on an individual basis within the relevant Department&#039;s framework. The terms may vary depending on the type of transfer involved which may be a secondment, loan or permanent transfer.

<p>
<a name="50309w01.html_para0">
There are no significant differences between the pension schemes for the Northern Ireland and home civil service and individuals can transfer their pension rights between the two schemes. As both schemes are members of the Public Sector Transfer Club previous service will be fully recognised for pension purposes if the individual transfers their benefits on club terms.

 In order to create an internal environment more attractive to private investors the UK is working closely with international partners to provide support to invigorate the Palestinian Authority&#039;s (PA) programmes of governance reforms. Specific UK assistance includes support for the PA&#039;s budget, a wide-ranging programme of public administration and civil service reform, and support for the civil police.

 In view of the poor governance in Zimbabwe and the intransigence of her Government towards constructive dialogue with the international community, most donors, including the UK, have suspended conventional development programmes and now focus on humanitarian and HIV/AIDS programmes. In 2003&#150;04 DFID spent &#163;34 million on such programmes and expect to spend &#163;25 million in the current financial year. The main areas of our support include HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and mitigation and direct support to some 1.5 million of the poorest households in the country, in the form of food, seeds and fertilisers.

Since that statement we have provided an additional &#163;30,000 in materials.

Of the public utilities only the provision of piped water was affected. Pumping stations and distribution networks were severely affected in many areas. This service is now getting back to normal. The management improvements at &quot;Guyana Water Incorporated&quot; provided through the water reform programme ensured an effective response to the flood situation. This programme was funded by DFID and others to improve the supply of potable water. There are sufficient resources in place, and sufficient capacity, to undertake the necessary ongoing repairs. Oxfam have been working very closely with the water utility to ensure the supply of potable water during and after the crisis.

<a name="50309w02.html_para8">
The Guyanese Drainage and Irrigation Board, supported by UN sourced experts, have identified a set of emergency works to be undertaken on the water management system damaged by the floods. This work is urgent as there are fears that this system was compromised by the floods, and might fail in the main May/June rains. DFID are now in the process of finalising assistance to support implementation of these emergency restoration works. In conjunction with United Nations Development Programme we are funding the cost of a Dutch expert to assist the Government of Guyana in overseeing the emergency rehabilitation of the water management system.

 International commitments made at Monterrey (2002), Rome (2003) and the recent High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Paris require both bilateral and multilateral donors to use their assistance in support of countries&#039; own priorities. DFID&#039;s country programmes are governed by Country Assistance Plans, which are agreed with partners and demonstrate how DFID will support their own poverty reduction plans. On 2 March, I published a new policy paper &quot;Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: Rethinking Conditionality&quot;, which emphasises our commitment to partner country leadership in setting their developing policies, and states that we will not seek to influence policy choices by use of aid conditions. DFID works closely with multilateral agencies, at both headquarters and country level, to ensure their procedures and practice promote alignment.

<p><a name="50309w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) advises that the findings of the Road Traffic Accident (RTA) study should not be disclosed at present to avoid either encouraging illegal action against badgers or deterring participation in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). However, information on the location of badgers where TB is diagnosed is released to divisional veterinary managers to inform the measures they take with respect to disease control in cattle in the vicinity.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the breeding population of cormorants <i>(a)</i> in England and <i>(b)</i> on inland waters in England. [214689]</p>




<p><a name="50309w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The latest estimate of breeding cormorants in the UK and Ireland is provided by the Seabird 2000 survey. These data indicate that there are 3,145 breeding pairs of cormorants in England (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man). This includes the majority of the estimated 1,646 breeding pairs of cormorants at inland colonies in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w05.html_para1">
UK coastal colonies are dispersed more widely, with many birds breeding in Wales and Scotland. However, many of the coastal breeding birds from all parts of the UK, and their progeny, move onto inland fisheries in England and Wales in the winter and these, together with significant immigration of wintering birds from the continent, give rise to elevated numbers inland during winter. The winter cormorant population in the UK has increased four fold in the last 25 years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the level of common agricultural policy production subsidies in the EU, including those retained under the national envelope system; and what assessment she has made of the impact that they have on the agricultural markets of developing nations.  [217418]</p>




<p><a name="50309w05.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development produce an estimate of the level of subsidy provided to agricultural producers in OECD countries, the Producer Support Estimate (PSE). The latest estimate, in &quot;Agricultural Policies in OECD Countries: At a Glance, 2004&quot;, puts the EU&#039;s PSE at &#8364;108 billion or approximately 37 per cent. of output. This estimate covers all direct payments to producers under the common agricultural policy (and national schemes) including those under agri-environment measures. It also covers gross transfers to producers as a result of market price support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w05.html_para2">
Defra has not made an assessment of the impact of the CAP on developing countries&#039; agricultural markets. However there are a number of published studies which consider the effects of developed countries&#039; agricultural policy on developing countries. One such estimate is presented in the World Bank report &quot;Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries, 2002&quot;. This puts the annual benefits to developing countries (in 2015) from liberalisation of agriculture and food policies in high income countries at $99 billion (when dynamic productivity gains are included). It is important to note that developing countries are not all affected in the same way: for example the effect depends on whether the country is a net exporter or net importer of highly protected agricultural products. In addition, the magnitude of an estimate will depend, in part, on the modelling methodology used to generate it.

 In May 2003, the USA, Argentina and Canada filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against the procedures regulating the import and marketing of GMOs in the European Union. The focus of the complaints is that the EU has allegedly not been operating its own approvals system for GM products since 1998. It is alleged that this is more trade restrictive than is required to achieve the desired level of public health protection, that it is not based on proper scientific criteria, and that it unfairly discriminates between GMO and non-GMO products. The case is made against the European Commission, not individual member states, but it specifically cites Austria, France, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy and Greece.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w05.html_para3">
The Department has received correspondence from stakeholders and the public in relation to this WTO case, in the main supporting the EU regulatory position. The UK Government has also raised this issue in meetings with the US administration.

The UK Government has expressed its disappointment that this action has been taken by the USA and we are working with our EU partners to defend the case and find a solution. As with any WTO dispute we will be bound by the ruling, which will be reached after due consideration of the evidence.

 Defra supports the appropriate use of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) such as reed beds, but recognises that, at present, barriers to the implementation, adoption and maintenance of SUDS exist. In order to address these problems, Defra is a member of the &quot;The National SUDS Working Group&quot; (NSWG), of which representatives of water companies and Water UK are also members. Regular meetings of this group are held facilitating discussion between all parties interested in the implementation of SUDS. In July 2004 the NSWG published an Interim Code of Practice (ICOP) for SUDS.

 The bid company London 2012 oversaw all the arrangements for the Evaluation Commission&#039;s visit to London in February. The majority of the London 2012&#039;s funding comes from my Department and the London Development Agency, with a substantial element coming from private sponsorship and fundraising activities. I understand from London 2012 that &#163;530,000 of costs are directly attributable to the visit. This figure is largely associated with the production cost of the three days of presentations, plus hiring hotel venue space and providing technical support. A further &#163;150,000 was spent on preparations ahead of the visit.

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w07.html_para0">
<i>(a)</i> Based on figures provided by the art market it is estimated that the cost of transactions would be reduced from approximately &#163;38 per artwork if the right is managed by individual artists to approximately &#163;28 per artwork if the right is administered by a single collecting agency. The Patent Office has asked in its present consultation for views on whether collective management of resale royalties should be made compulsory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w07.html_para1">
<i>(b)</i> The directive provides an option for increasing the royalty rate paid on the first &#8364;50,000 of the sales price from 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. The UK is not currently proposing to use this option and therefore no estimate of costs based on this rate has been made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w07.html_para2">
A number of factors influence the choice of location of a sale, including the location at which the highest price will be achieved and seller&#039;s fees. It seems likely that for many sales the cost of relocating would exceed any saving on royalty and would prevent diversion. In addition, based on figures provided by the art market for the 2001&#150;02 season, the total value of the market was &#163;4,227 million and of this &#163;442 million (approximately 10 per cent.) worth of these sales would attract a royalty payment if the right was applied to works by living and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Mar 2005 : Column 1820W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
deceased artists. If the right was applied only to works by living artists &#163;64.8 million (less than 2 per cent.) worth of the total value of sales would attract a royalty payment.

 The Home Office holds records of all employers who make work permit applications to employ workers from outside the European Economic Area. Records are also held of farmers and growers who employ people under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. In addition, information is available about the employers who have recruited nationals from the new EU accession states from 1 May 2004 under the Worker Registration Scheme. Students from overseas and those entering the UK under the Working Holidaymaker Scheme may also take employment, subject to restrictions, but no records are held of the employers involved.

The Legal Services Commission (LSC) provides funding for a national helpline for Gypsies and Travellers at a cost of around &#163;50,000 a year. It is not possible to say how much of this money was spent in relation to North Essex.

<p>

In addition, legal help, which provides for basic advice and assistance, is available subject to satisfying the statutory tests of the applicant&#039;s means and the merits of the case. The LSC does not hold data on how much legal help is awarded to Gypsies and Travellers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w15.html_para6">
Legal representation at planning applications and appeals is generally outside the scope of legal aid. However, since April 2000, funding can be made available in exceptional cases under section 6(8)<i>(b)</i> of the Access to Justice Act 1999, when the relevant criteria are satisfied, for example, where the case concerns the applicant&#039;s home. This protects the applicant&#039;s fundamental rights and ensures a fair hearing. It is not possible to give a precise figure for total costs, but since April 2000, a maximum of &#163;45,000 plus VAT (excluding legal help costs) has been spent on planning applications in relation to Gypsy and Traveller encampments. None of these applications related to planning applications or appeals in North Essex.

<p><a name="50309w16.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2005]:</i> Making work pay and supporting parents in balancing their work and family responsibilities helps enable parents to participate in the labour market, which in turn is critical to tackling child poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w16.html_para2">
Since October 2004, the minimum wage (adult rate), in conjunction with the working families tax credit and other benefits have provided a guaranteed minimum income of at least &#163;252 a week for families with one child and one earner in full-time work (35 hours per week). On 25 February we announced that the minimum wage will be increased to &#163;5.05 from October 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w16.html_para3">
In 2003 we introduced a new right for parents to request a flexible working pattern. In the first year 800,000 requests were either wholly or partly accepted. In addition to this new entitlement, we extended maternity leave so most mothers can choose to take up to one year. We also introduced new rights to two weeks&#039; paid paternity leave and introduced paid adoption leave.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w16.html_para4">
On 28 February my Department published a consultation document, &quot;Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility&quot;. Through the consultation we are seeking views on the details of commitments and proposals set out in the 2004 pre-Budget report which build on the our successful package of family friendly working rights. These include extending Statutory Maternity Pay, Maternity Allowance and Statutory 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Mar 2005 : Column 1852W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Adoption Pay to nine months from April 2007 towards a goal of a year&#039;s paid leave by the end of the next Parliament, introducing a right for mothers to transfer a proportion of their maternity leave and pay to fathers, and looking at options for extending the right to request flexible working to carers of adults and to parents of older children. These measures would give families more choice about how to balance their work and caring responsibilities, supporting parents who may otherwise have been forced to drop out of the labour market to stay in work.

<p><a name="50309w20.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Commission for Integrated Transport and the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions criticised the congestion PSA targets set in 2000 on the grounds that they did not relate to specific roads and were not meaningful to road users, since they did not capture important aspects of road users experience such as journey time reliability. In the light of these concerns the Government announced in the White Paper &quot;The Future of Transport&quot; (July 2004) that it was replacing the previous targets with new ones, to be published in July 2005. In the &quot;Transport 10-Year Plan 2000: Delivering better transport&#151;progress report&quot; (December 2002) the Government said that congestion forecasts were higher than previously, largely due to higher economic growth. The report went on to say that although the measures set out in the 10-Year Plan will deliver significant reductions in projected levels of congestion, these may not be sufficient to secure a return to 2000 levels.

 Recent progress on policies and other programmes to reduce emissions from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the transport sector and other sectors was published in &quot;Review of the UK Climate Change Programme: consultation paper&quot; on 8 December 2004.

<p>
<a name="50309w20.html_para8">
Examples of measures which have led to reductions in carbon emissions from the transport sector include the Government&#039;s support for low carbon vehicles and fuels through fiscal and other incentives and support for research, development and demonstration programmes such as the New Vehicle Technology Fund. Policy measures in the transport sector alone are forecast to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 4.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w20.html_para9">
The Government expect that, as a result of their policies, carbon dioxide emissions will fall. In 2003, they are estimated to have been about 7 per cent. below 1990 levels. By 2010, they are forecast to be 14 per cent. below 1990 levels based on current projections. This figure includes only the estimated emission reductions gained from measures that are firm and funded. It does not include, for example, measures that may happen but are not yet finalised, such as a possible further round of voluntary agreements on average new car fuel efficiency between the European Commission and the automotive industry after the current agreements expire in 2008.

<p><a name="50309w22.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 As part of its range of new deal promotional materials, the Department provides a leaflet for employers about the new deal for disabled people (NDDP), which is used by Jobcentre Plus in working locally with employers. It includes case studies of and for employers and can also be used by NDDP Job Brokers as a marketing tool. The NDDP News Magazine, which is published on a quarterly basis and has a circulation of 10,000 to 15,000, also includes 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Mar 2005 : Column 1876W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
positive features on employers&#039; experiences of employing people who have found a job through NDDP and is frequently requested by Job Brokers for use in their promotional activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w22.html_para7">
The main emphasis in promoting NDDP to employers lies with individual Job Brokers. Job Broker services vary and are focused on customers&#039; requirements and the needs of the local labour market. Their marketing activities are also tailored to need, and are most likely to be primarily directed towards potential customers. Job Brokers can work directly with an employer but will only do so with the agreement of the customer concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w22.html_para8">
A key indicator of success is in the programme&#039;s achievement of job entries. Up to September 2004, over 46,000 people had gained a job through NDDP since the programme began in 2001. The Department has in place a comprehensive research programme for NDDP, designed to establish the experiences and views of the range of stakeholders, including Job Brokers, customers and employers, among others. This does not directly assess the success of Job Brokers&#039; measures to publicise the programme, but emerging findings show that employers are broadly aware of the new deal and, although less so of NDDP specifically, they are aware of Job Broker organisations in their area, where Job Brokers often advertise under their own name for their NDDP service.

 The proposed new build station at Cookstown will be located adjacent to the existing PSNI station at Molesworth Street, Cookstown.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary wrote to the Libyan Foreign Minister, Mr. Abdul Rahman Shalgam, on 14 January informing him of our intention to transfer Mr. Al Megrahi from HM Prison Barlinnie to HM Prison Greenock. This decision was taken by the Scottish Prison Service on humanitarian grounds. United Nations monitors agreed that Mr. Al Megrahi&#039;s continued solitary confinement at Barlinnie was harmful to his health and well-being. Mr. Al Megrahi was transferred to Greenock on 24 February. Libyan consular officials saw Mr. Al Megrahi on the same day. We understand a follow-up visit will be made shortly.

 Whenever ambassador Bremer, Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Administrator, was absent from Iraq, his US deputy took charge and made decisions on his behalf. In May 2003, the UK Government appointed a UK Special Representative for Iraq to work alongside ambassador Bremer, but as an independent presence with no formal role within the CPA&#039;s hierarchy and with no formal legal decision-making power. However, from 23 to 30 December 2003, when both ambassador Bremer and his deputy were absent from Iraq, the UK Special Representative looked after CPA affairs. There were neither policy decisions made about Iraq, nor orders signed during this period.

It recommended that the current law relating to the prescription of botulinum toxin&#151;which allows for its prescription by a doctor and its administration by a doctor or nurses&#151;should be more consistently adhered to, and that facilities where botulinum toxin is injected should be licensed by the Healthcare Commission and subject to its regulations. The Government accept these recommendations, and will work with the Healthcare Commission, professional bodies and other key stakeholders to formulate an implementation programme.

<p><a name="50309w30.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The new contractual framework for community pharmacy gives primary care trusts (PCTs) the opportunity to work with local pharmacists to develop a range of high quality community pharmacy services. This will make them an integral part of local primary care provision. PCTs should be able to fully exploit the opportunities in order to maximise the benefits to patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para3">
The framework offers considerable benefits for general practitioners (GPs) and the opportunity to work closer with community pharmacists whether in rural or non-rural areas. This includes support for self-care, the management of common ailments and helping patients get the best from their medicines. The introduction of repeat dispensing in every pharmacy will mean that patients will be able to get a prescription from their GP to be dispensed in instalments by their pharmacy for up to a year without patients having to make repeat visits to the surgery for their prescriptions. This will help reduce GP workloads, offer opportunities for pharmacists to review patient medication and minimise waste by not dispensing medicines that patients no longer require. Repeat dispensing is especially of benefit to people with long-term conditions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para4">
We have recently finished consulting representative organisations on the regulatory changes needed to bring in the new framework and the reforms to the control of entry system. We will shortly lay these before Parliament together with the final regulatory impact assessment. We will also publish directions to PCTs, concerning how they are to implement some of the aspects of the new framework and a determination regarding the remuneration to be paid to national health service community pharmacy contractors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para5">
The regulations will ensure the new framework and the balanced package of control of entry reform measures broaden the range and quality of services for patients, encouraging innovation and excellence in service provision.

<p><a name="50309w30.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The national health service counter fraud and security management service (CFSMS) provides training for all staff who counter fraud and corruption within the NHS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para7">
It is mandatory for all NHS counter fraud specialists to successfully complete a counter fraud foundation level course. This high quality professional training has been accredited by the universities of Portsmouth, East London and Wolverhampton and is worth 40 higher education credits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para8">
Successful completion of the foundation level leads to the nationally recognised professional qualification of accredited counter fraud specialist (ACFS). The NHS is one of a number of organisations where staff are trained to this standard. At the end of 2004, there were 8,274 qualified ACFSs from hundreds of organisations in both the public and private sectors including six Government Departments, such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Government agencies such as the Audit Commission, several police forces, banks, investment companies and over 300 local authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para9">
Further training includes an intermediate level course, which focuses on prevention and deterrence of fraud. Additionally, the CFSMS provides refresher training on issues such as interviewing skills and regularly updates training where there are changes in law or procedures that have an impact on work to counter fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para10">
Throughout the year, the CFSMS ensures ongoing support and training for staff through quarterly forums and an annual conference. There is also assistance through a training centre helpline and a regional network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para11">
Because the training attracts higher education credits, it can lead on to further academic study and the CFSMS supports staff who want to continue to develop and work towards a BSc. (Hons) in counter fraud and criminal justice studies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50309w30.html_para12">
At present there are no plans to change the training. It is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is relevant and meets the requirements of staff.

Three month vacancy notes:<br>

1. Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March 2004<br>

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole-time equivalents).<br>

3. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<br>

4. Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey, March 2004.<br>

5. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<br>

6. * figures where sum of staff in post (as at 31 March 2004) and vacancies is less than 10.<br>

7. &#039;&#151;&#039; Figures where sum of staff in post (as at 31 March 2004) and vacancies is zero.<br>

This PSA target was changed to 34 per cent. by March 2008, following the 2004 spending review. Information for 2004&#150;05 showing progress towards this target will be available in autumn 2005. The final position on this target will be assessed in the autumn of 2008, when the data for 2007&#150;08 is available.

Data is not yet available to assess progress against the PSA target to increase the number of older people being supported to live in their own homes by 1 per cent. annually in 2007 and 2008. The baseline for the target will be calculated for the year 2005&#150;06 by the end of 2006, when the data is published. We will be able to measure the final position at the end of 2008.

 The national suicide prevention strategy for England annual report on progress 2004, published on 21 January 2005, stated that the overall death rate from suicide in the most recent period (2001&#150;03) has fallen to 8.6 deaths per 100,000 population. This marks a reduction of 6 per cent. from 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Mar 2005 : Column 1920W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the baseline rate in 1995&#150;97 of 9.2 deaths per 100,000. The rate has been steadily falling for the past five years and if this trend were to continue, the target would be met. The strategy is a coordinated set of activities, which will take place over several years and is subject to regular annual review and evaluation. A copy of the annual report has been placed in the Library.
