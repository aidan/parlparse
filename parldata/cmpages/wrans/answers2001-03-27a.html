<a name="10327w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the National Insurance Contribution liability was of a self-employed person earning <i>(a)</i> &#163;20,000 and <i>(b)</i> &#163;30,000 in the financial years (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1999-2000 and (iii) 2000-01; and what it will be in 2001-02.  [150049]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> Since 1999, this Government have introduced a package of measures to build a fairer National Insurance system, to improve work incentives and encourage job creation. In particular, we have aimed to improve the position of lower earning self-employed people and to address the under-contribution of the self-employed as a whole to the National Insurance Fund, compared with the National Insurance contributions (NICs) payable by employees and employers.
<P>

<a name="10327w01.html_para0">The self-employed pay class 2 which is a weekly flat rate charge and class 4 which is charged as a percentage of profits over the lower profits limit up to the upper profits limit.
<P>

<a name="10327w01.html_para1">In the March 1999 Budget the Chancellor announced a reform of self-employed NICs to reduce the burden of National Insurance on the lowest earning self-employed and encourage the start up of self-employed businesses. The flat rate was reduced from &#163;6.55 a week to &#163;2 a week and the class 4 rate was increased from 6 per cent. to 7 per cent. The starting point for payment of Class 4 NICs has also been aligned with the income tax personal allowance. These changes were introduced following recommendations of the Taylor report.
<P>

<a name="10327w01.html_para2">Over the period mentioned in the question the Government have also introduced a number of measures on income tax. For example, we have introduced and extended the 10p starting rate, cut the basic rate to 22p, introduced the Working Families Tax Credit and the Children's Tax Credit, which reduce direct tax.
<P>

<a name="10327w01.html_para3">By October 2001 as a result of personal tax and benefit measures, UK households will be on average &#163;590 a year better off and families with children will be &#163;1,000 better off on average from measures introduced over the parliament as a whole.
<P>

<a name="10327w01.html_para4">The NICs and income tax liabilities will depend on many circumstances.
<P>

<a name="10327w01.html_para5">The table shows the net effect of changes to NICs and income tax for a single self-employed earner who has no children.

 The reform of class 2 and class 4 National Insurance Contributions (NICs) will reduce the burden on low earners and encourage business start-ups. In 1999-2000, around 0.7 million self employed are estimated to be liable to pay only class 2 and 1.8 million are estimated to be liable to pay class 2 and class 4 NICs. For 2000-01 around 0.2 million are estimated to be liable to pay only class 2 and some 2.3 million are estimated to be liable to class 2 and class 4 NICs. Theses estimates are based on the survey of personal incomes.

 The evidence is that over 1.1 million working families now receive WFTC--300,000 more than received Family Credit at its peak. Thanks to the generosity of WFTC awards, employers are now able to offer jobs to people who would otherwise face financial barriers to work. This is a significant benefit to employers and the economy as a whole. The CBI has supported the WFTC which it has described as playing

 Accurate information on conditions in the West Timor refugee camps is difficult to obtain, following the withdrawal of UN staff and international NGOs in the aftermath of the killing of three UN workers in Atambua last September. But the Indonesian Government have managed the situation in the camps relatively well, and there have been no reports of widespread hunger. Some international NGOs, including Medecins sans Frontieres and Save the Children Fund, are considering re-establishing programmes. A UN mission is due in West Timor soon to review the security situation and decide whether conditions are safe enough for UN staff to return. The UN are particularly keen to ensure that all of those in the camps who want to return to East Timor are able to do so by 20 June, to enable them to register to vote in the Constituent Assembly elections planned for 30 August.

 The report was published today and I have placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. The report is also published on the DCMS website www.culture.gov.uk. I am grateful to Mr. Anthony Speed and his assistant for conducting a thorough inspection of the Royal Parks Constabulary (RPC).
<P>

<a name="10327w04.html_para2">The review was commissioned by the Royal Parks Advisory Board which has considered the report carefully. In reaching my conclusions on the report's recommendations, I have had the benefit of the Board's advice for which I am grateful.
<P>

<a name="10327w04.html_para3">I accept the report's analysis and its recommendations for improved efficiency and effectiveness. Immediate action has been taken to remedy deficiencies and further changes and improvements are being taken forward. Mr. Speed makes 23 recommendations. In the following list I give the action taken on each of them to date.
<P>

<a name="10327w04.html_para4">It is essential for the morale of the RPC and for recruitment and retention that the Force is properly remunerated. The Government have agreed, therefore, to make more money available to maintain the link between the salaries of RPC officers and of the Metropolitan police service at 85 per cent. The award is being backdated to 1 September 2000. The question of an additional London Allowance is under consideration.
<P>

<a name="10327w04.html_para5">My Department is discussing with the Home Office the future relationship between the RPC and the Metropolitan police service. The current position is that the RPC remains part of the Royal Parks Agency. There are options for change, as Mr. Speed's report recognises. These options require further detailed examination and discussion. I recognise that uncertainty can be unsettling and we shall reach a conclusion as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="10327w04.html_para6">Mr. Speed's report acknowledges the level of public satisfaction with the way in which the Royal Parks are policed. They are relatively crime-free areas. This is due to the dedication and professionalism of the officers of the RPC which I recognise and to which I pay tribute.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w05.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Salter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Defence Training Review.  [155985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Training is crucial to the success of our armed forces, and of the business of the Ministry of Defence itself. It represents a resource investment of some &#163;4.2 billion each year. Increasingly, we face new challenges and it is vital to ensure that our training continues to meet our needs and is cost-effective. Against this background, my predecessor announced on 22 July 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 614-615W that he had ordered a fundamental review of education and individual training. This review has now concluded and its report, entitled "Modernising Defence Training", is published today. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para0">The key findings of the review are that, overall, our training and education are of high quality, as demonstrated by operational successes, most recently in Kosovo and Sierra Leone. Improvements are nevertheless required to ensure that we have a training and education system to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The report therefore sets out a coherent set of measures designed to deliver a training and education system that is better integrated, aligned to operational and business needs, responsive to change and cost-effective.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para1">To reflect changing operational priorities, in particular those which emerged from the Strategic Defence Review, the report proposes more joint training between the services, and more multinational and inter-agency training for individuals at all levels. In line with the modernising government initiative, we will introduce improvements to civilian training and to leadership and management training, and will make the leadership expertise of MOD and the armed services more widely available as a resource for the UK as a whole. We will exploit the opportunities provided by new technology to make training better and more accessible, in particular through the expansion of e-learning.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para2">We also propose significant improvements in the field of education. The Royal College of Defence Studies, the Joint Command and Staff College and the Royal Military 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2001 : Column: 548W</I><P>
College of Science, with two new organisations--a Joint Services Warrant Officers School and a Defence Leadership Centre--will be brought together to form a Defence Academy, which we intend to become a national and international centre of excellence for postgraduate education and research. We plan to set up a defence sixth-form college and a defence undergraduate bursary scheme to boost recruitment of engineers and scientists, and to introduce a programme of progressive civilian accreditation of defence education and training. A common theme behind many of our proposals is the need not only to prepare our service and civilian personnel for the tasks we require of them, but to support their personal development, in line with the Government's commitment to lifelong learning, which is already enshrined in the learning forces initiative. This will help recruitment and retention, and also--recognising that for most people the services will not be their only career--provide transferable skills and qualifications that will enhance the national skills base.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para3">We have identified significant scope for improving coherence and cost-effectiveness through training and estate rationalisation, in particular by delivering a significant proportion of specialist training in new defence schools, either joint or lead service, rather than on an individual basis. As well as eliminating duplication, this would improve the quality of training, particularly that in support of joint forces and operations. This will be investigated further by project definition teams over the next 12 months. Subject to the outcome of this work, we believe that the rationalisation programme will result in more cost-effective training and will free resources both to fund improvements we have identified and for defence as a whole.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para4">Finally, to drive through and sustain all of these improvements we will establish a Director General Training and Education, who will provide a central strategy and policy focus.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para5">The review has been comprehensive and wide-ranging, and has been conducted in close consultation with all interested parties both within the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, and outside, including allies. The resulting proposals will build on our existing strengths to provide a better focused and more effective training and education system, ensuring that our service-men and women and civil servants receive the training and education they need to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and helping to maintain this country's reputation for professional, effective and successful armed forces.

<a name="10327w05.html_para8">When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Ministry of Defence has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so. The time taken to settle a claim is dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the case as it relates to determining liability and the nature of the injury, which can range from simple bruises or fractures, for example, to catastrophic injuries where the long-term medical prognosis cannot be assessed for some considerable time.
<P>

<a name="10327w05.html_para9">In line with all other defendants, the Ministry of Defence is bound by the Civil Procedure Rules introduced on 26 April 1999, which specify time scales for the handling of claims.

<a name="10327w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 This change was part of an agreement reached preceding implementation of the new NATO command structure in 1999, under which the United Kingdom and Germany will alternate the provision of Senior Commanders at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and Regional Headquarters Allied Forces Northern Europe (RHQ AFNORTH). At SHAPE, we will provide either Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR) or the Chief of Staff and at RHQ AFNORTH we will provide either the Commander in Chief (C in C) or the Deputy C in C. The nation filling the DSACEUR post will provide the Deputy C in C at the Regional HQ; the UK has recently taken over the key C in C NORTH post in anticipation of General Sir Rupert Smith handing over to General Stockmann as DSACEUR.

 Section 106 agreements are sometimes used to secure funding for school projects across all sectors. There is no obligation for match funding under such agreements, though money from a section 106 agreement could be used to part-fund a school's project. Current Government policy on use of section 106 funding is set out in circular 1/97 issued by DETR.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> We do not collect this information centrally. However, the Department has provided each of the 25 schools which have undergone a "fresh start" since 1997 with additional funding to support their plans for raising standards. Those fresh start schools which have encountered difficulties over teacher vacancies have been able to use these funds both for supply cover, in the short term, and to offer the recruitment and retention allowances needed to attract and keep permanent teaching staff in the longer term.

<a name="10327w07.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In October 1999, in line with national policy, the Chichester office of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), in liaison with a number of other criminal justice agencies including courts, police and local lawyers, introduced procedures based upon the Narey proposals. All defendants charged with a criminal offence where a guilty plea is anticipated now make their first appearance before the magistrates within five working days. All other cases appear in court within 48 hours.
<P>

<a name="10327w07.html_para7">In April 2000, the CPS at Chichester changed its structure in line with the proposals of the Glidewell review. As a first step towards a trial unit, it established a Crown Court Committal unit. This enables the Crown Prosecution Service to place greater emphasis on serious crime cases, which are heard at both Chichester and Lewes Crown courts.
<P>

<a name="10327w07.html_para8">The Chichester office also has fast track procedures in place to deal with Persistent Young Offender cases heard at Crown courts and Youth courts. CPS Sussex recorded the best improvement overall in the country in terms of the time taken to bring persistent young offenders to court. The average time taken was reduced from 144 days to 84 days. CPS Sussex is working continually towards the Government's 71-day target. All these changes illustrate the Government's successful policy of speeding up the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="10327w07.html_para9">The Chichester office is also involved in the Direct Communication with Victims initiative. This provides a written explanation when the CPS either discontinues or substantially alters a charge in the Crown court cases within the initiative. In some circumstances the CPS will meet with victims to explain why a decision was taken.
<P>

<a name="10327w07.html_para10">The Chichester office deals with a broad range of work, including murders. One such case made legal history with the conviction of a man for murder where the victim died more than a year and a day after the assault. Using the Law Reform (Year and a day Rule) Act 1996, and with the consent of the Attorney-General, a prosecution for murder was instituted and the defendant convicted. The case was an important decision as it was one of the first occasions when a defendant, who had been previously convicted of an assault before the victim died, was later tried again in respect of the same conduct and convicted of murder.
<P>

<a name="10327w07.html_para11">Actions and policies of the Treasury Solicitor's Department and the Serious Fraud Office do not directly affect the Chichester constituency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the implications of the EU ban on pithing on the safety of abattoir employees.  [144340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w08.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that it has undertaken an extensive public consultation on the potential impact of a ban on pithing. The risk to worker safety through involuntary kicking of stunned animals and the need for structural changes to abattoir premises in order to enable slaughtering to be carried out safely

<P><I>27 Mar 2001 : Column: 559W</I><P>
without pithing were among the points raised in response. We have recognised these concerns and have delayed implementation of the ban until 1 April 2001 to allow abattoir operators more time to make the necessary adjustments to premises.
<P>

<a name="10327w08.html_para0">Safety in the workplace is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE has, in collaboration with the Meat Trades Joint Working Party, developed guidelines and procedures which will help to minimise any potential risk to abattoir employees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w08.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make it the policy of the Government to seek to ensure that blister packs of medicinal tablets imported into the UK must have the day of the week identified in English; and if he will make a statement.  [153042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> The requirements for the labelling of medicinal products are set out in Directive 92/27/EEC. Printing the days of the week on blister packs is not one of these requirements. In considering the proposals from importers for the labelling of imported products, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) must ensure that these comply with the terms of the Directive. If they do, the MCA cannot prohibit the importation of the products nor insist that where the days of the week are present in a foreign language they should be translated.
<P>

<a name="10327w08.html_para1">It is therefore the policy of the MCA, where the days of the week are present on the blister strip in another language, to ask importers to provide a translation either on the labelling or within the patient information leaflet. In general the industry is co-operating with this policy. The MCA will continue to pursue it with individual importers on a case by case basis during the evaluation of their applications and with their trade associations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the cost is per patient treated under <i>(a)</i> the Cornwall Personal Dental Services Pilot and <i>(b)</i> the General Dental Service in England and Wales as a whole.  [153963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 In 1999-2000 the average cost per patient treated under the Cornwall Personal Dental Service (PDS) pilot was &#163;65.50 and under the General Dental Service (GDS) in Cornwall the average was &#163;42.10 per patient. A corresponding average for the GDS in England and Wales is not available because children having only an examination are not separately recorded as their treatment costs are covered in capitation payments.
<P>

<a name="10327w08.html_para2">An accurate comparison of figures is not possible because PDS work differs from the GDS average mix. For example, several PDS pilots deal with specialist dentistry and most do not register patients. The Cornwall PDS pilot includes general anaesthetics, special needs and orthodontic services. It is an access centre and operates through a network of 20 sites across the county, complementing the service provided by local GDS dentists. It has proved very popular with patients and is now seeing about 2,000 patients a month.

<a name="10327w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department is working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) in support of the development of the rural stress action plan (RSAP), which offers support to help alleviate stress in rural areas.

<P>

<a name="10327w08.html_para3">The RSAP group, which includes representatives from Government, the voluntary mental health sector and national farming organisations met again on 20 March this year to discuss details of future assistance, particularly in respect of the current foot and mouth outbreak.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> The "British Farm Standard", denoted by the red tractor symbol, is a voluntary scheme developed by the National Farmers' Union. The presence of the red tractor symbol on a food product indicates compliance with specific farm assurance schemes. Under European competition rules, use of indications like the red tractor symbol (and other similar indications), which are indications of quality, not origin, cannot be restricted to national produce.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Local authority social services departments have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to provide services for children in need in their area. The definition of a child in need is set out in section 17(10) of the Act including for example disabled children. If a young asylum seeker falls within that definition, social services departments have the same responsibilities to provide services to them as to other children who are also in need.
<P>

<a name="10327w08.html_para4">This means that local authorities must ensure that the welfare of all relevant children are safeguarded and promoted. They must assess the needs of each individual child and provide services as appropriate to meet the assessed needs. Our &#163;885 million Quality Protects programme is designed to improve the management and delivery of children's social services and ensure that our objective of improving the life chances of children in need is met.

 Yes. I understand that London Underground have well-developed safety risk control systems, which are the subject of continuous improvement. Risk assessments have been carried out for a wide range of possible incidents on all Underground Lines. In all cases the risk to standing passengers has been assessed as 'very low'. This is considered by London Underground to be 'as low as reasonably practical' under regulations set down by the Health and Safety at Work, etc Act 1974.

 The Rail Regulator has enforcement powers under the Railways Act 1993. Railtrack has told the Regulator that it would restore normal operation for most train operating companies by 21 May. The Regulator, having judged that Railtrack is currently in breach of its

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received on the impact of the climate change levy on rural enterprises, with particular reference to farms, horticultural producers, sub-post offices and small hotels; and if he will make a statement.  [155270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have received a wide range of representations about the impact of the climate change levy, including representations about farms, horticulture, post offices and hotels. Farms producing pigs, poultry meat and eggs are eligible to join climate change agreements to obtain an 80 per cent. reduction in the rate of levy in return for commitments to achieve agreed reductions in their energy consumption. Horticulture has been granted a 50 per cent. reduction in the rate of levy for five years and we have allocated up to &#163;5 million over three years (subject to State Aid approval) to provide energy efficiency advice to help them to adjust to the full rate. The horticulture sector has committed itself to a voluntary agreement to reduce energy consumption as part of this arrangement. The hotels sector has already entered into a similar agreement. Small businesses in rural areas will be subject to the levy. However, the smallest businesses, with domestic levels of energy usage, will be exempt. Like other businesses, small rural enterprises will be entitled to free energy efficiency advice from the Government's Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme and from the Energy Efficiency Advice Centres funded by the Energy Savings Trust.

 The Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) do not contain specific training requirements.

The training of staff forms an integral part of the safety management arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w11.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Sawford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when PPG13 will be published; and if he will make a statement.  [156064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We are today publishing the final version of PPG13. This is a major step towards integrating planning and transport at the local level and helping deliver the Government's 10 Year Plan for Transport. It forms a key part of our transport, urban and rural policies.
<P>

<a name="10327w11.html_para3">PPG13 is about getting the right development in the right place and ensuring people have a choice in transport. We want local authorities to actively manage the pattern of growth to make the fullest use of public transport and to integrate local transport investment decisions with location decisions for the major land uses.
<P>

<a name="10327w11.html_para4">PPG13 introduces Transport Assessments, to replace Traffic Impact Assessments, which will ensure that assessments of major development proposals cover access by all modes of transport. These assessments will help to promote development which is located and designed to provide access by a choice of modes and encourages developers to incorporate measures such as car-sharing schemes as part of travel plans. We will shortly be publishing good practice advice on undertaking Transport Assessments.
<P>

<a name="10327w11.html_para5">The guidance provides encouragement for well- designed and well-conceived park and ride schemes, ensuring that such proposals will be given favourable treatment through the planning system. In some circumstances, park and ride schemes may be permissible in the Green Belt, provided a thorough assessment shows the scheme to be the most sustainable of the available options.
<P>

<a name="10327w11.html_para6">PPG13 also carries forward proposals set out in the Rural White Paper to promote housing, jobs and services in rural service centres, including market towns. We also want local authorities to take a positive approach to farm diversification proposals to promote rural employment opportunities and to help reduce long-distance commuting to urban areas. Such diversification proposals should not be rejected where they would give rise to only modest additional traffic and would not have significant impact on minor roads.
<P>

<a name="10327w11.html_para7">The public consultation exercise on the draft version of PPG13 showed strong support for the guidance and for the use of national maximum parking standards for the major land uses. However, we have made changes to the standards, and how they are applied, to address business concerns and ensure the approach encourages investment in town centres and will be conducting a review of the impact of the standards over the next two to three years.
<P>

<a name="10327w11.html_para8">Copies of the guidance are being placed in the House Libraries and it is also available on the DETR website (at www.planning.detr.gov.uk).

In addition there will be transfer of &#163;2 million Provision from the Voted to the non-Voted element of this Departmental Expenditure Limit which will increase from &#163;137,911,000 to &#163;139,911,000. The increase in DEL will be offset by a charge to the DEL Reserve and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

<a name="10327w12.html_para16">The European Information and Communications Technology Industry Association (EICTA), formerly European Trade Organisation for the Telecommunication and Professional Electronic Industry (ECTEL), have already initiated a UK mobile phone take back and recovery scheme on a voluntary basis.

<a name="10327w12.html_para17">The initial ECTEL launch in 1997 involved only the mobile phone manufacturers--Alcatel, Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, Panasonic and Philips.

The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Ceredigion the number has reduced from 1,800 to 1,200. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally; in Ceredigion the number has increased from 700 to 900.
<P>

<a name="10327w13.html_para7">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 15,500 older people in Ceredigion have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.
<P>

<a name="10327w13.html_para8">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 14,100 pensioners in Ceredigion will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition, we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 5,500 in Ceredigion. 1,300 pensioner families in Ceredigion are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.

<P>
<a name="10327w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The UK Government are committed to promoting both the use of the Guidelines and their effective implementation. Primary responsibility for promoting and implementing the Guidelines in the UK rests with the UK National Contact Point, based within the Department of Trade and Industry, but working in liaison with other Government Departments and interested bodies.
<P>

<a name="10327w15.html_para7">The UK NCP has undertaken a number of activities to promote the Guidelines including the launching today of a booklet explaining its role and the Guidelines more generally. This is being distributed to relevant organisations and is available free of charge from DTI Publications. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="10327w15.html_para8">In addition, a website has been established, www.dti.gov.uk/worldtrade/ukncp.htm. The NCP has already held meetings with UK business, trade unions, and other non-governmental organisations and will continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="10327w15.html_para9">Future activities include the production of a publicly available Annual Report covering the activities of the UK NCP; using Government contact with business at all levels to promote the Guidelines and the UK Government's support for them; and contributing to OECD efforts to raise awareness in non-adhering countries.
<P>

<a name="10327w15.html_para10">This is in addition to its main task of responding to any inquiries or concerns about the activities of Multinational Enterprises raised with the NCP.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w15.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The inspectors have now completed their report. In view of the fact that while in opposition the Secretary of State questioned whether Kevin and Ian Maxwell should receive legal aid, he has been advised by officials, who consulted independent counsel, that he should stand aside from decisions flowing from the submission of the report. The Secretary of State has accepted this advice, has not seen a copy of the report and has delegated decisions on the report to me.
<P>

<a name="10327w15.html_para11">I have considered this matter carefully and decided that publication would be in the public interest.
<P>

<a name="10327w15.html_para12">I therefore intend to publish the report before the end of March 2001.

 Chapter 9 of Sir Anthony Hammond's report recommends that Departments review their Private Office working practices on the monitoring and recording of telephone calls and general record keeping. My Department has put in hand such a review in order to ensure that consistent arrangements are in place across Private Office.

<a name="10327w17.html_para4">In paragraph 5.191 of the report, Sir Anthony Hammond notes that a number of measures have been put in place since 1998-99 to improve the working practices of the nationality group of the Integrated Casework Directorate. Caseworkers have been reminded of the need fully to document action and decisions in all cases.

<a name="10327w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Subject to sections 11 and 37 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the allocation of party election broadcasts is a matter for the broadcasting authorities (that is, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Independent Television Commission, Radio Authority and Sianel Pedwar Cymru). Section 11 of the Act requires the broadcasting authorities, in determining their policy on party political broadcasts (including party election broadcasts), to have regard to the views of the Electoral Commission. Section 37 of the Act provides that only parties registered under Part II of the Act may qualify for such broadcasts.
<P>

<a name="10327w17.html_para5">We have held no discussions with electoral administrators concerning the British National Party's eligibility to qualify for an election broadcast. We have had no discussions with the British National Party and would not be disposed toward having any.

<a name="10327w17.html_para6">In response to concerns that unscrupulous candidates had in the past misled electors into supporting their nomination, the Representation of the People Act 2000 made it an offence for a person to include in his nomination paper any fraudulent or fraudulently obtained signatures of persons purporting to act as a candidate's seconder or assentor.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about the availability of replica guns, with special reference to those which fire ballbearings.  [155635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is a range of different types of replica firearms available in this country, some of which are capable of discharging projectiles and some of which are not.
<P>

<a name="10327w17.html_para7">As regards the first category, controls will depend on whether any projectile which is expelled is capable of inflicting a lethal injury. For example, fully functioning replicas of historic guns, whether breech loading or muzzle loading, are subject to the full control of the firearms legislation. Replica breech loading cartridge firing pistols are prohibited weapons which may only be held with the express authority of the Secretary of State. The possession of replica air weapons capable of lethal performance is governed by the wider provisions of the Firearms Act 1968 as amended and such weapons cannot be sold to a person under 17 or given to a person under 14. They are also subject to the provisions of the Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) Rules 1969.

<P>

<a name="10327w17.html_para8">Replicas which fire small plastic pellets or, in some cases, steel ball bearings with insufficient energy to penetrate the skin are not regarded as lethal barrelled weapons. Nor are blank firing replicas which cannot readily be converted to fire a live round, and realistic non-firing replicas. Such guns do not fall under the controls of the Firearms Act 1968 as amended and may freely be bought by anyone.
<P>

<a name="10327w17.html_para9">Under the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1989 any toy gun which discharges a hard projectile must not have an energy level in excess of 0.08 joule.

<a name="10327w17.html_para10">The Government recognise the concerns which have been expressed in relation to the misuse and ready availability of realistic replica guns and are looking carefully at the possibility of introducing additional controls. This is a difficult and complex matter, not least because of difficulties of definition, and the Firearms Consultative Committee have been asked to consider the detailed implications of any changes and to report back.

<P>
<a name="10327w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Asylum seekers are currently supported either by payments under arrangements put in place following the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 from the Department of Social Security, or by local authorities, or for newer applicants following the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, directly by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). The costs of all three methods of support are met from the Home Office budget, subject, in the case of local authorities, to agreed unit cost limits. Based on current forecasts of cost and estimates of the average number of asylum seekers supported for the year, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2001 : Column: 595W</I><P>
the average forecast cost in 2000-01 of supporting an asylum seeker (ie an applicant for asylum or a dependant of one) who has requested support, is &#163;6,100 for the whole year. These costs include accommodation or Housing Benefit where provided.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> Applicants are referred to Oakington where it appears that their application can be decided quickly, including those which may be certified as manifestly unfounded, and there are no other circumstances which would make their claim unsuitable for Oakington. Nationality is a factor, although not the only factor, in deciding whether a case is suitable for consideration at Oakington as the country of origin has a bearing on the likely complexity of the claim. Information on nationalities currently potentially suitable for consideration at Oakington is provided in the table. Operational constraints, for example the availability of interpreters, limit the range of nationalities than can, in practice, be dealt with at Oakington at any one time.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will set out, including individual statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effect upon Regent's Park and Kensington, North of his Department's policies since May 1997.  [155351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000, is available in the Library. The next report will be published shortly. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. "Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000" and "Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000" can be found in the Library. The recorded crime statistics include information on recorded crime by Basic Command Unit and Crime and Disorder partnerships.
<P>

<a name="10327w18.html_para0">The impact of Home Office policies and actions is not normally examined by constituency and the statistics which the Department collects, such as recorded crime, cannot be matched in the way requested although set out are examples relating to the Regent's Park and Kensington, North constituency or the immediate locality:

<a name="10327w18.html_para2">The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was awarded &#163;117,000 for a six-camera system covering two residential areas in North Kensington, Swinbrook estate and St. Quintin Park. The scheme aims to reduce incidents of assault, criminal damage and vehicle crime on both estates.
<P>

<a name="10327w18.html_para3"><i>Youth Offending</i>
<P>

<a name="10327w18.html_para4">The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) Youth Offending Team (YOT) covers the entire borough. Its aim is to reduce offending by children and young people aged 10-17. During 2000-01 the YOT dealt with 170 new cases. This represents approximately one in 70 of the youth population. The borough attributes its apparently low offending rate to the success of partnership arrangements aimed at reducing crime including the YOT, as well as the excellence of its Youth Service and Social Services Departments (as evidenced by recent Ofsted and Joint Review inspections). Robbery, burglary and violent 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2001 : Column: 597W</I><P>
offences are a priority for the YOT and its partners for 2001-02. The Youth Justice Plan contains objectives to develop intensive supervision programmes for persistent young offenders, develop an anger management programme and to share intelligence with the Police Service in relation to the most prolific young offenders in the Royal borough.
<P>

<a name="10327w18.html_para5">The YOT contracts with the Divert Trust for the delivery of a mentoring scheme. This scheme provides positive adult role models for young offenders. 17 volunteers from RBKC are currently on the scheme. RPS Rainer have been contracted to provide a bail supervision service aimed at reducing offending on bail as well as decreasing non-attendance at court. The YOT is part of the Royal borough's Community Safety Strategy and has specific targets to meet around early intervention work, support and guidance for parents of young offenders and the development of an assessment framework. The RBKC YOT piloted the new assessment framework called ASSET. The team continues to be part of the research programme investigating the efficacy of ASSET. The YOT places a particular emphasis on early intervention. During 2000-01, 70 per cent. of young offenders given a Final Warning took part in a rehabilitation programme, (despite the fact that attendance is voluntary). A sample of 50 cases showed only five occurrences of re-offending. This re-offending rate is lower than the previous cautioning rate. A course for young people at risk of offending or school exclusion called "Chance to Change" is run annually. Last year only one of 12 attendees subsequently re-offended.
<P>

<a name="10327w18.html_para6">In addition to statutory community orders, the YOT operates a groupwork programme for male and female offenders (separately), aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour and improving life skills. The YOT also operates a Youth Inclusion Programme in the north of the borough aimed at providing an intensive programme for the 50 young people in the area most at risk from offending. This programme is run in partnership with the Royal borough's Youth Service. The YOT has operated as a catalyst for developing joint work within partner agencies. Links with the voluntary sector have been strengthened and the incorporation of a victim perspective has brought a whole new dimension to youth justice interventions.

 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office annual reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000, is available in the Library. The next report will be available shortly. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. 'Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000' and 'Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000' can be found in the Library. The recorded crime statistics include information on recorded crime by Basic Command Unit and Crime and Disorder Partnerships.

<a name="10327w19.html_para5">The West Sussex Youth Offending Team (YOT) comprises staff and resources from West Sussex County Council, Sussex police, the Probation Service and the health authority and is a countywide service. It brings together staff from the five partner agencies to form an integrated, operational team. The YOT has been involved at a strategic and operational level in the key issues around 'speeding up youth justice', which has assisted in bringing down the average times for the processing of all youth cases, including Persistent Young Offenders. The court service has been improved by providing informed and proactive court duty officers to the increased number of scheduled youth courts, to promote the issues which assist in reducing unnecessary delays in the processing of young offenders.

<a name="10327w20.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what advice he has given to county councils about the disinfection of vehicles using public roads near locations associated with outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.  [153840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> The Foot and Mouth Order 1983 sets out requirements for the disinfection of vehicles that enter or leave an infected premises. While there are no powers or EU rules to require the disinfection of vehicles that pass adjacent to such premises, MAFF has posted advice on its website about the precautionary measures people should take in the vicinity of livestock farms.

<a name="10327w20.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to ensure that meat imported for the Ministry of Defence and local authorities does not come from countries infected with foot and mouth disease; and if he will make a statement.  [154010]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 All meat imported to the UK for human consumption must comply with Community animal and public health provisions that require meat to be accompanied by veterinary certification and to come from approved establishments in approved countries. These permit the importation of meat from some countries where foot and mouth disease is present but only where the veterinary authorities have contained the disease in specific regions. Community rules permit imports of meat from those regions only if it has been deboned and fully matured and is therefore not considered to present a risk of spreading foot and mouth disease. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. However, because of their foot and mouth disease situation meat may not currently be imported from South Africa, Swaziland or Argentina. There is, and I envisage, no exemption from these general rules for the Ministry of Defence or for local authorities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he has had with farmers and farm organisations over his Department's decision increasingly to restrict herds where inconclusive reactions to foot and mouth tests are found.  [154036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2001]:</i> Ministers have held regular and wide ranging meetings with farming and other organisations since the earliest days of the foot and mouth outbreak. Restrictions are imposed on herds where disease is suspected to exist. Disease may be confirmed on clinical grounds alone if the State Veterinary Service is satisfied that animals are clearly exhibiting signs of the disease. Where doubt exists as to whether the clinical symptoms actually relate to foot and mouth disease, samples are taken for testing. The testing process will ultimately lead to a positive or negative 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2001 : Column: 605W</I><P>
result. On occasions it may be necessary to take further samples before a clear result is obtained, particularly a negative. Restrictions will not be lifted until it is certain that the disease is not present.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_wqn7"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how frequently his Department's website relating to the foot and mouth crisis is updated; and if he will make a statement.  [154282]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Ministry's website www.maff.gov.uk relating to foot and mouth disease is updated at least twice a day. We recognise the importance of putting a wide range of information on the internet to assist farmers and the industry, and will continue to ensure that we provide a comprehensive and timely service.

<a name="10327w20.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what equipment for handling carcases of slaughtered livestock infected by foot and mouth disease was transported from Marsh Farm, Fambridge, Essex to Wick Farm, Layer-de-la-Haye, Essex; how and when it was transported; and what measures were taken to disinfect equipment before it was transported.  [154314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]</i>: One teleporter, hired from Sonic Rail Services Ltd., was moved under its own power with a MAFF escort on 10 March 2001 between 19.00 hours and 20.30 hours. Before being transferred between premises the teleporter was fully disinfected in accordance with the Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983. The disinfection was supervised by a MAFF official.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We have confirmed a number of cases of foot and mouth disease in animals which have passed through Welshpool market. Further epidemiological investigations are continuing, the results of which will be published.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w20.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> Following the successful introduction of rendering foot and mouth carcases at the Prosper de Mulder plant in Widnes, carcases have been sent to the plant at Marsh Barton since 16 March. Further plants at Great Torrington in Devon and at Paisley are now also being used.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make it his policy to seek to ensure that Polish fishing vessels are prohibited from fishing in the North Sea and the Irish Sea; and if he will make a statement.  [155442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's objective for fisheries is to ensure that any quotas granted to Poland and other acceding member states cover only those areas and stocks for which they already have recognised track records. As Poland has no track record in fishing in the North Sea and Irish Sea since the establishment of the Common Fisheries Policy it will not receive any quota for these upon accession.

[154337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The only approvals that we have specifically granted for the use of pesticides on genetically modified crops are experimental approvals. Unlike commercial level approvals, experimental approvals are not published for reasons of commercial confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="10327w21.html_para0">We are, however, in the process of reviewing the current arrangements to provide for greater openness and transparency. In the meantime the Pesticides Safety Directorate have been asked to seek the consent of the relevant approval holders to the release of the information requested. I will write with as much of the information requested as is consistent with proper safeguards for commercial confidentiality. Copies of the letter will be made available to the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what criteria the Lord Chancellor will use to assess applications for funding from the extra-statutory ex-gratia scheme, in Northern Ireland.  [156081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 I can advise my hon. Friend that my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor will consider each application for funding from the Extra-Statutory Scheme on its individual merits and in the round. In so doing the Lord Chancellor will have regard to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) whether the issues raised in the application fall outside the scope of a coroner's inquest;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) whether the applicant would qualify financially for full civil legal aid in other circumstances;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) whether an effective investigation of the death by the state is needed, and whether the inquest is the only way to conduct it;</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2001 : Column: 610W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) whether the applicant has a sufficiently close relationship to the deceased to warrant funding;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) whether an alternative to public funding is available;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(f) whether the applicant needs representation in order to participate effectively in the inquest--for example, because there are unusually complex questions of law or fact, or evidential difficulties, or because of the level of representation of others who have an interest in or are involved in the inquest;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(g) whether there is a significant wider public interest in representation being provided;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(h) the views of the coroner, if expressed; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) any other matters which appear to be relevant to the individual circumstances of the case.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10327w22.html_para0">The Lord Chancellor is writing to interested parties to invite their views on the criteria.
<P>

<a name="10327w22.html_para1">The consultation exercise for these criteria will conclude on 30 June 2001. In the meantime and until the Lord Chancellor reaches a conclusion on the final criteria to be adopted, he will apply the criteria set out to any applications for funding from the extra-statutory fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10327w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Our policy remains to repel the rebels, restore the peace process, and to help rebuild the country. Sierra Leone still has a considerable way to go. But I am encouraged by the start, on 14 March, of the UN peacekeeping force UNAMSIL's deployment forward into rebel held areas.
<P>

<a name="10327w22.html_para2">I also welcome the unanimous adoption of UNSCR 1343 (2001) on 7 March, imposing sanctions on Liberia. We co-sponsored this resolution in response to the UN Expert Panel report, which clearly identified Liberian President Taylor as the primary supporter of the Revolutionary United Front rebels. UNHCR 1343 is designed to persuade President Taylor and his associates to cease their malign activities in the region.

 We take every opportunity to discuss drugs with the Bolivian authorities. On 28 February I confirmed to the Bolivian Minister of Justice the UK's continuing support for his Government's efforts. We have contributed over a million pounds in counter-drugs assistance to Bolivia since 1997 and I am pleased to announce to the House that I have just approved a further

<P>
<a name="10327w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The UK strongly believes that the current UN settlement process, launched in December 1999 by the UN Secretary General, offers an excellent opportunity to achieve a just and lasting settlement in Cyprus. This is in the interests of all concerned. The UN process is currently at a sensitive and difficult stage but the UK has every confidence in the ability of the UN to find a way to resolve the current difficulties and move forward. To that end we will continue strongly to urge all those involved to remain fully and positively engaged in the search for a solution.

 In 1997 the European Community suspended GSP privileges to Burma in reaction to the use of forced labour there. My right hon.

 We are in regular contact with the Brazilian authorities on a broad range of human rights issues, including forced labour.
<P>

<a name="10327w22.html_para3">During talks between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Brazilian Government in Brasilia in December last year, Embassy officials again raised our concerns about the use of forced labour in Brazil. We have subsequently passed on a copy of Anti-Slavery International's latest briefing on forced labour to Brazil's National Secretariat for Human Rights.

<a name="10327w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are very concerned about increasing levels of violence in Colombia in recent months, particularly directed at trade unionists such as Wilson Borja and other human rights defenders. We have raised our concerns directly with the Colombian authorities. I issued a statement on 13 February reiterating our concerns. The President of the European Union intends to issue a statement on the situation in Colombia on behalf of all EU member states at the 57th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights taking place in Geneva at the moment.

 Relations with Luxembourg are traditionally very good. Ministers and officials have frequent contact with their Luxembourg counterparts at EU meetings. There were also four substantive bilateral ministerial meetings in 2000, including a meeting between the two Prime Ministers in London. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, my hon.

 The Government condemn all acts of violence in the middle east, and call on both parties to take steps to reduce the violence and build confidence. This of course includes action where possible to prevent terrorist acts. We take every opportunity to raise this with both Palestinian and Israeli representatives. The European Council in Stockholm on 23 March called for the immediate resumption of security co-operation and urged both parties to do all in their power to end violence, restrain extremism and minimise incitement and provocations.

 Following a successful EU Troika visit to the region, Heads of State and Government discussed the situation in the middle east at the European Council in Stockholm on 23 March. The Council reaffirmed the Union's determination to contribute to peace, stability and future prosperity in the middle east. To that end it requested the EU High Representative Javier Solana to explore how the EU can play an enhanced role in promoting the resumption of the peace process. While there has been an overall reduction in the level of violence in the past two weeks, we remain deeply concerned at the continuing tensions and instability. We urge both parties to take immediate parallel steps to address the current crisis.
