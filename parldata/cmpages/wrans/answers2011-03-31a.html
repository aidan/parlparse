There will be some additional co-location of criminal and family jurisdictions in magistrates and county courts as a result of court closures.

<i> [holding answer 28 March 2011]:</i><i> </i>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), referred at "The Times Summit" on Africa on 22 March to the Government's provision of £6 million of support during this year for continued building-up of the counter-piracy capacity of regional countries in the Indian Ocean area. This implements the Government's existing counter-piracy assistance policy as outlined in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris) on 5 July 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, column 31W. The cumulative total of £6 million represents a total of 12 separate piracy-related projects taken forward recently in Kenya, the Seychelles and in Somalia itself, including support for courts, prisons, police and coastguard. One project related to the gift of an advanced surveillance camera to the Seychelles coastguard, which was handed over on 24 March and enables more effective surveillance of pirate activity and now provides evidence-standard photography for use in prosecutions. Collectively this represents an important reaffirmation of the UK's commitment to provide comprehensive political, military and capacity building support to our partners in the region in their fight against piracy. I will write to the right hon. Member with more details of these projects, and will place a copy in the Library of the House, along with a copy of the Secretary of State's speech on Africa.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). These use disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years. Due to small sample sizes involved, estimate by ethnic group are based on three year averages.<br>
4. From 2001-02 it is possible to split the ethnic groups further. It is not possible to separate out definitional and real effects.<br>
5. The 'all other categories' group includes mixed, Chinese and other.<br>
6. Data up to 2001-02 correspond to Great Britain, while data from 2002-03 correspond to the United Kingdom.<br>

3. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.<br>

5. The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the 100% data sources, in particular, more complete information on the disabling condition of DLA claimants. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit.<br>

 Individuals will be able to make a new claim for personal independence payment up to the age of 65 (or state pension age, if that is higher). We recognise that individuals who develop additional needs earlier in their lives have had less opportunity to earn and save for later life. As a result, we intend in regulations to allow individuals already in receipt of personal independence payment when they reach state pension age to continue to receive the benefit, subject to the entitlement conditions continuing to be satisfied.</p>

 The Government propose to replace disability living allowance with personal independence payment in 2013-14. We are considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We believe that advice from an approved independent professional will be an important part of ensuring that assessments are objective and consistent. In most cases, we expect this to involve a face-to-face consultation to enable an in-depth look at an individual's circumstances.</p>

For example, they believe that the new assessment should explicitly take account of the impact of a health condition or impairment, including autistic spectrum disorders, on an individual's ability to communicate. This would set it apart from the current DLA assessment. We also recognise the importance of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism.

 It is important to be clear that the new assessment for personal independence payment (PIP) will be very different to the work capability assessment (WCA) used in employment and support allowance (ESA). This recognises that ESA and PIP are different benefits paid for different reasons. The emerging assessment for PIP will focus on individuals' ability to carry out key everyday activities, rather than capability for work and direct measures of associated functions as in the WCA.</p>

For example, we fully recognise the need to ensure that these processes are transparent and empathetic; and are considering the scope to use mental, intellectual and cognitive champions to support the assessment as recommended by Harrington.</p>

 Expenditure on flood risk management cannot be immune from the over-riding need to reduce the deficit, and to deliver efficiencies across all areas of public spending. DEFRA has committed to spend at least £2.16 billion over four years on flood and coastal erosion risk management in England. This is approximately 8% less than the amount spent by DEFRA over the previous four years. The Department has protected key front line aspects of the budget such as flood forecasting and warnings, incident response and the risk-based maintenance of existing defences. We also expect to be able to provide improved levels of protection to 145,000 homes by March 2015, even within a reduced budget.</p>

 As the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made clear at February's Agriculture Council, when some EU member states sought more time to comply with the ban on conventional cages, any delay in implementing the ban would be unfair to all the egg producers in the UK who have made significant investments to convert out of battery cages ahead of the European deadline. It would be unjust for them to have to compete with producers from other European countries which have not converted.</p>

 There is a substantial programme of environmental monitoring for radioactivity in UK waters which has been established for a number of years. The results of this programme, together with implications for human health and environmental health are published annually in the Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE) report series. These reports confirm that the environment and man are adequately protected, and that doses of radioactivity received by people and wildlife continue to be well within regulatory limits.

However, these appliances are already covered by other arrangements such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, so this will have no impact on the Government's carbon reduction strategy.

The research base has an important role to play in addressing such priorities and the research councils, with the support of independent advice, have proposed research programmes to tackle them. It is also appropriate for Ministers to ask research councils to consider how best they can contribute to these priorities, without crowding out other areas of their missions. But it is for the research councils to decide on the specific projects and people to fund within these priorities, free from ministerial interference.</p>

This sets out their strategic research priority areas. AHRC has been working since 2008, with four other research councils, on the Connected Communities Research Programme which has been developed through consultation with researchers. It has not been changed or modified in any way because of any intervention from Ministers: there has been none. At the core of this programme is research to understand the changing nature of communities in their historical and cultural contexts, and the value of communities in sustaining and enhancing our quality of life. These issues are also relevant to debates about the 'Big Society'. The AHRC has made clear their position in a statement published on 28 March:</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education pursuant to the answer of 22 March 2011, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1034-35W, on departmental telephone services, what steps are being taken within the specification outlined to facilitate the qualification of small voluntary sector organisations under the terms for contracted services; and if he will make a statement.

<i> [holding answer 30 March 2011]:</i> The Home Office in liaison with OGC and other Government Departments has developed the good practice guidance on procuring services from the voluntary and community sector (VCS). The primary focus of the guidance is to improve the participation of the VCS in public service contracts but it is also highly relevant to procurement relationships with small to medium enterprises and black and minority ethnic enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="110331w0002.htm_para77"><a name="11040118000098">The Department for Education (DfE) fully supports the use of the good practice guidance and recognises that the voluntary and community sector can make a significant contribution to the delivery of our policies. The Department's procurement policy requires that all procurement must be based on value for money (VFM), however, VFM and supplier diversity are not in opposition to each other and public procurement is generally more effective if it is open to ideas from all potential supply markets. The guidance is not about giving preferential treatment to VCS organisations rather it is about opening up opportunities and building effective relationships.</p>

The greater coherence and accountability of the system will enable our customers to see more clearly who is accountable for what, and to speak more directly to Government about their concerns. Instead of having several, sometimes conflicting, voices from official agencies giving different versions of the Government's policy, there will be a single clear message coming direct from Government. The abolition of several ALBs signals an end to centralised control over aspects of education where there is no need for the government to be involved, and supports greater devolution to localities and the front line, enabling more decisions to be taken by schools themselves, rather than by intermediate bodies The creation of executive agencies, rather than simply bringing the delivery functions into the Department, is also aimed at safeguarding independence in areas where this is important.</p>

 The Government are committed to tackling all forms of bullying particularly those motivated by prejudice. We want every school to have a strong ethos on good behaviour which includes a culture of respect and acceptance among pupils, staff and the rest of the school community. The Schools White Paper, 'The Importance of Teaching', is a wide-ranging document which sets out the Government's overall approach to different aspects of education, one being behaviour. In that chapter, we made it very clear that schools should not tolerate any form of prejudice-based bullying, regardless of motivation.</p>

 The Department has not assessed the effect on public health of emissions from incinerators since the date of the written answer in November 2009, nor has it commissioned or evaluated research into the effects on public health of emissions from incinerators since 2008. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) published a report of its review of the latest scientific evidence on the health effects of modern municipal waste incinerators in September 2009. The report concludes that while it is not possible to rule adverse health effects out completely, any potential damage from modern, well run and regulated incinerators is likely to be so small that it would be undetectable. The HPA report also advises that since any possible health effects are likely to be very small, if detectable, studies of public health around modern, well managed municipal waste incinerators would yield no useful information.</p>

1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
2. Main procedure or intervention-The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (eg time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures.<br>
3. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br>
 4. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is on track to meet its commitments on global food security and agriculture made at the 2009 L'Aquila summit. In the first year of this pledge, DFID had disbursed 32% of its total commitment of £1.1 billion.</p>

In summary, it is envisaged that we will stop 10 million more children going hungry and ensure a further four million people have enough food throughout the year. We anticipate working on food security in a small number of countries including Ethiopia, (South) Sudan, Zimbabwe and Burma. We will also continue to support multilateral agencies with a mandate on food and nutritional security. Agriculture will continue to be a major focus for DFID's Research and Evidence Division, which has increased its support for agriculture by 60% over the last three years.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) supports national health plans and where countries put in place specific systems to monitor TB, we will support this. Where TB is a high risk and common complication of pregnancy, we would expect to invest in that. The monitoring and evaluation framework in the "Choices for women" Framework for Results cannot be all-inclusive given the many aspects of reproductive, maternal and newborn health that we expect to support in the countries where we work. We must balance our need for accurate data to measure progress whilst not creating additional reporting burdens for countries or parallel monitoring systems.</p>
