<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what discussions he has had with leaders of the Muslim community about allowing burials in Church of England graveyards to take place at weekends.  [38473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 None. So far as I am aware, no approach has been made to the Church of England's national organisations on this topic, and I do not know whether it has arisen in any parishes.
<P>

<a name="20305w01.html_para0">Anyone who was resident in a parish or who died there, whatever his or her faith, is legally entitled to burial in a Church of England parish churchyard, provided it has not been formally closed for burials and space is still available there. It would not be possible to use a non-Christian religious rite in the churchyard, but the Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880 lays down a procedure under which the burial can take place without any religious service, subject to the conditions set out in the Act, for example as to the day and time of the burial. The design of grave markers would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Church's consistory courts.
<P>

<a name="20305w01.html_para1">I understand that issues of timing may also arise in the case of interments in local authority-maintained burial grounds, although that is not a matter for the Church authorities.

<P>
<a name="20305w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Frank Field: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will estimate the total cost of the compensation scheme for those priests unwilling to accept the Ordination of Women up to the cessation of the scheme.  [38495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 I refer my right hon. Friend to the answer I gave him on 27 February, which stated that expenditure to date and budgeted provision for future expenditure in respect of past and present claims for payment under the Ordination of Women (Financial Provisions) Measure 1993 is &#163;24.2 million in total.
<P>

<a name="20305w01.html_para2">The figure will rise if further claims are approved during the remaining lifetime of the legislation, which expires on 21 February 2004.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Over the past year OGC and the Small Business Service have jointly undertaken research to identify the barriers to effective competition in the government marketplace. No specific research has been conducted in the construction sector.
<P>

<a name="20305w01.html_para4">Aggregation, contract bundling and framework agreements were all raised by small firms as being barriers to accessing the government market. OGC is reviewing best practice in each of these areas to ensure optimum value for money.

<P>
<a name="20305w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> Information on the overseas earnings of engineering consultancies is given in Table C8.2 of UK Trade in Services 2000 which was published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In 2000, the latest year for which figures are available, this industry earned &#163;1,449 million from exports overseas, representing 2 per cent. of UK exports of services.
<P>

<a name="20305w01.html_para5">According to information published by ONS in the Monthly Review of External Trade Statistics, UK exports of manufactured goods in 2001 were worth &#163;160.7 billion, representing 84 per cent. of exports of goods, or 60 per cent. of exports of goods and services, together.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the statement of the working group set up by the Hawley Review in the report "Universe of Engineering" on the research needed to estimate the number of people who practise engineering.  [39532]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> The "Universe of Engineering" Report was produced by The Royal Academy of Engineering to assist The Hawley Group in its review of the Engineering Council and the needs of the wider engineering and technology community in the UK. The Report concluded that at least 2 million people are now employed in skilled engineering and technology jobs in this country, and that a new type of organisation, taking over from the Engineering Council, was required to support them.
<P>

<a name="20305w01.html_para6">The Engineering and Technology Board (ETB) has been established for this purpose and is now starting work with the full support of Government. The ETB's principal aims are:

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the impact of the level of transaction costs in the provision of equity finance to private business.  [37598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w02.html_spnew0"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Although this Department has made no assessment of the impact of these costs, the Government appreciate that they have the effect of encouraging private equity investors to focus on larger investments. This makes it more difficult for smaller enterprises to raise finance and is one of the reasons we have launched Regional Venture Capital Funds to provide smaller amounts of equity capital to growth businesses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Page: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what calculation has been made of the amount of carbon dioxide produced by the nuclear energy industry; and what estimate has been made of the annual cost to the nuclear industry of meeting the climate change levy.  [40703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 As with any large project, the process of constructing a nuclear power station will lead to carbon dioxide emissions but these will be negligible in relation to the lifetime generation capacity of the plant. Generation of nuclear electricity does not produce any significant carbon dioxide emissions. It is estimated that in 2001 in the absence of nuclear generation, emissions of carbon dioxide would have been between 11 and 22 MtC higher, depending on the mix of generation used to replace it.
<P>

<a name="20305w02.html_para2">The climate change levy (CCL) falls on supplies of electricity to business users rather than on electricity generators. The amount attributable to nuclear generation will depend on the extent to which consumers of nuclear electricity are domestic consumers or are businesses which are eligible for reductions in the rate of levy. For each terawatt hour of electricity supplied to business customers the CCL at the full rate would amount to &#163;4.3 million.

 The Department is in the process of reviewing the Consumer Credit Act in order to improve consumer protection against unfair lending practices. I published the summary of responses to our consultation paper "Tackling loan sharks&#151;and more" on 18 February. The summary contains a provisional timetable for when DTI expects to publish further consultation papers on our plans to modify the Consumer Credit Act and improve consumer protection against unfair lending practices. The summary also sets out the following priorities for the review:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improving the consumer credit licensing regime;
<P>
<BR>
Making the extortionate credit provisions more effective;
<P>
<BR>
Increasing consumer protection by changing the Consumer Credit Act's financial limit and categories of exempt agreements and simplifying the rules on multiple agreements;
<P>
<BR>
Enabling consumers to conclude credit agreements on-line;
<P>
<BR>
Simplifying the advertising regulations, including the regulations on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR);
<P>
<BR>
Amending the rules on early settlement, and;
<P>
<BR>
Implementing recommendations by the Task Force on overindebtedness.
Copies of both the consultation paper and the summary of responses have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 The US market is open to UK steel exporters. We are working closely with the European Commission to try to ensure that the US Government do not impose unilateral restrictions on steel imports. In addition, Ministers are taking every opportunity to lobby against any action by the US to restrict imports, which would be totally unjustified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w05.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The special voucher scheme was introduced in 1968 in recognition of the specific hardship being suffered at that time by British Overseas Citizen (BOC) passport holders and their dependants, who were under political pressure to leave their countries of residence in East Africa, but who held no other citizenship and had nowhere else to go. Several thousand BOCs and other United Kingdom passport holders took advantage of the scheme and settled in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s.
<P>

<a name="20305w05.html_para9">However, the world political situation has now changed and BOCs are no longer under threat of expulsion. They have, over the intervening years, either settled with their families in the new independent East African countries or, alternatively, some have moved with their families to India. Their families have now grown up and have families of their own.
<P>

<a name="20305w05.html_para10">There are relatively few applications for special vouchers these days and those who do apply are not being pressured to leave the country in which they reside. The scheme no longer serves the purpose for which it was set up. The Government have therefore decided that the time has come to abolish the scheme, with immediate effect. No new applications for special vouchers will be considered.

Local authorities can also fund provision through their housing capital programme although we expect this to be done through RSLs owing to their greater ability to draw on private sources of funding. &#163;2.6 billion has been provided to support housing investment by authorities in 2001&#150;02, which is three times the amount made available in 1997&#150;98.

 Our National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal was built on an unprecedented exercise in joint working within and outside Government. 18 Policy Action Teams considered the whole range of policy problems affecting our most deprived neighbourhoods. Since the launch of the National Strategy in 2001 a research and evaluation strategy has been developed, which will look at all our neighbourhood renewal programmes and initiatives to identify what works, and why.

 The Government are committed to tackling antisocial behaviour across all housing tenures. We are striving to promote a healthier private-rented sector and to do this we recognise the importance of tackling the problem of tenants who behave in an antisocial manner.

<a name="20305w09.html_para0">Much work has already been done across Government to try and tackle the problem. My own Department, for example, is currently considering responses to our recent consultation paper on the selective licensing of private landlords. This will ensure that in areas where local authorities adopt such a scheme all landlords meet minimum management standards and participate with others in dealing with antisocial tenants. We envisage that these powers will be available alongside the mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation, which although it is primarily concerned with targeting properties that are the highest risk to tenants, will also require that the licensee is a fit and proper person.

 There is a wide range of measures available to local authorities to improve safety outside schools.

In many areas school travel plans consider safety within the wider context of journeys to and from school.

<P>

<a name="20305w11.html_para0">SHMG (Supported Housing Management Grant from the Housing Corporation). This is a revenue grant which is paid to RSLs (registered social landlords) to fund the 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 2002 : Column 182W</I><P>
cost of support services. Only RSLs can receive this grant as the Housing Corporation only funds RSLs. It is a block grant, which is paid quarterly in advance.
<P>

<a name="20305w11.html_para1">THBS (Transitional Housing Benefit System) this is an individual welfare benefit. It is paid as part of an individuals Housing Benefit entitlement to cover the cost of housing support. It was introduced in April 2000 as a means of identifying the amount of Housing Benefit paid for support, prior to transfer to the Supporting People pot. Providers must separate out the cost of support services that was previously just charged as part of the rent. From April 2003 support costs will be ineligible for housing benefit and transitional housing benefit will be transferred to the Supporting People pot.
<P>

<a name="20305w11.html_para2">PAGS (Probation Accommodation Grants) this is a grant paid by the probation service for housing service for offenders. Each local probation service has a number of contracts with providers. The contract value will transfer to the pot. Until recently, part of the PAGs funding came from local authorities, this is no longer the case.
<P>

<a name="20305w11.html_para3">HIA (Home Improvement Agencies) funding this is paid by the DTLR to local authorities to fund the cost of home improvement agency services. It has to be match funded by the authority. Continuing the local authority match funding for the life of the existing funding period will be a condition of the Supporting People grant paid to the authority by DTLR.
<P>

<a name="20305w11.html_para4">Income support&#151;this welfare benefit is paid to owner occupiers. It is used to fund housing support services in the leasehold sheltered sector. This will not be a big element of the pot but we are not sure yet of the precise size. We are working with DWP and the Benefits Agency on how to identify the recipients and costs.
<P>

<a name="20305w11.html_para5">Funding from sources other than those listed above will not transfer to the Supporting People pot. We expect that there will continue to be a range of funding sources for housing related support. Authorities will be expected to establish all funding paid for services to ensure that they understand the full picture.

<P>
<a name="20305w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference.
<P>

<a name="20305w12.html_para0">There will be occasions, however, when the Secretary of State may consider it necessary to call in a planning application to determine himself instead of leaving it to the local planning authority. His policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. He will, in general, only take this step if planning issues of more than local importance are involved and if those issues need to be decided by the Secretary of State rather than at a local level. Each case is, however, considered on its own facts.

 Concerted action has been taken in the Department to reduce the number of outstanding parliamentary questions.

There are currently 411 outstanding questions due for reply before 14 February 2002. I aim to have provided right hon. and hon. Members with answers to those outstanding questions by 12 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="20305w14.html_para0">Several Members have raised concerns about unanswered questions and the length of time it has taken for questions to be answered. Last week in the course of dealing with these inquiries evidence came to light of what appears to be systematic falsification in recording the handling of parliamentary questions in the Department's parliamentary section. This included recording questions as having been answered when no such reply had been given to the Member or to the <i>Official Report</i>. Some of these questions date back to the beginning of this session.
<P>

<a name="20305w14.html_para1">The falsification that took place meant that both officials and Ministers were wrongly led to believe that Members had received replies to their questions when they had not. A full investigation is now under way to ensure that all the facts are known and that the necessary remedial action is taken. An official from the Department's parliamentary section has been suspended and is now the subject of a disciplinary investigation.

The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations are therefore being tightened to ensure workers know where asbestos is in premises and can take appropriate precautions. A copy of the research paper is available in the Libraries of the House.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government are considering a package of measures which, taken together, should meet the concerns expressed by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgments in a series of cases from Northern Ireland, including that of <i>Jordan v The United Kingdom.</i>
<P>
<BR>
In furtherance of that objective, I have had a number of discussions with the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland (the Director) regarding the giving of reasons when a decision is reached not to initiate or continue a prosecution. We have agreed that the following statement should issue.
<P>
<BR>
"The policy of the Director in the matter of providing reasons for decisions not to initiate or continue prosecutions, is to refrain from giving reasons other than in the most general terms. The Director recognises that the propriety of applying the general practice must be examined and reviewed in every case where a request for the provision of detailed reasons is made. This policy is based on a series of public interest considerations. It also reflects the duties owed by the Director to a range of parties as a public authority under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The lawfulness of the policy was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in <i>Re Adams Application for Judicial Review</i> (2001) NI 1.
<P>
<BR>
The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, has reviewed his policy in the light of the judgments delivered by the European Court of Human Rights on the 4 May 2001 in a number of Northern Ireland cases, including the case of <i>Jordan v The United Kingdom</i>. Having done so, the Director recognises that there may be cases in the future, which he would expect to be exceptional in nature, where an expectation will arise that a reasonable explanation will be given for not prosecuting where death is, or may have been, occasioned by the conduct of agents of the State. Subject to compelling grounds for not giving reasons, including his duties under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Director accepts that in such cases it will be in the public interest to reassure a concerned public, including the families of victims, that the rule of law has been respected by the provision of a reasonable explanation. The Director will reach his decision as to the provision of reasons, and their extent, having weighed the applicability of public interest considerations material to the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case."

 It is our long-term aim to have effective and sustainable drugs law enforcement in Afghanistan.

 The Bonn conference agreement was a political agreement intended to lead to a stable government in Afghanistan after a transitional period. In the agreement the international community and regional organisations were urged to co-operate with the Interim Administration to combat international terrorism, cultivation and trafficking of illicit drugs and provide Afghan farmers with financial, material and technical resources for alternative crop production. The Interim Administration has already introduced a ban on drugs production, processing and trafficking but it is too early to assess the impact on areas already under poppy cultivation.

 There was no effective governance in Afghanistan for many years. As a consequence authority was traditionally exercised primarily at the regional level. As a result of the Bonn Process, on 22 December 2001, the Afghan Interim Administration took office as the country's first national Government for many years.

 In the short period since the Taliban fell, the international community has co-ordinated a comprehensive programme of humanitarian and development assistance for Afghanistan, within which an anti-narcotics strategy will be an integral part.

<P>

<a name="20305w18.html_para2">The 1979 Lancaster House agreement stipulated that the Zimbabwe Constitution should contain provisions entitling public servants to state pensions, and that pension benefits should continue to be paid to former public employees no longer resident in Zimbabwe. The agreement did not contain any undertaking by the British Government to assume responsibility for the payment of pensions to those eligible, should the Zimbabwean authorities fail to maintain payments.

 On 9 June 1997 the UK Parliament lifted its long-standing scrutiny reserve on the regulations under article 235 (now article 308) of the treaty providing the legal basis for the introduction and use of the euro. This allowed the text to be adopted formally by the Council in Luxembourg on 17 June. My right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) represented the UK. These provisions applied to all transactions involving the ECU, including those relating to the Common Agricultural Policy. The introduction of the euro was in accordance with the procedure and timetable set out in the treaty. It is not possible to assess the financial consequences to UK agriculture of the replacement of the ECU with the euro, because we cannot tell how the currencies from which the value of the ECU was calculated would have fluctuated had the euro not been introduced.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy is made in accordance with the EU regulations. Actual CAP expenditure may be higher or lower than forecast at the beginning of each budgetary year, due to the market situation, exchange rate fluctuations, or exceptional items. Surplus from one year's EC Budget is returned to member states in the following year's Budget by means of a reduction of the amount to be financed from own resources. This has the effect of reducing the amount each member state is required to pay from GNP-based resource. Moneys returned in this way are not broken down by category and information is not therefore available for specific items of expenditure. So we have made no representations on this matter.

 The UK favours the abolition of milk quotas in advance of enlargement. If, however, this does not prove to be possible we believe the approach taken in the European Commission's paper on milk quota allocation for acceding countries to be a sound one. It follows previous practice, when quotas were first introduced in 1984, and in other EU enlargement processes, whereby quota is fixed on the basis of historical production during a set reference period, in this case the average for the years 1997&#150;99. As such, there should be no impact on the UK dairy sector. We have made it clear to the Commission that we are looking for an outcome which is both fair and does not create new obstacles for CAP reform.

 I have written recently to Commissioner Fischler explaining the trials on separator grids which the Sea Mammal Research Unit will be undertaking on our behalf in the offshore bass fishery in March.

 For international fisheries implicated in the bycatch problem, action is required at EU level. This is why I have written recently to Commissioner Fischler alerting him to my concern on this issue and urging EU action to resolve the problem. We will also be briefing other member states about the evidence we have and the state of progress of trials on mitigation methods. As a start I have written to M. Glavany, the French Minister with responsibility for fisheries, drawing my concerns to his attention and seeking support for my approach to the Commission. Spain rarely fishes in the mouth of the Channel where the current problems seem to be focused. We are not aware of any Portuguese activity in this area.

 The forthcoming Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations which will implement the regulatory and technical requirements of the Landfill Directive will ban the landfilling of hazardous liquid wastes from July 2002 as required by the Directive. The Directive also requires that non-hazardous liquids are banned from landfill 'as soon as possible' and no later than July 2009.

<P>
<a name="20305w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The statistical survey covers a wide spectrum of issues concerning the local air pollution control system; the 2000&#150;01 report is over 200 pages long. It ranges from simple numbers of applications and authorised processes in each of the 24 process categories, to data on speed of local authority decision, numbers and types of prosecutions, whether cost accounting is undertaken, and whether authorities have enforcement policies. Each statistical report is circulated to key stakeholders for their comment and the reports are now published. The reports are very carefully considered by the Department and decisions made on what steps should be taken. For example, in the light of figures on local authority take-up of cost accounting, steps were taken to reinforce to local authorities the importance of adopting such practice, and practical guidance was issued to all local authorities on cost accounting methods.

<P>
<a name="20305w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> 80 per cent. of IACS claims in Gloucestershire and 94 per cent. of IACS claims in England were authorised for payment as at 31 January 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Claims throughout the country were delayed as a result of the diversion of staff to foot and mouth disease duties and, more significantly, by industrial action by staff in the RPA. Until the industrial action was suspended on 11 January it was not possible to take action to relieve sites which were under the greatest pressure. Gloucester claims are processed at Exeter and, following the suspension, extra teams were drafted in from other RPA sites across the country and significant amounts of overtime were worked. As a result of this recovery action most of the Gloucestershire claims which are able to be paid will have been cleared by the end of February.

<P>
<a name="20305w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2002]:</i> The information requested is not collected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of the landfill tax on fly tipping; and if she will make a statement.  [39271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> The Department does not collate statistics on fly tipping. Reports by the Tidy Britain Group on this issue showed that the type of waste most frequently fly-tipped is household waste. It is unlikely that the landfill tax causes householders to fly tip waste because local authorities have a legal obligation to collect or accept this type of waste and, as a result, householders do not directly meet the cost of the tax.
<P>

<a name="20305w23.html_para0">Under Section 59 of the Environment Protection Act 1990, local authorities (or the Environment Agency) have the power to remove any fly-tipped waste and recover costs incurred from any person who made or knowingly caused or permitted the deposit of the waste.
<P>

<a name="20305w23.html_para1">The local authority or the Environment Agency also has the power to prosecute the perpetrators of fly tipping which can lead to an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment for up to two years (five years for special wastes).

<P>
<a name="20305w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Pesticide products containing carbaryl have been reviewed as part of the general review in the UK of all organophosphate pesticides. The main purpose of the review is to address public concerns about the potential toxicity of these chemicals and economic impact is not an overriding consideration where safety is concerned. However, the loss of some compounds may have an economic impact on particular sectors of industry. The decision to revoke a particular compound is not taken lightly. It may be revoked because serious safety concerns remain following the evaluation of data submitted in support of the compound or because there was insufficient data submitted for an adequate evaluation of the data to be made. The loss of carbaryl stems from a commercial decision by the approval holder not to support the compound under the UK review.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Carbaryl has been included as part of the general review in the UK of all organophosphate pesticides. The review was undertaken because of public concerns about the potential toxicity of these chemicals.
<P>

<a name="20305w23.html_para5">Organophosphate pesticides are mainly older compounds and the review will establish whether there is sufficient safety data available to satisfy modern standards. Companies are therefore required to submit data they hold on human health and environmental effects to support the continued safe use of the products containing these compounds. If data are not submitted then the approval for these products are revoked.
<P>

<a name="20305w23.html_para6">The approval holder for carbaryl did not submit supporting data, therefore products containing carbaryl have been revoked. The approval for the product Thinsec expired on 31 July 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Under EU rules the UK is not obliged to inform other member states of any national review programme of pesticide products undertaken to address national issues. However, all member states and the commission were informed of the UK programme to review organophosphate compounds, which includes carbaryl. In addition, all are automatically informed of any new product approvals and revocations. A separate European programme intends to review all active substances used in plant protection products within the community and all member states and the commission are involved in this decision-making process.
<P>

<a name="20305w23.html_para7">The approval holder for carbaryl did not submit supporting data under the UK review and therefore the approval for all products containing carbaryl, including Thinsec, have been revoked. Under the European review programme carbaryl has been supported so far. Data for the evaluation of carbaryl must be submitted to the member state evaluating the compound by the end of April 2002. The continued approval of carbaryl throughout Europe is therefore dependent on the conclusions of that evaluation.
<P>

<a name="20305w23.html_para8">It is possible for member states to carry out their own review exercises and for these to be carried out at different times to the European review. Member states are not obliged to follow other countries, domestic decisions regarding the approval or revocation of compounds. In this case, the UK organophosphate review was introduced to address public concerns about the safety of these compounds and we have acted in a consistent manner to revoke their use where appropriate.

 I believe strongly that community buildings and village halls have an important role to play in village life.

They can provide a focus for a range of activities including child care, employment training and advice, sports, leisure and participative activities involving all members of the rural community.
<P>

<a name="20305w24.html_para0">Recent evidence from the Countryside Agency's "Rural Services Survey" suggests that the substantial amounts of funding from various sources over recent years&#151;the 21st Century Halls for England Fund, the Community Fund, Awards for All funding and local authorities&#151;has been very successful in increasing provision of village halls. We are in regular contact with the Countryside Agency on these issues and my officials will be meeting Action for Communities in Rural England shortly to discuss how best to support local communities so as to complement the investment that has gone into village halls.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> New EU-wide measures (implemented domestically under the Processed Animal Protein Regulations from 1 August 2001) already control intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of a wide range of processed animal proteins effectively preventing their inclusion in feed for farmed animals in order to stop the propagation of BSE.
<P>

<a name="20305w24.html_para1">In Great Britain, a national feed sampling programme has been in place since 1996 to monitor compliance with BSE-related feed controls. This programme, operated by the State Veterinary Service, typically takes around 20,000 samples per year from feed mills, on-farm mixers and other premises handling livestock feed. The results of the programme are very encouraging and indicate wide compliance with the feed controls, confirming that prohibited ingredients (from domestic or imported sources) are being effectively removed from the market, distribution channels and farms.
<P>

<a name="20305w24.html_para2">One theoretical issue is that recent cases of BSE in younger animals may have been exposed to infection as a result of cross-contamination (during transhipment) of imported vegetable protein used in the production of animal feedingstuffs with meat and bone meal. We are continuing carefully to investigate such cases, but there is currently no clear evidence that individual animals have been infected by this route.

<P>
<a name="20305w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> Scottish Executive Ministers did not attend the February Agriculture Council as there was nothing on the agenda of specific interest to Scotland and the UK Government are well briefed on the Scottish Executive interests in more general matters. There was no need for the UK Government to raise any issues of particular concern to the Scottish Executive. On the third point, it is the responsibility of the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Scottish Executive's involvement in preparations for EU Council meetings. These arrangements are a matter for the Committee and the Scottish Executive. My Department provides information to Scottish Executive officials as part of that process.

 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> It is not possible to comment precisely on the effect of the climate change levy on the competitive position of our horticulture industry. This depends, among other things, on the extent to which individual sectors and firms within the industry are exposed to international competition; its future energy use; and the extent to which it takes up the incentives which the Government have introduced to help it improve its environmental performance and to protect its competitiveness. These incentives include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a special package of support which aims to improve energy efficiency across the sector, including the provision of site-specific advice for individual businesses;

<BR>
exemptions from the levy for most renewable sources of energy and for fuel used by good quality combined heat and power systems;

enhanced capital allowances for investments in energy efficiency technologies including thermal screens, boilers, combined heat and power systems and lighting; and

 Based on recommendations from the Environment Agency I (by authority of the Secretary of State) announced this morning that I have reviewed the identification of Sensitive Areas in England in accordance with the criteria in Part I of Schedule I of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994 (which transposes the European Council Directive (91/271/EEC) concerning urban waste water treatment).
<P>

<a name="20305w25.html_para1">This review has resulted in the identification of four freshwater stretches of the rivers Stour, Wissey, Chelmer and Leam, which are intended for the abstraction of drinking water, to be identified as Sensitive Areas (nitrate) on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20305w25.html_para2">These new requirements on water companies to remove nitrate from sewage treatment discharges will complement the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive.
<P>

<a name="20305w25.html_para3">Work to provide more stringent treatment (nitrogen removal) at six qualifying treatment works is expected to be completed by end 2004. 180 bathing waters (already identified under the Bathing Waters Regulations 1991) in England are also to be identified as Sensitive Areas as discharges from qualifying sewage treatment works receive, or are to receive by 2005 more stringent treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) to fulfil standards of those regulations.
<P>

<a name="20305w25.html_para4">Funding for these improvements have already been provided for in the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) Periodic Review of water company price limits for the five-year period from 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what her definition is of a high-ranking university as mentioned in Chapter 4 of "14&#150;19: extending opportunities, raising standards"; and if she will collect information regarding the socio-economic background of students entering such institutions to enable comparisons with those entering other universities.  [38091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The reference to "high ranking universities" is to those universities which have particularly demanding entry requirements, as the higher award is based on at least ABB grades at A level plus one AS level or on an NVQ level 4. The Higher Education Funding Council for England already collects and publishes information on the social class of students entering higher education, which is broken down by institution. It published the information for the academic year 1999&#150;2000, "Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK", last December (HEFCE Report 01/69). This is available on the HEFCE website at www.hefce.ac.uk/pi.

<a name="20305w27.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reason the Government are collecting the names and addresses of all children; and how this information will be used.  [38482]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department is collecting the names of most children, but not the addresses of any. This January we introduced the "Pupil Level Annual Schools Census" (PLASC) for maintained schools in England. Schools provided a list of the pupils on their register together with each pupil's name, "unique pupil number" (UPN), home postcode (not full address), and other details such as ethnic group, special educational needs and eligibility for free school meals. This information will be combined with details of Key Stage assessment and examination results collected separately from schools, marking agencies and exam boards, and with future PLASC returns, to create statistical profiles of pupils. The Department has no interest in the identity of individual pupils as such. However pupil names (in addition to UPNs) are needed to ensure that all data relating to the same pupil are collated correctly, and therefore that the statistical profiles are accurate. Within the Department only technical staff directly engaged in the data collation process will have access to pupil names.
<P>

<a name="20305w27.html_para0">Analysis of these statistical profiles will provide major new information to help schools, LEAs, the Department and other educational agencies in the drive to raise standards. It will also enable groups of pupils (such as ethnic minorities) who may be under-achieving to be identified far more effectively so that programmes can be developed or improved to meet their needs. Home postcodes too will be used for statistical purposes only. The postcode mix of a school's pupils provides an indication of socio-economic background which can be taken into account (along with other factors) in comparing the performance of different schools and setting targets for improvement. Postcode information also enables neighbourhood analyses to be carried out.
<P>

<a name="20305w27.html_para1">Certain limited disclosures of PLASC data with pupil names may take place provided these comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and any other legislative requirements. For further details I refer the hon. Member to my answer on 28 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 109&#150;11W to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington).

 Funding is not made available for specific categories of special educational need.

This includes the duty to identify children's individual special educational needs and to deliver the most appropriate provision to meet those needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to promote the level of apprenticeships in the UK.  [39897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Last November, at the launch of the new generation of Modern Apprenticeships, the Secretary of State announced a &#163;16 million marketing campaign, to be run over three years in England, to promote apprenticeships and boost participation. That campaign, led jointly by the Department and the Learning and Skills Council, starts on 4 March with a new television advertisement, aimed at young people, which will run until the end of the month.
<P>

<a name="20305w28.html_para2">From the spring, a range of marketing measures will be introduced to reach not only young people, but also key influencers and employers. At the local level, Learning and Skills Councils, Connexions Partnerships, careers services and other partners will work together to raise awareness of, and foster support for, Modern Apprenticeships; and to provide young people with essential information and advice on the opportunities available in their communities. It is a key role of National Training Organisations and their successors the Sector Skills Councils in partnership with the LSC to ensure that employers continue to support MA and that they provide sufficient places to meet the demand from young people.
<P>

<a name="20305w28.html_para3">Marketing and promotion of MAs in the rest of the country is for the devolved Administrations.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> All applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields received since 16 July 2001 have been scrutinised by an independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel. The panel comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the education organisation Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association. The purpose of the panel is to advise on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria, and to recommend either acceptance or rejection.
<P>

<a name="20305w29.html_para0">There have been 25 applications since 16 July 2001 to dispose of areas equal to, or larger than, a sports pitch. We are still assessing 17 of these applications and have approved the other eight, five of which are at school sites that are either closed or due for closure. Of the approved applications at the three operating schools, two will provide sports halls and a new all-weather pitch. The other approved application involves the granting of a lease as part of a Private Finance Initiative scheme to provide modern education facilities.

Recent changes to the student funding system apply to undergraduate rather than postgraduate students.

 Successful drug education programmes convey both knowledge and skills, particularly social skills, with the aim of enabling pupils to make informed choices. The Department for Education and Skills works very closely with schools, local education authorities and the police to ensure they are involved in the policy making process. In the last eight months officials have received correspondence from schools and parents; have worked closely with local education authorities on a drug, alcohol and tobacco education training package for teachers and have discussed drug education with the Metropolitan police and the Home Office via correspondence and at several meetings.

authorities in determining whether to report offences involving the theft of mobile phones to the police.  [40007]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w29.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The DfES is concerned for the safety and security of school pupils and staff, and in 1997 issued guidance on school security jointly with the Home Office. This guidance, "School Security: Dealing with Troublemakers", deals with incidents, including thefts, that occur on school premises, and advises schools and local education authorities that offences of theft need to be reported to the police. The guidance does not preclude a pupil or parent reporting any such offence independently.
<P>

<a name="20305w29.html_para4">Where a school's insurer lays down terms and conditions for the reporting of theft, we expect a school to meet them.
<P>

<a name="20305w29.html_para5">However, we recognise that school pupils are vulnerable to theft on the way to and from school. If a mobile phone is stolen in such circumstances, it is then a matter for the victim and their parents to report it to the police. They may also wish to inform the school so that the head teacher and local education authority may be able to see if any pattern of crime is arising, and to consider the need for advising pupils and their parents of any consequent action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many cases involving the theft of mobile phones were dealt with by school authorities, without the involvement of the police, in the last two years.  [40011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w29.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We do not collect these figures, nor would it be economic to request them from schools or local education authorities.
<P>

<a name="20305w29.html_para6">The reporting of criminal incidents to the police is the responsibility of the head teacher of a school. Guidance was issued to head teachers in 1997 by the then Department for Education and Employment, jointly with the Home Office. This guidance, "School Security: Dealing with Troublemakers", advised schools and local education authorities that offences of theft need to be reported to the police.
<P>

<a name="20305w29.html_para7">The procedure by which such offences are reported should be determined by discussion between schools and the police. In the case of the schools which they maintain, local education authorities also have a key role in monitoring overall security policies. But the primary responsibility for planning a school's security arrangements rests with the governing body of the school.

<P>

<a name="20305w30.html_para5">During the course of last year, the Department wrote to all existing pensioners, and those whose state pension age falls before 5 October 2002 to reassure them that, in the event of their death, the new rules on Inherited SERPS will not affect their spouses.

<a name="20305w30.html_para6">We are now going further to ensure that people understand the changes.

<P>

 A survey of Cabinet Office staff in 2001 indicated that at least 4.7 per cent. of staff undertook a wide range of voluntary activities.

<P>
<a name="20305w30.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The latest figures for October 2001 released on 21 February show that the civil service is making progress on tackling under-representation at senior levels:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>25.3 per cent. of the senior civil service are women, up from 17.8 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&#150;05 is 35 per cent.

21.2 per cent. of those in the top 600 posts are women, up from 12.7 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&#150;05 is 25 per cent.
<P>
<BR>
 <sup>1</sup> 2.3 per cent. of staff at senior civil service level are from a minority ethnic background, up from 1.6 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&#150;05 is 3.2 per cent.

<BR>
 <sup>1</sup> 1.8 per cent. of staff at senior civil service level have a disability, up from 1.5 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&#150;05 is 3 per cent.

<a name="20305w30.html_para11">Individual Departments and agencies have specific initiatives in place to tackle under-representation at senior levels. These are supported by a number of central initiatives, all of which are publicised widely across Government.
<P>

<a name="20305w30.html_para12">In June 2001, the Cabinet Office launched the Elevator Partnerships, as a pilot informal mentoring scheme for women. The aim of the scheme is partnership between 50 senior women and 50 junior women who appear to be static in career terms, with the aim of encouraging career confidence.
<P>

<a name="20305w30.html_para13">All Departments were given the opportunity to participate in the pilot. An evaluation of the pilot in the summer will be used to encourage Departments to set up similar schemes.
<P>

<a name="20305w30.html_para14">The Cabinet Office has launched "Pathways", a central development programme targeted at minority ethnic staff with the potential to rise to senior levels. There is an annual trawl across all Departments for participants and there is a page dedicated to the scheme on the civil service website.
<P>

<a name="20305w30.html_para15">There is also an annual bursary scheme for disabled civil servants who have the potential to reach a senior management position (at least Grade 7) in the civil service. The scheme provides access and funding for training opportunities and personal development. Applications are invited annually through advertisements in Government publications.

 In common with other sculptures at the dome site, NMEC paid only for construction and installation in order to keep the cost affordable. Ownership rights remain with Anthony Gormley, therefore. He has, however, made it clear that he wishes the sculpture to remain on the site. The necessary permissions are being pursued to make this happen.

 The provision of ice sports facilities is a matter for local authorities to consider. Local authorities are best placed to determine the level of provision required in the light of local needs and the appropriate mixture of public and private provision.
<P>

<a name="20305w32.html_para4">The Government support the provision of sport and leisure facilities through various means including funding from the Sports Lottery Fund, administered by Sport England. It is for local authorities to apply for this funding. No applications have been received for any new ice sports facilities in Gloucestershire.
<P>

<a name="20305w32.html_para5">Sport England have informed us there are no plans for the provision of an ice sports facility in Gloucestershire. Sport England's regional strategy report in 1995 recognised the need for new ice sport facilities in the south-west. As ice rinks are relatively expensive to build, any applications for lottery funding would be considered in the context of Sport England's priorities.

 Following a recommendation in the March 2001 Government's Plan for Sport, a review of the role that further and higher education can play in the delivery of sport was undertaken by a national advisory group.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> There are no plans to include church organs in the list of eligible criteria for the listed places of worship scheme. In devising a scheme that is as simple and straightforward as possible to operate, the Government have kept as close as possible to the existing VAT law for listed building alterations, so that if and when a reduced rate is introduced, its scope will mirror as nearly as possible that of the grant scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w33.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The BBC, as Television Licensing Authority, contracts the day to day administration and enforcement of the licensing system to its agent, TV Licensing (TVL). While there is clearly no benefit in visiting an address if it is known that there is no television receiver there, this information is not always available without a visit. I understand that, in the past, a declaration that no television was in use at an address was normally accepted by TV Licensing as proof of the matter, but that a significant proportion of such declarations turn out to be false. The BBC has indicated that its current policy is therefore that TV Licensing should visit all addresses in respect of which it has received a declaration that no television is in use.
<P>

<a name="20305w33.html_para1">TV Licensing officials may enter a person's home only with their consent or if authorised to do so by a warrant issued by a magistrate. Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 (as amended), in order to issue such a warrant a magistrate must be satisfied, by information provided on oath, that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under the Act has been or is being committed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what impact free museum entry in London has had on admission numbers.  [39751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w34.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There has been a 76 per cent. increase in visitors on average at those museums and galleries in London which previously charged for admission, in the two months following the introduction of free entry compared with the same period in 2000&#150;01. This is a tremendous endorsement of the Government's free access policy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w34.html_wqn1"><B> David Wright: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proposals are being considered to expand the programme of free museum entry across the United Kingdom.  [39750]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w34.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There are no plans to extend free entry to museums beyond free entry to the permanent collections of the main museums and galleries in England to which the Government are committed to ensure universal free access. Entry to the national museums in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is a matter for their devolved Administrations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport which television channels are subject to a must-carry requirement on <i>(a)</i> digital satellite, <i>(b)</i> digital terrestrial and <i>(c)</i> digital cable.  [38956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w34.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 No television channels are, in practice, subject to a must-carry requirement.
<P>

<a name="20305w34.html_para0">For satellite, access is a matter of commercial negotiation, and is regulated by Oftel under the Advanced Television Services Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/3151), as amended by SI 1996/3197.
<P>

<a name="20305w34.html_para1">In the case of digital services carried by cable, the ITC can, under section 78A of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (as amended), require digital local delivery services to carry public service television channels; but has not considered it appropriate to do so.
<P>

<a name="20305w34.html_para2">In the case of digital terrestrial television, provision exists in section 28 of the 1996 Act, and through the allocation of radio spectrum by the Secretary of State under section 65 of the 1990 Act and section 6 of the 1996 Act, by which sufficient space is reserved on multiplexes for the carriage of public service channels.

<P>
<a name="20305w34.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Digital Television Action Plan, issued on 20 December, sets out a series of actions, with intended completion dates, for Government and stakeholders collectively to determine and agree a target level of coverage for digital terrestrial television and to produce a plan to achieve this. We commenced a three-month consultation on 11 December to inform the spectrum planning process. It is for the digital broadcasters to determine proposals to develop the digital terrestrial transmission network, in consultation with the Independent Television Commission and the Radiocommunications Agency.

<a name="20305w35.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the outcome has been of the Government Task Force set up to help sports find alternative sources of revenue to replace tobacco sponsorship, with particular reference to darts; and if she will make a statement.  [40481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Tobacco Task Force last met in October 1999. Following that meeting it was agreed that the task force had completed its initial work of identifying the needs of sports affected by the ban on tobacco sponsorship. Those sports included in the task force confirmed that it was too soon to be looking to replace existing contracts, and that the situation should be reviewed before the expiry of current contracts. We have been in contact with the member sports since 1999 and will consider the case for reconvening the task force if requested to.
<P>

<a name="20305w35.html_para0">I have recently been contacted by the British Darts Association. I have confirmed that I am happy to assist the association in discussions with alternative sponsors as and when interested companies are identified.

 Since November 2000 the Independent Healthcare Association has collected monthly data from independent health care providers about the number of NHS patients treated by them. According to data made available to the Department by the IHA, in the calendar year 2001 at least 71,750 procedures were carried out in the independent sector in England, paid for by the NHS. This includes out-patient appointments, day cases and in-patient treatment.

Information on the number, remit and membership of task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews has been published by the Cabinet Office on a regular basis. The first report was published on 11 January 2000 and gives information for the period between 1 May 1997 to 31 October 1999. A second report was published on 27 July 2000, and covered the period 1 November 1999 to 30 April 2000.

The most recent report: "Task forces, Ad Hoc Advisory Groups and Reviews", which was issued in October 2001, covers the period of the financial year 2000&#150;01. Copies of these reports are available in the Library.

<a name="20305w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 HM Treasury commissioned a report by Derek Wanless, "Securing our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term View" to review the technological, demographic and medical trends over the next two decades that will affect the national health service. An interim report has been issued for consultation. A final report is expected later this year.

<a name="20305w36.html_para1">The Government are committed to making more medicines more widely available where it is safe to do so and the training and information needs of health care professionals and patients is an integral part in this process.

 Information is not available in the form requested. Although efforts have been made to quantify catchment populations at a trust level, all calculations are based on ward-resident populations. Therefore cancer network populations are more appropriate. Cancer services are provided by cancer networks which bring together primary and community care and secondary care services. Data on cancer network populations for England are shown in the table. Further information is available at http:// www.canceruk.net/catchment/catchment.htm.

 The national strategy for sexual health and HIV prioritises the HIV prevention needs of groups most affected by HIV, including people from, or with links to, high prevalence countries (currently in Africa), injecting drug misusers and men who have sex with men.

 Primary care trusts will be responsible locally for organising and supporting the appraisal of each of their general practitioners (GPs). The GP appraisal framework, issued by the Department, makes clear that in discharging this function, each PCT will be expected to establish effective procedures to deal with worries or concerns from individual GPs about the process or outcomes of appraisal.

<P>
<a name="20305w38.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Research commissioned by the Department suggests that the average time commitment for the appraisee will be between 4&#189; to 6&#189; hours. However this will vary between different GPs. In addition, the appraisal process will in some cases systemise existing arrangements in GP practices or Personal Medical Services pilots for monitoring and reviewing professional development. The GP appraisal framework makes clear that primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible locally for organising and resourcing the new appraisal system. The 2002&#150;03 health authority revenue resource limits circular (HSC 2001/024) made clear that PCTs should identify resources to support the new system and that they should have a funded policy on the provision of locum cover.

 The appraisal documentation requires the general practitioner being appraised to include consideration of his or her relationships with patients. Examples of documentation which may be used to inform this aspect of the appraisal includes patient survey data; significant event reports; any complaints or other representations received from patients, including any appreciative feedback.

 The primary aim of appraisal is to help general practitioners consolidate and improve on good performance. Appraisal will support the continuing personal and professional development of GPs.
<P>

<a name="20305w38.html_para6">The appraisal will not result in a pass or fail. It should conclude by setting down, as an action plan, the agreements that have been reached about what each party is committed to doing. This should include the essentials of the personal development plan (PDP). The appraisal should identify individual needs that will be addressed through the PDP. The appraiser and appraisee should review progress against the PDP and these actions during the course of the year and at the next appraisal discussion.
<P>

<a name="20305w38.html_para7">It should be exceptional for serious concerns about performance to be first raised in an appraisal. However, where it becomes apparent, during the appraisal process, that there is a potentially serious performance issue, which requires further discussion, the appraiser must refer the matter immediately to the PCT clinical governance lead or PCT Chief Executive to take appropriate action. This may for example include referral to any support arrangements that may be in place.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> The Department is aware of relevant epidemiological studies of childhood cancers, birth defects, and respiratory health, chromosomal aberrations, thyroid hormone levels, and pollutant levels in children, in relation to incinerators. Nearly all of these studies were conducted in countries other than the United Kingdom and are of an older generation of incinerators which would fail to meet current requirements for pollution control and emission standards for municipal incinerators in this country. The studies fail to provide convincing evidence that municipal incinerators affect children's health.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year.<P>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>

3. The expenditure is the total spent on commissioning health care by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The majority of drugs expenditure in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 and a smaller element in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.<P>

4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&#150;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>





5. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are therefore not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.<P>

<a name="20305w39.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The organisation, funding and delivery of care should be a matter for member states to reflect the specific care needs of our population. However, we have much to learn from each other and it is important that we share common experience and best practice to promote a high level of health care and care for all EU citizens in view of the challenges presented by an aging population. This is best achieved by co-operation on a bilateral and multi-lateral level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance his Department issues to health authorities on handling situations where patients released after delayed discharge refuse to leave the hospital.  [39312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w40.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> A patient's discharge is only regarded as delayed when the hospital team's assessment is that the patient no longer needs treatment in a hospital bed and that they can safely be cared for elsewhere. When this assessment has been made the patient does not have a right indefinitely to occupy a hospital bed. A patient can, however, refuse to be discharged to a care home. In this case, social services staff, together with the hospital, community health services, the patient and any family and carers, will need to explore alternatives. Ultimately a package of health and social care to support the patient in their own home (or alternative accommodation, if their own home is now unsuitable), should be put together to allow the patient to be discharged.

The registration period for adults was changed from 24 months to 15 months for new registrations in September 1996. For children, registrations used to lapse at the end of the calendar year after attendance at the dentist; since September 1996 the registration period is 15 months. These changes began to affect registration numbers in December 1997.

<P>
<a name="20305w42.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> NHS ProCure 21 aims to deliver better capital procurement in the national health service, through programmes on better design, enabling the NHS to be a better client, performance management and partnering. The first three elements apply to all capital schemes in the NHS. Partnering is currently being piloted in the north-west and west midlands regions. The selection of Principal Supply Chain Partners is currently in progress, and an evaluation will be made once the partnering programme is under way and a decision taken on how quickly we will be able to roll it out nationally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures have been put in place to ensure an increase in the number of vocational training places for general practice; how many places have been available in each of the last 10 years; and what estimate he has made of the number of places available in each of the next three years. the Minister of State, Department of Health,  [38460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> We do not have data available centrally on the number of vocational training scheme places. Doctors on vocational training schemes represent only a proportion of those training for general practice, as there are other training routes.
<P>

<a name="20305w42.html_para0">All doctors training for a career in general practice must undertake a period training as a General Practice Registrar. We have a target to increase General Practice Registrar numbers by 550 by 2004. To accommodate these increases, we are investing significant resources in the general practice training infrastructure (&#163;9 million over three years) and in developing training practice premises (&#163;30 million over the same period). We also removed, last November, the outdated restrictions that had previously prevented overseas doctors receiving NHS funding when undertaking General Practice Registrar training.

<a name="20305w42.html_para1">Recruitment to General Practice Registrar training is healthy. Numbers have risen, year on year, for the last five years. The attached table shows the figures for the last 10 years. Last year numbers increased by 224 on the previous year, exceeding our target increase of 150. As a result of the measures we have put in place, we expect growth to continue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many patients have travelled to EU countries specifically for NHS funded treatment in each of the last four months.  [39780]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20305w42.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> Under the pilot scheme to send national health service patients abroad currently under way in south-east England 18 patients travelled in January and 41 in February. 12 patients are due to travel on Friday 1 March. We expect up to 200 patients to travel overseas for treatment as part of the pilot.
<P>

<a name="20305w42.html_para3">The Department has authorised a total of 327 E112 applications since the beginning of November 2001, permitting patients to receive treatment, maternity care or continuing care in other countries of the European Economic Area, funded by the NHS. 85 applications were authorised in November, 72 in December, 94 in January and 76 have so far been authorised in February. (These figures are GB figures, as the Department administers this scheme on behalf of Scotland and Wales.) However, the fact that a given number of forms were authorised in a given period does not necessarily mean that the same number of patients actually received treatment overseas in that period.
