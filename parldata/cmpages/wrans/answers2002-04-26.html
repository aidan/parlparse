 I have approached the Chairman of the Liaison Committee with a view to appearing before Select Committee Chairmen to discuss domestic and international affairs every six months. Further discussions will continue with the Liaison Committee and the House Authorities to work out the precise details. These sessions will be held in public and will give Select Committee Chairmen the opportunity to ask me a range of in-depth questions. I will of course continue to account to Parliament weekly on the issues of the day during Prime Minister's Questions on a Wednesday.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the lost income from empty council housing was broken down by local authority in England, in each of the last three years. [42234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Lost income from empty council housing can be due to two main sources: <i>(a)</i> lost rent and <i>(b)</i> lost council tax.
<P>

<a name="20426w01.html_para1">(a) I refer the hon. Member to my answer of 11 February, <i>Official Report</i>, column 32W concerning the lost rental income from empty council dwellings in 200/01. The figures for 1998/99 and 199/00 have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the Government's policy on the provision of social and affordable housing in villages; and how proposals in the planning Green Paper would affect this. [52333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Our planning policies encourage the provision of affordable housing on allocated sites in villages and through the "rural exception policy". The exception policy is a special provision that applies only to rural areas and to sites, within or adjoining a village, where permission would not otherwise be given for new housing development. We have proposed to replace the present system of negotiated planning obligations with a tariff set by local authorities which will widen the type of developments contributing to affordable housing. The tariff would be spent in line with the priorities set out in local development plans, based on local and regional assessment. We expect the provision of affordable housing to be a high priority.

<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government issued "Guidance on Councillors" Allowances, Tax and Social Security Benefits" to local authorities, including passenger transport authorities, in August 1997. In April 2000 the Department issued an appendix to Joint Circular 1/86 setting out the maximum rates of travel and subsistence allowance which may be paid to members of local authorities, including passenger transport authorities.

<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2002]:</i> Four sub-groups have been set up to help target the advice members of the Urban Sounding Board give to Ministers. The sub groups cover:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
(i) the obstacles to effective physical regeneration and how these might be addressed (led by Prof. Brian Robson);
<BR>
(ii) how good practice in urban design quality and public space provision might be adopted more widely (led by Robin Nicholson);

(iv) how to make the Urban Summit, to be held in Birmingham on 31 October/1 November, a worthwhile experience for all those expected to attend (led by Prof. Michael Parkinson).

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20426w01.html_para3">They are informal, short-term groups of members tasked with taking forward discussion on the above issues and identifying areas for possible action. The groups are made up of members of the Urban Sounding Board and others with particular interests and expertise invited by the sub-group leader. Their findings will be considered by the Urban Sounding Board as a whole.

<a name="20426w01.html_sbhd10"><H4><center>Telecommunications Masts</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many telecommunications masts are located in areas of outstanding natural beauty, world heritage sites and other conservation areas; and what these locations are.  [52292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Department does not hold information about the number or locations of existing mobile phone masts.
<P>

<a name="20426w01.html_para4">However, the Radiocommunications Agency have made information available to the public via their website (www.radio.gov.uk). The database, called "Sitefinder", gives details about all operational mobile phone base stations and their emissions. Sitefinder employs a "user-friendly" map-based facility indicating the location of cellular phone base stations. More information on a particular base station is available by simply clicking on the position indicator for the base station in question.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what measures are being taken to minimise the number of telecommunications masts that are sited in areas of outstanding natural beauty, world heritage sites and other conservation areas.  [52291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Proposals to install telecommunications masts are for the Local Planning Authority to determine in the first instance, taking account of local planning policies and national planning policy guidance. Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 8 (revised) (PPG8). Advice on proposed development in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks is given in PPG7&#151;The Countryside. Advice on proposed development in world heritage sites and conservation areas is given in PPG15&#151;Planning and the Historic Environment.
<P>

<a name="20426w01.html_para5">The Government attaches great importance to minimising the impact of telecommunications development on the environment. Our policy is to encourage mast and site sharing and to make good use of existing buildings and other structures for the siting of antennas. The mobile phone industry has pledged to provide local planning authorities with annual rollout plans for each authority's area. We strongly encourage the use of pre-rollout discussions based upon these plans and collaboration between the operators and authorities as a means of overcoming potential technical and environmental constraints, particularly in designated areas. These discussions should also provide an early opportunity to explore possible alternative approaches, 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2002 : Column 467W</I><P>
particularly the opportunities for mast and site sharing and also in terms of the location and alternative design of the apparatus.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will issue guidance to the Planning Inspectorate on the interpretation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the determination of appeals.  [52598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Inspectors received extensive training on human rights matters prior to the coming into force of the Human Rights Act. Inspectors are kept appraised of key Court judgments involving various Convention rights.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_wqn1"><B> Hugh Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to amend the regulations governing rights of abode for gypsy families.  [52597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The main legislation governing rights of abode for Gypsy families are the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960, and the subsequent Caravan Sites Act of 1968.
<P>

<a name="20426w02.html_para0">There are no current plans to amend the legislation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_wqn2"><B> Hugh Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what guidance his Department issues to the Planning Inspectorate in determining appeals concerning gypsy families.  [52599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government's policy on Gypsy sites and planning is set out in Circular 1/94. This puts Gypsies on the same footing as others in relation to the planning system whilst recognising their special accommodation needs. Inspectors will also have regard to other relevant planning policies set out in Planning Policy Guidance Notes and Circulars. As with all planning decisions, each must be considered on its particular circumstances and merits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on his response to those parish and town councillors who are refusing to sign the new declaration of interests.  [52329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 As we have consistently explained, Parish councillors have for many years been subject to a Code which includes the requirement to declare their interests. The new Code, which includes a new requirement to complete a register of interests, has been supported by the National Association of Local Councils and the Association of Larger Local Councils, and by the majority of Parish Councils who responded to our consultation. I would encourage all councillors to accept the new Code.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the instances in which breaches of declaration of interest by parish and town councillors have been reported to his Department.  [52330]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 There is no requirement for such breaches to be reported to my Department. Under section 58 of the Local Government Act 2000, written allegations of a councillor breaching the new code of conduct are to be sent to the Standards Board for England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department provides support for improving and maintaining rural bus services by means of the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant and Rural Bus Challenge schemes. A total of &#163;198 million has been allocated to those two schemes for the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20426w02.html_para1">In addition, the Countryside Agency supports small-scale rural transport projects, such as community mini-buses, through its Rural Transport Partnership scheme for which &#163;32 million is available for the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the role of the Traffic Commissioners with specific regard to the maintenance and enhancement of bus servies in rural areas.  [52332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Traffic Commissioners have no role in the provision of individual bus services. That is entirely a matter for the bus operator, and the relevant local authority if the service is subsidised.
<P>

<a name="20426w02.html_para3">All local bus services must have their particulars registered with the relevant Traffic Commissioner. Operators can face disciplinary action by the Commissioner if they do not operate the service as described in the registration. A new, more flexible penalty power comes into force on 1 May.

<P>

<a name="20426w02.html_para6">During 2001, the Internal Management Consultancy Branch of the Cabinet Office undertook a review of Central Services (Personnel, Finance and Accommodation).

 We are committed to helping Incapacity Benefit (IB) recipients into work where they wish to do so and to provide security for those who cannot. Since 22 October 2001, people making new or repeat claims to IB in the Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices are required to participate in a Jobcentre Plus interview and a review at least every three years.
<P>

<a name="20426w03.html_para0">The reviews enable IB customers to discuss with their Personal Advisor the help, benefits and opportunities available to them. The interviews also provide an ideal opportunity for people to participate in the New Deal schemes.
<P>

<a name="20426w03.html_para1">For many people the key aim of the review is to ensure that they are receiving the right level of benefit. For others we can show them the help and support that is available to enable them to move back into full or part-time work.

<P>
<a name="20426w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 If a police officer has any suspicion that a person held in police custody may be mentally disordered or mentally handicapped, he must apply special protections for that person as set out in the relevant code of practice (Code C) issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). These include summoning an "appropriate adult" to assist and advise the detained person and (where the person appears to be suffering from a mental disorder) calling for the police surgeon.
<P>

<a name="20426w04.html_para0">Persons with a history of mental illness are subject to the same rules covering length of detention as other detainees. Under PACE where a person has been arrested for an offence they may be detained in police custody for up to 24 hours without being charged. This period can be extended to 36 hours by a police officer of the rank of Superintendent or above where a person is arrested for a serious arrestable offence. Further periods of detention up to a maximum of 96 hours can be approved by a magistrates' court.
<P>

<a name="20426w04.html_para1">Where a person arrested is charged with an offence they must be released from police detention unless certain conditions apply, such as where the custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person charged will fail to appear in court to answer to bail. Where such a person is kept in police detention they must be brought 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2002 : Column 478W</I><P>
before the relevant magistrates' court as soon as is practicable and normally not later than the first sitting after they are charged with the offence.
<P>

<a name="20426w04.html_para2">Where a person charged with an offence is arrested on warrant for failing to attend a magistrates' court, they must be taken back to that magistrates' court as soon as practicable. If a person is arrested in a different part of the country they must appear not later than the first sitting of the magistrates' court after their transfer back to the relevant area.
<P>

<a name="20426w04.html_para3">All persons detained in police custody have their detention reviewed on a regular basis. The first review is no later than six hours after the detention was first authorised. The second review is no later than nine hours after the first review. Subsequent reviews are at intervals of not more than nine hours.
<P>

<a name="20426w04.html_para4">A mentally disordered or mentally handicapped person who has been detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 can be taken to a police station as a place of safety to be assessed. The person can be detained only until such time as they have been interviewed and examined by an approved social worker and a registered medical practitioner, and suitable arrangements have been made for their treatment and care.
<P>

<a name="20426w04.html_para5">There are currently several strands of work focused on improving police practice in relation to mentally ill individuals. The Home Office, the Department of Health and the Association of Chief Police Officers are considering the development of national protocols covering the interaction between the police and health services in dealing with the mentally ill. The current review of the PACE Codes of Practice is seeking to strengthen further the protections for mentally ill detainees, particularly in terms of assessing their vulnerabilities and fitness for interview. In addition, the review of the Mental Health Act which is underway recognises that police cells are not generally appropriate places for assessing whether a person needs medical treatment.

 Information on the accommodation of prisoners after release is not recorded centrally for all prisoners. However a survey of prisoners' resettlement has recently been carried out for the Prison Service. This involved interviews with a representative sample of about 2000 prisoners shortly before discharge. It will provide information about the proportion reporting in the last two-three weeks of sentence that they have no accommodation to go to on release. Results will be available shortly.

<P>
<a name="20426w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We have not received a request from the United States for assistance with the deployment of a missile defence system. It would be premature, therefore, to make an assessment of the work that might be required to upgrade the facilities at RAF Fylingdales or RAF Menwith Hill for missile defence purposes, and how long such work might take. The costs associated with any such upgrading would be first and foremost a matter for the United States.

 We have no indication of the timing of any possible requests from the United States to build an X-band radar in the UK, nor do we work on the assumption that such a radar would necessarily be sited in the UK. I cannot therefore give a timescale for any UK decisions which might be required.

 The Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) was established in July 1993. Any Serviceman or Service woman, including those who have since left the UK armed forces, and Ministry of Defence civilians, who served in the Gulf at any time between August 1990 and July 1991, or who believe that their health has suffered as a direct result of the Gulf conflict can apply. Individuals who worked for contractors providing direct support to UK operations during the Gulf conflict may also be seen. All patients are seen following referral from their general practitioner or their armed forces medical officer. As at 19 April 2002, GVMAP consultants had physically examined 3,117 members and former members of the armed forces. This equates to 5.8 per cent of all UK armed forces deployed. Further information about the GVMAP can be obtained from my Department's web site: www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar or by telephoning Freephone 0800 169 5401.

 The DMO's targets for 2002&#150;2003 are set out below, together with a brief commentary on last year's outturn in relation to the comparable target. The DMO is today also publishing its Business Plan for 2002&#150;2003. I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library. The DMO, with HM Treasury, will in due course be reviewing its planning objectives in the light of the decision that I announced on 25 March to integrate the National Debt Office (NDO) and the Public Works Loans Board (PWLB) into the DMO with effect from 1 July 2002.
<i>Targets for the Debt Management Office 2002&#150;03</i>
<P>

<a name="20426w09.html_para2">1. To ensure full compliance with the Government's remit for the DMO as set out in the Debt and Reserves Management Report 2002&#150;03, within the tolerances and subject to the review triggers notified separately to the Office and consistent with the objectives of monetary policy. <i>[Target met in 2001&#150;02]</i>

To ensure that the maximum time taken to issue the results of gilt auctions does not exceed 40 minutes, that for structured Treasury Bill tenders does not exceed 30 minutes, and that for ad hoc Treasury Bill or other tenders does not exceed 15 minutes, while achieving complete accuracy. <i>[Target met in 2001&#150;02]</i>
<P>

<a name="20426w09.html_para4">3. To achieve complete accuracy, within agreed accounting tolerances, in the recording and reporting of transactions through the Debt Management Account (DMA), and in delivering money (and reconciling payments) to the National Loans Fund (NLF) and to meet the statutory deadlines for publication or submission for audit of the annual accounts of the DMO Agency, and DMA. <i>[First half of target met in 2001&#150;02. The second half relating to timeliness of publication of accounts was also met].</i>

<a name="20426w09.html_para6">5. To achieve less than 6 breaches of the operational market notices (excluding any breaches that the Treasury accept were beyond control of the Office). <i>[Equivalent target met in 2001&#150;02]</i>

<P>

<a name="20426w09.html_para10">To release all market sensitive data on announcements in a timely manner and to achieve no more than 10 factual errors in material published by the DMO, including on the web site (insofar as the material is under the control of the DMO and not third parties). <i>[Equivalent target&#151;which required complete accuracy covering also immaterial errors&#151;not met in 2001&#150;02. In particular on 14 March 2002 there was a premature release onto the web site of market sensitive information on the breakdown of planned gilt sales in 2002&#150;03.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many new tariffs the EU has imposed on imported goods in the past 10 years.  [52307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w10.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20426w10.html_para0">The Common Customs Tariff of the EU has over 10,400 tariff lines. Over the past ten years the EU has progressively reduced its tariffs in accordance with its GATT/WTO obligations. Over the same period for most tariff lines "preferential" (i.e. lower) rates have been charged on imports from a range of countries. In addition, on around 1000 tariff lines the EU has autonomously suspended duties on goods not produced or not available in sufficient quantity in the Community. As well as reducing tariffs, the EU has introduced anti-dumping or countervailing duties in response to unfair trade.
<P>

<a name="20426w10.html_para1">Within this complex framework of multilateral obligations, preferential agreements, tariff nomenclature changes, autonomous suspensions and remedies to unfair trade, the EU has imposed and modified a wide range of duties.
<P>

<a name="20426w10.html_para2">The detail of all these changes could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what the rate of <i>(a)</i> infant mortality, <i>(b)</i> still births and <i>(c)</i> birth defects in (i) 1985, (ii) 1986 and (iii) 1987 was for the old County of Clwyd.  [51533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year of age, per 1,000 live births) was 10.9 per cent in 1985, 8.7 per cent in 1986 and 10.2 per cent in 1987 for the county of Clwyd.
<P>

<a name="20426w10.html_para3">The still birth rates was 6.4 per cent in 1985, 5.3 per cent in 1986 and 5.0 per cent in 1987 for the county of Clwyd. These figures are based on still births of 28 or more complete weeks gestation per 1,000 births. The legal definition of a still birth was altered on 1 October 1992 to include babies born dead between 24 and 27 weeks.
<P>

<a name="20426w10.html_para4">The babies notified to the National Congenital Anomaly System for mothers resident in the former Clwyd health authority was 20.5 per cent in 1985, 17.7 per cent in 1986 and 12.1 per cent in 1987, per 1,000 live and stillbirths. Reporting to this system is voluntary, and differences may reflect changes in reporting practice rather than true changes in prevalence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES), now marketed as The Warm Front Team.
<P>

<a name="20426w11.html_para1">The New HEES was launched on 1st June 2000, replacing the more basic scheme that had operated since 1991. The Scheme is administered by two scheme managers, TXU Warm Front Limited (Eastern, East Midlands & Yorkshire and the Humber) and Eaga Partnership Limited (the rest of England).
<P>

<a name="20426w11.html_para2">The original scheme provided low income and disabled households with a single main insulation improvement, or a combination of smaller measures, mainly in the social housing sector. The new Scheme provides packages of insulation and heating measures, linked to the condition of the property and the householder's needs and is focussed on the private sector. To provide these packages the grant maximum was increased from &#163;315 to &#163;2,500 in the case of low-income households aged 60 years or more.
<P>

<a name="20426w11.html_para3">Under the original. Scheme, the role of the scheme manager was relatively limited. Their main role was the management and payment of appointed installers. The average management cost per household was &#163;15 excluding recoverable VAT.
<P>

<a name="20426w11.html_para4">The current Scheme introduced a significant shift in the role and responsibilities of the scheme managers. They are now responsible for marketing the scheme, the set up and maintenance of local referral networks, carrying out independent surveys of properties, providing householders with energy efficiency advice, advising and agreeing the most appropriate measures for properties, recruiting and managing heating and insulation contractors through open competition, and managing payments to contractors for work completed. This additional work has increased the average administration cost to &#163;77 for EAGA and &#163;86 for TXU per household excluding recoverable VAT. These costs exclude one-off start-up costs paid by the Department.
<P>

<a name="20426w11.html_para5">In the current scheme, the average cost for HEES installers has reduced to reflect the shift of responsibility for activities outlined above.

 The information requested is held on legacy systems which are neither flexible nor user friendly. A county breakdown is available for SCPS, BSPS, SPS, VCSPS, SAP & HFA schemes at the time of interrogation and is available in the Library of the House. It is not available for EPS. New flexible systems are being developed as part of the Rural Payment Agency change programme which should provide a range of statistical interrogation functions.

<a name="20426w11.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the recent change in the farmgate price of milk on the future viability of dairy farming; and what recent representations she has received from the dairy industry regarding agrimonetary compensation available to dairy farmers.  [51454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This year has witnessed considerable pressure on the farmgate price of milk, due in a large part to weak international markets for dairy commodities and to high current levels of domestic milk production. Official figures show that in February the average farmgate price of milk had fallen to 18.33 pence per litre. I am aware that some purchasers have recently announced more price cuts that are not yet reflected in official figures and which will further depress the average farmgate price of milk.
<P>

<a name="20426w11.html_para6">It is unlikely that prices at these levels are sustainable in the long term under the current milk regime and there are some potentially hopeful signs on world markets. The USA has recently exhausted its GATT commitment for subsidised exports of skimmed milk powders, while substantial quantities of New Zealand milk powders have already been sold. Furthermore, the EU has taken action&#151;strongly supported by the UK&#151;to assist dairy exports. We may therefore see some recovery in international markets that could ease pressure on domestic farmgate prices.

<a name="20426w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The National Pig Association (NPA) has made representations to the Government about the cost to pig farmers of the Government's proposals for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. It drew particular attention to the greater difficulty that pig farmers will encounter with the export of surplus manures to neighbouring farms in the proposed, larger, new zones. The Government has considered this representation and proposes to increase the cost assessment in recognition of the need for additional slurry storage capacity to provide more flexibility with the management of exported manures on pig farms.
<P>

<a name="20426w12.html_para2">The NPA urged the Government to introduce a grant scheme to assist farmers to adapt their manure storage facilities to the meet the standards required by the NVZ Regulations. The Government expects to extend the existing Farm Waste Grant Scheme to the new zones when they are designated.
<P>

<a name="20426w12.html_para3">The NPA also argued that the cost assessment for the keeping of additional records should be increased. The Government is not proposing to make changes to the record-keeping component of its cost assessment, which is based on an estimate of the average cost across all farmers affected. We recognise that within this average the costs that individual farmers face will vary depending on the nature and scale of their operations.

 In the UK, separate statistics are not held for "old-growth indigenous forest", for which there is no agreed definition. A number of measures are in place to protect all forests in the UK, including ancient semi-natural woodlands, where the biodiversity and cultural heritage values are highest. In particular, the felling of any type of woodland is controlled through felling regulations. Additionally, many woodlands are subject to further controls because they are within designated areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest or Special Areas of Conservation.

 Data from the recently published 2001 Farm Practices Survey indicates that 50 to 80 per cent of slurry stores were built before 1991. Generally, farmyard manure is usually stored in the field or on a concrete base. Therefore in most cases the annual cost of storage consists only of repair and maintenance costs that are likely to be a few hundred pounds. Further estimates could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost.

 The NHS Cancer Plan provided details of diagnostic equipment to be purchased for the NHS. This included a commitment to 200 new Computed Tomography scanners by 2004.

<a name="20426w14.html_para1">Programmes to deliver this commitment are well underway and by 17 April 2002, 84 Computed Tomography scanners had already been delivered to the NHS through central programmes.

[49801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20426w14.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> The capital cost of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners will vary according to the exact specification of the equipment. Annual revenue costs will also vary dependent on age and specification of the equipment, staffing levels and workload and casemix at the particular hospital. The following costs are provided for guidance:




<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2002 : Column 516W</I><P>


<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The current list price of a well-specified <i>(a)</i> CT scanner is approximately &#163;0.5 million and <i>(b)</i> MRI scanner is approximately &#163;1 million. These costs are not inclusive of value added tax or any necessary installation or building works.
<BR>
Annual revenue costs will incorporate both pay and non-pay costs, such as maintenance, film, drugs or contrast agent. Total revenue costs will therefore vary according to staff numbers, scanner activity and type of maintenance contract. However, the average total annual revenue cost for both <i>(a)</i> CT and <i>(b)</i> MRI scanners could be estimated at &#163;0.3&#150;&#163;0.4 million.
<BR>
The majority of hospitals elect to take out a fully comprehensive maintenance contract for both CT and MRI scanners. The cost of all servicing and repairs is included within a fully comprehensive annual maintenance contract, which costs approximately <i>(a)</i> &#163;50,000 for a CT scanner and <i>(b)</i> &#163;70,000 for a MRI scanner.
<BR>
Under a fully comprehensive maintenance contract, a supplier of CT or MRI scanners will usually quote an uptime guarantee for new equipment of 98 per cent. This means that the supplier is confident that there will be no more than 2 per cent unplanned downtime, which would roughly equate to 5&#150;6 days per year. Older equipment may have greater servicing requirements and the cost of a maintenance contract with a 98 per cent guarantee could be significantly more expensive. In this case, other contracts, with a lesser percentage guarantee are available at reduced cost. In every case, there are financial penalties to suppliers if they do not meet their uptime guarantee.
<BR>
It is estimated that there are approximately <i>(a)</i> 40 CT scanners and <i>(b)</i> 60 MRI scanners installed in the non-National Health Service sector in England. It is difficult to provide accurate figures in this respect since private healthcare providers are not required to submit details about facilities or workload to the Department.
