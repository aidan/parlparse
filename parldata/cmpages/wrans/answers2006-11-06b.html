the context of achievements against the office&#146;s target of
securing for the taxpayer &#163;8 savings for every &#163;1 spent.
The auditors concluded that the National Audit Office was more rigorous
than any other similar organisation worldwide in the way in which it
measured, recorded and reported the financial impact of its
work.</p><p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="61106w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06110637000033">The Commission

the financial impacts achieved by the office and of its plans to
increase the target to &#163;9:1. I believe that the Comptroller and
Auditor General and the National Audit Office provide an excellent
service and excellent value for money for the

research (by the Marine Biological Association/Cefas) on basking sharks
is using modern satellite telemetry to provide valuable information on
movements and behaviour of basking sharks in the north-east Atlantic.
Information uncovered to date on the geographical movement of
individual sharks suggest that despite making long-distance movements
they remain in the vicinity of the continental shelf around the UK,
Ireland and northern France. These findings have been consolidated with
sightings data from UK charities (MCS, IFAW, Shark Trust, Wildlife
Trusts, Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust) as part of a three-year
Esmee Fairbairn Foundation-funded grant to MBA. The project is bringing
together in a single database all recent data on basking shark

comprehensive analyses of

there is no current reliable population estimate for basking sharks in
UK (or the European) waters. This is due to the difficulties in
relating surface sightings to actual population size. While the broad
distribution patterns of basking sharks in UK waters are being
uncovered by sightings data, new research using telemetry data suggests
there are considerable differences in the density distributions of the
animal, with animals 60 times more likely to be at the surface (and
thus sighted) in mixed water fronts than stratified water fronts.
Genetic research is also under way to determine whether populations of
basking sharks are discrete or if there is population mixing between
the N-E Atlantic region and
elsewhere.</p><a name="qn_66"><a name="61106w0006.htm_wqn3"><p><a name="0611076000249"><b><a name="61106w0006.htm_spnew6"><a name="0611076001101">Joan

similar fuel duty incentive for bioethanol. These have led to a steady

two major biodiesel production plants in operation in the UK (the
ArgentEnergy plant near Motherwell and the Biofuels Corporation plant
in Teesside), which between them are capable of producing some 300
million litres of high quality biodiesel a year, some of which is
exported. A number of other biodiesel plants are at the planning and

due to come on stream in 2007. No bioethanol is yet produced in the UK,

The postcode of the dental practice was used to allocate dentists to
specific geographic areas. PCT and strategic health authority (SHA)
areas have been defined using the Office for National Statistics all

directory.<br>2. The data
in this report are based on NHS dentists on PCT lists. These details
were passed on to the BSA who paid dentists based on activity
undertaken. A dentist can provide as little or as much NHS treatment as
he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT. In some cases, a NHS
dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that
period. Most NHS dentists do some private work. The data do not take
into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by

schemes had varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with
corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations are estimated using
&#147;proxy registrations&#148;, namely the number of patients seen
by PDS practices in the previous 15 months. PDS proxy registrations
were not estimated for periods before September 2003&#151;actual
registrations were used before this

to meet Urgent Operational Requirements for specialist vehicles for use
by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams in the Balkans. It was
replaced in service by the Mine Protected Vehicle in 2001-02. The RG31
Mamba suffered from safety and reliability problems caused by the
additional weight of the appliqu&#233; armour affecting the
vehicle&#146;s steering and braking systems. These problems were
exacerbated by a lack of commonality between the vehicles, which were
bought in three separate batches, and poor availability of spare
parts.</p><p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="61106w0026.htm_para3"><a name="06110740000246">The MOD does

response to this report will be made shortly. I refer the hon. Member
to the Third Memorandum from the MOD made to the Committee for their
inquiry (HC1054 Ev77-78). This includes background on why the
demographic profile of service personnel by age, rank and length of
service will have an impact on take-up and explains that it may be more
meaningful to consider the age of a child and their stage of education
rather than the age/rank profile of a service person.</p><a name="qn_342"><a name="61106w0027.htm_wqn1"><p><a name="06110740000498"><b><a name="61106w0027.htm_spnew2"><a name="06110740002284">Mr.

all troops deploying to Op HERRICK are provided with enhanced combat
body armour (ECBA) as standard. In addition, Kestrel and Osprey
variants of body armour, which provide additional protection, are
available against specific threats and for specific roles, such as top

provides Commanders with a flexible system of personal protection so
that personnel can conduct their tasks effectively, while retaining a
level of protection commensurate with the threat assessment. Such
flexibility is deemed important because Commanders need to balance the

Twigg:</b> The MOD uses the Medical Employment Standard (MES)
as the main measure of outcome of its medical treatment including for
mental health. The MES gives an indication of the employability of
Service patients from the beginning (diagnosis) through to the end of
their care pathway. The MES is derived from a medical assessment of the
patient&#146;s illness, the treatment course required and various
occupational factors. The MES indicates whether the Service person can
carry out full service, serve in some restricted form/role for a
temporary period or, in some cases, a permanent basis or whether they
should be discharged from the Service on medical
grounds.</p><p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="61106w0029.htm_para0"><a name="06110740000683">With regard
to outcomes, in the majority of cases, personnel treated at the MOD's
Departments of Community Mental Health are able to return to Service.
Medical discharge rates for mental health conditions are low&#151;out
of 2000 personnel medically discharged annually from the UK armed
forces, only about 150 will have a mental health problem. Of these,
20-25 will meet the criteria to be diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD).</p><br>

receipt of a War Pensions Scheme disablement pension, widows or
widowers pension, in the form of a &#147;War Pensions

they were advised how to make a claim. In addition, information was
posted on our websites, and towards the end of the review ex-service
organisations kindly published details about the error and how to make
a claim in their
publications.</p><p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="61106w0030.htm_para12"><a name="06110740001124">In both

their pension and claim any back payments of pension or tax. Once an
individual had been identified as receiving incorrect payments etc.
interest was paid in accordance with Government Accounting and HM
Revenue and Customs rules and additional recompense as agreed by the
Department.</p>

million plus some &#163;18.2 million paid in compensation.
Approximately 1,600 individuals whose pension or tax status was
corrected did not receive compensation. There are a number of reasons
why an individual may not have received compensation, for example, an
individual's pension was recorded as &#147;taxable&#148;, however,
as the value of the pension was below the tax threshold, they had not
paid tax.</p><p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="61106w0031.htm_para3"><a name="06110740001128">The Armed

assessing the entitlement to compensation in each case according to the
methodology set by the Department. There are no independent procedures
in place to ensure that the individual's assessment is correct;
however, AFPAA&#146;s own internal project team undertook an audit on
a proportion of the cases. The compensation methodology was available
to all individuals and if an individual considers that this has not
been followed AFPAA will investigate and provide a detailed breakdown
of the compensation. Likewise where an individual has not received
compensation and they consider that they should have, the appeal will
be considered initially under the Department's statutory Internal
Dispute Resolution procedures. Following this appeal route an
individual may seek the services of the Occupational Pensions Advisory
Service and the pensions ombudsman, both of whom are

continue to deliver both outputs, working where appropriate with
coalition partners, the NHS, private health care providers and the

up as a consequence of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in 1998.
Since then, however, overall defence planning assumptions have changed

the defence planning assumptions contained within Defence Strategic
Guidance 03, the Defence Medical Capability (DMC) Phase 2 Study was
carried out. The DMC study produced interim revised DMS manning
requirement figures which more accurately reflect defence planning
assumptions and have thus overtaken the SDR figures. Indeed, the
Ministry of Defence has previously released elements of the interim
revised manning requirements, in anticipation of a new definitive set
of figures (as in a previous answer to the hon. Member for the Forest

policy engagement with UK regions and faith communities to help deliver
the UK&#146;s international strategic priorities, we visit areas with
significant minority ethnic communities where we meet UK civil society,
including local businessmen and women and attend events organised by
them. A wide range of people, including representatives of local
businesses, are invited to attend events such as seminars in different
areas of the UK, aimed at raising awareness of what the FCO does and
why it matters. The FCO has also been represented at various ethnic
business awards ceremonies held in London but attended by
representatives of regional businesses. One of the objectives for all
these events is to try to break down stereotypes of FCO staff and to
encourage applications which will make our work force more diverse.
Events involving business/faith for the period 2005-06 to date (the
period for which figures are available) are listed as follows. More
than one event was scheduled on certain days, in the interests of value
for money. FCO officials could provide further information on outreach

outlined serious outstanding questions that Iran needs to resolve.
These include: how Iran came to possess and what use it made of a
document on casting uranium hemispheres, whose only application is in
nuclear weapons; why Iran conducted experiments on Polonium 210, which
has virtually no civil use but can be used as a neutron initiator in
nuclear weapons; why Iran&#146;s military has been involved in what
it claims is a purely civil programme; and why Iran is constructing a
heavy water research reactor for which there is little apparent civil
need, yet which would be ideally suited for the production of plutonium

Currently estimated at roughly US $l billion, remittances account for
over 30 per cent. of gross domestic product (GDP), and through import
taxes provided some 56 per cent. of the state budget. This has enabled
the Government to run fiscal surpluses over the last few years, amounts
they have used for repaying the principles on their debt. On the
downside, this has meant significant proportion of the Moldovan labour

resources from those authorities of &#163;21.093 million. The table
gives the details for each
authority.</p><p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="61106w0039.htm_para9"><a name="06110764000155">There is
provision in the DFG financial management system for local authorities
to carry over any under spend from one year to another if this is due
to programme slippage and they can satisfy their auditors that this
slippage can be made good in future years. There is also provision for
a local authority who cannot meet this condition to refund the grant to
the Department. As the DFG programme is ring-fenced any such refund
will be re-allocated to other authorities who can demonstrate a need
for additional resource for their DFG programme. Any such re-allocation
will be made in close consultation with the Government
offices.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext"><i> LA

Barker Review of Housing Supply, the Government undertook detailed
analysis and modelling of affordability, as detailed in the research
publication &#147;Affordability Targets: Implications for Housing
Supply&#148; (ODPM, 2005). The modelling took into account rising
incomes over the period and this analysis contributed to the decision
to set an ambition to increase housing supply to a level of 200,000
annual net additions by 2016. It looked at long term prices, rather
than short term pressures in individual locations. The new National

associations (Notting Hill Housing Trust, Guinness Trust, Sovereign
Housing Group and Places for People) and one local authority, the
London borough of Southwark has begun to pilot the new Social HomeBuy
scheme. The pilots were launched in late 2005 by inviting expressions
of interest. The next stage was for landlords to supply key information
to the potential purchasers who had expressed an interest on property
values and likely costs, so that they could decide whether they wished
to make a formal application. The first applications and sales are now
starting to come through. Transactions typically take longer than house
sales because landlords also carry out affordability checks to ensure
purchasers can sustain home ownership. Over 150 applications are in the
pipeline, with five sales completed and more expected
shortly.</p><p><a name="stpa_457"><a name="61106w0041.htm_para2"><a name="06110764000591">Of the five

eight proposals. However, the final decision on the number of proposals
that will be implemented will depend crucially on the content of local
authority submissions and the potential impact on public expenditure
totals if these proposals were approved. This expected maximum number

people are infected with HIV. 20 million have died, and in sub-Saharan
Africa it is the leading cause of death. Women and young people are
particularly vulnerable. Fewer than one in five people at risk have
access to prevention information. Improving sexual and reproductive
health through improved information, services and commodity supplies is
among the most cost-effective of all development investments and is
central to DFID's strategy. It saves and improves lives, slows the
spread of HIV and AIDS, reduces poverty and encourages gender equality.
Changes in sexual behaviour through better awareness of the dangers can
make a significant difference. DFID's "Taking Action" the UK strategy

mercury for gold extraction. CASM has provided grants for
women&#146;s projects, for example helping set up the African Women

World Bank projects in Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. It has
also supported workshops and conferences on women in mining, for

supports the World Health Organisation, the Roll Bank Malaria

(GFATM), which all help finance the purchase and distribution of ITNs
in developing countries. The UK has, for example, doubled its funding
to the GFATM for 2006 and 2007 to &#163;100 million annually, subject
to performance. The GFATM has become a major source of funding for ITNs

bilateral programmes support countries to develop strong and
sustainable health services that are able to scale-up the coverage of
services including access to ITNs. In some countries, funding is
provided as part of our overall support for poverty reduction and
implementation of health sector plans. In such settings, it is not
possible to attribute the number of nets to a particular donor. What we
are interested in seeing is overall national increases in the
distribution and use of bed nets, and many countries are making good
progress in promoting ITN

is to act as a catalyst in driving forward simplification across the

the need to bear down on complexity is at the heart of future benefit
design and delivery. As a first step, the unit published
"Simplification: Guide to Best Practice" on 4 May 2006. Copies have
been placed in the Library. The unit is now working to help embed best
practice and over the summer has run a series of roadshows to raise

on simplification will be reported on annually in the departmental

extent to which key performance indicators are met across the

complexity of the system. The unit is also looking at whether it is
possible to produce a reliable set of indicators to measure future
progress.</p><p><a name="stpa_562"><a name="61106w0048.htm_para7"><a name="06110813000231">The unit
was fully staffed by the end of July 2006 (including a secondee from
Citizens Advice). There were no specific setup costs, as permanent
staff were drawn from within the Department. Total running costs over
the period January 2006 to September 2006 were
&#163;207,000.</p>

estimates have been made as the Disability Discrimination Act does not
set objective standards of compliance against which implementation may
be measured. Instead, the Act requires service providers to make
reasonable adjustments to enable disabled people to access their
services. What is reasonable for a particular service provider will
depend on all the circumstances of the individual case. Factors such as
the cost of the adjustment, its practicability, and the extent of the
service provider&#146;s financial and other resources may all be
taken into account in determining what is
reasonable.</p><p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="61106w0050.htm_para5"><a name="06110813000573">However,
the Department has undertaken a series of research projects to monitor
how employers and service providers are responding to their duties
under the Act. Research from 2003<sup>(1)</sup> looked at
organisations&#146; preparations for the 2004 duties requiring
service providers to make reasonable adjustments; this found that over
70 per cent. of organisations had made adjustments to assist disabled
customers. At the turn of the year we will be publishing new research
on organisations&#146; responses to the DDA which will include an
updated look at adjustments made for disabled customers by service
providers.</p><a name="61106w0050.htm_brev8"><a name="06110813002792"><ul><p class="tabletext"><sup>(1

2002-03. A comparable survey has been carried out in Great Britain
since 1992-93, and this GB survey has now been expanded into a UK
survey, including the Northern Ireland data.  2. The Northern

analysis.  3. A variety of definitions of household income are
available from the survey. Gross income is used here.  4.
Three years of the survey are combined to ensure an acceptable sample
size.  5. Because three years of the survey have been
combined, the significance of the &#163;300 limit for households is
not constant, due to price inflation and increases in general income
over time.  <i> Source:</i>  Family Resources

Inspector of Schools to report, as part of routine school inspections,
on the contribution made by schools in this respect. Inspectors will
judge this by assessing the extent to which learners contribute to
community cohesion and the effectiveness of the links made by the
school with other providers, services, employers and other
organisations to promote well-being and community cohesion. Where
inspectors identify underperformance, they will make recommendations on
which the school will be expected to respond. School Improvement
Partners will challenge and support the school in making any necessary
improvements and parents will be informed about progress through the

authorities and direct to schools, and relies upon them to prioritise
the resources received between different capital projects. Accordingly,
the Department does not maintain a record of grants in respect of

Knight:</b> Guidance on checks on supply teachers was placed
on Teachernet in September 2004, headed Checks on Supply Teachers
Updated Guidance (09/04) (at
http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/supplyteachers/schoolsdetail.cfm?&amp;id=16).
It points out that the same checks and qualifications are required for
all teachers, whether supply or not. It will be replaced as part of
revised guidance which was issued for consultation in the summer. The
consultation closed on 12 October, and the revised guidance is planned
for issue shortly. In addition Guidance on Induction is provided to
schools which includes guidance on how teachers doing supply work can
complete induction. (This is on teachernet at
http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=4866). This has not
changed in the last 12
months.</p>
