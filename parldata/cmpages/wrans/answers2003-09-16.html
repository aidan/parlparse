<P>
<a name="30916w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have recently worked with a larger number of NHS colleagues to refine the PEAT process in the light of experience to date. This review confirmed that the system has been a major factor in ensuring that all hospitals meet acceptable standards or better in terms of the patient environment. The NHS is to be congratulated for the progress it has made. The PEAT programme has been extended to include Mental Health and Accident and Emergency units, demonstrating the importance we continue to attach to this, and the need for the NHS to continue to focus on high standards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w01.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 We already have standards to ensure there is a managed environment which minimises the risk of infection to patients, staff and visitors. Hospitals' performance against these has improved over the last three years. For the first time this year these standards and an MRSA improvement score contributed to the star ratings. The Chief Medical Officer is leading a new initiative to produce a longer-term strategy to reduce health care associated infections.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he will take to increase the provision of accommodation available to women victims of domestic violence.  [130038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w01.html_spnew13"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Government are committed to increasing the full range of accommodation options for victims of domestic violence including more refuges and better help to support victims to stay in their own homes if appropriate. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is investing &#163;8.9 million this financial year in refuge provision and an additional &#163;9.9 million has been allocated by the Housing Corporation. The money is being used by Registered Social Landlords, in partnership with local refuge providers and local authorities to provide 273 units of accommodation in all regions in England. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also committed &#163;7 million in each of the next two financial years towards similar projects which will also be administered through the Housing Corporation.
<P>

<a name="30916w01.html_para3">In addition, the Supporting People programme enables local authorities to provide housing related support services for victims of domestic violence. This year &#163;34 million has been allocated to domestic violence schemes including accommodation and non-accommodation based services.
<P>

<a name="30916w01.html_para4">Domestic violence can be a significant cause of homelessness. Under the homelessness legislation, people who are vulnerable as a result of fleeing their home because of violence (including domestic violence) have a priority need for accommodation. Moreover, all local housing authorities in England are now required to have a strategy for preventing homelessness in the district and ensuring that accommodation and any necessary support are available for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. All authorities were required to have a homelessness strategy in place by 30 July 2003. The Homelessness Directorate is providing &#163;260 million between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 in support of local housing authorities' efforts to tackle homelessness. A number of authorities are using this funding to improve the support available to victims of domestic violence in order to prevent homelessness among this client group.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much was previously allocated in 2002&#150;03 to home loss payments in compulsory purchase; how much this has been increased as a result of the Government announcement in July; and whether similar changes have been made to farm loss payments.  [130199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w02.html_spnew0"><B> Keith Hill: </B>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he <i>(a)</i> records and <i>(b)</i> acts upon housing affordability data.  [129155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w02.html_spnew1"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister records a wide variety of data on housing, including affordability issues, which provide an essential underpinning to policy development. Through the Housing Corporation the Government finances housing for those who are unable to purchase their own home. More generally, as part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's drive to create sustainable communities, we are working to improve the supply of housing in those regions where high demand is causing prices to rise beyond the reach of those on modest incomes. Regional Housing Strategies, produced for the first time this year, which will be considered, are important in highlighting problems of affordability at regional and sub-regional level. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be taking account of these, in my decisions on the allocation of housing resources, later this year.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to permit local authorities to limit annual increases in council tax for pensioners to the rate of inflation; and if he will make a statement.  [130646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Subject to parliamentary approval, the Local Government Bill will allow local billing authorities to introduce locally defined council tax discounts from 2004&#150;05. This power could be used by local billing authorities to create a discount which would have the effect of limiting council tax increases for pensioners.

<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list each of the playing fields, broken down by local authority, which have been disposed of under general consent orders.  [130363]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w02.html_spnew3"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Local authorities are given powers under the Local Government Act 1972 to dispose of land in any manner they wish. The disposal must be for the best consideration reasonably obtainable, unless the Secretary of State consents to the disposal. General consents have been issued so that local authorities can, in certain circumstances, dispose of land for less than the market value without having to apply to the Secretary of State for specific consent. However, the Local Government Act 1972 requires local authorities proposing to dispose of open space that is used for public recreation to advertise their intentions in a local newspaper and consider any objections received.

 The Department manages the security of its information, including information held on its computers systems, in accordance with the guidance given in the Manual of Protective Security, a comprehensive body of policy and interdepartmentally agreed security standards issued by the Cabinet Office. From this guidance, we employ a range of measures to protect physical, computer and information assets. These measures are reviewed according to specific project requirements and as circumstances and technology changes require. All aspects of security (physical, personnel, procedural, information and IT) are inextricably linked and it is therefore not possible to provide a budget breakdown for IT related aspects only.

In the short term, a fast-track appraisal process was piloted recently for applications seeking less than &#163;15,000 under the Rural Enterprise Scheme. The indications are that such an approach can substantially reduce the time taken to confirm the decision over an award of grant and we hope to introduce new arrangements generally, over the coming months. For the longer term, we are engaged in a major programme to improve ERDP delivery radically, and support the delivery of new agri-environment schemes. These benefits, facilitated in part by a completely new IT system, will begin to come on stream in early 2005.

 Water companies do not have any powers to stop companies or residential properties discharging pollutants into waterways. Their responsibility, under the Water Industry Act 1991, is to regulate trade effluent discharges made to public sewers.
<P>

<a name="30916w03.html_para0">Responsibility for controlling discharges to waterways belongs to the Environment Agency (the Agency). Under section 85 of the Water Resources Act 1991 (as amended by the Environment Act 1991) it is an offence to cause or knowingly permit polluting matter to enter "controlled waters", that is rivers, estuaries, coastal or groundwaters without permission. This is obtained as a discharge consent granted by the Agency. The Agency sets consent conditions which control volumes and concentrations of particular substances or imposes broader controls on the nature of the effluent. Each consent is based on an objective set by the Agency for the quality of the stretch of water to which the discharge is made as well as taking into account any relevant statutory requirements.

 A number of Members have raised with me their view on the sitting hours&#151;both for and against the change&#151;by raising it in the Chamber, at Business Questions and Oral Questions to the Leader of the House, by letter and in private discussion. I have had no representations from outside Parliament in favour of the House reverting to its former hours.

 Ministers answer questions in accordance with the requirements set out in the Ministerial Code, the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and guidance on disproportionate cost. As the Ministerial Code makes clear, it is for individual Ministers to account for their decisions and actions. If a Member of Parliament is unhappy with the answer received to a parliamentary question, he or she should raise the matter with the relevant Minister. There are no plans to propose changes to current practice.

The Government's target is that by 2004, 28 per cent. of young people will start a Modern Apprenticeship by age 22. The expansion of Foundation Degrees will enable the progression into higher education from vocational programmes. Young people not yet ready to enter a Modern Apprenticeship will be able to join Entry to Employment, to benefit from help in developing basic skills as a means of entering a Modern Apprenticeship or employment.

 Companies House has had a disclaimer on its website for a number of years.

 The Department of Trade and Industry publishes annually estimates of oil and gas reserves on the UK Continental Shelf.

A further 425 million tonnes of oil and 330 billion cubic metres of gas are classified as possible reserves in discovered fields. There are a further 90 to 490 million tonnes of oil and 70 to 265 billion cubic metres of gas in potential additional reserves in smaller undeveloped fields. Furthermore, it is also estimated that additional reserves of between 270 and 1,770 million tonnes of oil and between 235 and 1,390 billion cubic metres of gas could exist in fields that had not been yet discovered.

<a name="30916w05.html_para4">A study carried out by IMC Group Consulting Ltd. for DTI which was published in December 2002 assessed UK coal reserves in the 15 deep mines operating at that time at around 150 million tonnes, with further known mineral potential of around 260 million tonnes, mainly in 7 mine licence areas.

 DFID recognises that secure rights to land and property are fundamental to poor people's ability to act as citizens and pursue their livelihoods within a democratic society and open economy. The absence of systems to establish property ownership holds back development. In many cases it excludes the poor from accessing basic services and participating in formal markets for land and property, limiting social mobility and economic opportunity. The rights of large numbers of people living in informal settlements (which make up between 30&#150;70 per cent. of populations of urban centres in developing countries) and those of rural people dependent on natural resources are frequently not recognised by the authorities. As a result they are vulnerable to eviction and loss of physical and natural assets. Many developing countries are seeking to address these problems by remodelling their systems of land and property administration, but lack the financial resources and technical capacity to do so effectively.

 While significant challenges face the reconstruction effort in Iraq, particularly in the electricity, water supply and oil sectors which have suffered from looting, sabotage and the breakdown of obsolete infrastructure, progress has been made in improving humanitarian conditions for most Iraqis. The public distribution system for food is up and running, most hospitals are in operation, medical supplies are coming into the country, children are being vaccinated and most schools were open by June. Continuing security problems are making the work of humanitarian organisations difficult and often dangerous.

 There are three main measures providing enhanced tax relief for expenditure on the production or acquisition of the master version of a film. None of these reliefs has been abolished. However, the relief contained in section 48 of the Finance (No.2) Act 1997 for British qualifying films with total production expenditure not exceeding &#163;15 million applies only to expenditure incurred on or before 2 July 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w08.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The estimated yield from restricting income tax relief on employee and self-employed pension contributions to the basic rate is &#163;1.9 billion in 2002&#150;03. The yield from restricting employer contributions is &#163;2.8 billion, this estimate assumes that the proportion of total employer contributions relating to higher rate taxpayers is that same as that for employees. The estimates take no account of any behavioural effects which are likely to result from such changes.

 The Chancellor's decision to increase the zero rate stamp duty threshold to &#163;150,000 for non-residential property has been welcomed by business representatives as a boost for small businesses investing in commercial property and will come into effect from 1 December 2003. The level of the thresholds is kept under regular review.

 The Government are on course to meet the target in the NHS Plan to implement the National Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy by 2004. A large scale consultation has been conducted jointly by the Department of Health and the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit. This yielded a large number of responses which have been extremely valuable in informing the development of the strategy. The Strategy Unit is due to publish its interim analysis shortly.
<P>

<a name="30916w09.html_para0">The Strategy Unit's final report, which will set out the cross-governmental alcohol harm reduction strategy, is due for publication during the autumn. There will then be further Government consultation on the details of implementation and the strategy will be implemented according to timetable by 2004.

<P>
<a name="30916w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government have already brought forward a range of legislative measures designed to help tackle anti-social behaviour associated with drinking alcohol. The Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000 makes it an offence for any person to sell alcohol to a person aged under 18 on licensed premises, or knowingly to

<P>

<a name="30916w09.html_para1">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 provides the police and local authorities with increased powers to tackle under-age drinking. The Act contains measures to make it easier for local authorities to designate areas where restrictions on anti-social drinking will apply. It also created a positive duty on licensees and their staff not to sell alcohol to persons aged under 18s.
<P>

<a name="30916w09.html_para2">Section 155 of the Licensing Act 2003, which came into force on 10 September 2003, extends existing police powers relating to the confiscation of alcohol from people who are drinking and causing a nuisance in public places, so as to allow for the confiscation of sealed containers, in addition to opened containers, in defined circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30916w09.html_para3">In addition, anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been used to prohibit individuals from consuming alcohol or being under the influence of alcohol in public. Such orders can also be used to prohibit individuals from entering licensed premises or off-licences and buying alcohol. ASBO prohibitions can cover any geographical area up to and including the whole of England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30916w09.html_para4">For the future, the Home Office is working with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit on their project to develop a national alcohol harm reduction strategy. The project is looking at the wide range of alcohol harms including alcohol-related crime, anti-social behaviour and community safety. A report setting out the cross-governmental alcohol harm reduction strategy for England is due for publication during autumn 2003.

 The Airwave network became available for operational use in the Thames Valley police area on 23 July 2003.The force is expected to be fully operational on the Airwave service by August 2004. The original estimate for the introduction of the Airwave service in Thames Valley was 24 June 2002.
<P>

<a name="30916w09.html_para8">The payment of government grant in respect of Airwave is adjusted in each police force depending on progress of the rollout. In the case of Thames Valley, the force received payment in 2002&#150;03 to assist with setting-up costs, but no payment was made for the service itself. Payment in 2003&#150;04 will cover the core Airwave service and part of the extra features required by the Thames Valley Police Constabulary to ensure its specific operational needs are met.

 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis informs me that the Borough Commander for Havering and his senior management team continue to police Havering borough using intelligence-led policing, focusing on crime hot spots within the borough.

A further initiative has been introduced whereby one sergeant and seven constables patrol outside nightclubs in Romford on both Friday and Saturday nights to reduce disorder. The Metropolitan police believe that this has helped to reduce disorder and provide reassurance in the town centre.

 The Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 set out at Schedule 1 a Code of Conduct, the principles of which guide police officers' behaviour. The Code applies to the conduct of police officers in all ranks while on duty, or while off duty, if the conduct is serious enough to indicate that an officer is not fit to be a police officer.
<P>

<a name="30916w12.html_para4">Any breach of the principles in the Code may result in an officer facing misconduct proceedings under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999. Chief officers are responsible for applying the Regulations to their own forces.
<P>

<a name="30916w12.html_para5">The investigation of complaints by the public relating to the conduct of a police officer falls under Chapter I, Part IV, of the Police Act 1996 (the Act). Under those provisions the police authority is the appropriate authority for handling complaints against senior officers (those above the rank of chief superintendent) and the chief officer of the force is the appropriate authority for recording and investigating complaints in respect of all other ranks.
<P>

<a name="30916w12.html_para6">The Secretary of State for the Home Department does not have the power to intervene in either the recording or investigation of individual complaints, whether they concern on or off duty conduct, or in any disciplinary proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30916w12.html_para7">Under Section 72 of the Act, the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) will supervise the investigation of certain types of complaints and it is within that process of supervision that it will have access to all the necessary evidence, primarily by way of the Investigating Officer's report. In such cases, the PCA may also impose such additional reasonable requirements as to the conduct of the investigation as appear to them necessary.
<P>

<a name="30916w12.html_para8">There is currently no statutory requirement for a force to disclose information to a complainant. The Secretary of State for the Home Department does not assess the extent to which police forces release information to a complainant regarding the outcome of a complaint.
<P>

<a name="30916w12.html_para10">The new system will not change the Secretary of State for the Home Department's role in regard to the handling of complaints or disciplinary proceedings taken against police officers. Similarly, although it does not change the handling with regard to supervised complaints, it does provide for a managed investigation by the IPCC and for an independent investigation by the IPCC. As these two new types of investigation will put the IPCC in full control of the investigation, they will have unrestricted access to all the necessary evidence. Finally, with regards to the disclosure of information, the new complaints system places a clear duty on the police to keep the complainant properly informed during, and at the end of, an investigation, subject to a sensitivity test.

 Police powers to confiscate alcohol and alcohol containers from under-age drinkers are provided by the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997. That Act was amended by section 29 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 with the effect that the police were able to confiscate alcohol in opened containers from young people in public places, but not alcohol in sealed containers.
<P>

<a name="30916w13.html_para4">Following representations from the police and others to strengthen these powers to include sealed containers, we brought section 155 of the Licensing Act 2003 into force on 10 September 2003. This extends police confiscation powers in respect of under-age drinkers in public places to include alcohol in sealed containers where the officer believes that the young person is, has been or intends to drink the alcohol in any public place.

In addition, a special &#163;50 million Basic Command Unit (BCU) fund has been distributed to local police commanders to help tackle the problems that matter most in their communities.

 The visa regime on the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC") stems from the fact that the United Kingdom requires holders of non-national travel documents to obtain visas to enter the UK. The "TRNC" travel document is considered to be a non-national travel document as it is issued by an authority which is not recognised by HMG. This will remain the case after the entry of the Republic of Cyprus into the EU in May 2004, unless a comprehensive political settlement is achieved first.

<a name="30916w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We are currently investing over &#163;500 million pounds a year in revenue funding to raise the aspirations and achievements of young pupils in deprived areas through the Excellence in Cities programme. The programme covers 58 authorities as well as Excellence Clusters which tackle smaller pockets of deprivation. It includes some 1,000 secondary schools and over 1,000 primaries. In addition to providing Learning Mentors Learning Support Units enhanced opportunities for Gifted and Talented pupils and EiC Action Zones and City Learning Centres, the funding also provides for the delivery of Behaviour Improvement Plans, Leadership Incentive Grant and Aim Higher which is specifically designed to raise aspirations and widen access to Higher Education.
<P>

<a name="30916w16.html_para3">OFSTED's recent report on Excellence In Cities found that: schools and teachers had been helped to meet the needs of disaffected and vulnerable pupils more effectively; exclusions are being reduced; attendance is improving at a faster rate in the schools involved in the programme; and the introduction of the programme has been associated with a faster rise in standards in secondary schools in EiC areas than nationally .
<P>

<a name="30916w16.html_para4">As well as the additional support provided through the Governments targeted initiatives we are aiming to raise the aspirations and educational performance of pupils in deprived areas through mainstream programmes. The mainstream Primary and KS3 National Strategies are built on the principle that all children are capable of attaining high standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in what circumstances children in deprived areas are paid to attend <i>(a)</i> school, <i>(b)</i> sixth form college, <i>(c)</i> further education colleges; and what guidance he has issued on how much is granted on a weekly basis.  [129092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
: Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is currently running as a pilot scheme in 56 Local Education Authority (LEA) areas in England. The pilots have tested eight variants of payment arrangements for EMA, two of which concentrate on the costs of transport. The maximum weekly payments vary from &#163;20 to &#163;40 assessed on income levels up to &#163;30,000. Guidance on the pilot arrangements is made available through the LEAs.
<P>

<a name="30916w16.html_para5">From September 2004 EMAs will be made available across England, offering a weekly payment of up to &#163;30, paid directly to young people who stay on in further education after they reach statutory leaving age. Young people may also receive bonuses if they remain on their course and make good progress with their learning. A leaflet explaining the national EMA scheme was published in August this year and copies are available in the House of Commons Library.

<a name="30916w16.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Universities and higher education colleges decide whether to classify students as "home" or "overseas" for tuition fee purposes using the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997, as amended. To qualify for home fee status under these regulations, students at higher education institutions normally need to have been resident in the UK for three years before the start of their course, and have "settled status" under the Immigration Act 1971.

<a name="30916w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The success rates for Modern Apprenticeships (MA) published in July were issued for the first time in this form. The rates vary widely between sectors and some will need to improve markedly if we are to achieve our ambition to revitalise and expand apprenticeship programmes. However, the latest figures we have do show that overall MA success rates have increased to 39 per cent. in the year to January 2003. While this improvement is significant and sustained we and the Learning and Skills Council are not complacent. We need to do more.

 The Department and partner bodies do already monitor participation levels, and other factors such as attitudes and experiences of learning, through a number of sources including the Labour Force Survey, the Learning and Skills Council's Individualised Learner Record, the National Adult Learning Survey and NIACE surveys. Age of learner is an important factor in all of these sources and the Department regularly undertakes analyses based on age. Many of the publications based on these sources do contain breakdowns by age. Results from the 2002 NIACE survey on adult participation showed that the proportion of 35 to 44-year-olds who were current/recent learners had increased from 43 per cent. in 1996 to 49 per cent. in 2002. Participation among 45 to 54-year-olds increased from 36 per cent. to 44 per cent. over the same period. These increases are greater than for younger age groups.

adults for culture, leisure community and personal fulfilment purposes with a better choice of opportunities to encourage adults back into learning. Through our Success for All reforms we will raise standards, increase participation and improve outcomes for learners and employers. We have introduced targets for learner numbers and learner success rates, including new national floor targets which set out the minimum acceptable levels of performance for colleges and other providers to be met or exceeded by 2006. These are aimed at improving the responsiveness and quality of provision to meet the needs of learners at all ages. The recently published Skills Strategy includes the new guarantee of free tuition for any adult without a good foundation of employability skills to get the training that they need to achieve such a qualification, known as a Level 2 qualification&#151;explicitly noting that a higher than average proportion of older workers do not possess a Level 2 qualification.
<P>

<a name="30916w17.html_para3">The Government has set itself stretching targets to increase the basic skill levels of 1.5 million adults by 2007 and to reduce by 40 per cent. the number of adults without a qualification at NVQ level 2 or its equivalent by 2010. These targets will only be achieved if those over the age of 40 increase their participation and attainment in learning. Government believes that targets focused on ensuring all individuals achieve minimum levels of skill are the most appropriate for meeting the needs of the economy and society.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Our Skills Strategy, "21st Century Skills&#151;Realising Our Potential", explained that we are committed to removing the age cap on Modern Apprenticeships in response to industry's concern that it constitutes a barrier to meeting their skill needs. As a first step, we have changed the rules so that, from 1 August 2003, young people who start their Modern Apprenticeship at any point up to their 25th birthday can complete it. Beyond that, we will invite the Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) to put forward their proposals to design and implement a Modern Apprenticeship programme for adults in their sector as part of the new Sector Skills Agreements. It will be for individual SSCs, the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) and key partners including employers to assess the implications of this change for particular sectors. They will do so taking account of the need to maintain high standards; current budget limitations; and forthcoming European age discrimination legislation.

 Figures supplied by HM Customs and Excise indicate that the percentage of all road transport fuel, by volume, of road fuel gases provided between July 2002 and June 2003 was 0.39 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30916w18.html_para0">The Government support the take-up of LPG and natural gas vehicles through both the fuel duty incentives for road fuel gases, which have been in place since 1995, and the grants, which have been available since, towards the purchase of LPG and natural gas vehicles, which are available through the PowerShift programme. In addition, discounts apply to alternatively fuelled cars under the carbon dioxide emissions based company car tax and graduated Vehicle Excise Duty regimes. As announced in Budget 2003, the Government have been consulting stakeholders on how best to ensure that future support for road fuel gases continues to reflect environmental and other policy objectives, with a view to announcing decisions in the 2003 Pre-Budget Report.
<P>

<a name="30916w18.html_para1">We recognise that biofuels also have a role to play in reducing the environmental impact of road transport. In recognition of these benefits, the Government have introduced a reduced rate of duty for biodiesel of 20p/l below that for conventional ULSD. Since introduction of this rate in July 2002, production of biodiesel has increased more than 10 fold to over two million litres a month. A similar incentive 20p/l in the rate for bioethanol is due to be introduced on 1 January 2005.

 BVPI 96 measures the condition of the carriageway on principal roads. BVPI 100 measures the duration of temporary traffic controls on traffic sensitive roads. A road may be defined as traffic sensitive at certain times of day only. Although temporary traffic controls or road closure may be necessary to carry out road repairs, BVPI 100 encourages authorities to plan these measures to take place outside traffic sensitive times, thereby minimising disruption to traffic.

The National Society for Clean Air (NSCA), together with the Association for London Government (ALG) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) are jointly investigating the possibility of introducing a London-wide LEZ. The London Low Emission Zone Feasibility Study&#151;Phase II Final report has been published in July this year (available on website www.london-lez.org) and I understand that the findings of the study are being considered for further action. The NSCA consulted on a recommended standard for National Low Emission Zones in May. However I understand that further research will be necessary before an agreed standard may be announced.

<a name="30916w19.html_para3">The Government's Green Paper also recognised that the state pension has a role to play in encouraging flexible retirement. We therefore published proposals to improve the reward for deferring state pension from 2006 by increasing the rate at which weekly increments can be earned, and offering an alternative to increments in the form of a taxable lump sum payment. We will be announcing our plans on this proposal in due course.
<P>

<a name="30916w19.html_para7">The Government are currently consulting on options for outlawing age discrimination in employment and vocational training under the European Employment Directive. The Age Matters consultation document launched on 2 July includes proposals for tackling employers' mandatory retirement ages&#151;that is, the ages employers set for the compulsory retirement of their employees. Under the directive, compulsory retirement ages will be unlawful unless they can be objectively justified. The Government will decide how to tackle this once it has analysed and considered the responses to the consultation. Age Matters also explains that we shall take advantage of the directive's provisions that allow occupational pension schemes to set ages for admission or entitlement to retirement benefits. Such normal pension ages are necessary for the operation of defined benefit schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the number of pensioners <i>(a)</i> entitled to Minimum Income Guarantee and <i>(b)</i> who were not claiming it in each of the last five years.  [129758]<P>
<P>
<P>

 Estimates of the number of recipients and entitled non-recipients of Minimum Income Guarantee can be found in editions of the annual DWP and DSS statistical report "Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up"&#151;copies of which are available in the Library. Estimates for 2000&#150;01, the latest year for which information is available, incorporate results of research which improved the quality of statistics relating to the Minimum Income Guarantee. Estimates for 2000&#150;01 are, therefore, not on a fully consistent basis with past figures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 We receive representations on behalf of employers through the National Employer Panel which is an employer-led body providing independent advice to Ministers on the design, delivery and performance of the UK Government's labour market policies and programmes. Its remit encompasses all the New Deals and other welfare to work activities delivered by the Department for Work and Pensions, Jobcentre Plus and partner organisations at the national and local levels. The Panel reports on a regular basis to my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My right hon.

 The Pension Credit application line received a total of approximately 413,000 calls between 7 April 2003, when it became operational, and 31 August. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in his written statement on progress on 14 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 6&#150;7WS, there are over 1.1 million pensioner households already on our systems ready to be paid Pension Credit from October. We intend from November to publish monthly reports on the progress of Pension Credit take-on, which will include information on the number of applications.

<a name="30916w20.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Pension Reform</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on his plans for pension reform.  [129501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 We have recognised the need to reform the pension system of the UK. Our approach has been, in the first instance, to focus additional spending on the poorest pensioners. This means achieving a balance between providing a solid foundation of support for all while targeting support at those who need it most. Pension Credit will, from October guarantee everyone (who applies and qualifies) aged 60 and over an income of at least &#163;102.10 a week for single pensioners, (&#163;155.80 for couples). These amounts will be more if pensioners have caring responsibilities, are severely disabled or have housing costs.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para1">For the first time, Pension Credit will reward people aged 65 with modest savings or income. In the past, those who had managed to save a little were left no better off than those who had not saved at all. People who had capital of &#163;12,000 or more could get no help however low their income.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para2">Pension Credit will change this by giving new money to those 65 and over who have saved. This will be worth up to &#163;14.79 for single pensioners, &#163;19.20 for couples.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para3">Pension Credit is radically different from the Minimum Income Guarantee in that pound for pound deductions will be scrapped. And the credit will reward those over 65 with total weekly incomes up to &#163;139 for single pensioners, &#163;203 for couples. Around half of all pensioner households will be eligible and stand to gain around &#163;400 a year on average.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para4">The basic State Pension will remain the foundation of income in retirement on which to build. Between April 2000 and April 2003 the basic State Pension has increased by almost &#163;10 a week for a single pensioner and &#163;16 a week for a couple. This represents an increase of over 7 per cent. in real terms. We will continue to uprate by either 2.5 per cent. or RPI, whichever is higher for the remainder of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para5">We have recognised the importance of a good second pension by reforming SERPS. From April 2002, 20 million people&#151;2.5 million carers, 2.5 million long-term disabled people and 15 million low to moderate earners&#151;begin to benefit by building up a State Second Pension.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para6">The Government also introduced Winter Fuel Payments (WFP) for people aged 60 and over. The WFP is &#163;200 a year for qualifying households and will continue to be paid at this rate throughout this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para7">People aged 80 or over who are entitled to a Winter Fuel Payment will get an extra &#163;100 per household. This is the 80+ annual payment which will be paid as part of the Winter Fuel Payment, to those who are aged 80 or over in the qualifying week (15&#150;21 September this year).
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para8">The Government have also introduced free TV licences for the over 75s and there have been increases above the rate of inflation to the Pensioners' Tax Allowances.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para9">In 2003&#150;04, the Government will be spending around &#163;8 billion extra a year on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes &#163;3.75 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners. This is almost six times more than an earnings link to the basic State Pension since 1998 would have provided.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para10">We have also recognised that there is a need to address reform of private pension provision. Our Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement' set out our proposals to radically simplify the pensions system including reducing eight tax regimes into one, ensure that individuals have access to the right information to make informed pensions savings choices and ensure that older workers can access the employment opportunities they deserve and balance this with flexible retirement choices.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para11">To build on this, after the largest consultation on pensions ever, we published 'Working and Saving for retirement: Action on occupational pensions' in June which introduced a balanced package of measures to assist employers in providing occupational pension schemes while ensuring protection for pension scheme members. We will set up a Pension Protection Fund, the first ever protection scheme for defined benefit pensions, bring in measures to ensure that where a solvent company chooses to wind up its scheme it will fully buy-out members benefits and establish a pensions regulator that will target badly run and high risk schemes in order to put consumers first.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para12">There is a need to engage with employers to re-invigorate the pensions partnership and that is why we have set up the Employer Task Force to identify and promote employer lead solutions. We also have accepted that there is a need to consider the voluntarist system in the longer term and to monitor progress independently. Therefore we have set up the Pensions Commission to monitor and keep under review the system of private pensions and long-term savings.
<P>

<a name="30916w20.html_para13">There is also a need to make individuals aware of their pension provision&#151;both from the State and private saving. That is why we are extending combined state and private pensions forecasts through a concerted and targeted campaign. We will continue to develop a web-based retirement planner and will pilot a scheme for employer-based information. All these measures will seek to enable individuals to make the right pensions choices from a more knowledgeable position.

<P>
<a name="30916w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The CVF Programme is still in the Assessment Phase and we expect to award the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) contract in spring 2004, as planned. Discussions on how work will be shared between the companies are progressing well as part of the negotiations on the alliance arrangements. Final arrangements will be confirmed with the award of the D&M contract next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions with the defence manufacturers have taken place on reducing the <i>(a)</i> size of the aircraft carriers and <i>(b)</i> number of aircraft carried; and if he will make a statement on how such changes affect power projection.  [128075]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Regular discussions occur between the future carrier (CVF) project team, BAeSystems and Thales United Kingdom as part of the routine business of the Assessment Phase. This phase is intended to reduce risk in emerging design solutions and balance the key parameters of performance, time and cost in order to best meet our developing capability requirements, both in terms of the ships themselves and in the aircraft they will operate. Power projection is a fundamental part of this capability requirement.
<P>

<a name="30916w21.html_para3">The CVF programme is currently midway through this assessment phase. The key specifications in capability terms will be determined prior to the award of the Demonstration and Manufacture contract, currently planned for spring 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In the Strategic Defence Review published in 1998, it was envisaged that the two new Future Aircraft Carriers would be in the order of 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes and be capable of carrying up to 50 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The intention, as with any other new equipment project, has always been to refine the design during the Assessment Phase in order to best meet our developing capability requirements. The Carrier programme is currently in this assessment phase. The key specifications in capability terms will be determined prior to the award of the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) contract, currently planned for spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="30916w21.html_para4">Our target in-service dates for the two carriers remain 2012 and 2015 respectively.

<P>
<a name="30916w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 At its meeting in December 2002 the European Council indicated the European Union's willingness to lead a military operation in Bosnia following the NATO SFOR mission. No decisions have been taken, however, on the end date of the SFOR operation or on the arrangements for any follow-on mission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30916w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There was no statutory or MOD requirement to record numbers of former Chatham Dockyard workers for whom estimated doses were entered in their radiation dose records and therefore it is not possible to supply the numbers requested. However, those individuals who were involved in incidents at the dockyard, such as exceeding a statutory dose limit, would have been involved in the investigation and therefore would have been aware of the outcome.

This publication does not require the break down of the development expenditure in respect of assets in use by individual assets, but the range and type of assets in use by the Department are identified. At 31 March 2002, development expenditure for fixed assets in use amounted to &#163;11.4 billion. Similarly, development expenditure relating to assets in course of construction is not analysed by asset type, but the main projects under construction are identified in the 1999&#150;2000 National Asset Register under Assets In Course of Construction. At 31 March 2002, this development expenditure totalled &#163;8 billion. Other intangible assets amounted to some &#163;80 million as at 31 March 2002.

 United Kingdom and other coalition armed forces and non-Governmental organisation teams have been engaged in explosive ordnance disposal tasks since before the end of the conflict in Iraq. It is not yet possible to say either what percentage of British unexploded munitions have been cleared or when all the work will be completed. To date, UK and other coalition explosive ordnance disposal teams in the UK area of operation have completed over 1,500 tasks and destroyed over 500,000 individual munitions. Those munitions include not only those dropped or fired by coalition forces, but also many from the Iraq-Iran war as well as mines laid, ordnance fired or dropped, and stores of ammunition and other ordnance left by Iraqi military and paramilitary forces.

 The Government sought to reform the child support system to provide prompt, accurate maintenance calculations and quick, reliable maintenance payments. The introduction of the new scheme was delayed from April 2002, to allow further testing of the new IT system, and was introduced on 3 March 2003.

Existing child support cases would transfer at a later date, when Ministers were satisfied that the new scheme, supported by the new IT, was working well. The exception to this is where an existing case is linked to a new application. In such circumstances the existing case is reassessed under the new scheme.

 A number of steps have been taken to assist first time buyers in Northern Ireland. The housing executive's house sales scheme has enabled over 100,000 tenants to become home owners and sales of housing executive homes currently account for over one third of all first time buyer transactions in Northern Ireland. The Department for Social Development also provides funding for the Northern Ireland Co-Ownership Housing Association which, through its equity sharing scheme, gives those on low incomes an opportunity to gain a foothold on the home ownership ladder and has, since its inception in 1978, helped over 17,500 participants to become home owners on an equity sharing basis, with over 13,000 of these eventually moving to full home ownership.

 My Department has commissioned a study of changes needed to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. The study is being carried out to complement aspects of the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Strategy and local Species Action Plans. One of its objectives is to examine the case for changes in the legal status of certain species, including the Irish Hare.
<P>

<a name="30916w26.html_para2">A draft report was received by the Department of the Environment on 30 June. It puts forward a number of legislative options in relation to the status of the Irish Hare. The final report is expected to make specific proposals. Before I consider whether to take these proposals forward, I will seek the advice of the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Group and the Department's statutory advisory committee, the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what changes have been made to the policy on the use of the Irish language in <i>(a)</i> the Department of Health and <i>(b)</i> the Department of Education in Northern Ireland since suspension of the devolved Assembly.  [121088]<P>

<P>
<a name="30916w26.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 There has been no change in either Department's policy on the use of Irish since the suspension of the Assembly. This is in line with the Secretary of State's decision on 9 December 2002 that Departments should maintain their existing practices with regard to the use of Irish and Ulster Scots. The position was reviewed subsequently and the Secretary of State agreed on 19 March that existing practices should continue for a further period subject to another review in September 2003.

 Pressures on the neurosurgery service have arisen mainly as a result of a need for more theatre time, and shortages in experienced nursing staff. This is not a problem unique to Northern Ireland&#151;there are similar problems with this service throughout the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30916w26.html_para4">The Royal Group of Hospitals, in liaison with the four boards, has been working hard to improve the situation, both in the short-term, and with regard to the longer-term development of the service.A task force was established by the trust to lead the effort in addressing the problems faced by the service;
<P>

<a name="30916w26.html_para5">Extra theatre lists have been introduced;
<P>

<a name="30916w26.html_para6">A twin-track approach to enhance the recruitment and retention of nurses has been implemented to restore nursing levels and enable more beds to be opened. This has involved:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> the appointment of a 'clinical educator' to enhance training
<P>
<BR>
 opportunities and to support and increase the number of nurses in training; and
<P>
<BR>
 the recruitment of additional nurses, allowing the phased opening of beds from June 2003, with all beds re-opening by January 2004.
<P>
<BR>
A clinical careers framework for nurses has also been launched to improve opportunities for personal development and career pathways;
<P>
<BR>
In addition, treatment has been provided for some suitable patients in units outside Northern Ireland.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30916w26.html_para7">These measures should make a significant contribution to addressing the problems in this service. I have asked my Department, in liaison with the boards and the trust, to keep me apprised of progress.

 With the exception of an annual publicity budget of &#163;50,000 to meet the cost of publishing the annual Organised Crime Task Force (OCTF) Threat Assessment and Strategy Documents and to promote the role of the OCTF, no specific funding has been allocated to the Organised Crime Task Force. Costs for administering the OCTF are met from the overall resources allocated to the Security Policy and Operations Division of the Northern Ireland Office. Individual constituent members of the OCTF are responsible for funding their involvement from within their overall organisational budgets.

 Schedule 3 to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 sets out how the appointments of political and independent members to District Policing Partnerships (DPPs) are to be made. District councils are responsible for the appointment of political (elected) members. Councils were required to ensure that the political members of the DPP reflected the balance of the parties prevailing among the members of the council, immediately after the last local government election.
<P>

<a name="30916w27.html_para0">The responsibility for the appointment of independent members lies with the Policing Board. A widespread advertising campaign and public information evenings were used by the Policing Board to encourage applications.

This takes a holistic approach to providing the necessary support and care to prevent the individual harming him or herself. It includes an initial assessment on reception to prison, Samaritan services, listener schemes, an anti-bullying policy and improved structures, systems and procedures. This will include a multi-disciplinary case conference being held, leading to the development of a care plan for those at risk. This policy is due to be implemented by December 2003.

 The Northern Ireland Waste Management Strategy, published by the Department of the Environment in March 2000, provides a framework for developing waste management practices to increase recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. A key element of the Strategy is the preparation of Waste Management Plans by District Councils. Plans covering all of Northern Ireland are currently being implemented and are geared towards achieving a primary target set out in the Strategy of recovering 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005.




<P>
<P><I>16 Sept 2003 : Column 727W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30916w27.html_para8">The Plans were adopted following extensive public consultation throughout each district council area. They set out the full range of activities and facilities to be put in place to provide a recycling service, taking account of the needs and circumstances of individual councils areas. These activities and facilities to be put in place include a mix of kerbside collection for individual households, home composting schemes and the development of new and enhanced civic amenity sites and recycling centres. Under its Waste Management Grant Scheme, the Department provides significant financial assistance to district councils to assist with the cost of implementing the Plans. The Scheme commenced in April 2001 and up to March 2003 some 20 Councils used the assistance for the purchase of bins to enable householders to segregate waste for recycling.

<a name="30916w28.html_para4">A Regional Transport Manual for the HPSS was produced and issued by the Department in June 1998. In relation to the use of taxis it states clearly that their use should be strictly controlled in order to minimise costs. Trusts have to ensure that when taxis are used to support fleet operation for regular or ad hoc work, that there are proper management protocols and monitoring arrangements in place.
<P>

<a name="30916w28.html_para5">Trusts must have mechanisms in place to ensure relevant directors are notified of expenditure on taxis. Also taxi services obtained from commercial taxi companies are subject to a process of tender through Regional Supplies Services.
