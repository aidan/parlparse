 Camelot, as lottery operator, always seeks efficiency and to maximise returns to good causes. However no specific exercise of this kind has been carried out by the operator. The National Lottery Commission has indicated that under the third licence recently awarded to Camelot, which will run from 2009, returns to good causes are likely to increase by between &#163;600 million and &#163;1 billion over the 10-year period of the licence, based on constant levels of sales at &#163;5 billion per annum and comparing the third licence increase with the terms applicable to the remainder of the second licence.</p>

 The Department for Work and Pensions has so far identified 17,692 people in the Selkirk transmitter area who are eligible for assistance under the Digital Switchover Help Scheme, 11,747 of whom are aged 75 or over. The remainder are eligible because they are in receipt of disability living allowance, attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance or mobility supplement, but a breakdown of numbers in receipt of each allowance is not available as this information is not needed for the purposes of the scheme. A further 233 people in the Scottish Borders local authority area (which broadly covers the Selkirk transmitter area) are eligible by virtue of being registered blind or partially sighted.</p>

By the beginning of September, the scheme had received responses from about a quarter of those people who have received an application pack. About half of those eligible had opted to receive help and about half responded to opt out. Of those who have opted in (i.e. said they want help) 1,150 have made a choice and 375 have yet to choose.

 The Political Parties and Elections Bill (Bill 141), introduced to the House of Commons on 17 July 2008, includes provision for the reintroduction of triggering in relation to a candidate&#146;s expenditure limit at a parliamentary general election. The Bill provides that the rules on triggering will come into force on the date of Royal Assent.</p>

The schedule also states that the Electoral Commission may issue a code of practice giving guidance on candidate spending. Such a code must be laid in draft before both Houses and is regarded as having been approved by Parliament provided that neither House resolves not to approve it within 40 days. It may then be published. Schedule 4A of the RPA has been in effect since 11 June 2006 without a code of practice having been produced (though the Commission has published other documents providing guidance for parties, candidates and agents on election spending).</p>

A number of factors affect the costs of prisons and so comparisons must be made with caution. These factors include: the size of prison, its age, design, the occupancy level, the prison security level, the type of prisoner and the activities carried out in the prison. All of the therapeutic communities operating within prisons are part of a larger establishment or grouping and although the accommodation of each community is separate and distinct, costs are reported as part of the whole. The establishment costs per prison place are listed as shown, alongside the number of therapeutic community places provided in each institution.</p>

 The Shadow Price of Carbon (SPC) set out on page 20 of the Climate Change Bill: Final Impact Assessment is taken from DEFRA&#146;s cross-departmental guidance (published December 2007) on how to value the impact of Government policies on greenhouse gas emissions. The SPC captures the costs of climate change that are associated with each additional tonne of emissions, and is consistent with the carbon price referred on page 7&#151;at the highest stabilisation level within the Stern Review&#146;s recommended range.</p>

The value of the SPC used reflects the highest potential costs of climate change under the Stern Review&#146;s recommended stabilisation range of 450-550 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent, in order to ensure that the UK is taking sufficient action to help us to achieve this stabilisation range.</p>

 Our planned and continuing strategy is to realign funding from a high number of very short and low quality courses to qualifications such as Skills for Life, full level 2 and full level 3 that offer the greatest opportunity for adults to gain the skills for employability and further progression in learning. But we understand that as well as increasing skills, education is also about meeting the basic human desire for intellectual stimulation. That is why we have safeguarded &#163;210 million each year through to 2010/11 to support informal adult learning.

This includes information on how to ensure elderly people are claiming all the benefits they are entitled to, how to access grants to help keep their homes warmer and advice about how to keep warm and reduce the risk to health during a cold period.

 The Department understands that Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership has recently used an unmarked vehicle to deploy mobile speed camera enforcement to target speeding motorcyclists. The county has suffered from a high number of motorcyclists being killed and seriously injured, currently accounting for 30 per cent. of all people killed and seriously injured on the roads. The unmarked vehicle is used on some of Derbyshire&#146;s most dangerous roads and is one of the many tools the partnership use to try to reduce motorcycle casualties. Initial feedback suggests that there has been a considerable reduction in speeding as a result of this covert enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80915w0009.htm_para5"><a name="08091514000261">Since 1 April 2007, the deployment of safety cameras has been the responsibility of individual local partnerships. The Department&#146;s guidance provides best practice advice on the deployment of speed cameras and recommends highly visible enforcement. However, the guidance explicitly states that it does not restrict or fetter the police&#146;s discretion to enforce the speed limit covertly anywhere, at any time. A similar statement was previously included in the Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera Programme for England and Wales.</p>

However, the Department's new, broader, Publication, Production, Management and Delivery tender includes requirements to be measured against the Department's Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) in its specification. This will rate suppliers' impacts against the SDAP, and provide measurements against it, specifically by encouraging greater use of e channels; encouraging supply chains to implement low carbon emission printing equipment; and minimising unnecessary transportation of materials through the supply chain.

<i>  [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> The existing guidance on promoting the health of looked after children published in 2002 sets out what health assessments should cover and the nature of the services which should be provided to meet the child&#146;s physical, emotional and mental health needs. The guidance is statutory for local authorities but not on health bodies. Revised guidance will be on a statutory footing for primary care trusts, strategic health authorities, NHS trusts, and NHS foundation trusts as well as local authorities. This will ensure the importance of the active co-operation of health services in the health assessments of looked after children under the general duty in section 10 of the Children Act 2004, which requires primary care trusts and strategic health authorities to co-operate with local authorities and other agencies to improve the well-being of children in their area.</p>

A revised version of the statutory guidance under Section 11 on making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, originally issued in 2005, was published in April 2007.

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> Local authorities are responsible for the distribution of funding (including funding provided through the dedicated schools grant (DSG)) to schools in their area. Each local authority in consultation with their schools forum has a funding formula that they have designed and agreed to cater for the needs of their own area including children with disabilities. Local authorities planned expenditure on special educational needs&#151;which includes but is not limited to disabled children&#151;has increased by over &#163;2.3 billion from &#163;2.8 billion in 2000-01 to &#163;5.1 billion in 2008-09.

 The Department is committed to ensuring that children of all ages and stages of development receive the appropriate education and services. The Government recently published their response to the consultation on the proposals for the Equality Bill, &#147;A Framework for Fairness&#148;. The response made clear that, after careful consideration, it has been decided not to extend legal protection from age discrimination to children. This is because a child&#146;s age is closely related to his or her levels of development and need, something which is not generally true of an adult&#146;s age. Children need to be treated in ways that are appropriate to their different ages, and age-related treatment of children in schools and in the delivery of children&#146;s services is not the same as age discrimination.</p>

 Before 2001, the police could take DNA samples from anyone charged but had to destroy them (and the profiles on the DNA database derived from them) if charges were dropped or the person was found not guilty. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changed this so that DNA could be kept from those who had been charged even if they were acquitted. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which came into force in 2004) extended the power further so that DNA could be kept from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and held in a police station.</p>

It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates.

1. Prior to 1980 Zimbabwe was known as Rhodesia. Rhodesia was not a member of the Commonwealth. Zimbabwe was suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth in February 2002. Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth on 7 December 2003 after the suspension was renewed at the Commonwealth Leaders' meeting. An Act of Parliament is required to affect the status of its citizens if a country withdraws from the Commonwealth.<br>
2. Figures are for trained and untrained regular strengths only and therefore exclude FTRS, Gurkhas and mobilised reservists.<br>
3. Figures have been rounded to 5; numbers ending in &#147;5&#148; have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic bias. Totals have been rounded to 10. Totals and subtotals have been rounded separately and so may not appear to be the sum of their parts.<br>
4. Due to the ongoing validation of the new Joint Personnel Administration System all Army data from 1 April 2007 are provisional and subject to review.<br>

 Following on from discussions at the Bucharest summit, the NATO Secretary-General called for a special meeting of NATO defence ministers to focus on the political challenges of NATO reform and to give ministerial direction and leadership to the transformation agenda. As a firm believer in the need for a fresh look at our international institutions, I offered to host the meeting which will be held at Lancaster House on 18 and 19 of September 2008. The Secretary-General has not issued any formal agenda, but has broadly outlined the issues facing the alliance&#151;planning and delivering key capabilities; efficient use of human, financial and technical resources; and joint and proportionate burden-sharing. It is likely we will discuss also recent events in Georgia.</p>

An additional 528,496 lofts, which already had some insulation, were topped up professionally. The programme also subsidises loft insulation via DIY outlets, and it is estimated that around 335,000 lofts were insulated by the householders themselves during the EEC1 period.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 May 2008]:</i> Pubscene Limited went into compulsory liquidation on 23 September 2003, and the Official Receiver became liquidator of the company on the making of the winding-up order. From information currently available, it appears the Official Receiver exercised his discretion not to require a formal Statement of Affairs to be submitted by the directors of the company. In cases where the Official Receiver requires a formal Statement of Affairs, the legislation provides that the Statement be filed at Court and not at Companies House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80915w0018.htm_para10"><a name="08091528000556">On 3 November 2003, the Secretary of State appointed an insolvency practitioner, Mr. Abdulali of Moore Stephens as liquidator of the company. There are no provisions in insolvency legislation providing for liquidators in compulsory liquidations, other than the Official Receiver, to obtain and file information by way of a formal Statement of Affairs.</p>

 An investigation is a fact-finding exercise. It may show that there has been no irregularity or malpractice in which case the process ends. In many cases, however, information obtained during an inquiry is a basis for further action, either by BERR or by others. This may take the form of a winding-up of the company, prosecution, directors&#146; disqualification or some form of regulatory action. In order to provide a more complete picture of the results of CIB investigations I have included the number of winding-up orders obtained and the number of directors disqualified.</p>

However, it is worth noting that while the SIC enables statistical comparison of industries, the details in this table, and comparisons of this nature in general, essentially reflect the degree of detail in which industries are defined for statistical purposes within the SIC system.

These restrictions cover only the key products and services that generate income for the network and preserve POL&#146;s ability to negotiate new business on behalf of the full network.

 In Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012, Government will auction 7 per cent. of allowances. This equates to approximately 85 million allowances, plus those allowances from installations that close during Phase II and any unused surplus from the New Entrant Reserve (NER). The total amount cannot exceed 10 per cent. of the number allocated during Phase II according to the terms of the EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC. The amount of revenue will be influenced by the market price of carbon at the time of the auctions. The Government do not comment on carbon price, as it would be improper for Government to speculate on how the market will function in the future. Therefore, an estimate on the amount of revenue the auctions will raise cannot be given.</p>

New approaches were agreed on how the AfDF would promote regional integration, which is important for growth in Africa, and assist fragile states, particularly those emerging from conflict. The agreed policy changes included how the Bank would adjust its approach to assist countries to tackle climate change and how it would ensure its assistance made a more effective contribution to improving the lives of African women and girls. The UK was instrumental in securing these agreements, and committed &#163;417 million to the AfDF over the next three years.

 At least 76 per cent. of the population of Gaza are now partly dependent upon food aid. The main issue affecting the supply of humanitarian aid, including food, is the partial closure of Gaza&#146;s crossings.

Although food aid is getting into Gaza, the size and frequency of these deliveries are insufficient to meet the broader needs of the population, who are dependent on such food items as are commercially available to make up the shortfall.</p>

 I visited Namibia on 9 July, immediately after Namibia hosted a Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Ministerial Conference on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) from 2 to 4 July. This conference was funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) with strong support from DEFRA and the FCO. The conference generated a Statement of Commitment to be passed to SADC Heads of State later this year, calling for regional action to improve fisheries governance and trade, and in particular to combat illegal fishing. The lack of capacity within the region to deal effectively with illegal fishing was highlighted during a meeting I had with the Chief Executive Officer of Hangana Seafoods, the first Namibian seafood producer to receive British Retail Consortium certification.</p>

DFID has now approved further funds to help build on this commitment and extend it to other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Namibia represents a relatively positive model for African fisheries and effort will continue to support Namibian interests in promoting best practice. Nambia has operated effective monitoring, control and surveillance of its fishing activities since Independence. Recent and relatively modest infractions during late 2007, involving Nambian flagged, foreign operated vessels in the horse mackerel fishery, have been effectively dealt with by the authorities.</p>

 Providing humanitarian assistance in Zimbabwe has been extremely challenging in recent months due to Mugabe&#146;s callous suspension of most relief operations. Department for International Development (DFID) officials have been working closely with the UN, EC and NGOs, in Zimbabwe and internationally, to lobby for an immediate resumption of all humanitarian activities, including food aid for up to 2 million Zimbabweans. As a result of these efforts, the Zimbabwean Government have finally allowed humanitarian agencies to resume their essential support. We are now closely monitoring the situation on the ground to assess humanitarian needs and ensure our partners can access the most vulnerable Zimbabweans.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 July 2008]:</i> As at July 2008, the EU Police Mission to Afghanistan (EUPOL) was making steady progress towards full deployment and had a presence in 14 provinces. The Mission is developing important working relationships with the US police teaming programme. Personnel from EUPOL are also working with the International Policing Co-ordination Board to develop a shared vision for the role of the Afghan police and with the US to strengthen the capability of the Afghan Ministry of Interior, both of which will be key to the success of police reform. In recognition of the importance of EUPOL and the role it plays in police reform in Afghanistan, the Government supported the ambition to significantly increase the size of the mission as agreed in May 2008. As at July, 18 states were seconding personnel to EUPOL. This breaks down as follows:</p>

 There is much anecdotal evidence from sources inside Iran that the financial measures, including asset freezes imposed by UN Security Council resolutions and reinforced by the EU, have affected the Iranian business community&#146;s ability to function effectively in some areas. They have disrupted the international operations of a number of Iranian companies and those Iranian banks named in the sanctions. According to our sources, restrictions on dual use goods have led to difficulties in sourcing spare parts in the Iranian power sector.</p>

There is now a growing debate inside Iran about the Iranian government&#146;s policies, including on economic management. Internal discontent about the Iranian economy is increasing in the light of accelerating inflation rates (approximately 26 per cent. as at August 2008), unemployment and frequent power cuts. We believe further measures on Iran must remain part of the current twin track diplomatic approach to persuade the Iranian regime that its continued defiance of UN Security Council resolutions will not be cost free.</p>

Technical assistance to the Kosovo government is provided through a combination of FCO bilateral funding, project activities under the joint FCO/Department for International Development/Ministry of Defence Conflict Prevention Pool and the FCO's Strategic Programme Fund.

The actual amount spent on EULEX in 2008-09 will not be known until the end of the financial year.

 Following discussions with Nigerian authorities and oil companies, officials from our high commission in Abuja estimate that Nigerian short-term production capacity stands at 2.6 million barrels per day, with the potential to rise to 4 million barrels per day. However, production has recently dropped to approximately 1.5 million barrels per day. Not all of this shortfall can be attributed to security concerns. A proportion is due to under-investment by the Federal government in existing oil exploration and production projects.

 In our view, the substantial threat which Sri Lanka faces from domestic terrorism and the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s abrogation of the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement, in favour of a policy of military suppression of terrorism, have been major contributory factors to the current levels of violence. The UK&#146;s view is that military action alone cannot resolve the conflict; the violence is too high a price for the people of Sri Lanka. Inclusive political negotiations need to take place for a just settlement that can satisfy the legitimate aspirations of all communities in Sri Lanka and promote democracy, stability and the observance of internationally accepted human rights principles.</p>
