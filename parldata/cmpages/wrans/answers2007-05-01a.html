 The UK Government are party to the European Union (EU) pledge to reach a collective target for the Overseas Development Assistance to Gross National Income ratio (ODA/GNI) of 0.56 per cent. by 2010, estimated to nearly double total aid between 2004 and 2010, with at least 50 per cent. of the increase going to Africa. The UK also announced a timetable to reach 0.7 per cent. ODA/GNI by 2013 and committed to double its bilateral spending in Africa between 2003-04 and 2007-08. The G8 Gleneagles 2005 communiqu&#233; stated that the commitments of the G8 and other donors would lead to an increase in ODA to Africa of $25 billion a year by 2010, more than doubling aid to Africa compared to 2004.</p>

The Department for International Development's (DFID's) bilateral programme of aid to sub-Saharan Africa is set at &#163;1.25 billion for 2007-08.</p>

 Poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) is DFID's term for aid provided to a partner government to support that government's poverty reduction programmes, which is spent using the government's own financial management, procurement and accountability systems. PRBS is also commonly known as direct budget support.</p>

It is allocated and spent by the government across all sectors to achieve overall progress against multiple poverty reduction objectives. General budget support has the advantage of supporting the government's overall policies for addressing poverty and reinforces the role of the Ministry of Finance in allocating resources across government in the most effective way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="70501w0003.htm_para3"><a name="07050141000357">Sector budget support is normally provided to the government to support implementation of a particular sector strategy and achieve particular improvements in for example health, education or road infrastructure. In some countries this can be a more effective way of achieving development in particular sectors. Sector budget support can also be a more effective way of delivering aid where there are high fiduciary or political risks&#151;in some countries we track our resources to the sector or sub-sector to ensure that they are spent in that sector.</p>

under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and it is important that both sides deliver on their commitments. The first step is for the National Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) to formulate the Election Law and for this to be passed by the National Assembly. The Election Law will establish the National Electoral Commission which will be responsible for the running of the elections. DFID and other donors have provided support to the NCRC to assist in preparation of the Election Law. Once the Election Law is passed a full programme of election support will be provided jointly with other donors. This will include training for the National Assembly in Election Law to ensure effective scrutiny of the Election Bill, and support for a monitoring and observation process to ensure effective oversightof the preparations for elections, and the electionthemselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="70501w0003.htm_para8"><a name="07050141000392">DFID has already provided support for the consultations around the elections process, nationally and in the South. We have also sponsored a visit for four members of the NCRC to observe the Scottish Elections on 3 May. This will provide an opportunity for Sudanese officials to witness a &#147;mixed&#148; electoral system in operation, a model which may be applicable for Sudan.</p>

 DFID pledged $545 million in Oslo for the period 2005-07. Actual disbursement has been much higher; DFID disbursed over $500 million during 2005-06, and our financial commitment for 2007 is $205 million. We are seeking greater clarity on the exact status of other donors&#146; pledges. From figures available we believe that most donors have also honoured or exceeded their Oslo pledges. At the recent Sudan Consortium held in Khartoum and Juba on 19-21 May, the international community re-iterated its commitment to helping Sudan implement the comprehensive peace agreement. DFID will continue to track closely levels of development assistance to Sudan through effective dialogue with other donors both in-country and at headquarters level.</p>

The Department has made no assessment of the likely impact on any particular area, as future programmes are for the Big Lottery Fund to design.

 There has been no reduction in the actual budget for the provision of out-of-hours (OOH) care, either for Western Urgent Care specifically, or in Northern Ireland as a whole, nor is such a reduction planned. When the Health and Social Services Boards took over responsibility for the delivery of OOHs from GPs in 2005 following the introduction of the new contract for GPs, the Department agreed to provide bridging finance for a period of three years to assist the boards with the start-up costs of the new service. It was agreed with the Health and Social Services Boards at the time that this bridging finance would decrease in the third year (2007-08) and cease from 1 April 2008. The budget for the service is otherwise unaffected.</p>

 The Home Office established in 2003 established in the Royal Courts of Justice and advisory service to help those who have been successful on appeal. Help is provided on things like documents to establish identity, finding accommodation, signing up for social security benefits, getting onto a GP&#146;s list, how to obtain legal assistance as well as practical advice on day-to-day matters, such as obtaining a bank account. In some cases the service also provides longer term casework support and counselling. Successful appellants may also be able to claim compensation from the Home Secretary depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

1. The official definition of a CIWH is a child aged under 16 in a working-age household where no adult works. The administrative data is an inexact proxy for this as it charts all children under 16 in a working-age household who have at least one parent claiming workless benefits (IS, JSA, IB/SDA, and PC). 2. The administrative data does not incorporate in its definition workless adults who do not claim benefits. It also differs from the standard CIWH definition in that it includes children in households with both working and non-working adults, as opposed to a household with no working adults. 3. Furthermore adults working part-time may also be eligible for IS, and such claimants may be included in the administrative data.<br>
4. The information on those claiming income-related social security benefit is not available.<br>

2. The figures quoted in this response come from data in the National Benefits Database and the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS).<br>
 3. Figures in this response are based upon periods of employment measured from the WPLS, which is based on data from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The figures given can only be taken as a minimum for the following (not necessarily comprehensive) reasons:<br>
(i) Some records show that a person started or ended employment at some point in the year, but the exact date on when they started or left their job is unknown, and therefore we do not know if they were employed at the points in time specified in this query.<br>
(ii) If a person&#146;s earnings are sufficiently low that they fall below the lower income tax threshold and so are not required to pay PAYE income tax on their earnings then there is no requirement to inform HMRC of their employment (although some employers declare these jobs anyway).<br>
(iii) These data do not include the self-employed.<br>
(iv) Poor quality personal data may lead to missed matches with benefits data.<br>
(v) No &#145;HMRC sensitive and secure&#146; information is supplied by HMRC (for example, HMRC employees, members of the security services).<br>

 The latest available data shows there were 20,887 dentists eligible to provide national health service dental services or listed on NHS contracts in England as at 31 December 2006. This is around 1,500 more than in March 2005 and over 4,000 more than in 1997. Under the dental reforms introduced in April 2006, primary care trusts (PCTs) are commissioning an increasing volume of NHS dental services, which is likely to result in further workforce increases.

<i> Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i><br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 These computerised cognitive behavioural therapies (cCBT) packages were reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), in Technology Appraisal 097 in February 2006. NICE recommended the use of Beating the Blues in the management of mild to moderate depression and FearFighter as an option for delivering cognitive behavioural therapy in managing panic and phobia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_505"><a name="70501w0018.htm_para6"><a name="07050163000320">NICE decided that there was insufficient evidence for it to recommend the use of COPE and Overcoming Depression as clinically or cost-effective options for managing depression, except as part of ongoing or new clinical trials that are designed to generate robust, relevant data on the clinical effectiveness of these specific cCBT packages.</p>

 Since the publication of the &#147;National Service Framework for Mental Health&#148; in 1999, mental health services in England have seen significant improvements, particularly in access to specialist community-based services that aim to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and the length of in-patient stays. However, in-patient services remain a key element of mental health service provision and a national acute in-patient mental health programme, which is hosted by the Care Services Improvement Partnership and supported by its regional infrastructure, is helping local services in implementing the Department&#146;s policy implementation guidance on published in 2002. The Department has also announced that over 2006-07 and 2007-08,&#163;130 million of extra capital investment would be targeted to upgrade the mental health estate, particularly in improving psychiatric intensive care units and places of safety for assessment under the Mental Health Act 1983 and enhancing the sexual safety of women.</p>

The aim of this guidance is to improve access to mainstream opportunities for people with mental health problems in closer partnership with other agencies and organisations including the voluntary and community sector. The national social inclusion programme, also hosted by the Care Services Improvement Partnership and supported by its regional infrastructure, is helping local services in implementing this guidance in line with their assessment of local need.</p>

 The definition of burden of disease used for the previous reply is one of a number of possible definitions.

 10 days has no particular significance in relation to the answering of parliamentary questions. As any period of 10 days will include at least one weekend and may also include other days on which the House of Commons may not be sitting and questions cannot be answered, it is a meaningless yardstick against which to measure performance in answering questions. In 2006-07, questions tabled shortly before the Christmas, February and Easter recesses did not fall for answer until after the 10-day point.</p>

HMRC has a no redundancy agreement with the trade unions lasting until at least September 2007.

The precise rate will be set in the usual way in due course by the annual uprating order, which is subject to affirmative resolution with debates in both Houses. The White Paper, &#147;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&#148; (May 2006) set out the Government&#146;s intention to uprate the pension credit guarantee in line with earnings over the long-term and factored this in to the overall projected costs of state pension reform.

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="70501w0023.htm_para3"><a name="07050174000709">The levy is also structured to promote use of alternatives to virgin aggregates from more sustainable sources, such as recycled demolition waste and slate waste, by granting these materials exemption from the levy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="70501w0023.htm_para4"><a name="07050174000710">The levy is part of a package of environmental measures (including the landfill tax and climate change levy) designed to encourage more efficient processes, environmental awareness and sustainable development. Research shows the levy, as part of this package, is helping meet the Government&#146;s policy aims. For example, Great Britain has seen a reduction in sales of virgin aggregate by around 18 million tonnes between 2001 and 2005 and an increases in the use of recycled aggregate in England of around 5.5 million tonnes.</p>

 The Government of Sudan has agreed to the Heavy Support Package of United Nations' support to the African Union (AU). But this is only a step towards the joint UN-AU Hybrid operation needed to provide protection to Darfur's citizens. The Government of Sudan must agree to the Hybrid force and co-operate fully with its implementation. If they do not honour their commitments we are prepared to introduce tougher measures.</p>

 We regularly discuss Darfur with the Chinese Government including at the UN. We want China to use its considerable influence with the Sudanese Government to help ensure Khartoum supports deployment of joint African Union/UN peacekeeping in Darfur, as well as a ceasefire and renewed political process. We gave this message to the Chinese Government before President Hu&#146;s visit to Africa earlier this year. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister also raised Darfur on 23 April, during his recent visit to China.</p>

 We have not made a military assessment of the French air force&#146;s capacity in Chad to monitor a no fly zone over Darfur. The French military have long-standing ties with Chad and any such measure would also require the Chadian government&#146;s consent.</p>

We do, however, emphasise strongly our deep concern over persistent violations of human rights in both Uzbekistan and Iran, and our corresponding belief that the UN should address these situations. For that reason, the UK co-sponsored the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly last autumn on the human rights situation in Iran; and the attempted resolution on the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, which unfortunately failed to pass a vote in the General Assembly&#146;s Third Committee, also last autumn. The independent UN Special Rapporteurs on Human Rights questions have frequently commented on issues in Iran and Uzbekistan in the course of their work; that work continues.</p>
