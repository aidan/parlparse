 In 2003, an extensive cost benefit analysis into movement standstills demonstrated the significant benefits of standstill regimes in reducing both the size and cost of a disease outbreak. These conclusions remain valid. Standstills confer significant protection when disease is present but undetected. It would not be desirable to remove this protection from the livestock industry.</p>

 Our White Paper &#147;Communities in Control: real people real power&#148;, published in July 2008, describes a variety of ways in which we will be seeking to empower local communities and citizens&#151;including disabled people and other disadvantaged groups, whether living in residential homes or with families&#151;thus enabling them to participate more actively in their communities. These include: a new duty on local authorities to promote democracy, another duty requiring best value authorities to involve people in local decision making, and a local Take Part programme to encourage more people from different backgrounds to engage in civic activities.

 No. I do not think that the expense would be justified.

 As part of a much wider package of real help for homeowners, the recently announced Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme will enable ordinary hard working households that experience a redundancy or significant loss of income to reduce their monthly payments to a more manageable level, by deferring a proportion of the interest payments on their mortgage for up to two years.

 Information on the value of section 106 monies held by each local authority is not collected centrally. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government has produced research reports into the value of planning obligations in England for 2003-04 and 2005-06 based on a sample of authorities across the country. It was estimated that the total value  of planning obligations agreed in England in 2003-04 was &#163;1.9 billion and in 2005-06 the estimate had risen to &#163;4 billion. These reports are available on the Department's website. New research covering 2007-08 has recently been commissioned and will be published in summer 2009.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 December 2008]:</i> Directgov has traditionally employed contract staff to fill short-term posts and those posts requiring specialist skills which cannot be recruited from within the civil service. This policy will continue as there is always likely to be a small number of contractors employed. All contractor posts are subject to competition and in order to ensure value for money, all new posts are to be market tested by carrying out a recruitment exercise to ascertain whether suitable resources can be recruited as permanent staff. There is likely to remain a requirement for critical posts to be staffed by a contractor on an interim basis while the recruitment exercise is being carried out.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 December 2008]:</i> The consultation period ended on 22 October 2008. The consultation asked specifically how we might reform industrial injuries disablement benefit to provide better support to help people adjust to their new circumstances while maintaining the work focus of the modern welfare state, whether lump sum payments are a good way of meeting people's needs, whether they give people more choice and control and whether we could make more use of them.</p>

We believe that there remains a strong case for continuing to provide particular support for people whose disability arises from work and we think the current industrial injuries disablement benefits scheme is the best way to do this.</p>

 As stated in paragraph 2.4 of the partial regulatory impact assessment (PRIA), this estimate came from the Lane Committee report (the report of the Committee on the Working of the Abortion Act set up under the chairmanship of Mrs Justice Lane and presented to Parliament in 1974) which found evidence that between 20,000 and 60,000 illegal abortions were carried out annually before the 1967 Act came into force. Therefore, in the PRIA we considered 20,000 to be a realistic minimum estimate. Furthermore, during the period 1964 to 1966 (prior to the Abortion Act) 98 women (32 a year) died as a result of illegal abortions.</p>

 We have asked the President of the Royal College of Physicians (Professor Ian Gilmore) to carry out a review of prescription charges that will consider how to implement the commitment to exempt patients with long-term conditions from prescription charges. The review will take into account the views of patients, the public, patient representative bodies, clinicians and health care organisations and is due to make its recommendations to departmental Ministers in summer 2009. Following this, the Government will decide how exemption from charging can best be phased in, including how the proposed changes can be funded.

 As of 30 November 2008 there were 50 children living with their mothers in a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU) within a women&#146;s prison. They may stay in an MBU until the age of up to 18 months (depending on the individual circumstances), although there is room for flexibility in the best interests of the child, which may mean a child staying in an MBU until two years of age. They are then gradually integrated into the care of approved family or carers in the community. This could include social services where no suitable carer exists.</p>

Particular help is to be given to those who&#151;for example because of learning disabilities &#151;may have problems in doing so. The Youth Justice Board, through its contracts with providers requires secure training centres to have in place arrangements under which concerns and complaints can be raised. Every young offender institution and secure training centre has an advocacy service, which plays an important part in helping young people to voice concerns.</p>

 Each secure training centre has a Youth Justice Board (YJB) monitor. All monitors are educated to NVQ Level 4 and have at least two years&#146; experience of the criminal justice system before appointment. The monitor&#146;s function is to ensure that the YJB&#146;s objectives for the centre are being met, in compliance with the contract. Monitors have an important part to play in ensuring that safeguarding and child protection arrangements are working effectively. Responsibility for such arrangements, however, and for individual cases, lies with local authority children&#146;s services departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="81215w0039.htm_para3"><a name="0812165000498">As the statutory planning body for post 16 education and skills, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for assessing the need for further education (FE) in each locality. Although the LSC, working with local partners, has identified a need for some additional FE provision in Sittingbourne, the evidence suggests that there is insufficient demand for a new FE college.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="81215w0039.htm_para4"><a name="0812165000499">Canterbury and Mid-Kent Colleges continue to play a major role in offering FE to learners in Sittingbourne, along with the local schools, the new Sittingbourne Skills Centre and the new Minster Academy which is expected to offer a wide range of vocational opportunities. Canterbury College, together with Swale borough council, is investigating whether there is scope for the college to have an additional presence in the area as part of the town&#146;s regeneration plans including looking at possible sites. If the college concludes this to be appropriate, it will consult locally before putting a case to the LSC for consideration. A proposal is unlikely before Easter 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="81215w0039.htm_para5"><a name="0812165000500">The power to establish FE colleges lies with the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills consulting with the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and is contained within section 16 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Such decisions usually follow proposals made by the LSC. In the event of a proposal for an existing college to locate a new site in Sittingbourne, the Secretary of State has no role in the decision. This is for the college concerned with the support of the LSC.</p>

 We are planning to launch our public consultation on the proposed new duty to record incidents of bullying early in 2009 and we aim to implement it in September 2009. The new duty will require schools to record incidents of bullying at school level; they will not be required to report their records to the local authority or central Government. We currently recommend that schools record incidents of bullying and share these records with the local authority as a means of developing cross-area anti-bullying strategies, and we will continue to encourage this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="81215w0039.htm_para8"><a name="0812165000568">As part of the Ofsted inspection process, schools are expected to demonstrate, through the self evaluation form, the steps they have taken to minimise bullying, and the effectiveness of these steps. Evidence is provided covering issues such as what anti-bullying policies the school has implemented, how incidents of bullying are recorded, how the data collected are analysed and followed up, and with what success. We expect school bullying records will be used when completing this form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="81215w0039.htm_para9"><a name="0812165000569">Ofsted inspectors also gather evidence through discussions with children and young people about whether they feel safe in school, and how well they feel the school deals with bullying. School records of bullying incidents would only be checked if there was a disparity between the information provided on the self evaluation form and the information gathered from discussions with pupils.</p>

October 2008. Due to technical difficulties the three musicians were asked to re-submit their applications on 29 October.

The musicians elected to retrieve their passports during this time.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people have been <i> (a)</i> eliminated from inquiries and <i> (b)</i> charged as a result of the police DNA database in the last year for which figures exist; and if she will make a statement. [241998]</p>

<p><a name="st_524"><a name="0812167000440"><a name="81215w0043.htm_spnew8"><a name="0812167001520"><b>Mr. Alan Campbell</b>
<i> [holding answer 11 December 2008]:</i> People may be eliminated from inquiries by the use of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) by two different methods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="81215w0043.htm_para10"><a name="0812167000441">The first method is by the standard operation of the NDNAD. When DNA profiles derived from traces found at crime scenes are loaded on the NDNAD they are automatically searched against the DNA profiles of all persons with a record on the NDNAD. If there is no match between the crime scene profile and the person&#146;s record the NDNAD provides no reason for the police to investigate that person. In that sense, all 4.6 million persons on the NDNAD are eliminated by every search of a crime scene profile which does not match them. If there is a match, a report is sent to the police who can carry out further investigation of this lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="81215w0043.htm_para11"><a name="0812167000442">The second method is by the use of intelligence led mass screens. These take place if the police may ask members of the public in a particular area to provide their DNA voluntarily. For example, all males under the age of 40 residing within five miles of a murder might be asked to provide a DNA sample to see if it matched DNA found at the crime scene. A cumulative total is kept of the number of such screens kept since the NDNAD was set up in 1995, rather than figures for particular years. Between 1995 and 31 October 2008, there have been 391 screens resulting in the elimination of 95,629 samples. DNA provided voluntarily is used only for that particular investigation and then discarded, unless the person concerned gives explicit written agreement for it to be retained permanently on the NDNAD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="81215w0043.htm_para12"><a name="0812167000443">Records are not kept of the number of persons charged as a result of use of the NDNAD, as charging reflects integrated criminal investigation which may involve both DNA and non-DNA evidence. However, records are kept of the number of DNA matches and detections. Matches refer to crimes where there is a match between DNA found at the crime scene and the record of a person&#146;s DNA on the NDNAD. A detection means that a crime with a DNA match has been cleared up by the police. Crimes with a DNA match often also result in further detections for other offences (known as &#145;additional&#146; DNA detections) as a result of further investigation linked to the original offence (in other words, the detection  <br>

of one offence through a DNA match may also lead to other offences being solved e.g. because an offender on being presented with DNA evidence linking him to one offence confesses to other offences). In 2007-08 there were 37,376 matches, 17,614 detections, and a further 15,420 additional detections.</p>

 The White Paper &#145;Raising Expectations: enabling the system to deliver&#146;, set out proposals to ensure that the needs of learners (young people and adults) and employers are met by a more responsive system. Responsibility for the planning, commissioning and funding for education and training for 16 to 19 year-olds will transfer to local authorities, supported by a new Young People's Learning Agency. For adults we propose to build on the demand led approach, including through the creation of a new Skills Funding Agency and strengthened advice and support services for adults and employers.</p>

At the same time the Government are working to develop stronger local area agreements and multi-area agreement proposals to ensure that all partners are clear on roles, responsibilities and outcomes. Building stronger links between local, regional and national bodies is vital to ensure the outcomes for young people, adults and employers are continuously improved. That is why local authorities will be expected to work collaboratively with one another supported by a slim-line Young People's Learning Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_586"><a name="81215w0047.htm_para14"><a name="08121655000098">In respect of adult skills, the Skills Funding Agency will also work with and develop existing local partnerships. It will work, for example, in partnership with the Young People's Learning Agency, regional skills and employment boards and other local and regional skills bodies to respond quickly and flexibly to national, regional and local skills needs, including drawing up statements of regional priorities and ensuring that these are reflected in multi-area agreements and local area agreements. The SFA will also work with regional development agencies and local authorities in relation to economic development and worklessness.</p>

 Two non-repayable grants are available to part-time students: a grant for fees and a course grant which is intended to cover the cost of books and travel. In 2008/09 the maximum fee grant is &#163;1,180 for students who study at a rate equivalent to 75 per cent. or more of a full-time course. The maximum course grant is &#163;255. The financial support package for part-time students has been specifically designed for them and recognizes that the needs of part-time and full-time students are not the same. Unlike full-time students, the majority of part-time students are in full-time employment, with 36 per cent. receiving full support for their fees from their employer. Therefore statutory funding for part-time students is not intended to cover living expenses. Fees for part-time courses are unregulated, thus fees will vary both from institution to institution and from course to course. Part-time students are therefore advised to get information on course fees by contacting the institution at which they want to study.</p>

The first three years of operation will not be concluded until autumn next year.
