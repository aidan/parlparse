To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the (1) sites in the United Kingdom where genetically modified crops have been grown in breach of the licence conditions and (2) the name of <i>(a)</i> the promoter and <i>(b)</i> owner of the (i) trial and (ii) materials in the trial and <i>(c)</i> any other (A) body and (B) person responsible for conducting such trials.  [72554]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There have been two such cases in the UK where a successful prosecution has been taken. The information is as follows:

<a name="90329w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on which occasions the team of Green Ministers has discussed issues relating to genetic modification.  [75088]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> The issue of genetic modification has not been discussed by Green Ministers. It is considered within Government by a different, specific, Cabinet Sub-Committee.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will introduce legislation to make biotechnology companies legally and financially liable for any damage to the environment caused by genetically modified crops.  [75200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1999]:</i> There is already some protection though Civil law and general product liability. The issue of environmental liability is an important one and the principle that those who damage the environment should pay for remedying the damage caused is one that I would strongly support. The European Commission is currently finalising a White Paper on environmental liability and this may offer a way forward. We expect the White Paper to include the question of damage by genetically modified organisms but need to study the detail of the Commission's proposals before reaching any conclusions.

<i>(a)</i> himself, <i>(b)</i> Ministers in his Department and <i>(c)</i> his officials and representatives of the biotechnical industry sector since 1 May 1997.  [74836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> There have been no such meetings involving the Ministers of this Department. Although most meetings involving officials are minuted, my officials have, from time to time, had meetings with the biotechnology companies where minutes are not taken. However, these are always in pursuit of a clear remit from Ministers for specific agreed purposes. Information on the number of such meetings is not available.

<a name="90329w01.htm_sbhd2"><H4><center>Soya Bean Imports</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what steps he will take to examine bulk imports of United States soya beans following the 1999 United States harvest to test whether they contain AgrEvo's Liberty Link soya bean; and if he will make a statement;  [75348]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on the licensing status of AgrEvo's Liberty Link soya bean in the <i>(a)</i> United States of America, <i>(b)</i> European Union and <i>(c)</i> United Kingdom;  [75347]
<P>
(3) what steps he takes to ensure that unlicensed soya beans do not enter <i>(a)</i> animal feed and <i>(b)</i> the human food chain; and what communication he has had with AgrEvo about the planting and harvesting in the United States of America and subsequent exporting to the United Kingdom of its Liberty Link soya bean.  [75349]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 AgrEvo's Liberty Link soya bean has been authorised for cultivation and food in the USA but not authorised for cultivation or food in either the European Union or United Kingdom. However, I understand that an application for marketing consent under Council Directive 90/220/EEC has been lodged with an EU member state. I have not had any communication with AgrEvo about this particular variety.
<P>

<a name="90329w01.htm_para0">It is illegal to import GM soya unless the variety has approval under Council Directive 90/220/EEC. It is the duty of the importers to ensure that all imported soya has the necessary authorisations. If the product does not get EU consent by the time it is grown commercially in the United States of America and we have reason to believe that the product is being imported illegally the inspection of bulk imports will be arranged. In such circumstances the importer can be prosecuted.

[77214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Estimates of the costs of inspection under the COMAH regulations by the Environment Agency in England and Wales and by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland are a matter for the two Agencies.

 There are six members from ethnic minorities appointed to sit on rent tribunals in the Greater London area. This represents seven per cent. of the total membership of the London Rent Assessment Panel, from which rent tribunals are drawn. We want to see the proportion of tribunal members from ethnic minorities more closely reflect that in the national population. Three of the members from ethnic minority communities have been appointed since September 1998.

<P>
<a name="90329w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Stringent controls and severe penalties are in place to discourage the fly-tipping of waste and, where it occurs, to enable the perpetrators to be traced and prosecuted. The main controls and the maximum penalties were set out in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) on 8 December 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>120-21</i>.
<P>

<a name="90329w02.htm_para1">My Department has prepared a Circular explaining these controls and penalties which was issued to magistrates by the Lord Chancellor's Department on 6 February 1998. We wish to encourage the Courts to make full use of the available penalties.

<P>

<a name="90329w02.htm_para2">We have made it clear that we expect the Environment Agency to be fair but rigorous in its enforcement of environmental controls; and we support the action being taken by the Agency on fly-tipping. This includes the provision of a free 24 hour hotline for members of the public to report incidents (Tel: 0800 807060).

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Tidy Britain Group has carried out three studies into fly-tipping. The study comprised three surveys and one of its main aims was to establish the types, quantities and locations of fly-tipped waste. The third survey was carried out in partnership with the Environment Agency and was published last month. It suggests a modest increase in fly-tipping over the period from 1994-95 but less than was originally feared by local authorities following the introduction of the landfill tax.

[78587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I do not consider that it would be helpful to collect figures on local authorities' aggregate credit limits. It is for local authorities external auditors to monitor their compliance with all the requirements of the capital finance system.

 We are keen for local authorities to pursue transfer where it is clearly part of their housing strategy and will improve the living conditions of tenants and the service they receive. However, authorities are under no compulsion to transfer their stock. Our aim is to ensure the delivery of improved efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness to tenants.

 There have been thirty-one transfers of local authority housing under either the Large Scale Voluntary Transfer programme, or with funding from the Estates Renewal Challenge Fund since 1 May 1997.

 Acting returning officers may apply to the Home Office for grants towards the cost of providing temporary ramps and specially adapted polling screens, to make polling stations accessible for those disabled voters who wish to vote in person, for national and European elections. The remainder of the cost is funded by the local authority. Grants are not allocated specifically for local elections. The need for revenue expenditure by local authorities is taken into account, along with other spending pressures and the scope for efficiencies, in the local government finance settlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w04.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Sawford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to publish revised household projections; and if he will make a statement.  [79535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 In our policy statement "Planning for the Communities of the Future" published early last year, the Government said that they would put in place new policies in respect of planning for housing which would include a new flexible approach to regional planning involving decentralisation to regional stakeholders; a national 60 per cent. target for the re-use of previously developed land; the creation of a National Land Use Database; and that we would be setting up a task force to advise us on how to make the best use of recycled land.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para0">Our emphasis is on urban renaissance--making our towns and cities places where people want to live--and this theme will be developed in an Urban White Paper which the Government propose to publish later this year.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para1">The Government have implemented all of these initiatives and more. We issued the consultation draft of planning policy guidance note 11 (PPG11) "Regional Planning" last month, together with new guidance on the preparation of development plans (PPG12). Planning policy guidance note 3 "Housing" (PPG3) was published for consultation last week. It introduces a new sequential approach to the release of housing land which will require local planning authorities to consider the re-use of existing property and of previously developed land before releasing greenfield land for housing development. The National Land Use Database is now being compiled and I expect to publish first results shortly.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para2">Together, these represent the Government's new policy direction to planning for housing and mark a clear departure from what has become known as the "predict and provide" approach favoured by the previous Government. That policy is dead.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para3">It has been the practice to publish periodically projections of household growth in England. In keeping with that, the Government Statistical Service (GSS) will be publishing a report later this year setting out the household projections for the period 1996 to 2021 together with a full description of the methodology by which those projections are derived.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para4">The household projections are one input to the process of regional planning, a new round of which is currently in progress. I have therefore decided to make available the main projections for England and the English regions in advance of publication of the full GSS document.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para5">The number of households in England is projected to have grown from 20.2 million in 1996 to about 24.0 million in 2021, an increase of 3.8 million or about 150,000 households per year. It is a smaller increase to that previously projected for the period 1991 to 2016 which was 4.4 million or around 175,000 households a year.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para6">The most important explanation for the reduction in the projected rate of household formation is the changes contained in the most recent marital status projections 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 471</I><P>
published by the Government Actuary's Department in January. Recent evidence has shown that cohabitation is increasing at a faster rate than expected, leading to a greater increase in the number of couple households by 2016 than assumed in the previous projections. Changes in the marital status assumption have also led to downward revisions in the proportions of older women who are widows or divorcees.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para7">The projections are not forecasts, estimates or predictions. They are based entirely on what might be expected to occur if previous trends continue and are heavily dependant on the assumptions involved. Such trends can and do change as a result, for example, of demographic or economic factors, as the new cohabiting assumptions show.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para8">I therefore agreed with the Select Committee to publish information about how sensitive the projected total number of households at 2021 might be to changes in underlying assumptions. This information is as follows 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 472</I><P>
in tabular form at the end of this statement but, for example, a 1 per cent. change in real interest rates may affect the national projection by over 200,000 households in either direction.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para9">The conclusion of the analysis is that the projected growth of 3.8 million in the number of households in England between 1996 and 2021 is not a precise figure. It reflects one of the potential outcomes but it could be subject to some variability.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para10">In keeping with previous published projections, I am today also announcing household projections for each of the Government Office regions. Again, the Government do not regard the projections as forecasts or predictions of the number of households likely to form. If the new regional projections are compared on a like-for-like basis with those published previously, they indicate a reduced rate of household formation in all regions except the South East where the rate of growth is stable. The projections are as follows:

<a name="90329w04.htm_para11">There are insufficient data available to undertake a sensitivity analysis on the regional projections. However, a significant factor in determining regional household growth is migration from and to other regions and there are some indications that this may be particularly sensitive to economic factors. In this respect, the Government do not believe that past migration trends are necessarily representative of future patterns of regional growth.
<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para12">Regional projections are published as one input to the process of regional planning. As our consultation draft of PPG11 "Regional Planning" indicates, the household projections should be taken into account in assessing a region's housing needs. Other factors should equally be taken into account so that regional planning bodies should, against the background of need and capacity, take a realistic and responsible approach to planning future housing provision.

<P>

<a name="90329w04.htm_para13">The household projections I am publishing today relate to England as a whole and English regions. I recognise that similar information at sub regional level could be useful as background for the regional planning process and the preparation of Regional Planning Guidance and my Department will therefore be writing to the regional planning bodies to make relevant information available in a form consistent with that published as part of the last set of household projections in 1995. The statistics are inherently less reliable at this level of detail and I expect the information to be used only to inform debate as an extrapolation of past trends and not to be used to 'predict and provide'. Rather, I look to regional planning bodies to use their new flexibilites to take account of all relevant factors, against the background of need and capacity, in considering the distribution of growth within a region.

<a name="90329w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 A Gulf veteran who is, or has been, concerned about his or her health may be receiving or have received care, including testing, under various auspices. The Ministry of Defence has only centralised data in respect of its Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP). This was established in 1993 to provide veterans who believe that their health may have suffered as a result of the Gulf conflict with as full a diagnosis as possible of their medical conditions. During an assessment at the MAP, all referred veterans receive a standard set of screening tests and are asked by the examining MAP physician to provide detailed information about possible factors to which they may have been exposed during the Gulf conflict. As at 18 March 1999, 3,021 Gulf veterans had been referred to the MAP for a medical assessment. Of these, 34 were waiting to be seen for the first time and 201 had failed to appear for one or more appointments; hence, a total of 235 have yet to receive any tests at the MAP.
<P>

<a name="90329w07.htm_para4">With regard to the testing of UK Gulf veterans for the presence of depleted uranium (DU), I refer the hon. Member to a detailed paper setting out my Department's position, which I published on Friday 19 March 1999. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90329w07.htm_para5">The MAP is not a research programme. The Ministry of Defence is funding a range of studies into different aspects of Gulf veterans' illnesses. One of these studies--a neuromuscular symptoms study being conducted by a team led by Doctors Michael Rose and Mohammed Shareif at King's College, London--involves carrying out clinical tests on Gulf veterans. A further study on UK Gulf veterans under Professors Simon Wessely and Anthony David of King's College, London, which is being funded by the US Department of Defense, is also conducting clinical tests on UK Gulf veterans. Both these research teams are conducting their studies independently of MOD and we do not have access to the data collected, including any clinical findings.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> Since the test-firing of depleted uranium (DU) based ammunition was approved in 1979 all testing of such ammunition in southern Scotland has been conducted at Kirkcudbright and West Freugh (near Stanraer). The trials at West Freugh, which took place in 1988 and 1990, tested Vulcan Phalanx ammunition and were very limited in nature, with only 200 small calibre rounds (around 20kg) being fired. The testing of 120mm DU-based ammunition for the Challenger main battle tank, which takes place at Kirkcudbright, started in 1982. Since the end of the Challenger tank development programme in 1997 this testing has been significantly reduced and currently only a small number of rounds are fired each year to check manufacturing quality.

<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> Officials from the Department for International Development (DfID) have been in discussion with the World Health Organisation (WHO) concerning possible projects to improve the overall health situation in Iraq. DfID expects to receive formal proposals--for example, to improve epidemiological surveillance in Iraq, to establish links between medical institutions outside Iraq and to improve Iraq's cancer registration system--from the WHO shortly, which the Government will consider carefully.
<P>

<a name="90329w08.htm_para0">The Government are well aware of suggests that there has been an increase in ill-health--including deformities, cancers and birth defects--in southern Iraq, which some commentators have attributed to the use of depleted uranium (DU) based ammunition by Coalition forces during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. However, the Government have not seen any peer-reviewed epidemiological research data on this population to support these claims and therefore cannot comment on them further. There is currently no evidence that the illnesses of the types described, including cancers, are uniquely associated with exposure to DU. The Government would, of course, consider carefully any medical or scientific data which was presented on this subject.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The typical requalification cost for an artillery or tank round of ammunition is about &#163;2 million, of which about &#163;1.5 million is for the charge. For rocket motors the cost is about &#163;5 million and for ejection seat cartridges up to &#163;1 million. Costs vary significantly according to the circumstances, as does the proportion of cost to be met by the Ministry of Defence. These amounts should be set in the context of the overall value of the procurement contracts, which often amount to many tens of millions of pounds. For example, the Extended Range Ordnance/ Modular Charge System contract is worth around &#163;100 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> All ammunition products require Ordnance Board qualification before they are made available for United Kingdom military use. Requalification of explosive products is required whenever there is a prolonged break in production or there has been a change in manufacturer, manufacturing process, or source of raw materials. Therefore it is not possible to determine precisely which future ammunition requirements will induce requalification.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> None. The MOD procures ammunition as a finished product, not as individual components.

We expect the factory to continue to participate in work on Ministry of Defence contracts awarded to Royal Ordnance and other prime contractors until that date.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the overseas countries from which the United Kingdom currently obtains ammunition products; and if he will list the value of each contract.  [78187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The Ministry of Defence currently procures ammunition products from the USA, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Belgium, Israel, Canada and South Africa. The costs associated with individual contracts are commercially sensitive and I am therefore withholding this information under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> Her Majesty's Government normally conclude Memorandums of Understanding only with other national Governments. There are no MOU with overseas ammunition suppliers.

<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> I have not had any discussions about the supply of ammunition with any overseas companies in the past year. However, Ministry of Defence officials have regular contacts on a wide range of issues with defence companies at all levels. These include obtaining 



<P>

information on product ranges and capabilities, the discussion of tenders, and the management and performance of contracts. Details of such contacts in the past year are not held centrally. However, a search of available records indicates that contacts took place with the following ammunition suppliers: Aerojet, Alliant Tech Systems, Armtec, Atlantic Research Corporation, Boeing, Day and Zimmerman, Lockheed Martin, Olin Winchester, Primex, Raytheon, and Team MACS of the USA; Aerospatiale, Celerg, CTA International, and GIAT of France; Alenia, Europea Metalli, Fiat Avio, and Simmel of Italy; Buck Technologies, Diehl, Dynamit Nobel, EBV, GIWS, Junghans, LFK, Mauser, MEN, and Rheinmetall of Germany; MECAR of Belgium; Hirtenberg of Austria; Miltec, Oerlikon, and Swiss Munitions of Switzerland; Eurometaal of The Netherlands, Lapua of Finland, Bofors of Sweden; NAMMO, and Raufoss of Norway; Expal, International Technology of Intallaza of Spain; INDEP of Portugal; Bristol Aerospace, and SNC of Canada; PINDAD of Malaysia; CIS of Singapore; Denel/ Somchem, Denel/Swarklip, Denel/Naschem, Pretoria Metal Pressing and Vector of South Africa; IMI, and Rafael of Israel; ADI of Australia; and Micron of India.

<P>
<UL>(2) what assessments have been made of the security of supply provided by each of the United Kingdom's overseas ammunition suppliers; and if he will make a statement.  [78186]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The Ministry of Defence considers carefully the issue of security of supply before placing equipment contracts with overseas suppliers. Where necessary, we seek suitable safeguards to ensure satisfactory security of supply.
<P>

<a name="90329w08.htm_para1">Contracts contain specific conditions designed to ensure prompt delivery of defence equipment and ammunition products. In order to eliminate exchange rate risks, we aim to place all overseas orders in Sterling. Where this is not possible, we use a variety of measures, including the advance purchase of Deutschmarks and US dollars, to minimise the risk of adverse movements in these currencies.

<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> I consulted other Government Ministers, including my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, about the issues surrounding the recent decisions on the Multi Year Buy and Extended Range Ordnance/ Modular Charge System competitions, including the impact on Royal Ordnance Bishopton and other Royal Ordnance sites. In addition to work associated with the Modular Charge System, Royal Ordnance informed the Ministry of Defence that it would require further work 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 487</I><P>
to be directed to Bishopton, without competition, for the plant to remain open. Even then, the work force would have had to reduce by almost half to around 150 employees. We concluded that &#163;20 million cost premium to keep a much reduced Bishopton open in the short term did not represent good value for the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which foreign Governments have been consulted with regard to the re-sourcing of ammunition supplies to UK forces following the closure of Royal Ordnance Bishopton.  [78181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> We have not formally consulted foreign Governments about the supply of ammunition after the closure of Royal Ordnance Bishopton, nor is there a need to do so. We routinely conduct international competitions for the procurement of ammunition. These show that there are many friendly and reliable alternative sources in Europe and further overseas. In the event of an urgent, unforeseen demand for ammunition, we would secure further supplies from friends and allies, as we have successfully done in the past. To facilitate such procurements the UK is a signatory of the international Joint Ballistic MOU, together with France, Germany, Italy and the US, which allows for the strategic and tactical interchange of 155mm ammunition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> Somchem was a clear winner of the competition for the sub-contract for the Modular Charge System for the AS90 howitzer on both cost and technical grounds. The decision to award Somchem the contract, therefore, represents best value for money.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w09.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Maples: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what defence industrial considerations were taken into account in the award of the artillery shell propellant contract to Somchem.  [78184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding</i> <i>answer 22 March 1999]:</i> We considered defence industrial issues very carefully before deciding to procure the Modular Charge System contract from Somchem. We concluded that Royal Ordnance would still be capable of continuing as a major supplier of a wide range of ammunition to the Ministry of Defence. The company remains a key player in the European ammunition business with a continuing role in the future rationalisation process for the industry.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B>

 Concept studies have examined the feasibility of upgrading and extending the life of the current Invincible-class aircraft carriers.

 British Aerospace Defence Systems, Marconi Electronic Systems, Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Raytheon and Thomson-CSF have been invited to tender for the initial assessment phase of the future aircraft carrier.

In late 1997 the Secretary of State spoke to President Museveni of Uganda about the abduction of many thousands of children by the Lord's Resistance Army, most of whom are forced to become child soldiers or concubines. In Sierra Leone, the British High Commissioner has just agreed with the President Kabbah that children under the age of 16 will be excluded from enlistment in the Sierra Leone armed forces or the civilian defence forces; and that any children taken into custody by ECOMOG will be handed over to UNICEF at the earliest opportunity. We have also provided assistance for children affected by conflict in countries such as Liberia and Sri Lanka.

 Allegations into criminal conduct over which the United Kingdom has jurisdiction are a matter for the police to investigate.

The powers with respect to international requests for restraint are very similar once a country has been designated by an Order in Council. Indonesia has not, however, been designated for this purpose. It is open to any party which considers that it has a claim to property to avail itself of the normal procedures available in the civil courts.

This process will be developed and implemented for cancer centres in the North West in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="90329w12.htm_para5">As part of our work to bring Calman/Hine into line with the national service framework model, we are developing a set of common national standards and performance measures against the new performance framework which will apply across the country. These will be supplemented by a new set of milestones against which progress in implementing Calman/Hine and achieving national targets can be measured.

Appropriate conditions (e.g. separation distances) may be included in a consent, but a consent would not be granted if ACRE considered the risks associated with cross-pollination to be unacceptable. In addition the Government have encouraged the development of industry guidelines which will set out best practice for growing GM crops, and these guidelines will include minimum separation distances between GM and non-GM crops.

Now that the Regulation has been agreed, we will be putting forward more detailed proposals for consultation, taking account of the funds available.

 It is for farmers to decide how best to manage their crop rotations to achieve profitability and meet customer requirements. The Government's role is to provide an appropriate policy framework, which is why it has pressed for CAP reforms aimed at reducing the distortions caused by production-linked subsidies. The Government also aid conversion to organic farming, which relies on crop rotations to maintain soil fertility.

 The precise impact of the statutory charge can be identified only when all moneys due by way of costs and contributions have been collected into the Fund.

Insurance companies trading in the United Kingdom have to be authorised in accordance with the Insurance Companies Act 1982. In addition, most companies agree voluntarily to abide by the industry statements and codes of practice of the Association of British Insurers.

 The information provided is based on the assumption that it is the number of adjudicators, and not adjudications, that is required. There are 50 full-time and 200 part-time adjudicators and approximately 17 per cent. of their time, equivalent to 2,500 sitting days per year, is spent on appeals against decisions by entry clearance officers.

Also, for the first time, my Department is spreading its financial support to museums beyond those which it directly funds by means of a &#163;15 million challenge fund for Designated Museums, the majority of which are outside London.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that the Millennium celebrations are truly inclusive, involving people from every part of the country and all sections of society. As well as promoting economic regeneration, many Millennium Commission projects are specifically designed to strengthen and empower individuals and communities, and to foster access to recreational and learning opportunities in areas where this has previously been limited.

However in the eleven months to the end of February 1999 there is evidence that this trend is being reversed. To enable NMGM to provide better access to its collections, we are providing it with additional funding so that the price of the Eight Pass can be pegged at its current

Measures in the National Lottery Act 1998 and recent changes in Policy Directions to the distributors will help to achieve this. The investigation which the English Sports Council, the Arts Council of England, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Lottery Charities Board, the Millennium Commission and the New Opportunities Fund are undertaking into the reasons for the low take-up of funds in coalfield areas will also help to ensure that people in Yorkshire and Humberside benefit as much as possible from the National Lottery.

 The Millennium Experience is the focus for the nation's millennium celebrations. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is therefore keen to ensure that as many people as possible who wish to visit the Dome can do so and that as many people as possible have the opportunity to take part in the associated National Programme of events and activities. The company's ticket pricing structure was announced on 18 March and includes up to one million free Dome admission tickets for schoolchildren under the Education Tours Scheme. There will also be discounted education rates for students/college visits (at &#163;14.50 each) and school visits (&#163;8 each). Details of the full range of prices were placed in the Libraries of the House on 18 March.

<a name="90329w17.htm_para4">The NMEC is not offering special discounts for low income families although the children of all families have the chance to benefit from free admission under the Education Tours Scheme.

The "halo" effect could double this figure. The BTA have further estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 new tourist related jobs will be created. This is excellent news for the whole of the UK.

<P>

<a name="90329w17.htm_para5">Before the decision was taken to site the Millennium Dome at Greenwich, the Greenwich Peninsula was one of the largest derelict sites in the country, suffering from heavy contamination.

This project, including the new Millennium Village that is being built in the southern part of the site as a model for sustainable regeneration of a brownfield site, will establish the Peninsula as a vibrant new urban quarter for London, with ensuing economic, social and environmental benefits for the south-east and beyond.

 A television licence is required to install or use television receiving apparatus to receive any television programme service, as defined by the Broadcasting Act l990. The licence fee is therefore a payment for permission to receive television broadcasts and not for a service provided. It is payable in full irrespective of the services that can be received or the use made of those services. Linkage of the level of the fee to the services available to, or used by, individual licence holders would undermine the principle of a universal licence fee to fund the BBC's services and would be wholly impractical to administer.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is his Department's estimate of the total value of goods sold in the United Kingdom in the categories of <i>(a)</i> private motor vehicles, <i>(b)</i> white goods and <i>(c)</i> personal computers in each of the last five years for which figures are available.

<a name="90329w19.htm_para5">Estimates of the value of goods sold to consumers in the United Kingdom are published by the Office for National Statistics in "Consumer Trends" and electronically on the ONS databank, which can be accessed by the House of Commons Library. Purchases of private motor vehicles are shown as series CCQI and white goods as series CDDS in table 2.1 of "Consumer Trends". Purchases of computers are not separately identified but are included within series CDGH, audio-visual goods, also in table 2.1.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is based on either the Family Resources Survey (FRS-table 1) or the Family Expenditure Survey (FES-table 2). Unlike the FES, the FRS does not cover Northern Ireland.<P>

2. FRS based HBAI data are not available prior to the financial year 1994-95. For this reason, FES based data (based on combined financial years, where 1995-96 denotes the combined financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97) back to 1988-89 have been provided as a supplementary table.<P>

3. In previous years, HBAI data were mainly derived from the FES. Following a DSS methodological review in 1995, it was recommended that information from the FRS should be introduced into the HBAI series and that it should replace the FES as the main source of information on low-income households.<P>

4. For the purposes of this analysis, 'main source of income' is defined as being the largest of the three sources of income outlined in the table above.<P>

5. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

6. The seventh decile (where decile one is the bottom decile) only partially falls below the average income figure; for this reason, figures relating to it have been excluded from the analysis.<P>

7. It should be noted that the results are subject to year on year sampling variation and that more emphasis should be placed on looking at longer-term trends as opposed to annual variations.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Arrangements for the treatment of payments from college Access Funds have been in place since the Funds were introduced in the 1990-91 academic year.
<P>

<a name="90329w20.htm_para1">Up to &#163;20 per week of any regular payments from Access Funds may be disregarded in the calculation of Jobseeker's Allowance paid to part-time students.

<a name="90329w20.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The word is used in its ordinary sense of health, success, contentment or welfare. In the context of welfare reform, we consider that this is best achieved by promoting work for those who can, whilst providing security for those who cannot.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w20.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We are currently examining the rules listed in chapter five of the Green Paper "Beating Fraud is Everyone's Business: securing the future" (Cm 4012). In each case, we are assessing the extent to which their design contributes to both fraud and error.

 We will be investing in new technology to modernise the administration of Social Security and to make payments more secure against fraud and error. It is not possible to distinguish the costs of security from those of administration.

<P>
<a name="90329w20.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the effect of the proposals contained in Safeguarding Social Security upon benefit administration costs.  [79219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w20.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Delivering a secure system is an integral part of good benefit administration. It is therefore not always possible to specify costs solely directed at safeguarding Social Security. Modernising our computer systems, for example, will deliver a better, as well as a more secure, service to the public.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w20.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have reformed the local authority anti-fraud incentive scheme to ensure that authorities submit valid claims for additional subsidy payments arising from the detection of genuine cases of benefit fraud. It is equally important to prevent fraud from entering the system. An additional &#163;100 million will be made available to local authorities over the next three years to encourage them to adopt the Verification Framework. Through a series of additional checks, carried out throughout the life of a benefit claim, the Verification Framework will help to prevent benefit fraud and error before it has a chance to occur.
<P>

<a name="90329w20.htm_para4">For the longer term we are working with local authorities on the measurement of levels of fraud, the effectiveness of anti-fraud strategies and the whole local authority funding regime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w20.htm_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Single Gateway will build on the existing close working relationship between the Benefits Agency and the Child Support Agency. Since last year, lone parents have been helped to complete a child support application when they are visited by Benefits Agency staff at the start of their Income Support claim. Likewise, under the new arrangements, we will help parents with care to pursue child support at the earliest possible stage.
<P>

<a name="90329w20.htm_para5">Securing regular child maintenance is one of the keys to helping lone parents move from benefit back into the labour market by providing them with a portable income which will supplement their earnings.

<a name="90329w21.htm_para3">The second is about more active management of dormant National Insurance accounts. This would of necessity be a continuing activity because the status of accounts change over time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w21.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We undertake a range of rigorous recruitment checks which follow Cabinet Office guidelines on all staff prior to employment. All existing Departmental staff are bound by strict rules on propriety which cover, for example, possible conflicts of interest.
<P>

<a name="90329w21.htm_para4">We have recently reviewed all of our recruitment and proprietorial checks and found them to be generally sound. However, we are currently undertaking a risk assessment of posts across the Department (including posts involving the allocation of National Insurance numbers) to determine those that are particularly sensitive and may require further checks. In addition, we are already implementing a number of improvements, including even tougher employment checks for new staff, new mandatory management checks to ensure the correct procedures are fully complied with. To provide a further level of assurance our internal audit will carry out their own checks.
<P>

<a name="90329w21.htm_para5">Measures have been put in place to strengthen the security and control of National Insurance numbers. To improve management control, the number of staff who can issue National Insurance numbers has been reduced by two thirds from 1,500 to 500. We have also introduced an approvals system whereby all new staff have to be approved by a designated manager.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to paragraph 5.18 of the document "Asylum Seekers Support", published on 23 March by his Department, under what circumstances families with children will not continue to receive support while they lawfully remain in the country.  [78949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Families with children who are recognised as refugees or granted exceptional leave to remain will, if they are eligible, be transferred to the main benefits system. Those whose application for asylum is rejected will normally continue to be supported while they lawfully remain in the country. Support would be withdrawn only in exceptional circumstances, for example, if the families were to leave the accommodation provided or were seriously to abuse it.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has for support arrangements for asylum seekers whose cases are not dealt with in the six month time scale set down in the Asylum and Immigration Bill.  [78798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There is no such time scale set out in the Bill. The White Paper "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum", indicated in paragraph 8.9, that the Government were aiming to ensure that by April 2001 most initial asylum decisions will be made within two months of receipt and that most appeals to adjudicators will be heard within a further four months.
<P>

<a name="90329w22.htm_para1">The support arrangements will be introduced before those targets are met, but are considered to be suitable for cases which take longer than six months overall, provided that such a support arrangement does not continue for several years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 This information is set out in paragraph 4.20-4.21 of the Information Document "Asylum Seekers Support" which I published on 22 March. The Government have concluded that adult asylum seekers should receive &#163;7 per week; children aged 3-18 should receive &#163;3.50 per week; and children aged under 3 years should receive &#163;7 per week in cash.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Home Office commissioned KPMG to conduct a study of the structure and size of the Directorate required to manage the proposed new asylum seeker support arrangements. We are currently assessing the recommendations in that report, but initial indications suggest that approximately 300 staff will be required.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to paragraph 4.12 of the document published on 23 March entitled, "Asylum Seekers Support", if he will list the component elements of essential living needs.  [78950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is not my intention to specify the individual elements of essential living needs. These will vary for different asylum seekers according to circumstances. The non-accommodation provision listed in paragraphs 4.18-4.21 of the Information Document are intended to cover essential living needs, but it is for asylum seekers to determine how they use the resources available to them.

[78799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The provision in paragraphs 4.18-4.21 of the Information Document "Asylum Seekers Support" which I published on 22 March set out the non-accommodation support provision. This provision is intended to cover any telephone and postage costs incurred by the asylum seeker. Where support is provided mainly in kind, providers will need to provide these services at no cost to the asylum seeker.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w22.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The amount of staff time spent on removals is extremely difficult to quantify. Cases may, depending on their type and complexity take only a few hours to conclude, or many months. Cases might be completed and removal effected, at the port of entry, but many cases will involve appeals, judicial reviews of periods of detention. All incur costs in staff time. An attempt to quantify the staff cost of effecting an asylum removal could, therefore, be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="90329w23.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The number of unopened letters in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) offices fluctuates from day to day with the volume of the postbag. However, as at 19 March there were approximately 3,900 unopened letters in IND offices. Of these, 3,600 were new applications which are readily identifiable from their envelopes and which are routinely sent unopened to caseworkers designated to deal with them, which allows the caseworker to open and deal with correspondence

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w23.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The previous Administration had already removed, in 1994, embarkation controls for passengers travelling from ferry ports and small airports to destinations within the European Union/European Economic Area, with the consequence that some 40 per cent. of all departing passengers were not seen by an immigration officer. There has never been an embarkation control for Channel Tunnel services.
<P>

<a name="90329w23.htm_para0">What was left of the control was, therefore, ineffective in terms of providing a reliable immigration record of a person's departure, and we have since introduced new arrangements following my announcement on 16 March 1998. The new system involves a close partnership between the control authorities and port operators, and is based on intelligence and target led embarkation checks, including the increased use of Closed Circuit Television.
<P>

<a name="90329w23.htm_para1">Resources previously engaged in operating embarkation checks have been re-deployed to improve arrivals control. There are no plans to reinstate routine embarkation controls, although immigration officers will continue to retain their powers to examine departing passengers if circumstances require.

 When an Immigration Officer discovers evidence of a non immigration offence during the course of an examination, the matter is referred to the appropriate authority (e.g. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise or the Police).

 Immigration officers have hitherto used their powers of arrest under sections 24(2) and 25(3) of the 1971 Act sparingly, both as a matter of policy and because of the practical difficulties which arise because these powers do not have associated powers of search and entry. Information about the number of occasions on which these powers have been used is not recorded centrally and there is no requirement for it to be recorded locally.

 The latest three months for which a provisional removals total is available are December 1998 to February 1999. During that period, some 9,210 persons were removed, or departed voluntarily from the United Kingdom, under port or enforcement procedures.
<P>

<a name="90329w24.htm_para0">The annual totals for the last three years are 26,800 in 1996, 31,110 in 1997 and 34,850 (provisional) in 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many failed asylum applicants were <i>(a)</i> removed and <i>(b)</i> deported voluntarily from the UK in each of the last five years; and what proportion of the total number of failed asylum applicants they represented.  [78663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The available information on the numbers of asylum refusals, and removals and voluntary departures of persons who have applied for asylum at some stage, in the last five years is given in the table. It should be noted that: the figures for refusal of asylum and exceptional leave relate to initial decisions by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) and do not take account of the outcomes of appeals or other subsequent decisions; and a removal or voluntary departure in one year may relate to a decision to refuse asylum and exceptional leave, or the withdrawal of an asylum application or appeal, in an earlier year. Furthermore, some failed asylum seekers may leave the United Kingdom without the knowledge of IND, or before enforcement action has been initiated, and will not be recorded in the removals and voluntary departures figures. As the available information on refusals and removals of asylum seekers is not therefore directly comparable, it is inappropriate to these figures to calculate removals and voluntary departures as a proportion of refusals.

 In 1998, some 340 recommendations for deportation were received from the courts. During the same year, 270 deportation orders were signed following a court recommendation for deportation. These data are provisional.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his estimate of the current total number of persons living in the UK who have no legal right to do so; and, of these, how many <i>(a)</i> have had enforcement action initiated against them but not completed, <i>(b)</i> have not yet had enforcement action initiated against them and <i>(c)</i> have absconded.

<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There is no estimate of the total number of persons living in the United Kingdom who have no legal right to do so. There is no figure for the number of persons in the United Kingdom who have no right to be here but against whom enforcement action has not been initiated.
<P>

<a name="90329w24.htm_para2">As at January 1999, the number of persons against whom enforcement action has been initiated but not completed (including absconders) stood at 67,000. But some of these may still have outstanding legal appeals which means they cannot be removed yet.
<P>

<a name="90329w24.htm_para3">As at the end of November 1998 the number of known absconders was 31,500. This covers persons subject to port or enforcement action who had breached conditions of temporary admission, temporary release or restriction order, or were otherwise known to be out of contact with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). Some persons recorded as absconders may have departed from the United Kingdom without the knowledge of IND.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Without having some idea of the number of drivers who actually discover clandestine entrants in their vehicle, any estimate of the proportion who report the matter can only be speculation. Many clandestine illegal entrants already report to the authorities of their own accord. Our aim should be to prevent them arriving in the first place.

<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the road haulage industry, in the course of which we have discussed possible precautionary measures; and I have made it clear that I am happy to have further discussions if this would be helpful. However, the Home Office has not commissioned any independent research into this subject and has not yet participated in the evaluation of research by others, but officials have advised on the work they have done in this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the proportion of road haulage operators and lorry drivers who have experienced incidents involving clandestine entrants.  [78701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Over 9,000 cases of clandestine illegal entry were detected or otherwise came to light during 1998. It is not possible to make an assessment of the proportion of road haulage operators and drivers who were responsible for bringing them into the country. It is not possible either to assess the proportion who were involved in unsuccessful attempts to gain entry to their vehicles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am aware that the Road Haulage Association (RHA) has issued guidance to its members on this subject. It is not possible to judge how many will have acted on that advice or obtained advice from elsewhere and, of course, not all operators entering the United Kingdom will be members of the RHA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w24.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Information on the number of people arrested under the provisions of Schedule 2 is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="90329w24.htm_para4">Provisional figures for 1998 indicate that 27,600 passengers were refused leave to enter and removed, 16,460 illegal entrants were detected and 3,920 people were served with a notice of intention to deport for overstaying or breaching conditions. However, by no means all of these would have been arrested under Schedule 2. Some would have come to light as the result of an application for leave to enter or remain, others may have come to light after being arrested in connection with other matters.

<a name="90329w25.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government's consultation document on the control of unscrupulous immigration advisers did not present a single set of proposals, but invited views on a range of issues and options for change. Of 53 respondents to the paper, all were in favour of regulating those who provide immigration advice for profit and are not already subject to a regulatory system; 22 were in favour of the independent regulation of solicitors; 22 were against regulation of solicitors, but 11 of these expressed some concerns or reservations about the adequacy of the current regulation of solicitors in this field of work.

<a name="90329w25.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Children are an extremely vulnerable group and therefore, unaccompanied children will not normally be interviewed about the substance of their claim if it is possible to obtain sufficient information to decide the claim from written representations or other sources.




<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 548</I><P>

In the event that an interview was necessary in a particular case, normal time limits would apply, but as in all other cases an extension would normally be granted if there was a good reason for the delay, and full account would be taken of the applicant's vulnerability. Obviously, any undue delay in deciding an application once the circumstances are known would not be in the child's interest.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the current cost of processing applications for <i>(a)</i> leave to remain in the United Kingdom, <i>(b)</i> the variation of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom and <i>(c)</i> the fixing of an indefinite leave stamp on an applicant's passport or travel document as a result of the removal or replacement of a previous passport.  [78671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w25.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Our estimate of the average cost of dealing with applications for <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> is &#163;90. This includes direct costs and overheads, including accommodation. The cost of fixing an indefinite leave stamp on a passport will be significantly less than this.

 None. The stamping of visas would slow down the immigration control process. One of the aims of the planned reforms set out in the Immigration and Asylum Bill is to develop a flexible and streamlined system of immigration control to enable bona fide travellers to pass through more quickly. We have 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 553</I><P>
made provision in the Bill for measures to be introduced to achieve these aims and, in particular, to provide for the issue of a visa or other entry clearance to have the effect of also granting leave to enter. In taking these flexibility measures forward, we will be looking at greater simplification of visa processes and how these and our operations in general might be improved by technological developments in immigration control.

<P>
<a name="90329w27.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The available information is that, on average, the waiting time, over the last six months, for a special adjudicator to determine an asylum appeal is estimated to be 13 months. This relates to the date of the receipt of the appeal at the Independent Appellant Authority not the date of the refusal as requested. Information on non-asylum appeals is not recorded centrally.

<P>
<a name="90329w27.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I am publishing on 30 March, the Home Office Drugs Prevention Initiative's (DPI) eighth and final progress report.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para0">This report reflects the Initiative's valuable contribution to advancing the case for effective community based drugs prevention over the last 9 years. That contribution was fully recognised in the Government's White Paper on Drugs, "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain", published in April last year. The work of the Initiative, in terms of its good practice findings from its rigorously

<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 556</I><P>
evaluated demonstration projects, has helped influence thinking and improve the evidence base for drugs prevention.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para1">The Initiative reaches its planned conclusion on 31 March 1999. The White Paper recognised the need for successor arrangements to the Initiative, to support the Government's 10 year anti-drugs strategy. I am pleased to announce that the Home Office Drugs Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS) will replace the DPI from 1 April 1999. The new service will cover the whole of England and will work closely with all Drug Action Teams to encourage good drugs prevention practice and to support their work in delivering the national strategy.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para2">I am placing a copy of the final DPI report in the Library tomorrow at 10.30 am.

<a name="90329w27.htm_wqn4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the outcome of the joint Prison Service and NHS Executive review on the future organisation of prisoners' health care; and if he will make a statement.  [79553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90329w27.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 A copy of the Report by the Joint Prison Service and NHS Executive Working Group on the future organisation of prisoners' health care has been placed in the Library, along with a Table giving a detailed response to the recommendations and action points.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para3">The Report identifies a range of weaknesses with the current organisation and provision of healthcare to prisoners. While there is good work being done, looked at as a whole, there is considerable variation in the organisation, funding, delivery and quality of prisoner health care, with variable links to the NHS. The Report makes clear that this situation is largely the product of a historic legacy of ad hoc development and relative isolation from the NHS. This means that, on the whole, prison health care is reactive rather that proactive; and well developed primary care teams, health needs assessments and appropriately planned services, are the exception rather than the rule.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para4">The Government accept the recommendations and action points set out in the Report and reaffirm the existing aim of prison health care to give prisoners access to the same quality and range of health services as the general public receives from the NHS. The reform of prison healthcare poses problems and issues of a complex nature and will take place against the background of NHS reform. This means that change must be carried out in stages. The Government's response combines immediate action to improve service delivery, with a joint approach to future policy development and further work on identification of prisoner needs, priorities, timescales for improvement and organisation.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para5">First, the Report has identified a number of areas where priority action is needed, and which can begin to be addressed within the existing comprehensive spending settlement. As a start, the Government intend that, by the end of 1999, work will have been carried out to pilot a new prison reception health screening tool. This will help staff more effectively to identify the health needs and status of each individual prisoner and plan how to meet their individual treatment needs. In parallel with this 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 557</I><P>
work, a health needs assessment template will be developed to help prisoners and health authorities determine the health needs of their prison population.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para6">With immediate effect, doctors newly appointed to undertake any kind of primary care in prisons will be required to hold a certificate from the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice (JCPTGP) or have recognised equivalent accreditation to practice primary care medicine. Doctors currently providing primary care services who do not hold the JCPTGP certificate will be encouraged to work towards obtaining it. The Government also accept the case made in the Report that nursing care in prisons should be under the direction of registered nurses. Where this is not the case, Prison Service establishments will work towards achieving it as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para7">The Report draws particular attention to the needs of the large number of prisoners with mental health problems. Within the framework of radical reform set out in the Government's White Paper "Modernising Mental Health Services--Safe, sound and supportive", published in December 1998, the needs of prisons will be taken into account when planning all inpatient mental health services including high and medium secure services. And, in order to support prisoners for whom a transfer to hospital would not be appropriate, Health Authorities will ensure that service agreements with NHS Trusts include outreach services for prisoners. These services will aim to provide appropriate mental health care for persons in prison custody and to achieve continuity of care when moving between secure prison accommodation and community mental health services.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para8">Secondly, the Government in particular welcome the proposal for greater joint working between the Prison Service and the NHS. This is in keeping with the Government's broader policy initiative, "Modernising Government", by removing barriers and disincentives to cross-departmental working where that is necessary for the delivery of better and more effective services.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para9">Ministerial and departmental accountabilities will remain as now: the Prison Service being accountable for the provision of primary care and the NHS for specialist services and for care provided in NHS hospitals. But future planning and delivery of prisoner health care will be underpinned by joint working and planning at national, regional and local levels. Practical benefits on the ground are likely to include the proper integration of health promotion and health care into prison regimes, and arrangements to ensure continuity of health care on receipt into custody, transfer to hospital, or on release back to the community. Health improvement programmes will be expected to reflect these objectives.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para10">In order to put the joint organisation and planning of prison health care on a firm footing, the Chief Executive of the NHS Executive and the Director General of the Prison Service, will, as recommended in the Report, 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 1999 : Column: 558</I><P>
establish in the course of 1999 a Joint Prison Health Policy Unit and a Joint Prison Health Care Task Force. These Units, working with the Prison Service and the NHS will lead and manage the process of change.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para11">The Joint Prison Health Policy Unit will be expected to set overall standards and policy, provide clear strategic direction for prison healthcare, and to advise both Home Office and Health Ministers. This Unit will replace the current Prison Service Directorate of Healthcare and will be physically located in the NHS Executive in the Department of Health. The Prison Healthcare Task Force will draw on staff of appropriate experience from the Prison Service, the NHS and other organisations. Its principal roles will be to offer expert advice and support the joint work that prisons and health authorities will need to do in identifying and implementing plans to improve health services to prisoners and in making the best use of available resources. The publication of this Report signals the importance that the Government attach to establishing joint working arrangements between each prison and their local health authority. Prisons and health authorities will be asked to start their joint work in the course of this summer.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para12">Thirdly, this reorganisation will not only greatly strengthen the co-ordination of prison health care, but form the basis for further work, including an assessment of how budget-setting might best reinforce effective care, the identification of prisoner health needs, the formulation of improvement plans and consequent financial implications, and advice on priorities so as to achieve the effective use of resources.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para13">The Report notes that the scale of the problem with prison health care will not become clear until health authorities and prisons have jointly assessed the local health needs and have formulated improvement plans. It is not, therefore, possible at this stage to say when all the objectives set out in the Working Group's Report can be achieved. However, the Government will be taking steps to identify the scale of the problem and the resources needed to improve performance against standards comparable to those available in the community. The Task Force will aim to provide advice on good practice. Also, through pilots and in other ways, it will help to identify different organisational models of local delivery that meet the primary health needs of prisoners and that are cost effective. In the course of next year a formal review will be carried out to assess structural issues, priorities, timescales and future possible resource requirements.
<P>

<a name="90329w27.htm_para14">While the arrangements set out above will apply to England, there is a need to ensure consistency throughout the Prison Service including the four prisons in Wales. The Secretary of State for Wales fully endorses the principles behind the Report's recommendations. The Welsh Office, and in due course the Welsh Assembly, will be working with the Department of Health and Prison Service to implement proposals to improve prison health care in ways compatible with Welsh circumstances.
