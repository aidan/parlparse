To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total cost of the road traffic accident badger survey has been from its inception to date.  [158335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The total cost of the road traffic accident badger survey to date is &#163;218,000.

<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research is being undertaken on badger to cattle transmission of M. bovis via cattle feed troughs.  [158337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Research by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) has shown that in the Woodchester Park study area some badgers regularly obtained feed from cattle troughs. In addition, badgers have been recorded defecating and urinating in troughs. Ongoing research at CSL aims to identify the seasonal and frequency of trough-use by badgers on cattle farms throughout the south-west of England. The results of this research will be reported to Defra in December 2005.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the responses are of badger groups confronted with shortages of primary foods arising from population pressure in terms of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;selectivity of diet and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;foraging distance.  [158338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The primary food of the badger in Britain is the earthworm. These do not represent a limiting resource across much of Britain, especially the south-west, due to their super-abundance. However, they may not be available to badgers under some conditions such as during periods of dry weather. Therefore, badgers are unlikely to be confronted with food shortages as a result of increasing population size alone. When earthworms are not available badgers are forced to select other food sources and will forage greater distances to obtain these. Being generalist opportunists, badgers will consume a wide variety of foods. These include many invertebrates, plant roots, fruits, cereals, animal carcases and stored livestock feed. Food shortages may encourage badgers to forage at greater distances from their setts, although there is no quantitative data on this.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether badger carcases on the roadside reported by members of the public are included in the road traffic accident badger survey.  [158625]

<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Road Traffic Accident (RTA) survey only operates in the seven English counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hereford, Gloucestershire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. Defra staff endeavour to collect any badgers reported by members of the public from roadsides within those counties. Not all badgers collected are suitable for post mortem examination, and only those that are suitable can provide data for the survey.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many staff are employed in the collection of badgers killed in road traffic accidents; and what the average period is between a report of a carcase being received and a collection being made.  [158627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The road traffic accident survey (RTA) of badgers killed by motor vehicles in seven English counties was operated by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) from June 2002 to end of February 2004. CSL had two full-time staff involved in the collection of RTA badgers (in peak periods another member of staff assisted), and typically a carcase would be collected within 24 hours of being reported.
<P>

<a name="40324w01.html_para0">Defra's Wildlife Unit (WLU) is now operating the RTA survey, and intends to involve up to four staff daily, as necessary, in the task of collecting carcases. All other travelling WLU staff, however, may also collect such carcases, as an ancillary action to their primary work tasks. The WLU will aim to collect such carcases within one working day of their notification.

<a name="40324w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of bovine TB control programmes undertaken without the active co-operation of farmers.  [157939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made, but the co-operation of farmers is vital for a TB control programme in cattle to be effective.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of other causes to which the reduction in bovine TB could be attributed in the Thornbury experiment, other than the clearance of badgers.  [157949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The fundamental difference between the Thornbury area and other areas in south west England, where bovine tuberculosis was a problem, was the systematic removal badgers from the Thornbury area. No other species was similarly removed. No other contemporaneous change was identified that could have accounted for the reduction in TB incidence within the area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her assessment is of the effect of anti-trial activity on the success rate of badger trapping during the Krebs trials.  [157954]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not possible to assess accurately the effect of anti-trial activity on the success of badger trapping, as there are no control data with which to draw a comparison. However, it is likely that such 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2004 : Column 827W</I><P>
activity has had a negative impact on the success rate, and has certainly led to some trapping operations being prematurely suspended or extended.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will estimate the number of injuries to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;cattle owners, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;keepers and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;stockmen which will be sustained as a result of the enhanced testing programme.  [157958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive do not hold specific data on the number of accidents occurring on farms that can be directly attributed to the current TB testing programme. Therefore it would not be possible to estimate the number of injuries resultant of any changes to the TB testing programme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the prevalence of TB in cattle is higher on organic holdings than on those where cattle are housed intensively.  [158021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The TB99 epidemiological questionnaire has been designed to assess factors that might predispose herds to a TB breakdown, and their relative importance. The form includes questions on organic herd status. To date, no finalised analyses have been made, but analyses of pre-Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak data and of data collected in 2002 are in progress. The results will be published later this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent discussions she has had with her counterparts in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Scotland and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Wales on the control of bovine TB; and what the outcome was of those consultations.  [158330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are regular discussions at official level on bovine TB issues. A subject of recent discussions has been the consultation exercise "Preparing for a new GB strategy on bovine tuberculosis".
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what evidence she has collated on whether poor standards of animal health and welfare in cattle husbandry contribute to the increases in bovine TB in cattle.  [158331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 An Independent Husbandry Panel was set up by MAFF on 17&nbsp;January 2000, in response to a recommendation of the Agriculture Select Committee (in April 1999) for a working party to be established to review the available scientific evidence on husbandry, and the role it might play in controlling bovine TB. Factors considered by the Panel included health and welfare aspects such as physiological state and concurrent diseases. Its report was published by MAFF in 2000.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what resources devoted to the Krebs reactive trials have been transferred to the Krebs proactive trials.  [158333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Wildlife unit staff and equipment have always been deployed on all elements of the culling trial; no particular element is ring-fenced and resources will therefore not specifically be re-directed to proactive culling following the cessation of the reactive culling work.

<a name="40324w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what adverse effects have been observed in cattle subject to continuous 60-day TB testing; and whether this has been accompanied by a higher rate of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;abortion, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;premature calving and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;early embryonic loss.  [158499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No adverse effects have been observed in cattle subjected to 60-day (short-interval) tuberculin testing.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what consultations she has had with <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;local authorities and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;their representative bodies on the resource implications arising from the enforcement of the proposed Tuberculosis (England) Order;  [158501]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate she has made of the costs to local authorities of enforcing the proposed Tuberculosis (England) Order 2004 in the first five years of its application.  [158573]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Consideration of the costs to local government will be considered fully in the final Regulatory Impact Assessment for the proposed new Tuberculosis (England) Order 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the cost to UK farmers of a levy to fund compensation payments in respect of slaughtered TB reactors.  [158572]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have not made such an estimate but as a general principle our proposal is that farmers would pay into a levy fund to meet half of the projected costs associated with disease control, including compensation. However, no decision has been taken on whether the levy would cover endemic diseases such as TB, or indeed what costs would be covered. These issues will be in the consultation document on the levy proposals that we are working on.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 6&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 247&#150;8W, on bovine TB, whether TB reactors that are negative on culture are considered to have been infected with M.bovis bacilli.  [158589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Cattle reacting to the intradermal comparative test are considered to be affected by bovine tuberculosis, regardless of culture results. The main reason for carrying out bacteriological tests in those animals is to identify, for epidemiological purposes, the strain of M. bovis responsible for the infection rather than to validate the skin test results.
<P>

<a name="40324w01.html_para1">There are several reasons why reactors may be negative on culture:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A very small proportion (0.5&nbsp;per cent. or less according to the veterinary literature) of reactors without visible TB lesions can be caused by bacteria closely related to the M. bovis bacillus.</FONT></UL>

<a name="40324w01.html_wqn17"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on what basis the Independent Science Group concluded that interference in the Krebs trials had had no discernible impact on the statistical integrity of the trials.  [158596]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The main technique used by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) for monitoring whether badger densities in the trial areas are consistent with the treatments, the 20&nbsp;per cent. surveys of trial areas, showed that badger activity levels changed in line with the treatment given (proactive, reactive or survey-only). Furthermore, the ISG carried out various statistical analyses on the data from the reactive and survey-only areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. These have shown a consistent effect of reactive culling across trial areas.

<a name="40324w01.html_wqn18"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs who was in charge of the conduct of the Thornbury trial; and what his or her current position is.  [158597]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her best estimate is of the number of badgers killed during the Thornbury trial.  [158599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not possible to give a number. The method of culling, gassing, meant many badgers died underground and could not be recovered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_wqn20"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cattle herds in heavily infected areas have demonstrated resistance to TB infection; and what explanation has been adduced for this phenomenon.  [158603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w01.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are many possible reasons why some herds in heavily infected areas remain uninfected. Since 1994, approximately 70&nbsp;per cent. of herds in current yearly tested parishes have had no confirmed breakdown. The TB99 epidemiological survey is investigating risk factors. The next report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB will include some results from the analysis of TB99 data from before the foot and mouth disease outbreak and, possibly, more recent (2002) data.

 It is not possible to give a realistic figure for the average cost of a Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) area.

 Carcases of any domestic cats submitted to VLA Regional Laboratories are examined for TB as part of the standard post-mortem protocols. If TB is suspected by the submitting veterinarian or if characteristic lesions of TB are found in the course of the post mortem examination at VLA, appropriate samples will be taken for histological and bacteriological tests to confirm the presence of "Mycobacterium bovis".
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the scientific justification was for the reduction in the 2004 haddock total allowable catch allocation for the Rockall Haddock fishery.  [161993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The scientific advice was for catches of Rockall haddock in 2004 to be reduced to the lowest possible level.

 The ICES advice from October 2003 was that West of Scotland stocks of Nephrops are exploited at sustainable levels. Advice for the Nephrops stocks alone was that a TAG of 11,300 tonnes was appropriate, and the TAG for 2004 was set at that figure.

<a name="40324w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The autumn North sea fisheries survey undertaken by CEFAS changed to the GOV (Grande Ouverture Verticale) trawl from 1992. The survey gear predominantly targets roundfish but also samples a wide range of other commercial fish. Consequently the gear is not designed to target only cod. Nevertheless, the GOV trawl is more efficient at catching cod than the Granton trawl it replaced. Both gears show a very truncated age distribution, with few mature cod. Before the change to the GOV gear the cod stock had seriously declined, and in the early 1990s the advice from ICES was that strong measures were needed to protect the cod, including direct reductions in fishing effort. Results from the two gears, albeit at different times, are comparable.

<a name="40324w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what her estimate is of the proportion of North Sea fish stocks which have gravitated to oil and gas rig exclusion areas and are not accessible to commercial fisherman;  [161998]
<P>
<UL>(2) what account is taken of the gravitation of commercial fish species to oil and gas pipelines and rigs in the conduct of abundance surveys.  [162031]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 This is not a well researched area but one North Sea study concluded that an oil platform had attracted cod and saithe, leaving a zone around the platform where fish density was lower. Even so, the total quantity was negligible compared to regional or even local fish stocks. On this limited basis it does not appear that the aggregation of cod and saithe by platforms is likely to have a significant effect on the availability of fish.

<a name="40324w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to what extent the previous year's landing of any specific fish species influences the setting of total allowable catches.  [161999]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Data on landings of commercial fish species are one important source of information for international assessments of such species. These assessments provide the basis for scientific advice on total allowable catches.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what adjustments are made to landing figures of fish species to account for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;discards and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;under-reporting in order to estimate the true levels of fishing mortality; and whether those adjustments have been constant in recent years.  [162000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Data on discards are included in only some annual assessments where sampling is such as to provide an adequate estimate of the discards. Scientists at ICES use the best information at their disposal in the stock assessments, and this may include information on under-reporting or misreporting. The magnitude will depend upon the circumstances of any one year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the implications of Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 of 4&nbsp;November 2003, on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain community fishing areas, are for UK fishermen.  [162002]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Council Regulation 1954/2003 introduces a new fishing effort management regime for Western Waters in place of that contained in Council Regulation 685/95. It extends the scope of the regime from vessels over 18 metres overall length to vessels over 15 metres overall length but no longer applies to vessels fishing for deep-water species which are now subject to separate management arrangements. The hailing in and out arrangements contained in the previous regime have been removed except in a newly created biologically sensitive area off the south-west coast of Ireland. The Council will agree new effort ceilings for Member States later this year. The new arrangements do not affect the ability of UK registered vessels over 15 metres to fish in western waters. Fisheries Departments will monitor overall fishing effort against the ceilings set by Council. Where an effort ceiling is in danger of being breached licences will be varied to prohibit fishing in the relevant area. No such licence variations have proved necessary since the previous regime was introduced in 1995.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There has been extensive tagging of cod to determine their migration and movements. These data form the basis for the current assessment and management areas for cod.
<P>

<a name="40324w02.html_para1">Since 1999, CEFAS has released cod tagged with electronic tags that allow more detailed information to be derived. The work has recently been expanded under a joint Defra/EU funded program (CODYSSEY) that is investigating movements and behaviour of cod over a wide part of the NE Atlantic including the North Sea. The technology is also being used in a current R&D programme which will help to show how cod respond to variations in food supply.

<P>
<UL>(2) pursuant to her answer of 23&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 134W, on fisheries, what investigations she has carried out to determine the effect of environmental change and species interactions because of increased water temperature in the North Sea.  [162025]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Two key factors are affecting recruitment of cod. First, the size of the cod stock itself, as fewer adult cod give fewer young. Secondly, the environment, through the planktonic food chain, affects the survival from eggs to "recruits". Sea temperature is often used as an index of such environmental changes. Defra are funding research into the links between the environment and recruitment, as illustrated in the recently publicised article in Nature. However, it is the first we have to manage. ICES advice is that if the environment is also causing reduced recruitments then managers have to be even more cautious.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 23&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 135W, on fisheries, on what evidence scientists have based their advice that over the last 20 years the fishing rate on cod has been five times that required to promote optimal use of the cod stock.  [162026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w02.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 ICES assessments show that recent fishing rates on cod have been about 60&nbsp;per cent. per annum ("F of 1.0"). This is over three times the rate needed to achieve the maximum sustainable yield per recruit (MSY) (F= 0.3) and five times that needed to achieve the bioeconomic optimum F0.1 (F = 0.2).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what changes have been made to the criteria used by the Environment Agency to determine priorities for investment in flood defences in each of the last five years; and on what basis these changes were made.  [154914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w03.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 For grant-aided capital investment the Environment Agency uses Defra's priority scoring system, which applies to all flood and coastal defence operating authorities. The system was introduced on a pilot basis in 1997 and, following a review and wide ranging consultation, a revised system was announced in 2002 to come into effect in April 2003. The revised system ranks projects on three components in a ratio of 20:12:12 respectively: benefit:cost ratio, the number of people to be protected (as measured by number of residences over cost) and environmental assets 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2004 : Column 836W</I><P>
protected. In order to be approved for grant aid from Defra proposals must meet a minimum threshold score, which is reviewed annually.
<P>

<a name="40324w03.html_para0">For investment in other flood management expenditure the Agency issued guidance to Regional Flood Defence Committees (RFDCs) on priorities in 1998. From 1&nbsp;April 2004 Grant in Aid from Defra will replace levies on local authorities for financing the bulk of RFDC expenditure and this gives the Agency a greater direct role in deciding on priorities and distribution between regions. For 2004&#150;05, allocations reflected the assumptions made in regional business plans for the previous levy-setting round. The Agency is now working with Defra on a more robust prioritisation system for the allocation of Grant in Aid based on new performance measures in relation to flood risk reduction, for application from 2006&#150;07. In the meantime the Agency will be expected to meet the targets published in their 2004 Corporate Plan.

 It is for market operators to take a commercial decision as to whether they choose to operate as a dedicated slaughter market. These markets can be beneficial to auction markets because of the revenue received from livestock originating from farms that are under a movement standstill.

<a name="40324w03.html_para1">Dedicated slaughter markets can also be beneficial to livestock farmers because they are able to take animals there whilst their farm is under a movement standstill.

(163070).
<BR>
The 2001 Census defines a same-sex couple as two people of the same sex, both resident in the same household, who report themselves as partners on the Census form. Figures published in table UV93 in the 2001 Census National Report for England and Wales Part 2 on the number of people with same-sex partners indicate that there were 39,261 co-residential same-sex couples in England and Wales identified by the 2001 Census. However, same-sex couples can only be identified if they choose to declare themselves as partners on the Census form. Thus the count of co-residential same-sex couples would be an underestimate of the true number. It is not known to what extent there was an undercount because, for example, same-sex couples may have ticked some other box in the relationship field such as 'Unrelated'. Furthermore, a household may contain more than one couple and there is no exact count of the number of same-sex households from the 2001 Census.
<BR>
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) gives information about same-sex couple households for each three-month period. It collects information on residents in private households. Questions are designed to establish whether each resident is cohabiting or not, and, if so, with which other household member. However, same-sex partnership can only be distinguished if the respondent volunteers the fact; it is not asked. In the LFS, a same-sex couple is defined as two respondents who are living together as a couple in the household and who are the same sex.
<BR>
In the three-month period ending November 2003, 50,887 same-sex couple households in Great Britain were identified on this basis. The LFS is a sample survey covering over 57,000 households in the United Kingdom in each three-month period. As with any statistical sample survey, estimates from the Labour Force Survey are subject to sampling error.
<BR>
It is not possible to derive an estimate of the number of co-residential same-sex couples in Scotland by taking the difference of the two estimates provided in this answer, since data were provided at different times and in different contexts, and each figure is subject to estimation error.
<BR>
There will be a more comprehensive analysis of how to interpret information on same sex couples later this year.

 HM Treasury works with the Office of Science and Technology, the DTI and the DfES on the implementation of the Government's science strategy, Investing in Innovation. HM Treasury's own direct expenditure on science and research is relatively small and is limited to economic advice, analysis and statistics: for example, during 2002&#150;03, around &#163;250,000 was spent on some 15 projects funded from the Macroeconomic Research Budget.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w06.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Since the Chancellor's announcement in the Pre-Budget Report that the Government were considering introducing tax stamps for spirits, Treasury Ministers and Officials have received a wide range of representations on this and on the spirits industry's alternative package of measures. Those representations acknowledge that spirits fraud is a serious problem and needs to be addressed but differ in their views on how to tackle this effectively. The main concerns highlighted related to the impact and compliance costs of tax stamps. In making his decision that tax stamps are necessary to tackle spirits fraud, the Chancellor took account of concerns raised and announced on Budget Day that he will help the trade financially with the cash-flow costs and capital investment associated with the introduction of tax stamps. He also announced that there would be a further freeze on spirits duty&#151;for the seventh Budget in a row and, indeed, that spirits duty will be frozen for the remainder of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40324w06.html_para2">Officials are working with the industry to consider how the offsetting measures can be effectively targeted and applied and to develop the detailed arrangements for tax stamps in a way that minimises additional burdens on business and causes minimal disruption to the trade's operations.

 This Government have given exhaustive consideration over recent years, in close consultation with the alcohol industry, to finding ways to tackle the serious problem of spirits duty fraud.

<P>

<a name="40324w06.html_para3">HM Customs and Excise held a formal consultation on tax stamps in late 2001 and early 2002. They conducted a further formal consultation in the summer of 2003 on regulatory options for reducing opportunities for fraud in the alcohol holding and movement system.
<P>

<a name="40324w06.html_para4">Partly as a result of those earlier discussions, a number of measures have already been put in place or are planned to tackle spirits fraud. These include the creation of a Joint Spirits Fraud Task Force in 2002 and the development of draft Memoranda of Understanding between Customs and key spirits trade associations. Customs have also strengthened their operational response to fraud, including the creation of a National Discreditation Team to detect illicit loads which were destined to be diverted after arrival in the UK.
<P>

<a name="40324w06.html_para5">Despite these ongoing efforts, Customs' estimates, published alongside the Pre-Budget Report in December 2003, showed that around &#163;600&nbsp;million of revenue was lost through spirits fraud in 2001&#150;2002. The Government therefore announced that tax stamps for spirits would be introduced from 2006 unless the industry put forward alternative measures that would be as effective as tax stamps in combating fraud.
<P>

<a name="40324w06.html_para6">There has been a further intensive period of discussions with the industry since December on all aspects of tax stamps and alternative options. The industry put forward an alternative package of 17 proposals. However, as announced in the Budget, the Government's assessment is that the anti-fraud impact of the alternative package falls significantly short of that estimated for tax stamps. The package contains inherent weaknesses: it leaves the door open for displacement to other types of fraud, most notably inward diversion; it stands to be undermined by a complicit party; and unlike tax stamps it does not tackle the problem of identification&#151;the ability for consumers, retailers and Customs officers to distinguish readily between licit and illicit products.

 Officials from HM Customs and Excise have contacted forty countries which operate tax stamps to discuss their regimes and experience of fraudulent strip stamps. From the twenty-five detailed responses received it is clear that fraudulent production can be limited by the use of anti-counterfeiting measures.
<P>

<a name="40324w06.html_para8">In addition, Customs have conducted a series of discussions with security printers and other experts in anti-counterfeiting technology. This has revealed a wide range of overt, covert and forensic features which could be used to protect UK tax stamps from counterfeiting.

The review found a widespread belief among suppliers that the Code was not working effectively. However, suppliers did not provide any hard evidence to support their view. The Office of Fair Trading is therefore carrying out a further compliance audit to establish how supermarkets deal with suppliers under the Code.

 Measures instituted by this Government since 1997 to improve pensioners' incomes have been targeted largely on those in the lower part of the income distribution who tend to be older, female, and from ethnic minorities.
<P>

<a name="40324w09.html_para2">The main measures since 1997 include: above inflation increases in the Basic State Pension between April 2000 and April 2003; the introduction of the Minimum Income Guarantee and then Pension Credit which, from April 2004, will ensure that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;105.45 a week and no couple on less than &#163;160.95 a week, as well as providing extra support for those with modest savings; Winter Fuel payments of &#163;200 a year for the remainder of this Parliament; an extra &#163;100 a year within the Winter Fuel Payments for those aged 80 or over; free TV licences for individuals aged 75 or over; and an extra 100 for households with at least one pensioner aged 70 or over.
<P>

<a name="40324w09.html_para3">The Government will be spending around &#163;10 billion a year extra on pensioners in 2004&#150;05 as a result of these measures. They have resulted in pensioner households gaining &#163;1,350 a year in real terms with the poorest third of pensioners gaining &#163;1,750 a year in real terms.
<P>

<a name="40324w09.html_para4">In addition, the DWP provides comprehensive guidance to staff on providing a service to ethnic minority communities. The Department also provides information in a range of languages and holds an annual Ethnic Minority forum at which issues affecting black and minority ethnic pensioners are discussed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w09.html_spnew11"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government currently have no plans to require compulsory employer contributions. We believe in the value of employer contributions but also in the pensions partnership that is at the heart of the voluntarist system.
<P>

<a name="40324w09.html_para5">It is, however, important that progress is independently monitored. That is why we have established the Pensions Commission to monitor how the voluntarist system is developing.

 The Government are sympathetic to all those people who will not receive the pension they worked so hard to build up for their future retirement. We have been meeting some of those affected and listened to suggestions regarding assistance ahead of the Pension Protection Fund's introduction. But there are complex arguments on both sides.
<P>

<a name="40324w09.html_para6">We are now exploring with industry representatives the basis on which we can establish firm estimates of the extent of the problem of defined benefit schemes winding-up under funded, the numbers affected and the potential scale of losses. Once those data have been collated, I will be in a better position to report more fully the findings of our examinations and what, if any, the appropriate course of action should be.

<P>
<a name="40324w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what his policy is on the statutory retirement age in the UK.  [162861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w10.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 There is no statutory retirement age in the UK, in the sense of an age at which legislation requires a person to retire.
<P>

<a name="40324w10.html_para0">The state pension age is currently 65 for men and 60 for women but will increase gradually from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020 to allow employees and employers as well as companies running pension schemes time to plan for and implement the changes.
<P>

<a name="40324w10.html_para1">We have signalled our intention to maintain the state pension age at 65 (there is a consensus that people should have the right to work longer but that this should be voluntary and not forced). However, both Private and State Pension systems allow individuals to work past this age and accrue higher pensions.
<P>

<a name="40324w10.html_para2">Proposals in the Pensions Bill will allow individuals to receive better rewards for deferring their state pension in the form of a lump sum payment or increased pension when an individual eventually retires.
<P>

<a name="40324w10.html_para3">The minimum age at which tax privileged retirement benefits can be drawn from a private pension scheme will be raised to 55 years by 2010. It is possible to retire earlier in exchange for an actuarial reduction of private pension. The actual amounts are dependant on the type of pension scheme and when the employee retires. It is a requirement of tax legislation that schemes should have a normal pension age reflecting the age at which individuals would usually withdraw their pension.
<P>

<a name="40324w10.html_para4">We are proposing to raise the age at which public sector employees can draw an unreduced pension from 60 to 65. This age would apply regardless of the employee's length of service but certain occupations where the physical capacity of the job justify the award of a normal pension at a lower age will continue.

 Evidence from research plays a key role in developing, monitoring and evaluating the business of the Department. The Department has developed a cycle of investigation and research, leading to informed planning to implement change (sometimes through pilots which refine innovative approaches), and then monitoring to assess the impact. This cycle is reflected in a parallel process of consulting upon and commissioning our social research programme through open tendering. The analytical community has been reorganised and aligned with policy and delivery units, integrating analysis and policymaking to provide the highest level of evidence-based policy making. The Department has maintained the level of research spending, and rigorous evaluation and monitoring of new developments. All research is published on the internet so that it is freely available to anyone who would wish to use it.

 Conditions on the delivery of mail are a licensing matter for the regulator, Postcomm. The Postal Services Act 2000, and the Licence granted by Postcomm under it, requires Royal Mail to make one daily delivery to every household in the United Kingdom. It does not specify the time at which this has to be made. Postcomm, therefore, does not have authority to dictate the time of the daily delivery. Postwatch (The Consumer Council) has worked closely with Royal Mail (and the CWU) throughout the process to ensure that the change to a single daily delivery balances commercial necessity against customer need. Postwatch undertook extensive research jointly with Royal Mail to ensure that any adverse effect on consumers was minimised. Postwatch advocated local flexibility rather than a "one-size-fits-all" solution and continues to work with Royal Mail at a local level to help ensure a smooth transition.

Planners are currently considering the designs for a new custody suite at Launceton and subject to planning consent, this will be open in 2005 and will provide an additional 21 cells. There are other cells available in police stations across Cornwall that are not part of custody suite facilities.

<a name="40324w16.html_para0">Refugees are now returning home. Recently, community leaders from refugee camps inside Afghanistan issued a written statement that they felt conditions in the North have now improved sufficiently for refugees to return. As a result, 30 families (118 individuals) from the Zahre Dasht camp returned to Farayab province on 21&nbsp;March. UNHCR jointly facilitated the return and provided shelter, income generation opportunities and water to vulnerable returnees in their areas of origin.

<a name="40324w16.html_para1">From a high of one million refugees living inside Afghanistan in 2001, there are now fewer than 200,000. Similarly, over three million refugees have returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran.

In addition, &#163;454,589.00 has been provisionally allocated for regional projects, including possible interventions in Brazil and Bolivia.

 The "Ysaka" project was approved and started in 2000, and implementation was delegated to a Management Unit led by two co-directors (one European and one Paraguayan). Seven wells have been completed to date. Up to December 2002, the European Commission had disbursed a total of 3.2&nbsp;million euro to this project.

The Commission's anti-fraud unit is currently conducting an investigation that will seek to recoup missing funds. In the meantime the Government of Paraguay have filed a criminal complaint against the two co-directors. DFID and the Foreign Office will continue to monitor the situation.

 Over the past 10 years, DFID has funded about &#163;3.6&nbsp;million of applied research on renewable energy, covering all the main renewable energy technologies, about half of this in the last four years.
<P>

<a name="40324w16.html_para8">We recognise the importance of access to affordable and reliable energy services to economic growth and development, drawing on the full range of appropriate technology options, including renewable energy.

<P>

<a name="40324w16.html_para9">As a follow-up to the WSSD, DFID is working with several international networks to promote improved access to energy services, including the Global Village Energy Partnership and the EU Energy Initiative. These programmes involve dialogue with developing countries about their energy needs in support of their poverty reduction objectives. Most countries possess a range of indigenous natural resources that may help meet requirements such cooking, heating, lighting and water pumping. Where they are practical and financially feasible, renewable energy resources may have an important role to play.

 Child labour is a significant problem in Guatemala with estimates of the number ranging from 550,000 to 900,000. The Government of Guatemala have ratified the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, which call for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, the rehabilitation of child labourers, and the prevention of child labour. They have also pledged to create a commission to examine the requirement for new regulations and the enforcement of existing labour legislation, but they face many constraints in putting these commitments fully in to effect. DFID will continue to monitor the Government of Guatemala's progress in doing so.

 Under Saddam Hussein's regime, Iraq was moving away from the Millennium Development Goals. The provision of health care, education and essential services declined significantly between the 1980s and 2003. Iraq's position on the Human development Index fell from 76th in 1990 to 126th in 2000.

<a name="40324w17.html_para0">Following Saddam's overthrow, the international community pledged $32 billion in assistance for 2004&#150;2007 at the Madrid Donors' Conference last October. A significant proportion of this finance will be invested in health, education and essential services including water supply and sanitation. Consideration is also being given to reducing Iraq's unsustainable external debt.

<a name="40324w17.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Great progress was made in reducing malarial mortality in the 1970s and 1980s, yet many parts of Africa are now seeing an increase in the number of deaths from malaria. A key cause is the increase in the resistance to anti-malarial drugs and the lack of affordable alternatives. In addition the capacity of health systems in sub Saharan Africa is often inadequate to respond effectively to malaria. Nonetheless, malaria remains a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable.
<P>

<a name="40324w17.html_para2">Since 1998 the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided in excess of &#163;110&nbsp;million to support malaria control activities globally and at country level. At the global level this include support to Roll Back Malaria; support to the Medical Research Council; support to the Malaria Consortium Resource Centre; and initiatives to help find new low-cost malaria treatments. DFID has committed US$ 280&nbsp;million over seven years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). The GFATM will fund distribution of insecticide impregnated bednets and appropriate ant-malarial medication.
<P>

<a name="40324w17.html_para3">DFID also supports malaria control activities at country-level through our bilateral county programmes, either through direct support to the health sector or through general budget support. DFID is committed to supporting national Governments and their partners to help ensure that effective drugs and commodities, including effective anti-malarial drugs, are accessible to the poor. Since 1997, DFID has committed &#163;1.5 billion to strengthen health systems to deliver vital drugs and health care treatment.

 The provision of search and rescue dogs is managed and supported by the non-governmental organisations themselves that comprise the National Search and Rescue dog group. DFID meets the costs of their deployment and return when the dogs are used overseas as part of a United Kingdom response to natural disasters such as earthquakes. It is not possible to disaggregate the deployment costs of the dogs as they are one part of a larger search and rescue effort and immediate response that usually also includes the delivery of other relief items by the same chartered aircraft.

<a name="40324w17.html_para6">The UK has worked hard to improve aid effectiveness by untying aid, focusing support on strategies drawn up by developing countries themselves, harmonising our assistance with other donors, and the use of new means of aid, such as direct budget support. More effective use of aid therefore, means moving away from donors allocating funding to selected sectors or to donor-led projects, and moving towards providing support that is consistent with national poverty reduction strategies. For this reason, DFID budgets according to regions and countries, and allows country programmes to determine priorities according to national plans.
<P>

<a name="40324w17.html_para7">DFID's strategy for water and sanitation is therefore aimed at seeking to ensure that water and sanitation issues are given the right level of priority within developing countries' plans although evidence suggests that this is not always the case. It is for this reason that DFID has recently published a Water Action Plan, 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2004 : Column 887W</I><P>
which sets out how we intend to take this work forward. The Plan sets out what needs to be done at the national, regional and international level. The key elements are: making sure water and sanitation issues figure prominently in policy discussions with our main partner countries in their reform agendas; providing evidence of the links between improved water management, water supply and sanitation and achieving all the MDGs, and ensuring that we are making use of this evidence in our policy dialogue; improving the way the international system works, by focusing support on key international partnerships and networks, particularly those that can improve co- ordination in the water sector.
<P>

<a name="40324w17.html_para8">The next step will be to put the plan into operation.

In my reply I noted the work being done to ensure London schools receive maximum benefit from all available sources of funding, and welcomed his views on how best to ensure the coherence of funding streams relating to the Extended Schools initiative. Officials meet regularly with the Association of London Government to discuss a range of issues, including funding for London schools, in the context of the London Challenge Programme.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

<i>(i)</i> Connexions Partnerships were rolled out over two years commencing April 2001. North London and South London started in April 2001, East London in April 2002, Central London in June 2002 and West London in September 2002. It was expected that the NEET figures would increase during the start up period reflecting the wider remit of the Service to engage with all young people in the relevant age group.<P>

<i>(ii)</i> Data for April 2001 to March 2002 are for 16&#150;19 year olds. Data for 16&#150;18 year olds were not available.<P>

<i>(iii)</i> *Data for April 2001 and May 2001 were unavailable for North London Connexions Partnership due to initial difficulties in establishing coverage of the 16&#150;18 cohorts.<P>

<i>(iv)</i> The number of 16&#150;18 year olds not in education, employment or training increases in September each year as summer school leavers enter the labour market for the first time.<P>

<i>(v)</i> From April 2003 mandatory timescales were introduced for maintaining the currency of a young person's activity and thereby focus attention on the size of the NEET group. The variation between the partnership data from April 2003 indicates both the varying success partnerships have had in applying the follow up rules and the cyclical nature of the NEET group.<P>

institutions. The funding made available to HEFCE and English universities for 2004&#150;05 provides for a modest increase in student numbers from EU countries following accession. It is not possible to predict the numbers with certainty at this stage since a decision to study in the UK depends on a number of factors, including the availability of HE in the student's home country and their ability to support their own living costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 No, we are committed to reducing ring-fenced budgets for schools. We believe that schools will get best value from their budgets by managing them as a whole in accordance with their own priorities.

<P>
<a name="40324w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Officials from the London Challenge Programme have met with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit to discuss the relevant findings of the London Analytical Report, including those relating to pupil mobility. The London Challenge is addressing the particular challenges faced by schools

with high levels of mobility through the Key Stage 3 Strategy and through the trialling of induction mentors in 22 London secondary schools as part of the 'On the Move' project.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether there is evidence of a disproportionate effect in London authorities arising from pupil mobility.  [163420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Pupil mobility in some London schools is significant. Data published in the Ofsted report 'Managing Pupil Mobility' in 2002 showed that mobility in both inner and outer London was higher than elsewhere. Schools in inner London authorities had an average of 14.2&nbsp;per cent. of pupils joining or leaving mid year. In Outer London the average was 6.8&nbsp;per cent.. This compared to 5.9&nbsp;per cent. for metropolitan authorities, 6.3&nbsp;per cent. for unitary authorities and 5.7&nbsp;per cent. for shire authorities. Ofsted evidence suggests that where mobility levels exceed 12&nbsp;per cent. there is an impact on standards achieved for all pupils. We are seeking to address the issue of pupil mobility in London through the trialling of induction mentors in 22 London secondary schools, and by the dissemination of good practice through the Key Stage 3 Strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has accepted the School Teachers' Review Body's recommendation that pay scales increase by 2.5&nbsp;per cent. in April 2004 and by 3.25&nbsp;per cent. in April 2005 to August 2006. This is in line with the Government's projections on the rate of inflation to 2006 and it is not, therefore, expected that teachers' pay will involve a real terms increase.
<P>

<a name="40324w20.html_para3">The Government play no part in setting the levels of pay in the higher education and further education sectors as universities and further education colleges are independent and autonomous bodies. Pay levels are subject to negotiations between employers and the representative trade union bodies. Pay levels will therefore vary from institution to institution.

A total of 20,000 personnel have been or are being trained for the Afghan National Police (ANP) force. We do not have exact figures for retention in the ANP but overall retention rates appear better than in the ANA.

PRTs aim to support the authority of the Afghan Government, improve the security situation, facilitate development and reconstruction, and support Security Sector Reform. In the long-term Afghanistan must have an effective national army and police force. Work to recruit and train them has been under way for some time, with our active support and involvement. A wider programme of Security Sector Reform is also underway, including the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the maximum council tax is that a local authority may set for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;a second home and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;an empty home; and to what purposes the local authority may apply the proceeds of the council tax received in each case.  [162220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 From 1&nbsp;April 2004, the Council Tax (Prescribed Classes of Dwellings)(England) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3011) allow local billing authorities to reduce the discount on most second homes to 10&nbsp;per cent. and on long-term empty homes to zero. There is a national exemption from council tax for unfurnished dwellings which are vacant for six months or less. The maximum council tax which could be charged on a second home is therefore 90&nbsp;per cent. and the maximum council tax which could be charged on a long-term empty home is 100&nbsp;per cent. Council tax from second homes and empty homes can be used in the same way as council tax from other property. The proceeds are shared, between billing and precepting authorities. The effect of changing the discounts on second and long-term empty homes is to raise the tax base of an area and so local authorities in that area can raise more council tax. The Government will not adjust grant because of the extra income generated by reducing the second homes discount. This means local authorities in the area have the choice to spend this on local priorities or to have a lower council tax or precept than would 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2004 : Column 908W</I><P>
otherwise have been the case. In the case of long-term empty property, the Government intend to adjust grant so that extra revenue will not be retained locally.

 After transfer local housing authorities retain their statutory functions in relation to homelessness and the allocation of housing. The Housing Allocation, Homelessness and Stock Transfer&#151;A Guide to Key Issues issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in January 2004 advises that it is crucial for housing authorities to negotiate nomination agreements with the transfer landlord and other partner RSLs to ensure that they can continue to discharge their statutory responsibilities.

 Responsibility for promoting voter understanding in the June elections to the Greater London Authority and European Parliament rests with the Electoral Commission under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Greater London Returning Officer has overall responsibility for organising and running the GLA elections and, in 2004, the European Parliament elections in the London region. I understand that the Electoral Commission and Greater London Returning Officer are working in partnership on a programme of public information and awareness.

<a name="40324w24.html_para0">The Government have made provision for the Greater London Returning Officer to include information about the GLA and European Parliamentary elections in the

 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister met with members of the Electoral Commission on 3&nbsp;March to discuss issues relating to the piloting of all-postal voting at the European Parliamentary and combined local elections in June, including how many regions should be involved. Both parties agreed that the regions that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced should use all-postal voting this year are each capable of running a successful pilot.

<a name="40324w24.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Following the late sharp increase in the size of the Supporting People budget last year the Government launched an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme. The review concluded that &#163;1.8 billion was too much to pay for legacy funding, however it recommended that the pace of change needed to take account of the need to protect services for vulnerable people. This is why authorities have only been required to make a 2.5&nbsp;per cent. efficiency saving in 2004&#150;05 with an element of these funds being re-allocated elsewhere on the programme. The final Supporting People grant allocations for 2004&#150;05 have now been made and will not be reverted. Those allocations reflect a very significant increase in funding compared to two years ago.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) when the Committee on Safety of Medicines was first informed of the risk of stroke in certain atypical antipsychotics used for the treatment of elderly people with dementia;  [161249]
<P>
<UL>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w25.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The safety of medicines is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the Government's independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).
<P>

<a name="40324w25.html_para1">Early information on the risk of stroke in dementia patients treated with risperidone was assessed by the MHRA in 2002, resulting in changes to the product information to include appropriate warnings. However, it was not until later in 2003, when further data became available, that revealed the magnitude of the risk and potential public health implications. The CSM was consulted in December 2003, as soon as all the data and subsequent analyses had been compiled and assessed by the MHRA. The CSM considered an assessment of all available data from clinical trials with risperidone and advised that additional analyses of the risperidone clinical trials in dementia and analysis of the risk of alternative treatments were required, as well as expert advice in the treatment of patients with dementia.
<P>

<a name="40324w25.html_para2">An expert working group, including geriatricians, psychogeriatricians and psychiatrists, met on 19&nbsp;January 2004 to consider a formal meta-analysis of clinical trial data for risperidone and clinical trial data on olanzapine, which had recently become available. The CSM considered the recommendations of the expert working group at the end of January and advised that the risks of stroke with risperidone and olanzapine should be communicated accompanied by comprehensive treatment guidelines to inform the necessary changes in prescribing practice. In the case of a third atypical antipsychotic quetiapine, there were insufficient data to draw conclusions.
<P>

<a name="40324w25.html_para3">Risperidone has a United Kingdom marketing authorisation, whereas olanzapine has a European authorisation valid throughout the European Community. The communication in the UK on 9&nbsp;March 2004 on risperidone and olanzapine was planned to coincide with a Europe-wide communication on olanzapine following consideration by the European scientific committee, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) at its February meeting.




<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2004 : Column 916W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40324w25.html_para4">The CSM, through the MHRA, has close links with regulatory authorities world-wide. The MHRA is represented on the CPMP and its Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP), which meet monthly and provide a regular forum for discussion of drug safety issues within the European Union. An electronic communication system allows rapid exchange of drug safety information between member states. The PhVWP has regular videoconferences to share drug safety information with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America. The MHRA is a member of the Vigimed mailing list, which is an e-mail distribution list set up to facilitate rapid exchange of information between National Centres participating in the World Health Organisation International Drug Monitoring Programme. The MHRA also has informal links with other regulatory authorities world-wide.
<P>

<a name="40324w25.html_para5">There is an obligation on companies making an application for a marketing authorisation to provide the MHRA with all information relevant to the assessment of risks and benefits on the product at the time of the application; this includes data from clinical trials conducted outside the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many local authorities had incurred fines following the introduction of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc) Act 2003, at the latest available date; how much the fines for each local authority have been since the Act came into force; what the total amount of fines incurred by local authorities is; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="40324w25.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Figures for legal liability for delayed discharges for individual councils are not currently held centrally although data on the number of delays and the level of legal liabilities will be available in due course, once the data have been validated. However 17 councils have indicated that they have no liabilities for charges since reimbursement came into force. Further, the majority of social services departments have arranged local investment agreements with the national health service and will only pay charges once they exceed this locally agreed level of investment.

<a name="40324w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Doctors who are European Economic Area nationals do not have to undertake English language competency tests in order to register with the General Medical Council. The law does not currently permit this. It is the responsibility of national health service employers to ensure that all doctors they employ have the necessary English language competence to carry out their duties safely. They may require a doctor to undertake a language assessment as part of the recruitment process, regardless of which country they come from.

 A copy of "Improving access in primary care with Advanced Access" has been placed in the Library. This is produced by the primary care collaborative. A key role for the collaborative is to explain, promote and disseminate "Advanced Access". Participating general practices have delivered impressive results&#151;delivering a 72 per cent, reduction in waits for a general practitioner and a 50 per cent, reduction in waits to see a nurse. In large part as a result of this work, most patients in most areas are now able to be offered fast access to a GP or other primary care professional, in line with the NHS Plan target.

 The National Patient Safety Agency launched a 'clean your hands' pilot campaign in July 2003. It aims to develop solutions to improve hand hygiene compliance by national health service staff, by testing ideas at six pilot sites. It is estimated that about &#163;600,000 would be required to launch a campaign and supply a toolkit to every acute sector ward in the NHS, which works out at a cost of less than &#163;2,000 per trust. The annual cost to the NHS of healthcare acquired infections has been estimated to be about &#163;1 billion.

 <i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The DH clinical guidelines, published in 1999, lay out the principles of safe and responsible prescribing to drug misusers.

<a name="40324w27.html_para2">Building on that, the National Treatment Agency (NTA) has produced guidance on the drugs used for substitute prescribing. This guidance was produced with the help of an expert working group, who based their advice on the evidence base. The NTA have also published guidance on the prescribing of injectable opiates for the small group of drug misusers who do not respond to oral substitute prescribing.

<a name="40324w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) is a qualification recognised around the world for basic computing skills. General information technology skills should be seen as an everyday requirement for any service based organisation. The opportunity to gain the ECDL qualification is offered to all staff working in the National Health Service. For NHS staff, it provides a basic level of knowledge, which enables people to demonstrate their competence in computer skills. The ECDL is completed in modules and designed to be completed over time and to fit in and around any other work requirements.
<P>

<a name="40324w28.html_para4">There is no formal requirement for NHS staff to hold the ECDL for the purpose of working in the NHS. As a matter of good practice, and as part of its commitment to life-long learning, the NHS encourages all staff to develop appropriate skills, including competency in the use of IT.
<P>

<a name="40324w28.html_para5">The national health informatics development team within the NHS Information Authority has put in place central facilities to support local NHS organisations in training needs around the ECDL. Since the programme was launched in March 2003, 9,000 people have qualified and a further 54,000 have registered. It is expected that up 40&nbsp;per cent. of NHS staff will register over the five year timescale of the central programme. The central programme provides central support for registration and validation of ECDL training that would otherwise fall to individual NHS organisations and is expected to cost &#163;15&nbsp;million. It remains the responsibility of local NHS organisations to provide local facilities. Specific costs for ECDL training by individual members of staff are not identified.

 Nurses who are European Economic Area nationals do not have to undertake English language competency tests in order to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

The National Health Service locally is usually required to make funds available to support NICE appraisal guidance within three months of publication. In the case of this guidance, the Secretary of State issued a direction to waive this requirement, as NICE advised that successful implementation of structured educational programmes would depend on the availability of an appropriately trained workforce. Primary care trusts, in working towards the Planning and Priorities Framework target of having practice based registers and systematic treatment for people with diabetes by 2006, should consider the introduction of structured education as an important element of a systematic treatment regime.

 A pharmaceutical distributor in the United Kingdom is required to hold a wholesale dealer's licence (WL) issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A WL does not authorise distributors to make changes to the manufacturers' packaging and related materials of licensed medicinal products; these activities require a separate assembly licence, also issued by the MHRA. A number of wholesale dealers hold assembly licences for the purpose of re-packaging licensed parallel imported medicines and this reply relates to this group of products.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w30.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The pooled drug treatment budget totalled &#163;243.6&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04, which allowed for an average increase of 24&nbsp;per cent., to primary care trusts in their allocation from this budget. It is also estimated that &#163;200&nbsp;million of mainstream national health service expenditure will be spent on drug treatment in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="40324w30.html_para6">All funding for alcohol treatment services is drawn from the mainstream budgets of the NHS and local authorities. The amounts spent on treatment services from these budgets was substantial, although the method of funding means that it is not possible to give figures on expenditure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what information he collects on the percentage of annual staffing costs spent on training in the NHS.  [162087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40324w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 In 2002&#150;03, the latest year for which actual outturn figures are available, the Multi Professional Education and Training (MPET) budget accounted for 11&nbsp;per cent. of the national health service annual staffing costs. The MPET training budget excludes funds spent by NHS trusts and primary care trusts on training existing staff from within their own budgets because this information is not held centrally.
