<P>
<a name="80429w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government have made considerable progress in securing international agreement to the Mauritius Mandate and will continue to press for its speedy and determined implementation.

<a name="80429w01.html_para2">To date, decisions have been made on the timing and level of relief to be granted under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative to six countries.

<P>
<a name="80429w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The total exposure of the EU to the 20 countries that are presently thought likely to get debt relief under the HIPC initiative is about 5% of the total debt owed to all multilateral creditors by HIPCs. This amounts to approximately $1 billion.
<P>

<a name="80429w01.html_para6">The EU has agreed to put 40 million ECU of interest on European Development Fund assets towards financing the first part of the EU's component of HIPC debt relief to these countries.

 No tests of dioxin levels have been commissioned at the site of the former Avenue Cokeworks at Wingerworth in Derbyshire as the activities at this site are not considered to be significant sources of dioxins. While all combustion activities are likely to generate some dioxins, the Environment Agency report that the levels detected in or on the ground within the site would be expected to be similar to those which have been detected in urban areas. The Environment Agency and its predecessors have undertaken extensive dioxin monitoring in the river sediments in and around Chesterfield since the early 1990s. There have been no significant dioxin levels in the sediments of the River Rother upstream of its confluence with the River Doe Lea indicating that there have been no significant inputs of dioxins from the Avenue site. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has been

<a name="80429w03.html_para0">The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food commissioned strategic research, amounting to some &#163;1.7 million in 1997-98, relating to coastal defence problems. In particular, a three-year project looking into the processes associated with the erosion of soft cliffs has been completed recently and the final report will be published later this year. A five-year programme of major investigations into coastal morphology (including the development of understanding of coastal processes which contribute to coastal erosion, and the ability to model them) has also been completed recently.
<P>

<a name="80429w03.html_para1">In addition, a report on the Ministry-commissioned coast protection survey of England was published in 1994. The survey examined the extent, adequacy and state of repair of defences. Subsequent update reports have been commissioned, concentrating on those defences identified as being in the worst condition.

<P>
<a name="80429w03.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I regret that surviving records reveal very little about the exposure of personnel to Mustard Agent at the Defence Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Centre (DNBCC). It is known, however, that, between 1966 and 1980, students at the Centre were exposed to a small amount of the Agent, about the size of a pinhead, on their wrist as part of Confidence Training. The intention was to prove and give confidence to the chemical agent decontamination process which was taught by the Centre and which the students were expected to teach to members of their parent units on their return. The practice was stopped on advice from the Chemical Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down because it was not compatible with emerging health and safety guidelines.
<P>

<a name="80429w03.html_para9">Procedures for the conduct of the test were laid down in a NBC Defence Training Pamphlet and were explicit in their instructions as to the safety precautions to be observed, but no specific health and safety guidelines were extant at the time covering these specific types of test.

further self-harm was minimised while he remained in the van. Group 4 informed the Immigration Service that at no stage while in the van did Mr. Ekpo request toilet facilities. If staff had been made aware of such a request all possible steps would have been taken to arrange this. Mr. Ekpo was escorted to a Harmondsworth building and was examined by a doctor who declared him fit to be detained. Mr. Ekpo was offered, but declined to accept, both food and medication. He was finally detained at Northside Police Station, Heathrow Airport.

 In accordance with authority received from the Deportation Section of the Home Office, removal directions were set by the Immigration Service at Becket House for Mr. Ekpo to be removed from the United Kingdom at 11.35 am on 1 April from Terminal 4, Heathrow Airport. Arrangements were made for Mr. Ekpo to be accompanied by escorts from a security company. This information was then passed to the Harmondsworth Detention Management Unit, which made arrangements for Mr. Ekpo to be transferred out of Rochester on 31 March 1998 and for him to be accommodated overnight in a police station near to Heathrow Airport, pending his deportation on the morning of 1 April.

 The information requested is not available. However, the Home Office has a research programme designed to shred further light on the links between drugs and crime. A study conducted by the University of Cambridge of drug use by samples of people arrested by the police in various English cities was published recently (Home Office Research Study 183--Drugs and crime: the results of research on drug testing and interviewing arrestees), a copy of which is available for consultation in the Library. Key points to emerge were that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Urine tests showed high levels of recent drug consumption among arrestees--61 per cent. had taken at least one illegal drug.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Comparatively high proportions of arrestees across all sample areas tested positive for heroin/opiates (18 per cent.) and cocaine/crack (10 per cent.). These are costly drugs, often thought to be funded by acquisitive crime.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nearly half the arrestees who reported taking drugs within the last year said their drug use was connected with their offending. Among various factors, they emphasised the need for money to buy drugs.</FONT></UL>

<a name="80429w05.html_para8">The figures correspond to the number of deaths where the substances were mentioned on the death certificate or were identified following investigation. Where, for example, both heroin and temazepam were involved, each will be counted in the table; once under 'heroin with other drugs' and once under 'temazepam with other drugs'. The figures in brackets are those deaths with a mention of alcohol and are included in the non-bracketed figures. None of these cases is included in line (k) which covers deaths certified as due to alcoholic psychoses, alcohol dependence syndrome, non-dependent abuse of alcohol, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and toxic effects of alcohol.

<a name="80429w05.html_para9">Data for years prior to 1994 are available but there are undercounts of the types of drugs involved due to the methods of data collection and processing in use at the time. From 1994, a new method was introduced which gives a more accurate count of drug deaths. Data for 1993 are not directly comparable and are provided for information purposes only.

 The Department is examining urgently ways to secure that the education, employment and training needs of young people who are looked after by the local authority are met more effectively. We have set up a national forum, including representatives of leading statutory and voluntary agencies, to look at a range of possible initiatives. These include issuing statutory guidance to authorities and schools, providing better information on, and setting targets for, educational outcomes, and promoting advocacy schemes.

 <i>[holding answer 6 April 1998]:</i> Information on the incidence of osteoporosis or the number of accidents caused by osteoporosis is not available centrally. It is estimated that around 0.1 per cent. of the 56,000 hospital admissions in the specialty of "Trauma and orthopaedics" during 1996-97 were attributable to osteoporosis. No estimate has been made of the number of osteoporotic fractures which are likely to occur during the next 12 months but 35 cases were treated as in-patients or day cases in NHS hospitals in Wales during 1996-97, accounting for 586 bed-days. Of these, only three cases were treated in beds in the specialty of "Trauma and orthopaedics", accounting for 78 bed-days. No information is available centrally concerning the cost of treating osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80429w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 None of the evidence available suggests that soft PVC toys currently on the market in this country would, in foreseeable conditions of use, lead to the release of dangerous levels of phthalates. Under the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 suppliers have a statutory duty to supply safe toys and action can be taken against a supplier of toys found to release unacceptable levels of phthalates.
<P>

<a name="80429w08.html_para0">Following my instructions last year, UK safety experts have been leading the research into the release of phthalates. They are working with experts from other member States including those carrying out the Dutch study. I am most concerned to ensure that articles intended for use by children are safe and, if the research being carried out shows that there is cause for concern, the Government will not hesitate to act.

<a name="80429w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The European Works Councils Directive has to be implemented in the United Kingdom by 15 December 1999. Until it is implemented, there is no obligation on companies to include workers in the United Kingdom in arrangements for European-level information and consultation, although a considerable number have already done so voluntarily.
<P>

<a name="80429w08.html_para2">The Government do not collect information on the numbers of employees affected by voluntary arrangements or likely to be covered when the directive comes into force. From research carried out for the TUC, it appears that around 4 million workers in the United Kingdom may be covered by the Directive once it is in force here.

<P>
<a name="80429w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I became aware of the existence of the letter from Mr. Moulsdale, secretary to the Astra Holdings plc inspection, in February 1998 following a newspaper article suggesting, mistakenly, that I had tried to suppress its disclosure on public interest grounds. The letter itself became a particular issue for me when, later in February, the trial judge presiding over the Astra directors disqualification proceedings invited me to give the disqualification proceedings my personal consideration.

<a name="80429w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Our top priority for public health in poor countries is to strengthen health systems to meet better the needs of poorer people. Many developing countries currently spend less than &#163;3 per person per year on all health needs. But it is recognised that as little as &#163;9 per person per year is needed to make a major difference to poor people's health. We work to support health sector reform and improvements in water and sanitation. We have seen real progress in the last decade with new approaches to reduce suffering from TB and Malaria. More needs to be done. Poor people are at high risk of death from communicable disease and ill health increases their poverty.

 Our strong preference is for cattle to be exported as meat rather than as live animals. Nevertheless, we recognise that, at the present moment, export refunds continue to be an economic reality. The EU beef sector remains in structural surplus and if these exports did not take place, the beef would probably be offered into intervention at considerably higher cost to the EU budget.
<P>

<a name="80429w11.html_para0">As part of our commitment to improving animal welfare, we successfully pressed for the adoption of an EU Council Regulation which provides that the payment of refunds for live animals is subject to compliance with Community legislation concerning animal welfare and, in particular, the protection of animals during transport. We consider that this will help achieve our aim to reduce the number of live animals being exported to third countries and traded within the Community and ensure that those animals that are exported receive an appropriate standard of welfare.

 The Sheep and Goats (Records, Identification and Movement) Order 1996, among other things, lays down the requirements for recording flock numbers and animal movements which producers must follow in order to receive Sheep Annual Premium. The Order specifies the information that must be recorded but not the precise format. Full details, including recommended formats, are given in a booklet 'Sheep and Goat Identification, Records and Movement--A Guide to the Legal Requirements' which was distributed to sheep farmers early in 1996. In addition, a recommended format is reproduced in the Notes for Guidance on the Sheep Annual Premium Scheme which are distributed with the claim form each year to all known producers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to introduce national standards for clinical and administration information held on NHS databases, and to encourage their operational interactivity.  [39588]<P>

<P>
<a name="80429w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 April 1998]:</i> The White Paper "The New NHS--Modern, Dependable" emphasises the importance the Government attach to ensuring that the right information is made available to clinicians to support direct patient care. It also states that performance against the wider goals of improving health and healthcare outcomes, the quality and effectiveness of service, efficiency and access will be judged by greater use of comparative information.
<P>

<a name="80429w13.html_para0">We accept that the development and introduction of national standards for clinical and administrative information is an essential element in meeting these information needs of the new National Health Service. We are making further investments to build on the progress already made in collaboration with the health professions in establishing national standards covering data items, codes, and Electronic Data Interchange messages. Targets have been set in the White Paper which depend on the availability of such national standards. The new information management and technology strategy for the NHS which will shortly be published by the Department will set out in greater detail the information targets to be met and the steps being taken to ensure their delivery. These steps will embrace both the further enhancement of the definitions of national information standards and the expansion of the use of the NHS electronic superhighway.

<a name="80429w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Disability benefits, including Disability Living Allowance (DLA), are included in the Department's Comprehensive Spending Review, which was announced on 11 June last year. The review is an important step in our plan to modernise and improve the Social Security system, so that it helps people to work as far as they are able; provides appropriate support to those who cannot work; and makes the most effective use of the resources available.
<P>

<a name="80429w13.html_para1">No decisions have been taken to make greater use of home visits to supplement the information provided by new claimants for DLA. However, as part of the review, we are looking at ways of improving the claims process and we will take account of concerns expressed by the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board, adjudication officers, disabled people and organisations which represent them.

<a name="80429w14.html_para2">In accordance with the Open Government Code of Practice on Access to Government, the standard practice is that reports of such studies commissioned by the 



<P>
<P><I>29 Apr 1998 : Column: 172</I><P>
Department are published on completion unless they are covered by a specific exemption under that Code. All research reports include, as standard, information on the research remit (covering details of the sample and questions asked) and findings. These studies are running to different timetables, but we expect all to be published within the next year, except the work on Earnings Top Up, which is part of a longer-term study.
<P>

<a name="80429w14.html_para3">The remaining contracts were commissioned to develop and evaluate publicity campaigns or to inform other presentational issues. Reports of this sort of research are not usually published, but are made available on request. A report of each of these studies, discussing the remit and findings, will be placed in the Library once the decision-making process is completed and/or the relevant publicity campaign has started. We anticipate that this will be within the next 12 months for the specified contracts.
