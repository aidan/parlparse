 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what proportion of the funds pledged during the London Conference on Afghanistan will be channelled into the Counter Narcotics Trust Fund.  [49267]</p>

 In total, US$77.5 million has been pledged by the international community to the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s Counter Narcotics Trust Fund. This includes US$60.1 million worth of assistance pledged during the London Conference on Afghanistan (31 January to 1 February) by the UK, US, Sweden and Korea.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the proportion of Afghan warlords who have <i>(a)</i> supported and <i>(b)</i> opposed the Taliban.  [48769]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The term warlords&quot; is most often used to describe militia commanders, or others exercising influence in the provinces, not appointed by the central Government. The vast majority of warlords opposed the Taliban regime, and many played an active role in the regime&#039;s overthrow in 2001, including in some cases by contributing forces to the Northern Alliance.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Government assesses that the negative influence of warlords&quot; in Afghanistan&#039;s political process is gradually diminishing. Those who chose to embrace the new democratic process were required to cut all links with militia groups before putting themselves forward as candidates at the September 2005 parliamentary and provincial elections. Those who still remain outside the democratic process are finding their influence reduced by nation-wide

disarmament programmes and the growing control exercised by centrally-appointed Provincial Governors and Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police forces. But this is a long process&#151;democratic institutions, although now established, are fragile and the political process of resolving violent conflict will take time to have effect, though the Government of Afghanistan is determined to see it through.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent assessment he has made of the human rights position of Ascension islanders in respect of <i>(a)</i> rights of abode, <i>(b)</i> ownership of property and <i>(c)</i> appeal rights in cases of deportation; and whether rights differ between native-born and immigrant islanders.  [47242]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 There is no indigenous population, or islanders&quot;, on Ascension Island. People working and living there do so for the duration of their contracts. None of those individuals currently working and living on Ascension, whether born on the island or not, has the right of abode or the right to own property. The human rights of those currently on Ascension Island are protected by those human rights instruments which have been extended to the island, including the European Convention on Human Rights. Procedures relating to deportation for breach of the immigration rules are governed by the Entry Control Ordinance. There is a right to make representations to the Governor against any deportation order.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 The agreement between the UK and US Governments relating to Wideawake Airfield, which came into force on 1 October 2003, provides for up to four non-scheduled civil aircraft movements (take-off or landing) per week. This facility has not been used on a regular basis. This is a matter for commercial decision by potential operators.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the reasons were for the rejection of a desk study into the Ascension Island Fisheries Protection Project; and what estimate was made of the cost of such a study.  [47246]</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew8"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 A desk study on Ascension Island&#039;s fish resources was conducted in 1990. Another desk study would not add greatly to the information available from this earlier work (a further study would have cost approximately &#163;30,000) and is not considered an appropriate use of Foreign and Commonwealth Office funds.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what estimate he has made of the potential revenue from the sale of fishing licences for tuna in the seas around Ascension Island.  [47327]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 Revenue accruing from the sale of fishing licences for Ascension Island was, up until 1 April 2005, combined with that for St. Helena. The figure for 2003&#150;04, the most recent available, was approximately &#163;128,000. Because of the level of uncertainty surrounding both the current state of the stocks of migratory fish in that part of the Atlantic and the intentions of distant water fishing fleets, Ascension Island has not sold any fishing licences since 1 April 2005. It is therefore difficult to estimate the potential revenue from the sale of fishing licences for Ascension Island.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 There is no indigenous population, or islanders&quot;, on Ascension Island. People working and living there do so for the duration of their contracts. Figures on retirement or termination of contracts are a matter for the individual organisations based on the Island and are not centrally held. A small number, less than 5, have remained on the Island on the expiration of their contract. Their cases are under review.

 There is no indigenous population on Ascension Island. People working and living there do so for the duration of their contracts. Employees whose contracts end, and are not renewed, are required by law to leave the Island. Figures are held by employer organisations, and we therefore do not have access to this information. The employment contracts usually place on the employer an obligation to return the employee to a specified location at the end of the contract. Approximately 70 per cent. of those working and living on Ascension Island originate from St. Helena. We are aware of two people being removed from Ascension Island. One was removed to the UK, the other to St. Helena.

<a name="stpa_31">Funding for infrastructure development features prominently in both DFID and EU programmes to support the Overseas Territories. We have worked closely with the EU on a number of projects. Notable recent examples include new airports on Montserrat, Anguilla and Grand Turk and road infrastructure on Providenciales. DFID is also providing funding for an

On Pitcairn, work to pave the Hill of Difficulty, the only access road from the harbour to the main settlement of Adamstown, and make essential repairs to the jetty and slipway was completed during 2005. In addition we are planning to fund jointly with the EU repairs to the harbour wall on Tristan da Cunha and the construction of a breakwater on Pitcairn.

<p>
<a name="60206w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_32">DFID&#039;s programmes focus on those countries which still need development assistance along the path to self-sufficiency. We would normally look to the wealthier Overseas Territories to finance their priorities for capital expenditure from their own resources, including under normal commercial borrowing terms. The EU also largely focuses its development programmes on those Overseas Countries and Territories (OTC)s whose economic development is least advanced. Similarly, we would not expect EU grant funding for infrastructure to be available for those OCTs with ready access to commercial borrowing.

[46906]</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60206w05.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 A Department for International Development (DFID) commissioned report by the Tyndall Centre called the Impacts of Global Climate Change on the UK Overseas Territories (OTs) found that long-term weather characteristics are likely to change. It concluded that regional warming in the Caribbean could be as much as 6 degrees by 2100, and slightly less in the South Atlantic and Pitcairn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">The report identified common areas of concern as many OTs share similar characteristics. In particular, many are islands with populations reliant on a fragile natural resource base. The effects of climate change include severe tropical storms and hurricanes in the Caribbean and likely increases in the severity and frequency of low rainfall events and droughts in all areas. Global sea level rise is now projected to be as much as 0.9 meters by 2100 and in the medium-term raised sea levels will exacerbate the effects of more severe storms, directly affecting coastal infrastructure and tourism.

<a name="stpa_34">On 30 January the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published the book &#039;Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change&#039;. Although not specifically directed at the impacts of climate change on OTs, the book discusses many of the potential impacts that OTs can expect to see in the future, such as degradation of marine ecosystems and increases in global sea levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_35">As the international community makes efforts to tackle this global problem, the UK is keen to raise awareness in OTs of the impacts of climate change on their societies.

Worldwide less than one in five people have access to basic HIV prevention services (including sexual and reproductive health services). This prevention gap&quot; is fuelling the spread of HIV. Improving access to a comprehensive range of effective HIV prevention information, services and supplies including sex education for young people and condoms for all those who are sexually active, is therefore important and this is what our programmes supports.

<a name="stpa_62">The UK led the support for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) prevention policy Intensifying HIV prevention&quot; at its June 2005 Programme Coordination Board, which I attended.

There has been discussion of these differences in global and bilateral meetings. We will continue our dialogue with the UN, European Governments, the US Administration and other donors; but we will, as we always have, continue to work with US colleagues to promote country-led evidence-based and effective approaches to tackling the HIV epidemic and we will continue to promote the importance of access to a full range of sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies.

 In 2004&#150;05, DFID&#039;s bilateral expenditure on projects which were targeting effective reproductive health services was &#163;194 million. This figure is reported in the document entitled &#039;Statistics on International Development&#039; (SID) 2005 (Table 20), (which is available in the Libraries of the House) and reflects all projects that were recorded as having a primary or significant focus on effective reproductive health services.

 The Government considers that part two of the Bill, which introduces the statutory regulation of claims management services, will have no impact on collective conditional fee agreements.

This will not affect the various methods available for funding claims.

 The Ministry of Defence pursues a range of policies aimed at helping personnel achieve a better balance between their work and their personal lives, where this can be done without affecting operational effectiveness. Our long term strategies seek to reduce pressure by lengthening tour intervals, improving career development and, through our future basing strategy delivering improved family stability throughout consecutive tours. We also provide access to a wide range of welfare services, where service families can go for advice and support at all times. We maintain close links with mediation and support organisations such as RELATE to help ensure that additional specialist support is made available whenever required.

 Rest and Recuperation (R and R) provides service personnel, on mentally and challenging deployments, a respite from a stressful operational environment in order to sustain their operational effectiveness. R and R should not, therefore, be considered as compensation for separation from family and friends. Post Operational Leave (POL) exists to meet this requirement (the entitlement to POL does begin on the day that service personnel leave their permanent duty station). Depending on the exigencies of service, the operational chain of command will authorise the time, location and duration of any period of R and R, basing their decisions on published guidelines. We have recently carried out a review of all leave and absence types in the light of the advent of the new tri-service joint personnel administration (JPA) system, which will roll out on a single-service basis throughout 2006. It was not considered appropriate for the qualifying period of deployment for R and R to begin before personnel arrive in theatre.

<a name="stpa_155">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes its responsibilities for the environment very seriously. However, there continues to be a vital requirement for the United Kingdom to maintain a maritime capability to protect crucial lines of communication, to participate in operational activities and to be able to address potential mine and submarine threats, now and in the future. To ensure that our military capabilities in these areas are fully maintained, it is imperative that we continue to use active sonar, both now and in the foreseeable future.

Furthermore, sonar is essential to protect UK waters and ensure safe navigation. That said, this certainly does not imply that our sonar activities are undertaken without the fullest possible respect for the environment.

<a name="60206w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_156">Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are undertaken for a wide range of our activities in the marine environment, including sonar. Such EIAs cover the marine habitat of the operating area concerned and the species likely to be encountered. The EIAs are used to better tailor the activity and ensure that potentially damaging effects are identified during the planning stage of the exercise and reduced their impact to an absolute minimum. With the same aim in view, we have also issued instructions to all our ships&#039; Commanding Officers for the operational use of sonar in the marine environment. This guidance employs the precautionary principle of &#039;Plan, Look, Listen and Act&#039;.

<a name="stpa_157">While we believe that our operating procedures reflect the best scientific advice and provide a sustainable balance between the need for effective military training and the need to protect our marine environment, we are certainly not complacent. The MOD continues to be closely involved in research, in the UK, with the US and NATO authorities, and in other international forums into the possible effects of sonar noise on marine life. Should any new research provide evidence of a link between our method of using sonar and a detrimental effect on marine life, we would, of course, consider what further mitigation measures might be possible. In the meantime, the current measures reflect the best scientific advice available.

Notes:<br>

1. Numbers above exclude old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment in place, as well as new scheme cases being progressed clerically.<br>

2. Old scheme child supports cases a largely processed on the old IT system, but are also processed on the new IT system where they have been migrated due to links with new scheme applications.<br>

3. Maintenance Direct cases are those in which the Agency has carried out a maintenance calculation or assessment, and the non resident parent has subsequently agreed to pay the parent with care directly. There will then be no further involvement from the Agency unless requested by either party (for example in the event of a change of circumstances requiring recalculation or non compliance by the non resident parent). The existence of such an arrangement does not guarantee that payment of maintenance occurs, as it could cease upon mutual agreement of both parties without the Agency being informed.<br>





4. A case is counted as having been compliant on the Agency collection service if it is open at the end of December, and any money has been both requested and received via the Agency&#039;s collection service in the preceding three months.<br>

5. Volumes are rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The fact that the number of suspensions and actual penalties is less than half the number of referrals is explained by the number of debtors who enter into agreements to pay rather than attend court. Similarly, only a very small number of debtors actually go to prison or lose their driving licences, in our experience, because the courts normally seek to suspend a sentence on condition that the defendant commits to pay.<br>

2. We do not have accurate data for the number of cases referred to court for the periods 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03.<br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_168">The Agency collection service deals with significant sums passing through its bank account (in excess of &#163;600 million in each of the last two years). As a consequence the Agency bank balance is continually turning over with receipts from Non Resident Parents and employers which need to be assigned and be paid out to Parents with Care or the Secretary of State (where the Parent with Care is in receipt of benefit). At 30 November 2005 an amount of &#163;4.2 million had been received, cleared, and was in the process of being passed on to the Parent with Care via their preferred Method of Payment, which is in the main directly into their bank account. At this date there was also an amount of &#163;9.5 million in the bank account awaiting fund clearance and assignment between the Parent with Care and the Secretary of State.</p>

All of the different approaches so far adopted by researchers are methodologically and conceptually difficult and have produced widely differing results.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_200">Jobcentre Plus provides additional help for those people who face particular disadvantage in the labour market.

</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_201">By way of context it is worth mentioning that the Government published a Green Paper on Welfare Reform&#151;A New Deal for Welfare : Empowering people to work&quot; on 24 January 2006.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_203">The Green Paper sets our proposals for reforms which build on recent successes which Jobcentre Plus have been a part of and we are continue to take a leading in role in delivering better services to the people we serve.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_204">On the specific issue of language difficulties, our policy is to ensure interpreters are provided when conducting business with customers who do not speak English or Welsh, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

Participants follow a varied and innovative approach to learning and are encouraged to take part in project work and work placements to consolidate their learning, which is designed to improve skills by at least one level.</p>

IB customers with the most severe conditions are not expected to take part in the full Pathways regime but can volunteer to participate. The support includes a Choices Package, which includes the Condition Management Programme (CMP) delivered through a partnership between Jobcentre Plus and the NHS. The CMP is delivered by health professionals and has been

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_232">The new process introduces the use of a national contact centre with a single 0845 number for customers wishing to book an interview to apply for a National Insurance number. Appointments for interviews are made and confirmation of the appointment is sent to the customer immediately. Evaluation in those regions where this new process has been implemented has shown that 97% of all calls are answered, of which 92% of calls are answered within 20 seconds. The average speed of answer is 8 seconds.</p>

<p><a name="qn_302"><a name="60206w31.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the likely impact of the pension protection fund levy on small businesses.  [48803]</p>




<p><a name="st_303"><a name="60206w31.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) that accompanied the Pensions Bill 2004 addressed the effect of the pension protection levy on businesses, and was agreed by Parliament when the Bill was passed.

<p>

than 50 employees) will be limited overall by the fact that few such businesses run defined benefit pension schemes, and so are unlikely to be affected by the pension protection levy. The RIA estimates that less than 2.2 per cent. of the total cost of the Pension Protection Fund would be met by small businesses.

<a name="stpa_238">Responsibility for consulting on and setting the level of the pension protection levy rests with the board of the Pension Protection Fund. Following 17 weeks of consultation two consultation documents were produced plus one update. The aim was to strike a balance between affordability and security. Representatives from small business were consulted as part of the process. This all resulted in a report on 16 December 2005, including an estimate of the pension protection levy amount. This is available on the Pension Protection Fund&#039;s website.

Notes:<br>

1. A winding up scheme is one which has notified the Pensions Regulator (or its predecessor the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority) that it has commenced winding up procedures.<br>

2. A wound up scheme is one which has notified the Pensions Regulator (or its predecessor the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority) that it has completed winding up procedures.<br>

3. Schemes are required to notify the Pensions Regulator of changes in scheme status as soon as is reasonably practical. This means that the data for the year ended 31 March 2005 is provisional.<br>

4. The figures are based on information held on the register as at 11 January 2006. The effective date for the scheme status is based on the last scheme status change date.<br>

5. Figures for 1997&#150;98 commence on 2 April 1997 because, where a scheme commenced or completed winding up procedures prior to 1 April 1997 but the exact date cannot be ascertained, a default value of 1 April 1997 is used as the date on which the scheme commenced or completed winding up procedures. As a result a very large number of schemes are recorded as having commenced or completed winding up procedures with a scheme status change date of 1 April 1997, even if they had commenced or completed winding up procedures at some earlier date. Including schemes with this default date in the table would significantly overstate the number of schemes that commenced or completed winding up procedures during 1997, so a start date of 2 April has been used for 1997&#150;98.<br>

6. Total membership includes active, deferred and pensioner members. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of these numbers.<br>

7. During 2005&#150;06 the Pensions Regulator will continue with its plans to issue all occupational pension schemes that are registered in the UK a scheme return form. This will provide the Pension Regulator with access to enhanced data in future years.<br>

The NIO and DHSSPS have jointly commissioned research into children from a Care background who enter the criminal justice system. This is known as the Pathways research. Decisions on the publication arrangements for this report will be taken jointly by NIO and DHSSPS. Final decisions on publication remain within the NIO, but there is a presumption that research commissioned from the Research and Statistics Programme will be published. All statistics and research publications are available on the NIO website. Usually a small number of printed copies of each publication are made available for those without internet access.<br>

They have confirmed that there are three persons, none of them teaching staff, with a conviction for a sexual offence who are currently working in schools; none of these persons is on a sex offenders register as all the offences were committed over 15 years ago. In one case the offence was against a minor and involved a girl who was just under age; in the other two cases the offence was against an adult female. In each case the employing authority knew of the conviction through the pre-employment check and took professional advice. The advice was, in each case, that the person was not a risk to children, and so employment was offered. The employing authorities remain satisfied that these persons do not pose a risk to children.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not expect there to be any negative impact on the performance of the two pilot tri-service control centres as a result of the merger of fire and rescue service control rooms into regional controls.

<p>
<a name="60206w42.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_315">The tri-service pilots are not combined emergency service control rooms, but three separate controls located in the same building. This is because the different business needs of the three services are a key implementation barrier to delivering fully integrated tri-service centres. In terms of performance, the fire and rescue service accounts for fewer than 10 per cent. of calls in the tri-service centres, so combined centres will still be able to function much as they do now as bi-service controls without fire. The valuable lessons that have been learnt from the pilots, especially in terms of closer working between emergency services, can still be built on after the introduction of regional fire control centres.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that health funding takes account of planned housing growth. The discussions have been at a strategic level and have not touched upon the specific plans for Kettering General Hospital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w43.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">Significant extra resources are being provided for health services in the growth areas. Already an extra &#163;20 million of revenue funding per annum has been provided for primary care trusts in the growth areas (2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06) and an extra &#163;20 million of capital resources allocated to strategic health authorities in the growth areas (2005&#150;06).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w43.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_332">Kettering General Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Trust has benefited from extra resources. In May 2005 the trust was granted some &#163;7.4 million (&#163;5 million from the primary care trust and &#163;2.4 million in capital from the strategic health authority) to tackle the growth in demand for services. This has enabled the trust to employ 164 extra nurses and 32 extra doctors. The trust has invested &#163;2 million in a 40-bed ward and five-bed Accident and Emergency observation ward. The trust is building a &#163;16.5 million treatment centre and an ambulatory care centre is currently in development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w43.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_333">Future health funding will also take into account planned housing growth. The Department of Health&#039;s announcement on primary care trust revenue funding on 9 February 2005 included a growth area adjustment. Amongst other factors, this will lead to the primary care trusts in the growth areas receiving funding increases of &#163;860 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;970 million in 2007&#150;08 (increases over the two years of 20.8 per cent. compared to a national average of 19.5 per cent.). Government is also giving priority to growth areas for future LIFT (local improvement finance trust) schemes. This private finance initiative programme will create long-term public/private partnerships to secure continued investment in health care in local areas.

 National park designations apply to extensive areas of countryside and contains England&#039;s most beautiful, spectacular and dramatic landscapes.

 The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 introduced special measures for witnesses in proceedings for antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs). These measures were introduced to address concerns about the protection of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The measures include screening witnesses from the defendants, giving evidence through video link or in private, and the use of video recorded evidence. This makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in the Crown and magistrates court during an ASBO hearing. Antisocial behaviour response courts have been established in magistrates courts sitting in their civil capacity to ensure that witness issues are addressed and the respect action plan announced plans to establish similar arrangements for county courts. There are also plans to introduce the same measures for ASBO victims in civil hearings as for victims in criminal cases. The Home Office has issued a good practice guide to practitioners on how best to support a witness.

 In the period prior to 1999, the Chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) did not put any firm recommendations to the Secretary of State for the Home Department that cannabis be reclassified to a class C drug.

<p><a name="st_439"><a name="60206w46.html_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The notification requirements of Part two of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (which are known as the sex offenders register) automatically apply to all offenders who have received a conviction, caution or finding for a relevant sexual offence from 1 September 1997. The Act also includes a partially 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Feb 2006 : Column 929W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
retrospective operation so that for convictions for relevant offences received before 1 September 1997 an offender will become subject to the notification requirements if he was awaiting sentence or serving his sentence on that date. The 2003 Act also introduced sexual offences prevention orders (SOPOs) which are made by a court in respect of any offender who poses a risk of serious sexual harm and who has received a conviction or caution for a sexual or violent offence (listed in Schedule three or five to the Act). SOPOs are used to impose prohibitions on an offender but also make him subject to the notification requirements for the duration of the order. SOPOs can be made regardless of when the conviction or caution for the qualifying offence was received. It is the case that Schedule three does not include those offences which pre-date the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and this means that if an individual&#039;s most recent sexual offence was committed 50 years ago and he has not since committed a violent offence, then it would not be possible to make him subject to a SOPO and therefore subject to the notification requirements. However, if such an individual posed a risk of harm to children, then it would still be possible for a court to make a risk of sexual harm order (RSHO) and if an offender breaches the prohibitions in a RSHO, then he automatically becomes subject to the notification requirements for the duration of the order.

Since April 2005, they may also be used for the purposes of identifying a deceased person. There is no distinction between the retention of DNA profiles of an adult or a juvenile.

 All buildings occupied by the Home Office are subject to a fire risk assessment in line with the requirements of current legislation and the draft Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order. Part of this risk assessment is to ensure that the occupants are provided with sufficient means of early warning in the event of fire. Any requirement to extend audible fire alarm coverage will therefore be addressed on a building by building basis.

<p><a name="st_473"><a name="60206w50.html_spnew0"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The central UK national fingerprint database (NAFIS/IDENT1) has been unavailable to the police service on 96 unplanned occasions in the last 12 months. On only 36 occasions the central system was unavailable for more than two hours and for the remainder the system was unavailable for periods as short as 15 minutes. During these periods the police service were able to continue to carry out some of the identification business processes but this can also prevent users from carrying out all or part of the processes. There are currently no national figures available that reflect periods of local disruption directly connected to IDENT1 development and maintenance work. Presently Police Information Technology Organisation together with the supplier are migrating the fingerprint identification service from the National Automated Fingerprint System (NAFIS) to the new IDENT1 identification platform which will have additional capability. There has been disruption and problems to the IDENT1 service during the migration process in the last few months. These problems are being addressed by the Police Information and Technology Organisation (PITO) and should result in a robust and reliable service to the police forces being resumed as soon as possible. In order to ensure the Home Office investment in the IDENT1 service is developed and maintained to provide maximum benefit to the police fingerprint community I have asked my Home Office colleagues to review and report progress to me at regular intervals.

 Further to my written ministerial statement of 11 November, I would like to state that based upon feedback given on 9 November to forces and authorities, they are further developing their options for change. For the Yorkshire and Humber region, two options of those submitted were assessed as meeting the criteria and these are, (1) a single regional strategic force option and (2) two strategic forces, North Yorkshire merging with West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire merging with Humberside. I made it clear that police authorities including North Yorkshire, are free to submit options other than ones we have commented on if they wish to, making a compelling case for these by 23 December. No decisions will be made until after the consultation process has run its course.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that every neighbourhood will have a dedicated neighbourhood policing team by 2008. The size of the neighbourhood which is served by this team will vary from area to area: a neighbourhood&quot; to an inner-city resident will be very different from what it means to someone living in a predominantly rural area. Typically though, it is likely that a neighbourhood will cover one or two council wards. What is really important is that residents will know the names of their local officers see them on the street and have their phone numbers and email addresses.

 The Police Service continues to make steady progress towards the 2009 Race Equality Employment Targets. In 2003, BME representation was 2.9 per cent. In 2004 it was 3.3 per cent. and in 2005 it was 3.5 per cent. Although the number of minority ethnic police officers narrowly missed the 2004 milestone of 4 per cent., further measures are being put in place to ensure that numbers continue to rise steadily and that the Police Service meets the 2009 target of 7 per cent. The retention rate for minority ethnic officers compared with white officers is very similar over comparable length of service periods after the first two years point. In the first six months of service however, minority ethnic officers are leaving at a greater rate than white officers (12.6 per cent. of BME officers compared to 7.6 per cent. of white officers) although the wastage rate is lower than in previous years. The wastage rate for officers with six months to two years&#039; service has increased for both groups. No targets have been set for the recruitment and retention of women.

<p><a name="st_516"><a name="60206w52.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Overcrowding alone does not explain why there are self-inflicted deaths in prisons. In 2005, despite rises in the prison population, the number of apparent self-inflicted deaths fell by 18 per cent. in comparison to 2004. Most importantly, a high proportion of prisoners arrive in prison having experienced negative life events that we know increase the risk of an individual harming themselves. We also know that cell-sharing is a protective factor against suicide.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w52.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_378">That said, managing high numbers of prisoners can lead to an increase in transfers between prisons, itself a time of heightened risk. More people being received into custody may mean that some prisoners are located further from home, which, in turn, may mean that their access to familial or social support is affected. Sometimes overcrowding will reduce the time staff can spend with individual prisoners on care and risk assessment, and it sometimes leads to an increase in the length of time prisoners are locked in their cells, rather than engaged in regime activities, association and other purposeful activity. These factors together increase distress which we know from research by the University of Cambridge is related to suicide rates.

 With the introduction of patient choice and payment by results, it is important that patients are aware of the services and options available to them. Therefore, a small amount of advertising is in the interests of both patients and hospitals. The Department is developing guidelines, to ensure that any public communications are not only honest and accurate, but also appropriate. These guidelines, together with the payment tariff set by payment by results, should deter inappropriate expenditure on advertising.

<sup>(43)</sup> Figures calculated in 2004&#150;05 prices by applying Gross Domestic Product deflator.<br>

<sup>(44)</sup> From 2003&#150;04 onwards, the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) for the Department was increased by a switch from the exchequers annually managed expenditure spending to cover the increased costs of pensions. An addition of &#163;1.6 billion was made to the NHS DEL to cover these costs from 2003&#150;04 onwards. While this change affected the overall level of NHS Expenditure, they did not increase or decrease the spending power of the NHS. It is cost neutral. For purpose of comparability, the extra expenditure has been stripped out of pay and included in others.<br>

<sup>(45)</sup> Pay has been estimated by combining NHS Accounts information, accounts data for foundation trusts from Monitor, and general medical practice data based on latest information on the new general practitioner contract. Increases in staff are based on census returns, the proportion of extra funds to new staff and pay is based annual comparison of growth in pay bill with growth in NHS staff numbers (weighted by pay).<br>

<sup>(46)</sup> Examples of other incremental expenditure include: buildings, equipment, training, research and development, supplies of services.<br>

Note:<br>

This analysis may not be directly comparable to previously published analyses due to revisions to forecasts, estimates and GDP deflators.<br>

This has resulted in a considerable increase in civil action being instigated for first time offenders with repeat offenders subsequently dealt with through criminal proceedings. Penalties are sanctioned through the civil courts as criminal prosecution of offenders would not be a cost effective way of dealing with such high volume but low-value frauds.

In the North East there are three local authorities with middle schools (Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland and North Tyneside). Following approval from the schools adjudicator in April 2004 Newcastle upon Tyne LA has now completed its reorganisation of schools (3 to 2 tier) in the Outer West area. The Gosforth area will remain 3 tier. Northumberland LA has published proposals and obtained approval for a reorganisation scheme to remove some of its middle schools for implementation from 2005 onwards.

<p><a name="st_650"><a name="60206w66.html_spnew4"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Last September, on a visit to Delhi, the Prime Minister announced a major &#163;10 million initiative spread over five years, aimed at re-vitalising educational links between institutions in the UK and India. The development of sustainable, long-term partnerships between institutions will be key to the success of this initiative. My Department, together with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council, is leading on designing the shape of the new initiative which will begin this April. This design work is continuing and I expect to be in a position to announce more details of the scheme next month.

 A study commissioned by the British Council in 2004 into the Global Value of UK Education and Training Exports estimated that international students contribute some &#163;5 billion a year to the UK economy. Since 1999, my Department has taken steps to increase the number of international students in UK higher education through the Prime Minister&#039;s Initiative (PMI). A key element of the PMI is a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the credentials of UK education overseas. We expect to launch a second phase of the PMI in April. Information on the number of international students working part-time whilst in the UK is not available.

 The Department relies on local authorities to ensure, in their planning, that the provision of school places matches existing and forecast demand.

 Hartlepool United FC is one of more than 150 sports clubs and venues currently signed up to the Department&#039;s Playing for Success&quot; (PfS) initiative, which is establishing study support centres in or near their grounds. Four consecutive national evaluation studies have shown that PfS is highly effective in meeting its objectives of improving the literacy, numeracy and ICT skills of pupils at key stages 2 and 3, as well as boosting their motivation and self esteem. Hartlepool&#039;s Centre was not open at the time of the last evaluation. However, the local authority&#039;s annual report of the Centre&#039;s work in 2004&#151;05 echoes the national findings.

 The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust is a non profit-making educational charity.

 The Construction Industry Scheme requires contractors to make deductions (currently at 18 per cent.) from payments made to sub-contractors and pay the deductions to HM Revenue and Customs. All sub-contractors registered under the scheme are also registered for self-assessment and are required to report their profits on a self assessment return, at the end of the tax year. The amounts deducted from sub-contractors are applied first against their liability to income tax on their profits and then against their liability to class 4 national insurance contributions on those profits. Any balance is repaid. Where sub-contractors are liable to class 2 national insurance contributions, they account for them separately to HM Revenue and Customs.
