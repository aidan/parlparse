<P>
<a name="71103w01.html_wqn4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to alter the Sports Council lottery regulations regarding grants to primary schools. [13015] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 There are no Lottery regulations that apply solely to primary schools. The English Sports Council (ESC), the distributing body for sport-related projects in England, makes awards to all schools and colleges through its "School Community Sports Initiative."
<P>

<a name="71103w01.html_para2">The ESC has developed two proposals as part of the process to help primary schools benefit further from Lottery funds. The first is through part of a new range of revenue programmes encompassing support to the development of talent identification and coaching and leadership for Young People through the World Class Start Programme. Secondly, it is anticipated that primary schools may be able to benefit more suitably through the development of the joint-distributor Community Projects programme currently under development.
<P>

<a name="71103w01.html_para3">In addition, the White Paper "The People's Lottery", published in July, details the Government's proposals to changes and further improve the way in which the lottery operates. One of the most important proposals is the introduction of a new cause--The New Opportunities Fund--which will provide Lottery support for initiatives in education, health and the environment. Primary schools will be eligible to apply for funding from the New Opportunities Fund for out of school hours projects. The target is for at least half of all secondary schools and a quarter of all primary schools to be undertaking such projects and activities by 2001.

[13780]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w01.html_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Security Service Act 1989 provides that, where the tribunal does not uphold a complaint, it shall give notice to the complainant that no determination has been made in his favour, but that it shall not give the complainant any reasons for its determination. To provide reasons would risk compromising the operational effectiveness of the Security Service, to the detriment of national security. For similar reasons, it is not possible to allow individuals to have access to information held by the Service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In 1995, the Government of Guyana, in consultation with Britain and other donors, imposed a moratorium on logging concessions in order to allow time to improve its ability to manage its forests sustainability. We understand that some logging companies, including Asian-owned ones, have expressed interest in operating in Guyana but no logging concessions or exploratory permits have been awarded since then to any companies.
<P>

<a name="71103w02.html_para0">As a result of this, the UK has been working with the Government of Guyana to strengthen the Guyanese Forestry Commission.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what factors led to her Department deciding to disregard war widows' pensions and war pensions in their entirety when assessing entitlement to housing benefit and rent rebates in Northern Ireland.[13940]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The decision to disregard war widows and war pensions fully was carried forward into the Housing benefit legislation from the previous rent rebate and allowances scheme. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Rate Collection Agency administer Housing Benefit for the whole of Northern Ireland. As neither has access to other resources to subsidise Housing Benefit expenditure it was decided that the policy and legislation in Northern Ireland should follow the practice in Great Britain where the substantial majority of local authorities exercised their discretionary power to allow a full disregard.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 In terms of new proposals, the short answer to my hon. Friend is for the Church Commissioners to hold their nerve during recent stock market corrections 



<P>

and to have sufficient cash in hand to take advantage of any bargains that have been presented as a consequence of good stocks falling lower than their true market value.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave a moment ago to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). The Commissioners' priorities are measured over the long term but we actively manage our asset portfolio to ensure that we hold the most appropriate investments to enable us to optimise our return on both capital and income.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his assistance in Committee in moving the amendment on Clause 35 of the Finance Bill which dealt with the abolition of the tax credit for charities and which would, had the amendment been carried, have been of assistance to the Commissioners.
<P>

<a name="71103w03.html_para0">The Commissioners welcome the time allowed by the Government for them to plan for the removal of ACT relief and the phasing of its impact between 1999 and 2004. We put our case to the Government after the changes announced in the Budget. As to investment policy in the light of the withdrawal of ACT credit, the Commissioners have decided that at least half of our portfolio should comprise investments in a wide range of United Kingdom commercial and industrial shares. We continue to think that these are appropriate assets to meet the needs of our beneficiaries within the Church of England and we are playing an active part in putting the case for full exemption from taxation to be restored to charities.
<P>
<P>

[11850]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The Commissioners put their case to the Government after the changes announced in the Budget and were active in briefing honourable Members in preparation for the debate on Clause 35 of the Finance Bill, which introduced the abolition of the tax credit for charities. They are contributing to the Government review of the taxation of charities. Submissions are being made by the Church Commissioners, the Churches Main Committee and other church organisations.

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, as representing the Church Commissioners, what support the Church Commissioners receive from Her Majesty's Government to enable them to maintain redundant and under-utilised churches. [11777]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport provides 70 per cent. of the cost of the Churches Conservation Trust, which preserves redundant Church of England parish churches of particular historic and architectural quality. Churches which are open for public worship are the responsibility of their respective parochial Church Councils who have access through English Heritage to the Government's State Aid scheme. The Commissioners themselves receive no direct financial support from the Government for these purposes.

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, as representing the Church Commissioners, what steps have been taken to implement the recommendations of the Social Security Committee, fifth report (HC 340 Session 1995-96) relating to pension provision in the Church. [11778]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The Social Security Committee recommended that the Commissioners' power to spend capital in discharging their past service pension liability should initially be for a limited period and that the Pensions Measure should provide for the full application of the legislation passed by Parliament to regulate and control pension schemes. These recommendations were reflected in the Pensions Measure which received Royal Assent earlier this year.

<P>

<a name="71103w03.html_para1">Monsanto have assured the Commissioners that they are a life science company playing a pivotal role in improving the health and nutritional needs of future generations whilst being strongly committed to complying with various laws and Government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Our Embassy in Almaty constantly monitors the human rights situation in Kazakhstan. We take up specific cases with the Kazakh authorities when necessary.
<P>

<a name="71103w03.html_para3">Our main concerns revolve around prison conditions and the high rate of capital punishment. In an effort to improve this situation, the UK has offered to support a proposal put forward by the United Nations Development Programme to help reform the penal system in Kazakhstan. We will continue to keep this under close review.

 Britain and Iran usually have fifteen full-time diplomatic staff in each other's capitals. Both Embassies are normally headed by a Charge d'Affaires. However, after the Mykonos verdict in April, both the British and Iranian Charges were temporarily withdrawn. Both Embassies are currently headed by acting Charge d'Affaires.

We continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Burmese refugees in Thailand.

<P>
<a name="71103w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer which companies bidding to take over control of the administration of National Savings have indicated that they would be able to offer new work opportunities in the Blackpool area to any National Savings employees who might be deemed surplus to requirements at the time of their acquiring responsibility for National Savings administration. [13384]

<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Our policy is to find the Government's borrowing requirements as efficiently as possible. National Savings makes a valuable contribution to our funding strategy, and I expect it to continue to do so. I welcome the work which the Agency is doing to study the potential for greater efficiencies through improved marketing and the examination and possible involvement of a private sector partner in its operations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what account he will take of local job-creation possibilities in deciding which company will take over the running of National Savings local administration in the Blackpool area. [13385]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The potential for creating new jobs to offset the anticipated continuing reduction in the Agency's manpower will be a key consideration as proposals for private sector involvement in the operations of National Savings are evaluated.

<a name="71103w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 A study of the potential for private provision of National Savings accommodation is being conducted in parallel with work to explore the scope for private sector involvement in National Savings operations. I would not expect final conclusions before the Spring of 1998.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the Economic and Finance Council--ECOFIN--of the European Union in Brussels on 13 October, and at a formal dinner with Finance Ministers from the EFTA countries the previous evening.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para0">The Council welcomed the UK's Convergence Programme--in particular the Government's commitment to sound finances and stability-oriented monetary policy as a basis for economic growth and investment. The Council also noted with satisfaction the changed arrangements for the implementation of monetary policy, which have helped to lower inflation expectations in the UK. The Council also noted with approval the Welfare to Work initiative and the Employment Action Plan. The Council agreed Conclusions on the Programme and adopting a text for an Excessive Deficits Recommendation. The text of the Conclusions follows this answer.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para1">The dinner, on 12 October, was a useful opportunity to exchange views with the Finance Ministers of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, particularly on employment. I was pleased to see the support that my own approach to employment and employability enjoys both within the EU and EFTA.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para2">The Council discussed the Commission's Communication on Harmful Tax Competition in the EU, focusing on the Code of Conduct. The UK recognised that a voluntary Code might play a helpful role in tackling harmful tax competition, but would only agree to a Code 



<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 1997 : Column: 17</I><P>
that respected Member States' continues competence in the field of tax. The UK, and other Member States, called for several changes to be made to the draft Code. Discussion on the Code will continue in the Taxation Policy Group.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para3">The Commission introduced its Communication on the Practical Aspects of the Euro. This was another useful exchange of views, with Ministers contributing their ideas on how to ensure the smoothest possible transition both for businesses and for public authorities in those countries joining the single currency in January 1999.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para4">The Council considered the liberalisation of capital movements in the context of the IMF. Discussion centred around the compatibility of possible new IMF articles with the Treaty. Council agreed that Monetary Committee should refine EU policy on IMF proposals but that Member States should continue to represent themselves in negotiating the new articles.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para5">The Council discussed a Commission Communication on Public-Private Partnerships in the sphere of Trans-European Networks. The Communication was the result of work by Commissioner Kinnock's High Level Group on the same subject and was welcomed.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para6">The Council took some agenda items over lunch. We discussed the Commission's proposals on enlargement as set out in their July proposals on Agenda 2000. For the UK, the key issues were that the 1999 Own Resources Ceiling of 1.27 per cent. of Community GNP is not raised for the period 2000-06, and that spending is set at levels much lower than this. Substantial policy reform is also necessary to make enlargement affordable and successful. The Council agreed to consider at the next ECOFIN the work to be carried forward on the development of economic coordination in Stage 3 of EMU. The Presidency described its preparations for the Jobs Summit on 20-21 November, and an extraordinary meeting of the ECOFIN Council was agreed for 5 November to do further work on this.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para7"><i>Text of Council conclusions on UK convergence programme</i><i></i>
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para8">On 13 October 1997 the Council welcomed the new United Kingdom Convergence Programme. It noted the progress that had been made in reducing the government deficit and inflation under the previous programme and it welcomed the new government's ambitious but realistic programme to enhance the pace of adjustment.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para9">The Council welcomed, in particular, the government's commitment to sound finances and stability oriented monetary policy as a basis for economic growth and investment. Action has been taken to increase the pace of deficit reduction: the Council noted with satisfaction that the government deficit will be well below 3 per cent. of GDP in the calendar year 1997 while the debt ratio will remain below 60 per cent. of GDP. It noted that the continued commitment to tight expenditure control represented a sound basis for long term budgetary consolidation. The Council urged the UK authorities to make sure that continued borrowing over the economic cycle to finance investment represents an adequate medium term fiscal rule consistent with the objectives of the stability and growth pact.




<P>

<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para10">The Council noted with satisfaction the changed arrangements for the implementation of monetary policy, which have helped to lower inflation expectation in the UK. The Council also encouraged the UK Government to recognise the role of the exchange rate in maintaining stability. The Council noted the UK inflation target of 2.5 per cent. and urged the UK Government to keep this under review in order to ensure that UK inflation remains low and compatible with inflation rates in other Member States.
<P>

<a name="71103w05.html_para11">The Council noted with approval the broader social and economic objectives outlined in the programme and in particular, the concern to improve the opportunities for employment for the young and long-term unemployed. The Council noted that these issues are also dealt with the UK Employment Action Plan. The Council invited the Commission, in close cooperation with the Monetary Committee, to monitor the implementation of the Convergence Programme.

 The firm line we have taken with abusive asylum seekers from these countries has already led to a substantial decrease in the numbers of new arrivals. Many recent arrivals have already been removed to France. Where appropriate, we have detained applicants. My right hon. Friend announced on 27 October a reduction from 28 to five days in the period allowed for post-interview representations in certain cases where claims are judged likely to be abusive. All applications continue to be considered individually, on their merits, in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention. Policy options are constantly reviewed to ensure we maintain our firm line.

<a name="71103w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The North Wales Police Authority's spending capacity for 1997-98 was increased by 3.9 per cent. (&#163;2.7 million) to &#163;72 million, which was above the national average. No final decisions have been taken about the allocation of funding to police authorities for 1998-99. The Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 removed decisions about police numbers from the hands of the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="71103w06.html_para1">It is now for individual chief constables and police authorities to determine the number of police officers in each force, having regard to the resources available to them. At the end of March 1997, North Wales Police had 62.4 per cent. of strength deployed to patrol duties. This is significantly better than the average for England and Wales of 57.6 per cent. This Government will do all that it can to relieve the police of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to allow chief constables to put more officers back on the beat.

<a name="71103w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 My officials have written to their counterparts in other interested Departments and will shortly meet representatives of the tourist industry to discuss further the concerns they and others have raised with us about fire safety in hotel accommodation in some member states. In the light of those and other ongoing discussions, I intend to consult Ministerial colleagues to determine whether there is a need for us to press for an improvement in compliance with European Community recommendation 86/666/EEC--on fire safety in existing hotels--by other member states.
<P>

<a name="71103w07.html_para3">Within the United Kingdom, we consider fire safety levels in hotels to be high, and our domestic legislation in this area already meets the principles of European Community recommendation 86/666/EEC on fire safety in existing hotels. We must therefore carefully weigh any perceived shortcomings in hotel fire safety in other member states against not only public safety but the possibility of unnecessarily imposing further legislation burdens on our own domestic tourist industry which would probably have no tangible safety benefit for hotel guests in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="71103w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985 makes it an offence for retailers to sell substances to a person under the age of 18 if they have reason to believe that the young person intends to inhale them or their fumes for the purpose of intoxication. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs undertook a study into volatile substance abuse, the results of which were published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1995. A copy of their report "Volatile Substance Abuse" is in the Library. They concluded that there were no acceptable legislative changes which would do more than the Act already does to protect young people.

<P>
<a name="71103w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have recently approved three applications for repatriation to the Republic of Ireland submitted by prisoners convicted of terrorist offences. These were approved on the basis that the Republic will continue to enforce the sentences imposed by the courts here in accordance with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. Remaining repatriation applications are at various stages of consideration either here or in the Republic and will be determined as soon as possible.

<a name="71103w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The available information is for those persons initially granted exceptional leave to remain on refusal of asylum. Information for persons granted exceptional leave without originally having applied for asylum is not separately identifiable in the statistics.
<P>

<a name="71103w08.html_para4">In the second and third quarters of 1997 respectively, 540 and 950 grants of exceptional leave on refusal of asylum, excluding dependants, were made. Equivalent information for each quarter of 1995, 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 can be found in table 1.4 of the Home Office statistical bulletin "Asylum Statistics United Kingdom 1996", issue 15/97. Issue 9/96 of the same publication provides the same information for each quarter of 1994. Copies of both publications are available in the Library.

<P>

 The following information is obtained from the Annual Reports of the Interception Commissioner. The Government support the policy, adopted by successive Commissioners, of not publishing a further breakdown of the figures, and of excluding numbers of warrants issued by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, because it would be prejudicial to national security to do so.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There are no such plans. The rules relating to maintenance and accommodation allow a person who is present and settled here to sponsor their spouse to come to the United Kingdom, providing there will be no additional recourse to public funds. This means that a sponsor may continue to receive benefits to which he is entitled in his own right.

 I could not say without consulting each individual file how many meeting requests I have received, but I will always be happy to meet hon. Members to discuss cases unless there are strong reasons for not doing so. Often a meeting proves to be unnecessary because the case is resolved to the Member's satisfaction, and if an individual is detained pending removal I will often prefer to handle representations in writing or by telephone in order to prevent delay.

<a name="71103w09.html_para0">I have already held 25 such meetings at the Home Office, and have another 10 scheduled for the next month. I aim to respond promptly to such requests.

 The UK Passport Agency is unable to provide this information as the records that are kept do not differentiate between British subject passports issued to those born in or connected with the Irish Republic and those born in India who have that status by connection with former British India. The Agency can only confirm that 3,894 British subject passports were issued in the six month period May to October 1997. The status of British subject cannot be transmitted to a child born in the Irish Republic after 31 December 1948.

 Estimated daily intake--EDI--calculations have been carried out in the United Kingdom as part of the pesticide approvals process in those cases where it appears that the acceptable daily intake--ADI--of residues in a food crop might be exceeded. For example, EDI calculations were made for chronic risk assessment purposes in preparing the paper "Unit to Unit Variation of Pesticide Residues in Fruit and Vegetables" which the Pesticides Safety Directorate published in March this year.

<a name="71103w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 30 October, together with my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. Under each agenda item decisions were taken which will enhance fisheries conservation.
<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para6">The Council agreed by qualified majority, with Denmark voting against, a wide ranging package of technical measures designed to conserve fish stocks by reducing catches of juvenile fish and discarding.
<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para7">Key features of the present arrangements, such as the areas closed to protect juvenile fish, will be maintained. The minimum mesh size for cod, haddock and other large-bodied species was confirmed at 100mm in the North Sea and North West of Scotland, and will increase, with special transitional arrangements, from 80mm to 100mm in other waters to the west and south of the United Kingdom. Other measures to increase the selectivity of fishing nets include a new requirement to use square mesh panels in nephrops nets and limits on twine thickness. In order to assist enforcement, there will also be limits on the number of nets of different mesh sizes that fishermen may use on a single trip, with the detailed rules on this aspect to be decided next year.




<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 1997 : Column: 37</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para8">The rules on discarding will change in order to reduce the quantity of fish discarded. The minimum landing sizes of fish will be made more consistent with the mesh sizes used, again in order to reduce discarding. Minimum sizes have also been improved for shellfish stocks to give this sector added protection.
<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para9">The new conservation rules will come into effect on 1 January 2000 so as to give fishermen time to adapt their fishing gear and practices. The Government has worked closely with the fishing industry in discussing technical conservation measures and the new rules respond to many of their concerns. As well as securing conservation gains, we successfully resisted proposals which would have undermined effective enforcement at sea.
<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para10">The Council unanimously agreed conclusions on future policy towards fisheries agreements with third countries. As a result the European Commission will undertake a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of these agreements. In the meantime the Council has called upon the Commission to explore ways of ensuring that the agreements are coherent with general development policy and involve fishing opportunities set at sustainable levels. The Council has also called upon the Commission to examine the funding arrangements and to provide full evaluations before expiring agreements are renewed or new agreements sought. I fully support these conclusions which lay the foundation for a more soundly based future policy.
<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para11">The Council unanimously adopted new rules on catch reporting in Western Waters to come into effect on 1 July 1998. These new rules make up the last enforcement element of the December 1994 Western Waters agreement on Spanish and Portuguese integration into the Common Fisheries Policy. They will strengthen enforcement but should not create significant additional burdens on fishermen because catch reports will be submitted along with the position reports which vessels have had to submit since 1996 when operating in Western Waters.
<P>

<a name="71103w10.html_para12">I used the opportunity of the Council to draw attention to the need to make progress on the Commission's long-standing proposal to phase out the use of drift nets on the high seas. I made it clear that the United Kingdom would seek to reach an agreement during its Presidency of the European Union next year, taking account of both environmental concerns and the needs of the fishermen who have hitherto participated in the fishery.

No prosecutions relating to the docking of tails have been brought by MAFF under schedule 3 of the Welfare of Livestock Regulations 1994 during 1995-96 or 1996-97. Prosecutions brought by local authorities or other bodies are not recorded centrally.

<a name="71103w11.html_para0">Farmers in other Member States are permitted to feed meat and bonemeal (MBM) to non-ruminant livestock. In the UK, mammalian MBM has been prohibited from all farmed livestock feed, including pig, since March 1996. This extension of our ban, which formerly only applied to ruminant feed, was introduced on the specific advice of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee to avoid the risk of any cross-contamination between ruminant and non-ruminant feed. Such cross-contamination could lead to the perpetuation of the BSE epidemic in British cattle.

[14042]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has considered the data on the toxicity of vitamin B6 on two separate occasions. It is aware that the validity of some of the science on which its recommendation was based--including the study by Dalton and Dalton--has been questioned but it has not been persuaded that this issue needs to be looked at for a third time. The Government has every confidence in the rigour with which the COT reviewed the data and in the robustness of the recommendation it made. We see no reason to invite the Committee to reconsider the evidence.
<P>

<a name="71103w11.html_para2">Members of the COT are appointed by the Chief Medical Officer as independent scientific and medical experts on the basis of special skills and knowledge. However, it is inevitable that most experts will have gained experience by applying scientific and toxicological skills to address questions of a commercial nature. In order to ensure that these commercial interests do not conflict with the need to obtain independent expert advice, members are required to declare any commercial interests on appointment and, again, during meetings if a topic arises in which they have an interest. Details of the interests declared by COT Members have been placed in the Library. The Government is wholly satisfied with the integrity of the members of the COT and with the independence of its advice.

<P>

<a name="71103w12.html_para0">The findings of a recent report undertaken by Trade Indemnity also showed that small businesses continue to suffer more from late payment than larger ones.

<P>
<a name="71103w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Most EU legislation on road haulage is aimed at completing the single market in transport: even where agreements have been reached there is often some scope for variations and exemptions between States. There are also, in practice, some differences in interpretation of EU legislation and inconsistencies in its application. By contrast, much other road traffic legislation is better made at national level taking account of the differences in road condition, driver training, penalties and enforcement in individual Member States.
<P>

<a name="71103w15.html_para0">Differences may include the side of the road on which traffic passes, maximum lorry weights, speed limits, the provisions of various national highways codes, priorities at roundabouts, night-time, weekend and bank holiday lorry bans, lorry routeing, and the requirement to pay tolls or purchase <i>vignettes</i>. There are also various more specialised requirements such as documents or markings on the vehicle giving details of weights and dimensions of the vehicle and the threshold for requirements to notify police authorities and highway agencies of abnormal loads. The penalties are those laid down in national penal codes.

<a name="71103w15.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government recognise the importance of long-term reductions in emissions taking into account issues of equality and the need for developing countries to develop their economies and combat poverty. The proposals of the Africa Group merit consideration as one of a number of approaches to the long-term control of greenhouse gas emissions. In the meantime we believe that developed countries must take the lead and agree at Kyoto to making legally binding significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions after 2000. The EU proposal for a 15 per cent. reduction in emissions by 2010 provides the best way of achieving this.

 At the Third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, the Government will be supporting the EU proposal that developed countries reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by 15 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, and by at least 7.5 per cent. by 2005. The Government think that it is important that Kyoto sets a target for 2005, and we believe this figure strikes the right balance between ambition and achievability.

<P>
<a name="71103w15.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The minimum age for eligibility for an Orange Badge is two years; this is laid down in the Disabled Persons (Badges for Motor Vehicles) Regulations 1982. The reason is that children below this age will often be carried in a pram or pushchair, whether they are disabled or not. We keep the operation of the Orange Badge Scheme under review but we have no plans at present to change the eligibility criteria.

 My Department published a paper in May 1995 ("Provisional for Social Housing--Background Analysis: Households in England, their Housing Tenure and the Housing Stock, 1991-2001") analysing the way in which population changes and household growth might alter the demand for housing in England by main tenure over the period 1991 to 2001. This indicated a newly arising need for social housing of between 60,000 and 100,000 units per annum.
<P>

<a name="71103w15.html_para1">The range of demand for additional social housing was calculated by taking the Department's official projection of the growth in household numbers over the 10-year period and subtracting estimated growth in owner occupation. Estimates were based essentially on past trends. The methodology assumed that overall size of the private rented sector would remain unchanged over the 10-years (though in practice it has expanded). Specific adjustments were made for Right To Buy sales, demolitions, etc.
<P>

<a name="71103w15.html_para2">In November 1995, my Department commissioned the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Cambridge to undertake a feasibility study to develop an economic model of the demand and need for social housing in England between 1996 and 2006. A technical report on this study will be published shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Enviornment, Transport and the Regions what action has been taken to reduce discharges of the radioactive substance technetium 99 from the Sellafield reprocessing plant. [13023]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w16.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 all discharges of radioactivity from the Sellafield site are authorised by the Enviornment Agency. British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) has applied to the Environment Agency to vary its discharge authorisations for the Sellafield site. The application includes a reduction in the maximum permitted levels of technetium-99 discharges to sea.
<P>

<a name="71103w16.html_para0">In July, BNFL provided additional information to the Environment Agency in support of its application in respect of its aerial discharges. The Environment Agency is considering the additional information.
<P>

<a name="71103w16.html_para1">My Department has received requests for the application to be called in by the Secretary of State for his own determination. These requests are being considered.
<P>

<a name="71103w16.html_para2">The Government are committed to ensuring the best practicable means are used to limit radioactive discharges. Indeed, the Government agreed to comply within a request to demonstrate to the OSPAR Commission how the UK is meeting the obligations of the OSPAR Convention with respect to reducing discharges and eliminating any pollution from discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield to the Irish Sea.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w16.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Discussions are continuing within OSPAR, in which UK officials are involved, on the form of an objective with regard to radioactive substances and a strategy to achieve that objective. This will form part of the conclusions of the OSPAR Ministerial Meeting being held next summer. In the meantime, the UK is continuing to comply with all its international obligations on the protection of the environment, the public and workers from harmful effects of ionising radiation.
<P>

<a name="71103w16.html_para3">The UK is also continuing to develop and use the Best Available Techniques to prevent pollution of the marine environment from inputs of radioactive substances. We indicated at the OSPAR meeting in September our wish to make progress on the question of reducing nuclear discharges to the marine environment and to work with our OSPAR colleagues to find a way of committing all countries to this action.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) on what evidence his Department's projections of the increase in the number of households by the year 2016 are based; [13028]

<P>
<a name="71103w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Descriptions of the methodology and main statistical assumptions underlying the household projections to 2016 are set out in the annexes to "Projections of Households in England in 2016", published by the Stationery Office in March 1995. A copy of this publication is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="71103w16.html_para4">My Department has received many representations about the accuracy of the household projections and they have been subject to considerable scrutiny since their publication. Much of this work has been published, for example by the Environment Committee in evidence for its report on Housing Need in 1996. Further discussion of the household projections was given in the Green Paper, "Household growth: where shall we live?" which was published last November and the Government are currently considering the responses to that consultation. I am satisfied that the projections were the best that could be made with the available data and that they accurately reflect recent trends.

 The 1,500 mile London Cycle Network (LCN) being developed by the 33 London boroughs, with financial support from the Government, comprises dedicated routes, shared routes and signed routes along lightly trafficked roads. A summary table showing miles of existing and planned LCN routes by borough, which includes dedicated routes, is set out below, but specific information on dedicated routes is not held centrally. Approximately one third of the network has been implemented and it will be completed as resources allow.

In addition, the review of local government finance, which is being carried out in consultation with the Local Government Association, is considering the role

Once I have received the report I will consider arrangements for its publication. I hope to release the report of the research undertaken by the City University into the operation of compulsory purchase orders at the same time.

 We do not have information on the commercial and non-commercial interests of members of the Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification (ACGM); nor on any members of the Health and Safety Commission's advisory committees. Such information is not sought by the HSC when members are appointed to committees. The ACGM was set up by the HSC to provide it with expert advice in relation to all aspects of the contained use of genetically modified organisms. Members are nominated by the CBI, TUC and other bodies according to the tripartite principle applicable to all HSC advisory committees.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what controls exist to ensure that companies retain parental lines of genetically-modified seed varieties granted consent for release for field testing or marketing. [13182]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71103w20.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The marketing and experimental release of GM plants, including seeds, requires consent from the Secretary of State under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations. Consents may be subject to conditions, which could include conditions with respect to the retention of parental lines. In addition, statutory controls exist over the marketing of all seed of the main agricultural crops, whether genetically modified or not. The effect of these controls is that the seed of parental lines of hybrid varieties can only be produced by or under the control of the person responsible for maintaining the variety.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what resources he will make available to authorities that have been or are to be reorganised on 1 April 1995, 1996, 1997 or 1998 for reorganisation costs incurred by them in 1997-98; and if he will make a statement.

 On 18 July I invited authorities that have been or are to be reorganised on or before 1 April 1998 to submit estimates of the amount of expenditure they expect to incur on transitional costs of reorganisation in 1997-98. On the basis, inter alia, of the information provided by the authorities, I have decided the revised maximum amounts that it would be appropriate to allocate towards such costs in 1997-98. In the initial round priority was given to authorities that were reorganised on 1 April 1997 and will be reorganising on 1 April 1998; I have adopted the same priorities for the mid year stage of the scheme. The majority of the authorities to be reorganised in 1998 requested at the beginning of the scheme that allocations in respect of redundancy be deferred until this round. Accordingly, the allocations listed below for authorities reorganising in 1998 are intended to cover redundancy costs.

 The Strategic Defence Review is my Department's contribution to the Comprehensive Spending Review. At the strategic level, we are committed to strong defence through NATO and the maintenance of our nuclear deterrent. This forms part of the framework of the Strategic Defence Review.

 Experience of recent conflicts confirmed that low flying continues to be a vital tactic in the penetration of hostile air defences. There are currently no specific studies into the benefits of low flying, but the need is kept under continuous review.

 Drunkenness is an offence under the Service Discipline Acts and is taken very seriously by the Armed Forces. All three Services already have comprehensive packages, available to all personnel, to combat alcohol misuse in addition to measures taken to limit drinking in Service establishments. These measures are kept under review and amended and re-focused as necessary.

 Batteries are purchased by many budget holders in the Ministry of Defence, either directly or as part of other projects, to meet the needs of all three Services. In all cases, a range of factors is taken into account including safety, storage and maintenance, disposal, and integration into other defence equipment. There are stringent tri-service procedures to ensure that any new battery or modification to existing batteries is an acceptable addition to the Department's range of codified batteries. Wherever possible, value for money is sought through competition against performance specifications, taking account of both initial purchase and through life costs.

 The proposed changes to Child Benefit for new lone parents are due to be implemented from June 1998, prior to that date current entitlement rules still apply. From implementation of the proposed changes, new lone parents will receive the same rate of Child Benefit as couples with children. Existing recipients will not be affected as long as they continue to satisfy entitlement conditions. In addition, lone parents who are receiving Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance with the lone parent rate of family premium will be able to make one subsequent claim for the lone parent rate of Child Benefit when they move into work.

 On 17 July my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced a wide-ranging review of the central areas of insecurity for elderly people, including all aspects of the basic pension and second pensions, including SERPS.
<P>

<a name="71103w25.html_para0">The first stage of the review has involved an extensive public consultation exercise with pensioners' organisations, employers, employees, consumer groups, the pensions industry and others. As part of that exercise I have met the following organisations: Security in Retirement, including Baroness Castle, Mr. Barry Fawcett of the Public Service Pensioners' Council, National Association of Retired Police Officers, the British Pensioners and Trade Union Association, Help the Aged and Age Concern. I have also met the National Pensioners' Convention on 3 occasions reflecting their central and specific role to ensure that the views of today's pensioners are at the heart of the review process. Departmental Officials have also held a separate meeting with them.
<P>

<a name="71103w25.html_para1">We have already received more than 1,100 written responses to the review, including representations from pensioner organisations, which we will consider. The Government intends to publish its initial framework for change in the first part of 1998. There will then be a further period of consultation before firm proposals are developed.
