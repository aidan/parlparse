<UL>(2) pursuant to his answer of 24 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, what assessment he made of whether it was appropriate to follow the guidance in relation to the consultation in the pensions statement; and if he will make a statement.  [73934]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2002]:</i> As a general rule, the requirements of the Code of Practice on Written Consultation apply to all national consultations carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para0">It should, however, be noted that the Code of Practice applies to those consultations that cover

where views are sought from the public. The code makes clear that parts, but not necessarily all of the guidance it contains may be relevant to more limited consultation exercises, such as those seeking views from professional bodies or departmental trade unions, or consultation with local government. There may be occasions, for example on practical aspects of implementing technical legislation, where consultation is limited to those directly affected.

<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on Cherwell District Council was published on 19 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para1">The BFI finds that the council had implemented improvements since its Best Value Review and the BFI Best Value inspection in October 2001. The introduction of a customer service team has had a positive impact on claims processing speed as this team deals with all telephone enquiries from claimants, which allows processing of claims without interruption. The council had set challenging targets to answering telephone calls quickly and BFI found the service to be efficient.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para2">The report identifies a number of strengths and good practices. The council is commended for the high standard of verifying claims for benefit, recording the required evidence to support the claim and using efficient procedures to control and monitor claims.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para3">The council has effective mechanisms for the identification, classification and recovery of overpayments and is commended for its use of management information for monitoring performance. However, the report notes that a number of cases sampled had been incorrectly classified. The council is recommended to use its powers to recover debt in all appropriate cases to improve the rate of recovery.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para4">The council is also commended for its partnership approach to long-term strategies. The Community Plan has been produced with 15 public, private and voluntary sector organisations after extensive consultation with local people.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para5">The report recognises the council's commitment to fraud prevention, deterrence and detection. Fraud awareness among benefit staff is high and this is reflected in the number of high quality fraud referrals that benefit staff make to the council's fraud investigators.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para6">BFI expresses concern with the lack of management checks on IT security. The council has responded positively to this and has taken immediate steps to rectify the situation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_wqn3"><B> Paddy Tipping: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement about the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of <i>(a)</i> North Ayrshire Council, <i>(b)</i> Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council and <i>(c)</i> the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.  [76870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on North Ayrshire Council was published on 18 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para7">The report finds that in the first instance, the council had been delivering an inadequate benefits service. The council needs to take some basic decisions on its operational strategy for delivering benefits, such as the structure, location and management arrangements for benefits administration and counter fraud.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para8">In terms of delivering the service, the report notes that the standards expected for verifying claims to benefit were not being met. Contributory factors included a poorly designed claim form that failed to guide the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 133W</I><P>
claimant to complete it accurately, the absence of quality checks to identify weaknesses, insufficient staff training, the lack of a visiting team to undertake targeted checks and a constant backlog of cases. A high percentage of private sector claims were not being referred to the Rent Officer and were thus avoiding the required controls on rent and benefit levels.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para9">The council operates decentralised benefit processing within its housing offices. At the time of the inspection, there were longstanding backlogs of work. The speed of processing was poor but varied across area and benefit type. Claimants were not receiving the same standard of service across the council's area.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para10">The BFI expresses major concerns over the safety and security of the council's IT systems to support the benefits service.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para11">Overpayments have been found to be a particularly weak area of the council's performance. The BFI considers that improvement is needed across all areas, including accuracy, identifying, recording and recovering overpayments. Improvements are also needed on the audit trail for decision making and management information.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para12">The council was not generating the management information needed to manage benefits effectively. For example, in the areas of workflow and capacity, appeals and overpayments.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para13">BFI commends the council for funding Professionalism in Security (PINS) training for its counter fraud staff. At the time of the inspection, fraud investigation was found to be inadequate but the signs were that this would improve. The council needs to develop its Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Corruption policy to include objectives, reporting arrangements, sanctions, review arrangements and how it will evaluate its effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para14">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council was published on 19 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para15">The BFI first inspected and published a report on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council in October 1999. The report made eight major recommendations to improve performance.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para16">This follow up report finds that while progress had been made in implementing these recommendations it had been too little and too slow.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para17">The first inspection made a number of recommendations to improve the council's internal security. Some of these have been implemented but IT access controls remains weak, division of duties is not always appropriate, there is inadequate management checking and insufficient internal audit coverage.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para18">The correct verification of claims was highlighted as an issue at the first inspection and remained inconsistent at the time of the follow up inspection.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para19">Significant improvements were needed to the council's procedures for backdating claims. While some of these had been implemented, the follow up inspection showed there was still a need for improvement, in particular record keeping of applications for 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 134W</I><P>
backdating. Further improvements were also needed to the council's claim form to ensure that claimants provide sufficient information to allow assessment of the claim.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para20">There had been a noticeable improvement, including the appointment of a new fraud manager, in the council's counter fraud work although much of this improvement took place in the months leading up to the on-site phase of the follow up inspection.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para21">The council dealt speedily with the processing of new and renewal claims, unfortunately, the BFI found that the number of errors entering the system at the time of inputting the information was increasing, with 11 mistakes found in a sample of 40 claims. The problem of a considerable backlog of new and renewal claims had been resolved.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para22">An improved working relationship with the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service (now joined as Jobcentre Plus) is noted in the report.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para23">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para24">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames was published on 26 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para25">The report finds that the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames had made many improvements during the 2 years before the BFI inspection and since bringing the benefits service back in house after a period of outsourcing. In some areas this improvement was significant.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para26">These improvements include reductions in the time taken to process new and repeat claims and notifications of changes in circumstances. However, the council needs to improve further in these areas if it is to achieve its Best Value targets.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para27">Other improvements made by the council include the implementation of the BFI national model claim form and Verification Framework, sustained improvements in key customer services and a reduced backlog of work which has led to reductions in customer complaints.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para28">The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames still needs to improve its verification of claims, the quality of its fraud investigations and become more effective at recovering overpayments. This is critical if the #30.6m of benefit paid to 6,000 claimants is to be brought under tighter control.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para29">The report finds that the council had a clear prosecution policy to deter fraudsters but identifies weaknesses in the quality of fraud investigations. The report acknowledges the successful prosecution of fraudsters in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para30">Overall the report concludes that the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames has established a good platform from which it can make the necessary improvements.




<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 135W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para31">In 2000/01, the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames administered approximately #30.6 million in housing benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement about the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of <i>(a)</i> the London Borough of Enfield and <i>(b)</i> Wakefield Metropolitan District Council.  [76865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on the London Borough of Enfield was published on 18 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para32">The BFI reports that the council's management of the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit was poor with weaknesses in many areas.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para33">Access to the benefits system was not sound and the council did not ensure that claims were right from day one. Information was not routinely verified or cross checked and management was not monitoring performance. This significantly increased the risk of fraud and error at the outset of the claim.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para34">The council did not detect when payments went wrong and take prompt action to correct them with appropriate penalties to deter a recurrence. Delays in dealing with changes of circumstances have increased the number and level of preventable overpayments.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para35">Considerable delays occurred in the assessment and payment of benefit. Management was not monitoring the processes to ensure that bottlenecks and backlogs were quickly identified as they appeared. This caused hardships to claimants and by failing to make payments on account in appropriate cases the council increased this.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para36">Insufficient resources were devoted to recovering overpayments of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. As a result, the council was failing to control the level of outstanding debt.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para37">The BFI also found that the council's counter fraud performance was poor. Weaknesses were identified in the management of the investigation team and the quality of the investigative work.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para38">The council is commended for its commitment to its anti-poverty strategy and for promoting the take up of benefit. Its dedicated team has helped Enfield residents to receive more than #12 million in new and additional welfare benefits since 1996.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para39">The report concludes that the council needs to improve the management and effectiveness of its working practices within the benefit service in order to deliver its corporate vision.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para40">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on Wakefield Metropolitan District Council was published on 9 October 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para41">The report finds that in March 2001, the council completed a Best Value Review of the benefits function. The review identified a need to improve in key areas such as claims processing, management checking and overpayment administration. The report finds 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 136W</I><P>
performance in these key areas is poor. However, BFI recognises the efforts being made by the council to improve performance.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para42">The council's practices for processing benefit claims differed across its 13 sites, and there was a 6 weeks backlog of work creating queries and complaints. The council was intending to centralise its benefit function as an answer to many of its problems, however insufficient plans for centralisation had been produced.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para43">Whilst the report finds examples of good practices, it found differing levels of performance and procedures across the council. The inconsistent verification of benefit claims and low levels of management checks were identified as key weaknesses, increasing the risk of fraud and error entering the benefit system.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para44">The council intends implementing the Verification Framework before March 2003 and it was improving its corporate performance measurement framework. These initiatives combined with centralisation should put the council in a position to provide a much improved benefits service.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para45">The report finds very poor performance in the council's administration of overpayments of benefit, with benefit debt increasing and errors being made. However, the council was enhancing its IT system to improve its performance in overpayment administration.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para46">The council had a sound approach to countering fraud and corruption, and had undertaken some good quality fraud prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para47">The report concludes that there is a clear need for the council to improve its benefit performance as the inspection identified many cases of poor performance. However, BFI was encouraged that the council was aware of the challenges it was facing, and with the level of interest shown by elected Members, both in the inspection and the benefit service.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para48">In 1999&#150;2000, Wakefield Metropolitan District Council administered approximately #65.2 million in housing benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement about the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of <i>(a)</i> Babergh and <i>(b)</i> Swale district councils. [76866]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on Babergh District Council was published on 10 October 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para49">The BFI first inspected and published a report on Babergh District Council in April 2000.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para50">This report finds that Babergh District Council had made significant improvements since the first inspection. Despite backlogs of work, the council had made progress in its housing benefits administration and counter fraud work. Throughout the inspection, BFI identified improvements and good practices that had been implemented since the first inspection.




<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 137W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para51">The report finds that the council had introduced initiatives to raise awareness of housing benefits among its residents, and had reviewed its Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit claim form.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para52">The council had introduced the Verification Framework, improving the collection and recording of evidence to support new claims for benefit, and it was identifying and checking any inconsistencies to reduce fraud and error. All new claims were subject to a 100 per cent. quality check.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para53">However, the report finds that the council needed to improve its evidence gathering for renewal benefit claims and not make awards before all the necessary evidence was collected.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para54">The report finds backlogs of work, arising from the simultaneous implementation of the Verification Framework and a new IT system for processing housing benefits claims, which were severely affecting the processing times for all claims.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para55">The report finds a marked improvement in counter fraud work, with investigators receiving Professionalism in Security training and a full range of investigations being undertaken. The District Auditor had reported satisfaction with the council's counter fraud measures.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para56">Overpayments had increased since the first inspection, mainly due to the backlogs of work and IT changes. Levels of recovery had dropped and overpayment cases were not well documented or subject to quality checks.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para57">In 2000&#150;01, Babergh District Council administered approximately #12.8 million in housing benefits.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para58">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para59">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on Swale Borough Council was published on 25 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para60">The BFI first inspected and published a report on Swale Borough Council in April 2000. The report found that while the council demonstrated some good working practices, the efficiency and security of the benefits system was compromised by a backlog of work and a lack of a clear sense of direction and purpose in its counter fraud strategy. At that time, the council had undergone a period of significant change.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para61">This report finds that of the 40 recommendations made in the April 2000 report, the council had implemented 6 in full, partially implemented 24 and not implemented 10.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para62">The report commends Swale Borough Council for its commitment in clearing the backlog of work, which was having a detrimental effect during BFI's first inspection. This required a heavy investment in increasing and training its staffing on the benefit section.




<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 138W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para63">There have also been improvements in the council's benefit claim form, the levels of verification and the speed of processing claims and notifications of change of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para64">There were still problems with the council's counter fraud operations. BFI reports that a lack of effective management had hampered the way that the unit operated. The report finds a general lack of management checking and controls to guard the system against fraud, error and abuse.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para65">The report finds significant problems with overpayments not being accurately classified and the situation had worsened since the first report. The council did not always impose the maximum deduction for the recovery of fraudulent overpayments.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para66">The counter fraud operation was not being sufficiently managed and there was minimal management checking and little direction during fraud investigations.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para67">The council's post opening operation was found to be insecure and BFI expresses concern to find that numerous recommendations made in this area in the first report remained unactioned.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para68">In conclusion, the council had only partially delivered the improvements that it said it would in its response to the Secretary of State following the publication of the BFI's first inspection report, published in April 2000.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para69">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement about the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of <i>(a)</i> Erewash Borough Council, <i>(b)</i> East Dumbartonshire Council and <i>(c)</i> St. Helens Metropolitan Borough Council.  [76867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w01.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on the Erewash Borough Council was published on 26 September 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para70">The report finds Erewash Borough Council failing to deliver an adequate and secure benefit service. There were significant weaknesses in the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit and counter fraud work. There were also significant backlogs of work.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para71">At the time of BFI's inspection, the council had been in a state of constant change for over 4 years, and no senior manager was in post with specific responsibility, or expertise in, housing benefits or counter fraud work. This lack of expertise and key personnel had resulted in a complete lack of strategic direction. Council Members were aware of these problems but the council had made slow progress to resolve the issues. The report finds earlier plans had proved to be of limited use and much rested on the appointment of new chief officers.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para72">Despite the serious lack of managerial involvement at a high level, the efforts of benefits staff must not be ignored as they devised procedures, which were a positive measure. They attempted to improve standards 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 139W</I><P>
by implementing the Verification Framework, expanding customer services and organising occasional landlord forums. Although fragmented, these efforts were a positive step.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para73">There was a serious lack of control of benefits work. There were no quality or management checks, no formal procedures and little training. Staff resources were inadequate.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para74">The introduction of a new IT system was poorly planned and managed, and the system was not used to its full potential. Management information from the housing benefits IT system was unreliable and there were serious flaws in the security of the system.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para75">The report finds errors in all stages of the overpayment process, with little control or monitoring, and no one appointed with specific responsibility for overpayment work.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para76">The council had poor counter fraud performance in all aspects of its operation. Fraud investigations lacked depth and substance and this impaired its ability to prosecute fraudsters.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para77">Erewash Borough Council only fully implemented 9 of 30 recommendations, made by the District Auditor 3 years before the BFI inspection, to improve its counter fraud arrangements.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para78">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on East Dunbartonshire Council was published on 7 October 2002 and copies of the report were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para79">The BFI first inspected and published a report on East Dunbartonshire Council in March 1999. The report found that the council was a poor-performing authority that needed to design and develop a more secure and accurate benefits administration system and improve the quality of its benefits service.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para80">This report finds that the council had responded positively to the findings in the first report and had introduced some improvements in its administration of housing benefits. However, some key recommendations from the first inspection had not been properly addressed and minimal progress had been made in counter fraud work.
<P>

<a name="21022w01.html_para81">The introduction of the Verification Framework in April 2001 had improved the evidence gathering process. However, the use of the same sub-standard claim form that was in place at the first inspection and poor staff training meant that the majority of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit awards were based on poor or inadequate evidence.

 On current plans, the Type 42 Destroyer HMS Nottingham is expected to arrive in the United Kingdom on, or about, 12 December 2002. While a decision on the ship's future has yet to be made, there is no reason at this time to suppose that repairing her will not be worthwhile. We have therefore invited those UK shiprepair companies with the necessary in-depth knowledge and experience of maintaining and repairing Type 42 Destroyers and their systems to visit the ship to make their own assessments of the damage and tender for any repair work. This invitation has been issued without any commitment from the Ministry of Defence to proceed with the repairs should it not be cost effective to do so. One of the companies invited to visit Nottingham on this basis is Fleet Support Limited, the commercial operators of the Naval facilities at Portsmouth.

 Defence contacts with Indonesia over the past year have been focused on taking forward a reform programme within the Indonesian armed forces under the aegis of the inter-Departmental Global Conflict Prevention Fund. This has the objective of promoting the emergence of democratically accountable and professional security forces. Contacts have included visits to the United Kingdom by Indonesian politicians, civilian government officials, police and military officers to discuss issues such as defence management, promoting greater transparency and accountability of military expenditure, rules of engagement and the role of the military in support of the civil authorities. United Kingdom visitors to Indonesia have covered similar issues. In addition, two Indonesian officers and one civilian attended a United Kingdom-sponsored ''Managing Defence in a Democracy'' course in September 2002 in Singapore and two Indonesian officers attended a United Kingdom-sponsored regional peacekeeping course in Bangkok in August 2002.

 The United Kingdom is contributing to the development of NATO STANAG 4586 that relates to the definition of Standard Interfaces of Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Control Systems for NATO UAV interoperability.

 Technology demonstrations for the TRACER programme took place during June and July 2002. The cost of these trials was included in the overall Assessment Phase contracts valued at some #90 million. Final reports have now been delivered and technology maturity data that they contain will inform decisions within the Department about how individual technologies might be applied to future equipment programmes. The results contain commercially sensitive proprietary information and there are no plans to publish them.

 My Department has a number of web sites in addition to the Department for Transport web site (www.dft.gov.uk). It is not possible to state the start up costs as the site has been created out of the former DTLR (and before that, DETR) web site. The annual cost of running the web site is currently #85,000 (excluding staff costs). The web hosting company is EduServ, who are based in Bath. There has been no assessment of the DfT web site, as it has only existed since the creation of the Department earlier this year.

 The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) are statutory advisers to the Department for Transport on the transport and mobility needs of disabled people. The Committee was set up under S.125 of the Transport Act 1985 and it is also recognised in a number of other Acts including the Railways Act 1993 and the Transport Act 2000.

[75848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Following discussions with a producer of water-diesel emulsion fuel, some limited testing of their fuel was carried out as part of a much wider particulate research programme commissioned by this Department in partnership with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and the Oil Companies European Organisation for Environmental Health and Safety (CONCAWE). The results of those tests are included in an Annex to the report on the Particulate Research Programme 1998&#150;2001 which was published in May 2001. I am arranging for copies of the Summary Report, including the full report on CD, and the relevant Annex from the full report to be placed in the Libraries of the House.

[75608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has had discussions with Transport for London and has received enquiries from other bus operators about the use of water-diesel emulsion fuels in public transport vehicles. The Department is aware that diesel emulsions can deliver some environmental benefits, in particular through reduced NOx and emissions of particulate mass but there is evidence of increased hydrocarbons and ultra-fine particle emissions. There is an emerging view among medical experts that, potentially, ultra-fine particles may have a significant effect on human health. Therefore, until the health effects are clearer, the Department has some reservations about the wider use of these fuels.

 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The estimate of forecast total UK demand for air travel in 2030 is based on a 1 per cent. per annum reduction in air fares in real terms over the forecasting period, as noted in paragraph 5.9 of the consultation document ''The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East.''

<a name="21022w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The Government is committed to ensuring that the aviation industry meets its environmental costs. Since civil aviation is a international industry, the Government's approach is to support multilateral action through ICAO to end the exemption from tax for international aviation fuel. Unilateral action would create market distortions, such as ''tankering'' of extra fuel from aboard to avoid tax, and would have limited environmental benefits. The Government has given an undertaking not to remove zero rating for VAT purposes of international air (and sea) transport. In the consultation document, <i>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom:South East</i>, it is estimated that policies to meet the contribution of aircraft emissions towards climate change would reduce demand by around 10 per cent.

 Regulations for buses provide minimum safety and accessibility standards for all passengers and in some circumstances dedicated transport for children requires additional features such as seat belts.
<P>

<a name="21022w06.html_para2">The current regime allows education authorities the flexibility to use the most appropriate means of transport for schoolchildren, whether on dedicated vehicles or by using existing services.
<P>

<a name="21022w06.html_para3">My Department has recently commissioned independent consultants to evaluate the American-style yellow school bus pilots which First is running. The objectives of the evaluation include comparing the daily cost per capita to local authorities of running a First pilot vehicle to that of running a traditional school contract vehicle.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is no specific category of School bus in regulations. Amendments to the Road Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations in 1996 require minibuses or coaches used for the transport of groups of more than three children on organised trips to be fitted with seat belts. In many cases this would include vehicles used for trips to and from schools. Further changes to these regulations require all new buses and coaches which are not certified to carry standing passengers to be fitted with seat belts from October 2001.
<P>

<a name="21022w06.html_para4">The Department has recently consulted on the reform of national regulations and approval schemes for the construction and use of minibuses, buses and coaches. The main purpose of these changes is to simplify the current regulatory structure and align our requirements with those common in the rest of Europe. Whilst these proposals do not differentiate between the uses to which buses and coaches are put they will effect all such vehicles including those used for school transport.

<P>
<a name="21022w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The regulatory framework for operators of goods and passenger service vehicles is contained in the Goods Vehicle (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 and the Public Passenger Vehicle Act 1981. In January 2001 Regulations were made to allow illegally operated heavy goods vehicles to be impounded. Following consultation, we are in the process of making regulations to increase fees relating to the licensing of operators and the registration of bus services. We are currently consulting on regulatory changes to facilitate the registration of flexibly routed bus services. We are planning to clarify and extend the categories of exemptions to goods O-licensing as soon as consultation has been completed. We continue to keep the systems under review with a view to improvement and the easing of the regulatory burden on industry.

If there is no seat belt available, then children may not travel in the front. Passengers in the rear seats of passenger carrying vehicles over 2.54 tonnes unladen weight are not required to use seat belts or child restraints.
Casualty figures for children 0&#150;3 years are set out below. Information on the use of seat belts is not recorded in official casualty statistics, and therefore it is not possible to say whether these casualties were using child restraints or seat belts or not. The figures include casualties in buses or coaches where the passenger was injured whilst getting on or off&#151;these are not disaggregated from the casualty figures.

<P>
<a name="21022w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> There is a requirement for all Non Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) to be reviewed quinquennially. The Commission for Integrated Transport's first quinquennial review will take place in 2004. There is no requirement to carry out any additional performance reviews of the Commission, as they are only an Advisory NDPB. The Commission does however publish annual reports that give details of their performance; copies of their first 3 annual reports have been placed in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="21022w08.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> The work of Rail Passengers Committees are co-ordinated by the Rail Passengers Council. The Council and Committees are the statutory watchdog protecting and promoting the interests of rail passengers. Their statutory duties are set out in sections 76 and 77 of the Railways Act 1993, as amended by the Transport Act 2000. Sponsorship and external assessment of the work of the Council and Committees are matters for the Strategic Rail Authority.

 Customs can seize illegally logged timber only if the species concerned is covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). New EU-wide legislation is needed to empower customs authorities to prevent entry of illegally logged non-CITES timber. The UK is working within the EU to identify what legislation is needed and how it can be introduced. The UK Government has also committed its own central departments and their agencies to procure timber from legal and sustainable sources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Expenditure on TB compensation in GB fell from #7,307,797 in 2000 to #7,074,125 in 2001. The reduction was due to the diversion of resources during the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak away from the testing of cattle for TB. Therefore the number of animals identified as TB reactors and slaughtered as a consequence, fell from 6,954 in 2000 to 5,903 in 2001.

<P>

<a name="21022w10.html_para0">SVS expenditure figures include the cost of dealing with reactor herds when new incidents of Bovine TB are identified. The reduction of expenditure between 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 can be explained by a lower number of TB incidents in Wales in 2000.

<P>

<a name="21022w10.html_para3">There are no plans to offer financial support to establish new facilities for the composting of cooked food waste. However, the 2000 spending review provided substantial additional resources to help deliver the statutory performance standards on recycling and composting.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> DEFRA recognises the importance of free range egg systems in terms of consumer choice, but we have made no specific assessment of the role of small free range poultry units in reviving the agriculture sector as a whole. Individual producers will need to make decisions based on their own individual circumstances.

<a name="21022w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's scientific advisers, English Nature, consider that the hedgehog is under no conservation threat. The UK's total pre-breeding population stands at about 1,555,000; 1,100,000 in England, 310,000 in Scotland and 145,000 in Wales. English Nature is aware of a study into numbers of hedgehogs killed on roads by cars but advises that, as the study is not yet completed, it is too early to draw conclusions at this stage.

 At present there is no comprehensive, standardised national monitoring of British mammals that embraces the full range of important species. Whilst a range of organisations undertake monitoring, not all mammals are included, surveys are often sporadic and the results distributed to only a limited extent.
<P>

<a name="21022w10.html_para8">DEFRA therefore let a GB wide research contract entitled ''Design and pilot a multi-species terrestrial mammal monitoring project'' in June 2001, to the British Trust for Ornithology and the Mammal Society. The overall aim will be to design and pilot, using a volunteer network, a winter monitoring project involving both visual recording of mammals and the recording of their signs. This is intended to form a building block for an integrated mammal-monitoring system.
<P>

<a name="21022w10.html_para9">The work will include an analysis of the results, including aspects such as accuracy, repeatability and the utility of the results, for monitoring mammal abundance and distribution and for the potential to assess long-term trends.

 Following the Agricultural Wages Board annual pay negotiations on 3/4 July, an assessment of the impact of the proposed changes to be included in the 2002 Wages Order was issued by the Board's Secretariat on 5 August 2002. Copies were sent to all the people who requested further information on the Board's proposals. This showed the increased cost to the agriculture industry in England and Wales over the period 1 October 2002 to 30 June 2003, resulting from the proposed changes, to be between #57 and #69 million. These costings were derived from the Ready Reckoner prepared annually by Defra for the Board to use during the pay negotiations. Cost estimates for individual sectors of the industry were not prepared.
<P>

<a name="21022w11.html_para1">Cost assessments were also prepared by the National Farmers Union and the Transport and General Workers Union. Defra statisticians also reviewed the results of the September 2001 Earnings and Hours Survey and submitted a paper to the Board showing how this would affect the Board's assessment of the impact of the 2002 proposals. In addition Defra economists prepared a paper for the Board, providing an update on the economic performance of each of the key sectors in the agriculture and horticulture industry. The Board's Secretariat has confirmed that all these papers were considered by a meeting of the Board's Working Party which took place on 27 August (immediately prior to the Board's Confirmation meeting on 29 August). This meeting was intended to ensure that both sides of the Board and the Independent members had a clear understanding of how the proposals would impact on both the employers' costs and workers' pay.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when section 63 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 will be implemented; what the legal and financial implications of this will be for local authorities; what incentive it will provide for them to ensure that their rights of way networks are kept fully open; and if she will make a statement.

 Following our recent consultation on implementation of section 63 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, we are now drafting regulations in the light of the 126 responses we received, with a view to commencing the provisions in early 2003.
<P>

<a name="21022w12.html_para0">Local highway authorities are already under a duty to protect the rights of the public to use rights of way. Under the new burdens procedure, highway authorities collectively are being funded for the additional requirements imposed by section 63. The procedures will provide a formal means for any person to draw to the authority's attention paths which are being obstructed and to take court action where they fail to act. The provisions will encourage authorities to be more proactive in their attempts to keep rights of way free from obstructions, leading to improved access and use of rights of way.

 By mid 1994, out of Rwanda's population of roughly 8 million at the beginning of the 1990's, some 2 million had become internally displaced and a further 2 million had fled as refugees to neighbouring countries. The Government of Rwanda's policy of national reconciliation and its success in establishing a peaceful and stable country have led to the return of the vast majority of these displaced persons and refugees to their communities.
<P>

<a name="21022w13.html_para1">There are three significant returns of displaced persons to Rwanda: of disarmed ex-FAR/Interahamwe soldiers and their families from the DRC; of Rwandan refugees from the eastern DRC, and; of Rwandan refugees from Tanzania.

<a name="21022w13.html_para2">The Government of Rwanda hopes that some 25,000 ex-FAR/Interhamwe will be repatriated as the Pretoria Agreement is implemented. The Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme provides for the return of ex-combatants and their families to their communities, for the counselling of ex-combatants and the communities to which they are returning, and significant economic assistance to ease the reintegration of ex-combatants into society. Special packages of assistance are available for child, female and disabled ex-combatants. The Government hopes that their withdrawal from the DRC will serve to increase the flow of the ex-combatants into the Programme. We judge that the Programme is well designed and well established, and have committed US$5 million to support it. We have also committed US$25 million to the equivalent regional demobilisation programme.

 Rwanda is largely on track to achieve the 2015 target for universal primary education and. in fact, has set a national target of achieving UPE by 2010. Primary enrolment has increased by over 50 per cent. since 1996, to nearly 1.5 million children in 2001. This represents a net enrolment ratio of around 75 per cent. for both boys and girls.

<P>

 There were an estimated 1.5 million children enrolled in primary schools in Rwanda in 2001. Private schooling plays a minimal role, accounting for less than 0.8 per cent. of the pupils.

 I have congratulated President Kagame on his commitment to implementing the terms of the Pretoria Agreement with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by withdrawing Rwandan forces from the DRC. The UK has joined with the international community in condemning the renewed outbreak of hostilities by armed groups in the Eastern DRC following the Rwandan withdrawal, and calling upon all those directly involved or involved in supplying the armed groups to cease forthwith.
<P>

<a name="21022w13.html_para12">We strongly support Rwandan plans for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of its own soldiers and those Rwandan rebels in Congo who choose to return to Rwanda. We have committed $25 million to the World Bank's Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme for the Great Lakes region, under which Rwanda and the DRC will benefit, and are contributing a further $5 million directly to the Rwandan National Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme.

<a name="21022w14.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Humanitarian food aid into southern Africa will only meet 30 per cent. of the estimated 4 million tonne cereal deficit faced by the region. The commercial sector and governments are expected to import and distribute the bulk of the food requirements. Although some Governments are subsidising maize prices to keep them stable, prices are at historical highs throughout the region. As imports will be insufficient to build up stocks prices will remain high until the next harvest expected from April 2003. Local food prices next year will be determined by the size of the harvest.

<P>
<a name="21022w14.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Uncertainties and interference by governments in maize pricing and input supplies have resulted in many farmers planting a wider range of crops. Although most smallholders still plant maize, more are moving into cash crops that provide higher returns. DFID supports recovery programmes in southern Africa which are supplying seeds and planting materials for a range of crops including maize that will reduce the reliance on a single staple and ensure a wider and more varied diet.

<P>
<a name="21022w14.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 It is extremely difficult at present to obtain accurate information on the food situation in the hill districts of the Mid and Far West of Nepal, which have traditionally been areas of food insecurity. Recent reports suggest that food supply in those parts of the country has been affected by the poor monsoon this year, the migration of young men from conflict affected areas, and restrictions on movements and on the supply of food by Maoist and Government security forces. For example, in some mountain districts we estimate the millet crop will be only 80per cent. of normal levels.
<P>

<a name="21022w14.html_para0">It is too early to say that there will be a humanitarian crisis in the Mid and Far West of the country. The greatest need at present is for more reliable information. DFID is monitoring the situation closely. DFID recently provided #115,000 to increase the capacity of the World Food Programme's Vulnerability and Monitoring Unit. We are also closely in touch with other organisations monitoring the situation including the UNDP, the International Nepal Fellowship and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
<P>

 At Tokyo in January we pledged #200 million over 5 years to Afghanistan, we did not divide this in to specific amounts for separate financial years. So far in the current financial year we have disbursed over #33 million of our budget of #55 million. In 2001&#150;02 we gave approximately #60 million to Afghanistan for immediate humanitarian relief activities, including food aid and support for returning refugees. International support for such appeals has already provided some essential building blocks for longer term reconstruction: for example a polio vaccination programme has reached 6 million children and 3 million children are now back at school.

<a name="21022w16.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID is not giving direct assistance to customs officers in South America or West Africa to prevent the illegal trade in bushmeat. DEFRA and HMCE ensure that importation to the UK complies with CITES controls on endangered species. DEFRA is carrying out an awareness-raising campaign in these regions aimed at reducing the illegal trade of meat into the UK. My Department's primary role is to support poverty reduction, which we see as key to ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources, including wildlife, in poor countries.

 There is no formal classification of which endangered species constitute bushmeat within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. However, a recent review of commercially valuable bushmeat species in Africa (CITES Document 11.44) concluded that of forty-two primary species caught and traded, eight species are ''endangered'' (i.e. listed on CITES Appendix 1) and one species (elephant) has some ''endangered'' populations. The 8 ''endangered'' species are Leopard, Chimpanzee, Bonobo, Gorilla, Mandrill, Drill, Diana guenon/monkey and Jentink's duiker.

 The HIV/AIDS epidemic poses a major threat to food security in Sub Saharan Africa, and has served to contribute to, and greatly exacerbate southern Africa's growing famine.
<P>

<a name="21022w16.html_para0">HIV/AIDS is hitting agricultural productivity hard. In just two decades AIDS has killed seven million farmers in Africa and in some countries, households and villages are losing from 10&#150;50 per cent. of agricultural productivity due to the disease.
<P>

<a name="21022w16.html_para1">HIV/AIDS impacts on reduced food availability as workers become too ill to work the land, care for livestock and maintain essential machinery. At a family level food production has fallen by as much as 80 per cent. when the main producer is affected. This is especially true in areas such as Southern Africa, which uses labour-intensive farming methods.

 DFID's overall programme in Africa is set to increase from 640 million pounds sterling this year to one billion pounds sterling by 2006 and HIV/AIDS will remain one of our highest priorities in the region.

A further $200 million dollars (#140 million pounds approximately) has been pledged by the UK to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.

<a name="21022w17.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The key point of the Court of Appeal's judgment in these consolidated cases, as far as my Department is concerned, is that the legislation enabling the Secretary of State to give guidance to headteachers, local education authorities and appeal panels in relation to the exclusion of pupils from school complies with the <i>Human Rights Act 1998</i>, and in particular with Article 6 of the <i>European Convention on Human Rights</i> (the right to a fair hearing). So far as the guidance applicable to these cases was concerned, the Court went on to hold that neither its content nor the fact that the exclusion appeal panels had a statutory duty to have regard to it in determining the appellant pupils' appeals compromised the pupils' right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal. However, the Secretary of State is mindful of the observations which the Court made with regard to using her powers to issue guidance and will bear them in mind when issuing revised guidance.
<P>

<a name="21022w17.html_para6">As to the future, I envisage that the Secretary of State will continue to use her statutory powers to give guidance for the purposes of promoting fairness and consistency in decision-making.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on what basis the ethnicity factor in the additional educational needs allocates extra resources to all ethnic groups; if she will publish the evidence that her Department has used to assess need under the AEN factor; how many children receive increased funding from the ethnicity factor with the AEN; how much funding was distributed under the ethnicity factor to local councils in the years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02; and what her Department's estimate is for next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Under the current system of Education Standard Spending Assessments (SSA), extra resources are allocated to LEAs in recognition of the additional educational needs of children in minority ethnic groups on the basis of country of birth data taken from the 1991 national census. The number of children covered is 12 per cent. of the total population of children under the age of 16. The amount of funding distributed using this factor was #434 million in 2000&#150;01 and #448 million in 2001&#150;02. The amount of funding to be distributed for Additional Educational Needs for 2003&#150;04 will depend on decisions yet to be taken about the new formula for LEA funding to be introduced from April 2003. Those decisions will be informed by research undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a copy of

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 We believe that schools should be orderly and disciplined places of learning at all times. In that context it is right that teachers and headteachers should have the power to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom. This may mean excluding them from school, for a fixed period or permanently, while maintaining their education in alternative provision.
<P>

<a name="21022w18.html_para0">Since taking office the Government has devoted far greater resources than ever before to supporting teachers in dealing with disruptive behaviour in the classroom. There are now over 1,050 Learning Support Units in schools helping to tackle classroom disruption. Further expansion of our Excellence in Cities (EiC) and Excellence Clusters programmes will provide a further 140 Learning Support Units. The #66m package announced in the Budget will fund, among other things, more Learning Support Units, Behaviour and Education Support Teams and summer activities aimed at improving discipline.

 The allocation of funding to maintained schools by local education authorities is governed by regulations made under section 47 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The current (2002) regulations give wide discretion to authorities in the factors and criteria to be used for the funding of special needs, both in mainstream schools and in special schools. In November 2001, the Department issued good practice guidance <i>The Distribution of Resources to Support Inclusion</i>, on approaches to the delegation and distribution of resources for meeting the needs of pupils with special educational needs and those with other additional needs in mainstream schools. From 2003 onwards the schools forums established under s.43 of the Education Act 2002 will advise local education authorities on their funding arrangements for special needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 Inland Revenue has specialist enforcement teams based in Aberdeen and East Kilbride who are responsible for enforcing the national minimum wage in Scotland. The teams follow up complaints made by workers and third parties about non-compliance and use other Revenue risk based data to identify employers for enquiry. Since April 1999, the teams have conducted 1,910 inspections and recovered of over #660,000 in wage arrears for low paid workers in Scotland.

 The Government has said that it will complete an assessment of the five economic tests within two years of the start of this Parliament.

 The statistics in question relate to ''typical'' families in the UK. The impact of indirect taxes on a typical family are imprecise as spending patterns vary widely between households with the same composition and income level. We have no plans to introduce new indices of indirect taxation.

 Married women and widows married before 5 April 1977 could elect, if the election was made before 12 May 1977, to pay reduced rate National Insurance contributions. The reduced rate contributions they elected to pay only covered them for Industrial Injuries Benefits. They did not build up entitlement to other contributory benefits in their own right. However, these women may receive a basic state pension based on their husband's contribution record when he retires and claims his state retirement pension.

<P>

The Treasury was the first Government Department to have a web site and over the last eight years has developed and maintained a series of web sites. Complete start up and running costs for all Treasury related sites launched since 1994, including dormant and closed ones, could not be provided without incurring disproportionate cost.<P>

The Treasury's websites are hosted by commercial companies whose contracts are subject to regular review. Anticipated costs on hosting services over the next twelve months will be approximately #40,000 with another #50,000 spent on technical management and support. Information relating to the individual companies hosting the site could not be disclosed under Exemption 7 (Effective Management and Operation of the Public Services) of the <i>Code of Conduct on Access to Government Information</i>. The Treasury has not, to date, commissioned external companies to provide reports on its web sites.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned for, convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of insanity of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act since the date of its implementation to notify their local police of their names, addresses, dates of birth and intentions to travel abroad for eight days or longer. There is, however, no register of sex offenders, as such; nor are sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act separately identified as such in criminal statistics.
<P>

<a name="21022w23.html_para2">The Home Office has issued guidance to chief officers of police and probation in respect of their statutory duty under section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 to make arrangements for the assessment and management of the risk posed by dangerous offenders. The guidance requires information about the number of registered sex offenders in each police area to be published. A copy of the relevant annual report, which reveals there are 713 registered sex offenders in Hampshire, translating to a rate of 40 per one hundred thousand of the population can be obtained from the Hampshire police or Probation Services. Detailed Information requested is not available centrally.

<a name="21022w23.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will list the UK police forces which have a dedicated traffic enforcement division, how many officers there were in the divisions; and what these figures were as a percentage of the force strength; [73427]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the UK police forces which have disbanded their dedicated traffic divisions in the last 10 years;  [73428]
<P>
(3) what the budget for traffic enforcement was in each police force for the last 10 years; and what each figure was expressed as a percentage of the force budget. [73429]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="21022w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The two tables give the information readily available. Table 1 sets out for each police force in England and Wales in 2001&#150;02 the number of officers in traffic posts (''traffic police''). Traffic police are defined as ''staff who are predominantly employed on 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 223W</I><P>
motorcycles or in patrol vehicles for the policing of traffic and motorway related duties''. The definition does not include accident investigation, vehicle examination or radar duties. No records are kept centrally of which forces organise their traffic posts into dedicated traffic enforcement divisions or which forces have disbanded dedicated traffic enforcement divisions.
<P>

<a name="21022w23.html_para3">Table 2 sets out for each force in England and Wales the net cost of traffic and road safety for the past two years, showing each force's spend on these as a proportion of the force budget. The table shows that, over the two-year period, spend on traffic and road safety increased as a proportion of the force budget in a significant number of forces.
<P>

<a name="21022w23.html_para4">A thematic inspection report on road policing by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, published in 1998, identified an intelligence-led model for this activity, integrating traffic policing with other core activities and making more effective use of police resources. As forces increasingly adopt this approach, the number of dedicated traffic officers may reduce, but this does not necessarily reflect a lower level of enforcement. The increased use of cameras and other technology can allow a reduction in traffic officers whilst maintaining traffic targets/ enforcement levels. It also allows traffic officers to be appropriately targeted elsewhere. Reductions in the numbers of traffic officers, taken by themselves, can therefore be misleading.

<a name="21022w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The table gives details for each force area in England and Wales of the number of roadside checks undertaken, total Vehicle Inspectorate (VI) staff hours worked, hours lost by the VI owing to the lack of a police officer, and total police hours worked. Hours lost by the VI cover circumstances such as where police officers were called away at the time of the check to deal with local emergencies or where officers did not attend as arranged. Numbers of roadside checks where the police gave more than 24 hours' notice of cancellation or where a force could

not cover the desired number of checks because a senior police officer decided that the resources needed to go elsewhere are not recorded centrally.
<P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para0"><P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para1">Much of the increasing demand on the police is generated by the current provision that only an officer in uniform can stop vehicles for such purposes as roadworthiness and emissions tests. The police are not always in a position to supply officers to assist the VI in this way, and the Government recognise that police involvement in VI roadside checks may not be seen as the most effective use of police resources. Provisions in the Police Reform Act 2002 enable Community Support Officers and accredited persons to be given the power to stop and direct vehicles for specific purposes. These include for tests by the VI of vehicles' roadworthiness and compliance with construction and use regulations. The Act also removes the present restriction on traffic wardens' powers to stop, so that they can also undertake such functions. These measures will benefit the VI by enabling them to have a higher level of guaranteed service.

<P>
<a name="21022w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Home Office does not routinely publish monthly crime figures. Statistics collected by the Home Office and published on 14 October as part of the Street Crime Initiative show that street crime offences in the Metropolitan Police Area fell from 6,774 offences in the four weeks ending 30 January to 4,576 offences in the four weeks ending 28 August. This represents a reduction of 32 per cent. The definition of street crime is all robbery offences (commercial and personal) and snatch thefts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Parking offences are contained in a number of Acts including the Highways Act 1980, the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. Guidance about illegal parking is given in the Highway Code.
<P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para3">Enforcement of criminal parking offences is an operational matter for the police. The Road Traffic Act 1991 provided for the decriminalisation of most non-endorsable on-street parking offences and their enforcement by local authorities. Normally, where there is an infringement a local authority parking attendant would issue a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) to the transgressor. It is a matter for the local authority to

<a name="21022w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 Since the attacks of 11 September, the Government has conducted a wide ranging review of the United Kingdom counter terrorist procedures and infrastructure, including physical and legislative measures to disrupt, deter and prevent terrorist activity. The Civil Contingencies Committee, which I chair, has led the review working systematically through all government departments, the emergency services, local authorities and the Devolved Administrations. In this way we are in a position to get advice on issues that require central leadership or facilitation. The arrangements are revised and tested through exercises to encourage continual improvement of our response arrangements.
<P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para4">The Government's progress report ''The United Kingdom and the Campaign against International Terrorism'' published on 9 September, and placed in the Library, provides a summary of action taken to strengthen counter-terrorism measures within the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para5">An external assessment by the House of Commons Defence Committee, detailed in their sixth report of session 2001&#150;02 ''Defence and Security in the United Kingdom'', made further recommendations to which the Government are responding and which will help guide further work.
<P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para6">To further enhance the capacity at the centre of Government to co-ordinate security, intelligence and consequence management matters and deal with risks and major emergencies should they arise, Sir David Omand KCB was appointed as Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator and Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office in June this year.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State receives representations on a regular basis regarding capacity in prisons. These come from a wide variety of individuals and organisations.
<P>

<a name="21022w24.html_para8">Her Majesty's Prison Service has already started an emergency building programme to increase capacity by 2,320 places by March 2003. The programme includes building modular temporary units and ready to use units at existing prisons and the deferment of some wing

Data on initial decisions are independent of applications data, and do not all necessarily relate to applications lodged in the same period.
There are no data available on asylum appeals lodged by nationality. The requested information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.
In the first quarter (January to March) of 2002, an estimated 35 Iraqi principal asylum applicants were removed. This includes persons departing ''voluntarily'' after enforcement action had been initiated against them and persons leaving under Assisted Voluntary Return Programmes run by the International organisation for migration (IOM), and excludes dependants.
Data on removals by nationality in the second quarter of 2002 are not yet available. This information will be published on 29 November on the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration 1.html.

<a name="21022w25.html_para4">The routine use of Prison Service accommodation for immigration detainees ended at the beginning of this year, but it remains necessary to hold small numbers of detainees in prison for reasons of control and security.

 Asylum applicants are provided with help in a language that they understand at all stages of the asylum process. Interpreters are available free of charge for all dealings with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND).
<P>

<a name="21022w26.html_para0">When an asylum application is made at a port or in country at a Screening Unit, an interpreter will be provided to help the applicant through the screening process. Where an applicant is given a Statement of Evidence Form (SEF) to complete they are provided with explanatory notes both in English and one of 33 languages. The explanatory notes set out what is expected of the applicant and the possible consequences should they fail to comply with our requests. An interpreter will be provided for any substantive interview conducted with the applicant. The applicant will previously have been asked on the SEF or during the screening process to give details of the language and dialect in which they would prefer to be interviewed.
<P>

<a name="21022w26.html_para1">If an applicant is to be sent to the Oakington Reception Centre they will be given a leaflet, translated into 29 languages, which explains how their application will be considered. Interpreters are provided on site.

<P>
<a name="21022w26.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The latest available statistics on removals relate to 2001. These show that 48,155 persons (rounded to five) were removed from the United Kingdom under Immigration Act powers. This includes persons departing ''voluntary'' after being refused entry or after enforcement action had been initiated against them but excludes persons departing under the Assisted Voluntary Returns Programme run by the International Organisation for Migration.

<a name="21022w26.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary last met his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, on 26 September in Calais. Their discussions of measures to counter clandestine migration have concentrated for the most part on the Channel Tunnel and the port of Calais. However, the two Governments recognise that as the security of these two routes is tightened, clandestine illegal entrants may try to use other ports. On 26 September the two Ministers therefore discussed possibilities for extending UK Immigration Service presence to other French ports, as well as for posting of French officers to UK ports.

 An estimated 19 per cent. of applications received in 2001 were granted refugee status, i.e. were successful in their application to be granted refugee status under the 1951 UN Convention. It is estimated that a further 23 per cent. were granted Exceptional Leave to Remain (ELR). These estimates include the outcomes of reconsidered cases and outcomes of appeals at the Immigration Appellate Authority. Of applications received in 2000, an estimated 19 per cent. were granted refugee status and a further 14 per cent. were granted ELR.

 Forensic pathologists play a crucial role in the criminal justice system. Their principle function is the conduct of post-mortem examinations in cases of suspicious or sudden deaths to determine the cause and time of death. This information is critical to homicide investigations.

 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The following tables show the numbers of burglaries per 10,000 households for urban, rural and suburban areas, as measured by the British Crime Survey. There is no commonly agreed definition of rural areas. Results here use the Office for National Statistics (ONS) District Level Classification in order to provide the urban, suburban and rural breakdown. The ONS classification of areas was revised for authorities in 1999. The revision produced a different hierarchical structure hence there is little direct comparability with the results of the original classification. Therefore, it is not possible to give the figures for the most recent sweep of the British Crime Survey (BCS).

 On Thursday 17 October, I launched a consultation on the design of the equal pay questionnaire. The Employment Act 2002 provides a new power to introduce an equal pay questionnaire into the Equal Pay Act 1970. We are seeking views by 10 January 2003 on a draft questionnaire, with the aim of bringing it into effect, subject to Parliamentary approval, in April 2003. The questionnaire will help women who think they may not be receiving equal pay to request key information from their employers before deciding whether to bring a case. In some cases this could lead to resolving or settling a claim rather than taking the tribunal route.

<P>

<a name="21022w28.html_para12">The questionnaire is one of a raft of changes we are introducing to speed up and simplify equal pay cases; and it forms part of the Government's drive to close the pay gap between men and women. Also published on the Women and Equality Unit's website is a briefing paper ''Equal Pay and Pay Gap&#151;Update on Government Action''. This provides an update on Government action to narrow the pay gap and progress made following the Government's response to Denise Kingsmill's report on Women's Employment and Pay (December 2001).

 The existing formula used to allocate National Health Service resources has been reviewed by the advisory committee on resource allocation (ACRA).

ACRA does not conduct formal consultations. I cannot at this stage anticipate the outcome. Later this autumn when we announce the revenue allocations for the next three years we will explain changes to the formula.

 The Black advisory group was commissioned in 1983, by the then Minister of Health, to investigate reports of a high incidence of leukaemia occurring in young people living in the vicinity of the Sellafield nuclear site. In their report, Black 1984, the advisory group confirmed that there was a higher incidence of leukaemia in young people resident in the area. They also concluded that the estimated radiation dose from the Sellafield discharges and other sources, received by the local population, could not account for the observed leukaemia incidence on the basis of knowledge available at that time. The uncertainties in the available data led the advisory group to make recommendations for further research and investigation.
<P>

<a name="21022w33.html_para9">The committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment (COMARE) was established in November 1985 in response to the final recommendation of the report of the independent advisory group chaired by Sir Douglas Black. Its terms of reference are to

Delivering the NHS Plan, published in April 2002, provides the latest forecasts for growth in the National Health Service workforce. By 2008, we expect the NHS to have net increases over the September 2001 staff census of at least 15,000 consultants and GPs. We anticipate that international recruitment will contribute towards this figure and our international recruitment assumption for consultants and GPs is 1,000 by 2005.

We anticipate that by 2005, compared to 1999, up to 35,000 extra nurses may be working in the NHS, who have been trained overseas.

 Statutory responsibility for the provision of fire services rests locally with the fire authority. However, a fire authority may not reduce its establishment without the approval of the Secretary of State under section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947. Consent is only given when he is satisfied that the national standards of fire cover will be maintained. Fire authorities are inspected regularly by HM Fire Services Inspectorate as to the manner in which they are performing their functions.

An additional #200 million in PFI credit approvals has already been earmarked for the fire service, and a further #50 million in PFI credits will be made available to the service in both 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.

<a name="21022w36.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The number of London Lettings released by the operation of the scheme in recent years are listed in the table below. This represents a useful contribution to easing pressure on social housing in London.
<P>

<a name="21022w36.html_para14">The number of households rehoused under the Seaside and Country Homes Scheme by property size are as follows. Figures prior to 1996&#150;97 are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

<sup>(44)</sup> Bedroom standard is an indicator of occupation density. A notional number of bedrooms are allocated to each household in accordance with its age/sex/marital status composition and the relationship of the members to each other. This is then compared with the actual number of bedrooms (including bed-sitters) available for the sole use of the household.<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research he has commissioned into the Housing Health and Safety Rating System since July 2001; what the terms of reference are for that research; who is undertaking it; and when he expects it to be published. [74143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w36.html_spnew25"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We are currently running three research projects relating to the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). The first, which began in January 2001, is to develop the statistics to support the system, and is being carried out by Warwick University with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The second, which began in August 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 284W</I><P>
2001, is an evaluation project, by DTZ Pieda, to identify the practical lessons to be learned from the publication of Version 1 of HHSRS in July 2000. The third, which began in September 2001, is to produce the guidance needed to assist local authorities in the application of HHSRS specifically to houses in multiple occupation, and is being carried out by the Building Research Establishment. Reports on these projects are expected to be published by the end of this year. This work will inform the production of Version 2 of HHSRS, which we expect to commission in time for publication next autumn as part of a comprehensive package of guidance.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent assessment he has made of the size and type of accommodation suitable as an alternative to LA and RSL tenants underoccupying their current accommodation; and what measures he has taken to encourge LAs and RSLs in areas of high demand to ensure that this type of accommodation is included in new developments.  [74156]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w36.html_spnew26"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 No such assessment has been carried out by the Government. However, local authorities in their role as strategic housing authorities are required to assess the type of accommodation required in their areas. Local authorities may also require a proportion of affordable housing as part of new developments, often built by Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and funded by the Housing Corporation. RSLs must ensure that bids for capital investment in social housing fit with local authority and regional priorities and the Housing Corporation's National Investment Strategy.
<P>

<a name="21022w36.html_para21">Over the next 10 years, the Government will encourage councils and housing associations to set their rents to within 5 per cent. of the levels given by a national formula that reflects a property's size, location and condition. This will give tenants the choice over paying more for a larger property in a high cost area, or saving money by renting a smaller property.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w36.html_spnew27"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government have no immediate plans to replace the overcrowding standard. But they are considering the extent to which overcrowding can be tackled through a new health and safety enforcement regime for housing, based on the new health and safety rating system.

<a name="21022w36.html_para22">The Government intend to legislate to introduce the new enforcement regime as a replacement for the fitness standard when Parliamentary time allows.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not made a recent assessment of the impact of concierge security schemes on antisocial behaviour in local authority tower blocks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w37.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister, pursuant to the answer of 7 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 22W, on local authority capital receipts, concerning his intention to pool housing capital receipts from debt-free authorities <i>(a)</i> what proportion of the receipts will be pooled, <i>(b)</i> on what basis and to which other local authorities the money will be redistributed, <i>(c)</i> on what date this arrangement will be implemented; <i>(d)</i> how this arrangement will encourage existing debt-free authorities to remain so and others to become debt-free, <i>(e)</i> whether the new arrangements will apply to clawbacks from previous large scale voluntary transfers of council housing and <i>(f)</i> how these proposals will help those local authorities who have difficulties in providing additional affordable housing due to the high price of buildings.  [76525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Our consultation paper ''The Way Forward for Housing Capital Finance'', issued in August, sought views on the detailed mechanism of the capital receipts pooling regime. The consultation period ended last Friday and we will make a further announcement when we have considered the responses. As the then Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) said in her reply on 7 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, Hansard (col. 21&#150;22W) these changes will be introduced alongside the wider changes to the local authority capital finance system which required primary legislation; the timing of this is still to be decided.
<P>

<a name="21022w37.html_para0">The proposal is about sharing out funding for investment fairly among local housing authorities. The current arrangements for redistributing the spending power of capital receipts do not apply to all authorities. Debt-free authorities are exempt&#151;they retain all their capital receipts, and so finance substantially more investment from receipts than other authorities, regardless of their relative need to spend.
<P>

<a name="21022w37.html_para1">There is no good reason for this anomaly. Pooling will ensure that capital resources are better targeted, so that all housing authorities have the access they need to fund new affordable housing and bring their stock up to decent standard. Without this, either investment in housing by the most needy authorities would need to fall, or substantial increases in taxes would be necessary to make good the money that debt-free authorities retain.

<P>

 Planning policies for affordable housing are set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3, <i>Housing</i>, and in Circular 6/98, <i>Planning and Affordable Housing</i>. Local authorities are expected to plan to meet the housing requirements of the whole community, including those in need of affordable housing. To encourage mixed and balanced communities, local authorities should ensure that new housing developments help to secure a better social mix by avoiding the creation of large areas of housing of similar characteristics.

<P>

<a name="21022w37.html_para4">The Courts have also held that the Government's statements of planning policy are material considerations which must be taken into account, where relevant, in decisions on planning applications. These statements cannot make irrelevant any matter which is a material consideration in a particular case. But, where such statements indicate the weight that should be given to relevant considerations, decision-makers must have proper regard to them. If they elect not to follow relevant statements of the Government's planning policy, they must give clear and convincing reasons (E C Grandsen and Co Ltd <i>v</i> SSE and Gillingham BC 1985).
<P>

<a name="21022w37.html_para5">Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 (revised) (PPG8). PPG8 states that health considerations and public concern can in principle be material considerations in determining applications for planning permission and prior approval. Whether such matters are material in a particular case is ultimately a matter for the courts. It is for the decision-maker (usually the local planning authority) to determine what weight to attach to such considerations in any particular case.
<P>

<a name="21022w37.html_para6">However, it is the Government's firm view that the planning system is not the place for determining health safeguards. It remains central Government's responsibility to decide what measures are necessary to protect public health. In the Government's view, if a proposed mobile phone base station meets the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure it should not be necessary for a local planning authority, in processing an application for planning permission or prior approval, to consider further the health aspects and concerns about them.

 #146 million Starter Home Initiative funding was allocated in September 2001 to help 4,600 key workers in London into home ownership by March 2004. The key workers in London benefiting from the Initiative are primarily teachers, police and health workers; and also some social workers, care workers, transport workers and fire fighters. We are considering, as part of our long term programme of action for housing, how key workers can best be targeted for housing assistance beyond March 2004, and will make an announcement about this at the turn of the year.

 There is increased emphasis in the new PPG3 on securing well-designed residential environments, which offer housing opportunities for all in the community in the most sustainable way. Local authorities and developers are expected to think imaginatively about designs and layouts which make good use of previously developed land in urban areas without compromising the quality of the environment. In determining planning applications, local planning authorities should reject poor design.

<a name="21022w38.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The size of an individual constituency will depend on the total number of members of the assembly in each region. As set out in chapters 6 and 7 of the Regional Governance White Paper, an assembly would have between 25 and 35 members in total, mainly depending on its size of population, and around two-thirds of members would represent individual constituencies. The average population per constituency in the north-west would therefore be between around 290,000 (with 23 constituency members) and around 420,000 (with 16 constituency members).

<a name="21022w38.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nick Raynsford: </B> 
 The White Paper <i>Your Region, Your Choice</i> formally invited comments on stakeholder involvement with elected regional assemblies; the closing date for responses was 31 August 2002. But the White Paper also offered the opportunity for general views to be submitted&#151;there is no deadline for these views and comments are still being received.
<P>

<a name="21022w38.html_para1">To date, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received around 1,100 representations on the White Paper, of which around 200 offered comments on stakeholder involvement with elected assemblies
<P>

<a name="21022w38.html_para2">In addition, we have received around 1,500 postcards in support of the Cornish Constitutional Convention campaign for a referendum on establishing a Cornish Assembly.
<P>

<a name="21022w38.html_para3">We are currently undertaking detailed assessments of stakeholder responses, and of general responses to the White Paper. These will be published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website later in the year. We will then set out our further proposals on stakeholder involvement, taking into account views expressed in the consultation.
<P>

<a name="21022w38.html_para4">It remains the case that we intend to introduce a Bill to provide for referendums and associated local government reviews as soon as Parliamentary time allows, with the aim of enabling the first referendums to be held during this Parliament.

<a name="21022w38.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 A major consultation paper ''The Key to Easier Home Buying and Selling'' was published in December 1998. The consultation found wide-ranging support for the introduction of a seller's pack in England and Wales. We are committed to making it easier for people buying and selling homes through the introduction of a seller's pack, and the necessary legislation will be reintroduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows. Following discussions with representatives of consumers and the main professional and trade bodies, we intend to publish shortly two further consultation papers dealing with the detailed contents of the seller's pack and the application of the seller's pack in areas where property values and demand are very low.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what plans he has to abolish the local authority social housing grant and replace it with increased resources to the approved development programme to support the priorities of regional housing statements;  [76382]
<P>
<UL>(2) what proposals he has to convert the current local authority repayable loans to registered social landlords into one-off grants.  [76383]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w38.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The local authority social housing grant (LASHG) enables those local authorities with the necessary capital resources to make a loan to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) for new or improved social housing, which is then reimbursed by the Housing Corporation. It is a demand-led mechanism, with no link to relative need to spend.
<P>

<a name="21022w38.html_para6">We have been consulting on options for replacing this system with one that targets resources to areas with the greatest housing need. We have invited comments on two alternatives&#151;providing resources through the Approved Development Programme, or replacing LASHG with a regime in which local authorities make grants direct to RSLs.
<P>

<a name="21022w38.html_para7">The consultation period ended last Friday and we will make a further announcement when we have considered the responses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w39.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), which was responsible for building the Dome and running of the Millennium Experience, was allocated #628 million of National Lottery funds from the Millennium Commission for the Millennium Experience, which included the associated national programme of events across the UK as well as the Dome at Greenwich. NMEC is currently in solvent liquidation and it is expected that some #25 million of this grant facility will not be required.
<P>

<a name="21022w39.html_para2">Up to the end of July this year, English Partnerships (EP) had incurred a total cost of #21.4m. This includes, from 1 July 2001&#151;when EP took over the ownership of the Dome&#151;#3.3m for the management, maintenance and security of the Dome; #6.5m for decommissioning the contents of the Dome and its site in preparation for the future long term use; and #4.9m in connection with the sale process. It also includes #6.7m for the previous competition to find a long-term use for the Dome. All of these costs incurred by EP in relation to the Dome will be recovered from sale proceeds.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the effects of the change in property prices in Taunton since 1999; and if he will make a statement.  [74110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w39.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 According to the Department's Survey of Mortgage Lenders, house prices in south-west England rose by 31.8 per cent. during the three years 1999 to 2001. According to HM Land Registry figures the average price of residential property sold in Taunton Deane was #85,097 in 1999 and #109,530 in 2001.
<P>

<a name="21022w39.html_para3">Homeownership is affordable for most people. Homeowners are benefiting from low interest rates, low unemployment and robust income growth. For people purchasing a home in south-west England during 2001, total mortgage payments averaged 17.44 per cent. of their income. This compares to 28.42 per cent. of income in 1990, and is lower than 1999 (17.91 per cent.) and 2000 (19.43 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="21022w39.html_para4">However, we are well aware that there can be serious problems for many first time buyers in areas of high demand. We are committed to improving people's housing choices, and to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home. Our aim is to deliver new affordable housing where it is needed most, in more sustainable forms.

<a name="21022w39.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We have no evidence to suggest that personation will be a significant problem at local elections in May 2003, and have no plans to introduce any new specific measures to prevent personation.
<P>

<a name="21022w39.html_para5">In our prospectus, issued in September 2002, inviting councils to propose pilot voting schemes in the May 2003 local elections, we have made clear that such schemes would need to ensure that any new method of voting is at least as secure, if not more secure, than conventional electoral practices. The Electoral Commission will, as required by statute, be consulted before any pilot schemes are approved. The programme of pilots itself will be looking at new ways to incorporate specific measures to test security and fraud.

 Member states of the Council of Europe (CoE), including the UK, make no direct budgetary contribution to the Congress of local and Regional Authorities of Europe (CLRAE), which is a consultative body within the CoE consisting of local and regional elected representatives from each of the 44 member states. CLRAE is funded through the CoE's ordinary budget as provided by member states and as agreed by the CoE's Committee of Ministers.
<P>

<a name="21022w39.html_para6">CLRAE has a Regional and a Local Chamber, membership of which is on the basis of nomination by member states' governments according to the requirements of the CLRAE founding charter. The UK has 9 full and 9 substitute seats in each Chamber. The UK's nomination procedure provides for a balanced representation of local and regional interests; all UK appointees must hold an electoral mandate in a UK local authority, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, or the GLA.

Earlier this year the Government announced a new commitment to ensure that by March 2004 no family with children will be placed in B&B other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than 6 weeks. This was accompanied by changes in Housing Benefit subsidies to make leasing self-contained temporary accommodation more cost effective, and an additional #35 million to help local authorities find alternatives to B&B.<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para2">Under the homelessness legislation (Housing Act 1996), a person is ''statutorily homeless'' if they do not have accommodation which they have a legal right to live in, which is physically available to them and which it would be reasonable for them to continue to occupy.
<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para3">In March 2002, the Homelessness Directorate published a report ''More than a Roof'', which outlined the Government's new approach to tackling homelessness funded by #125 million over this year. The Homelessness Act 2002 will also bring about radical change in the way that central and local government, and all other partners, work together to tackle homelessness. For the first time ever, local authorities will be required to carry out a review and develop a strategy for their area that prevents homelessness and provides solutions for people who are, or who may become homeless.

 The Homelessness Directorate's report ''More than a roof'', sets out specific measures to tackle homelessness backed up by a #125 million investment over the next year. The Homelessness Directorate has provided a total of over #3.7 million to local authorities in rural areas over the next year to fund schemes such as mediation services for family and couples in relationship difficulties; additional support for women fleeing domestic violence; rent deposit guarantee schemes to help homeless people find housing in the private sector; court and landlord advice services to reduce evictions; and debt and welfare counselling to help people sustain their tenancies.

 The 2002 spending review settlement has provided an extra #1.4 billion for housing.

My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is giving careful consideration to the best use of this additional funding to deliver sustainable communities. My right hon.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister where responsibility will lie for <i>(a)</i> police, <i>(b)</i> waste disposal and <i>(c)</i> fire services in new unitary authorities.  [73354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21022w40.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Regional Governance White Paper, <i>Your Region, Your Choice</i>, published in May, sets out the Government's plans to establish unitary local authorities in place of existing county and district councils in those regions where people vote in a referendum for elected regional assemblies. In any region where the Government decides that a referendum 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2002 : Column 299W</I><P>
should take place, the Boundary Committee for England will carry out a review and recommend the best unitary arrangements for the two-tier parts of that region. A referendum will then be held to see whether people support the creation of an elected assembly. The new unitary arrangements will be implemented if&#151;but only if&#151;a majority of those voting in the referendum voted for an elected regional assembly.
<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para4">Where new unitary arrangements are introduced, we would expect that existing police authorities would remain in place. Appointments to these authorities would be made either by unitary districts or by the unitary county council, depending on the new unitary structure.
<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para5">There are currently combined fire authorities in former county areas which have only unitary local authorities; and also in areas where there are one or more unitaries, district councils and a county council. Where changes lead to district-based unitaries in future, we would expect there to be a combined fire authority, but where they lead to a unitary county with no existing or new district-based unitaries, we would expect the county council to remain responsible for providing fire services. This is without prejudice to our consideration of any recommendations on the organisation of the fire service that Professor Sir George Bain's recently announced review might make.
<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para6">Waste disposal is currently a responsibility of county councils and would become a responsibility of unitary authorities where these are established in future in regions that have an elected assembly.

 Information about turnout for those referendums which local authorities hold voluntarily is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. The average turnout in binding referendums which councils held between June 2001 and October 2002 on whether or not their area should have a directly elected mayor was 29 per cent., within a range of 10 per cent. to 64 per cent.

 The Government recognise that there is a shortage of affordable housing in many rural towns and villages. The need can be for both homes to rent and to buy.
<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para7">We expect all local authorities to develop housing strategies and to develop local housing need assessments as part of their long-term plans. We believe that judicious use of their planning powers can deliver more affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="21022w40.html_para8">By next year, we expect to deliver around 9,000 affordable homes annually in rural areas, including 3,000 in small settlements. Of these, a proportion will be for low-cost home ownership.
