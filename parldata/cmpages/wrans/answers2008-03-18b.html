<i> [holding answer 11 March 2008]:</i> &#145;The Path to Citizenship&#146; published on 20 February 2008, outlines the Government's plans for a third phase of migration reform. That is reform of the path to British citizenship to reinforce our shared values. The consultation concludes on 14 May 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="80318w0002.htm_para10"><a name="08031877000319">One of the proposals is to create a new fund to manage the transitional impact of migration, to which we will ask newcomers to contribute extra in payments to the public purse to help alleviate the transitional pressures we know migration can bring. The fund will allow us to release limited amounts of money quickly and responsively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="80318w0002.htm_para11"><a name="08031877000320">We would aim to raise tens of millions of pounds with the fund operating from April 2009. We will work closely across Government to develop a clear and transparent methodology for the appropriate surcharge, including who should pay them, once the consultation has closed.</p>

 Where the measures I have announced, to provide benefits for recreational bass fishing and for recreational sea angling in general, result in detailed proposals for legislation, a consultation accompanied by an impact assessment would need to be carried out. The impact assessment would include an assessment of the costs and benefits of any proposals in relation to individual anglers and to businesses dependent on angling. The Drew report, funded by DEFRA, into the economic impact of recreational sea angling in England and Wales provides some baseline data against which any improvements could be measured.</p>

 I met sea angling representatives at the Angling summit on 18 February where a number of concerns were raised with me regarding the introduction of a chargeable licence for sea angling. I have also discussed the issue direct with anglers around the coast, as have my officials.

<i> [holding answer 25 February 2008]:</i> Professor Brian Spratt&#146;s Independent Review of the safety of UK facilities handling foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus made 14 recommendations, all of which the Government accepted, agreed to or agreed to in principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="80318w0005.htm_para2"><a name="08031877000675">The recommendations in relation to immediate action on containment have all been addressed. Progress in implementing them is kept under close review through regular inspections by DEFRA and the Health and Safety Executive. In relation to the recommendations on further action on biosecurity and biosafety, the chief veterinary officer recently wrote to Merial and the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) to remind them of the importance of clarity of roles, responsibilities and effective communications. Once we received assurances that sufficient mechanisms were in place, and following progress in relation to the immediate actions on containment, Merial&#146;s licence to handle specified animal pathogens was restored on 25 February 2008. DEFRA officials continue to work closely with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate about inspections at Merial.</p>

I understand that the review is expected to report in April. At present, we do not believe that further work on identifying the source of the virus would add to our understanding of the measures that need to be put in place, but we will keep that assessment under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="80318w0005.htm_para4"><a name="08031877000677">In relation to the recommendation on the regulatory and inspection framework, Sir Bill Callaghan was requested to lead a review examining ways of simplifying and strengthening the regulatory framework for animal pathogens. The review reported on 13 December. In the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to the House in December, he accepted all the recommendations in this review and progress is being made in implementing these.</p>

The passes grant is based on &#163;4 for each pass in circulation at October 2007, uplifted by 20 per cent. to recognise that the new England-wide concession is likely to be more attractive than the existing one. &#163;31 million is not an annual cost as passes can remain in use for up to five years.

 The proposed Heysham to M6 Link Road has yet to receive programme entry.

 Following the introduction of the free off-peak local bus travel concession within local authority areas in April 2006, central Government provided an extra &#163;350 million in 2006-07 and &#163;367.5 million in 2007-08 (increasing annually) for statutory concessionary fares through the revenue support grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="80318w0007.htm_para0"><a name="08031877001143">The Department is now paying an additional special grant of &#163;212 million to travel concessionary authorities in 2008-09 (and rising thereafter) just to cover the cost of extending the statutory minimum bus concession to provide free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England. This additional amount is based on our assessment of the likely cost impact of the new concession, which is based on generous assumptions about pass take-up, fares and increased patronage. It is enough to fund around an extra 200 million bus journeys across England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="80318w0007.htm_para1"><a name="08031877001144">The money will be distributed by a special grant, in line with the wishes of local government itself, using a formula to direct to funding to areas likely to experience increased costs such as urban and tourist centres and coastal towns. The formula used is based on the most popular option with local authorities from our recent consultation on the issue. We are confident that sufficient total funding will be distributed to cover the additional cost of the new concession.</p>

Overall, the stock of VAT registered businesses in the UK has increased by 246 thousand (14 per cent.) between the start of 1999 and the start of 2007 and new registrations have exceeded de-registrations in each year.</p>

International evidence available from these types of service models is that they can prevent out-patient appointments and reduce hospital admissions.

without such prior qualifications. The policy will therefore promote both our objective of widening access to higher education and our progress towards the target that 40 per cent. of the working age population should have an HE qualification by 2020. It will enable us to support 20,000 more first-time or progressing students (in full-time equivalent terms) than would otherwise be possible, and create incentives for universities to reach out to the six million adults who currently have an A-level or equivalent qualification, but no HE experience.</p>

 The statutory responsibility to take investigations and enforcement actions rests with local authorities and their trading standards officers. It is an offence for a UK-based body to offer what could be taken to be UK degrees unless that body is recognised. In addition, local authorities can prosecute UK-based bodies illegally using the protected word "university" in the UK under Business Names regulations. The Trade Descriptions Act and misleading advertising regulations can also be employed in this context. However, the Department is actively assisting the Home Office, the Border and Immigration Agency and local authorities with a number of on-going investigations. Over the last five years, my Department (and its predecessors) has directly assisted local authorities in successful enforcement against 17 offending bodies with closure of 10 and prosecution of a further three. In addition, and since 1 January 2005, 256 colleges on the Department's Register of Education and Training Providers have been investigated by the Borders and Immigration Agency. Of these, 124 have been found to be in breach of the immigration rules, and therefore removed from the Register.</p>

 Abolishing interest on new student loans&#151;to English domiciled students in the UK and EU students studying in England&#151;would increase the long-term resource cost from around 27 per cent. of the face value of the loans to 39 per cent. That means that every &#163;100 lent to students, would cost the taxpayer &#163;12 more, resulting in extra expenditure of around &#163;700 million per year for maintenance and fee loans, once fee loans are in steady state. The estimated cost of abolishing interest for loans that have already been issued is &#163;2.0 billion. These costs are due to the extra interest rate subsidy that would be incurred under a zero interest rate. The terms of student loans are already generous with interest pegged to the rate of inflation so that, in real terms, borrowers repay no more than they borrowed. Abolishing interest would substantially increase the costs to Government and to the taxpayer of subsidising these loans and means that students would repay less in real terms than they had borrowed.</p>

 There are no formal criteria used by the EU Commission.

Friend on 29 February 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column 2024W, I remain strongly of the opinion that active engagement with Israel through the EU provides a valuable forum through which to continue to raise human rights concerns. In 2007 the EU-Israel human rights working group, established under the framework of the Association Agreement, provided the opportunity to discuss: inter alia minorities; respect for human rights including respect for religious freedom and belief; Israeli settlement expansion; administrative detention including individual cases; international humanitarian law; as well as questions related to the UN Human Rights Council; and thereby established a closer bilateral dialogue on these issues.</p>

We believe that justice is an essential part of a sustainable peace and it is vital that those responsible for the terrible crimes committed during the conflict in northern Uganda are held to account.

 The Ministry of Defence has held regular discussions with the Royal British Legion (RBL) since the launch of its "Honour the Covenant" campaign in September 2007, covering a wide range of issues affecting the nation's responsibilities to its armed forces. Since 1997, the RBL accepts the Government have made a number of improvements but would like to see more done. The Government have taken a number of important steps to ensure that the nation meets its responsibilities towards its armed forces, veterans and their families, including improvements to compensation, healthcare, accommodation, and welfare support. The forthcoming Cross-Government Command Paper will review the current position and set out such further improvements as may be appropriate.

 The UK Government are supportive of efforts to achieve gender equality and continue to work very closely with both the Women&#146;s National Commission and the Women&#146;s Budget Group on promoting gender equality within the UK. In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women&#146;s Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented. In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate departmental expenditure statistics by gender. The DCMS Equality Scheme 2007-10 sets out the action which the Department is taking to promote gender equality. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

 We have tough protections in place to protect playing fields and planning guidance is clear that no playing field needed by the local community should be lost. This is supported by the facts. In 2005-06 (the latest year for which we have figures) Sport England reported that 97 per cent. of all planning applications affecting playing fields represented either an improvement or no change to sporting provision.</p>

I am aware of concerns from some organisations that having a time limit acts as an incentive for developers to fence off playing field land from public use in the hope of gaining future planning permission. As such, I have asked Sport England to investigate and assess any issues surrounding the five year rule on consultation. Following this my officials and Sport England will be meeting their colleagues in Communities and Local Government shortly to discuss the issue.</p>

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has provided VisitBritain with funding of &#163;49.9 million in 2007-08 to promote Britain as an attractive place to visit. Within VisitBritain, VisitEngland promotes England to the domestic market. VisitBritain and VisitEngland are aware of the importance of the coast and seaside resorts to British tourism: for example, the &#145;English Rose&#146; TV campaign featured coastal scenes. Other campaigns (which are themed, rather than geographical) feature seaside resorts, such as &#145;Family Fun!&#146;, &#145;Rural Escapes&#146; and &#145;TasteEngland&#146;. A recent promotional supplement in <i> The Times</i> featured Holiday Parks on the coast.

 Under the Education Act 1996, local authorities have a duty, where necessary, to assess children's special educational needs (SEN) and draw up SEN statements. The Government provide statutory guidance in the SEN code of practice to help local authorities fulfil that duty. The Government expect every child who needs a statement to have their SEN met will receive one. Our SEN strategy &#145;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#146; set out a programme to improve SEN provision in schools with the result that more children can have their special educational needs met fully without requiring a statement. However, the Government have maintained parents' rights, under the Education Act 1996, to request a statutory assessment of their children's SEN, with a view to statements being drawn up, and to appeal refusals to assess and statement to the SEN and Disability Tribunal.</p>

 1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>
 2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 The current rules for local, Greater London Assembly and parliamentary elections specify (whether e-counting is used or not) that a candidate may require the returning officer to have the votes re-counted but that the returning officer may refuse to do so if in his opinion the request is unreasonable. At the GLA elections in May 2008, where e-counting equipment is to be used, the returning officer has been given the discretion to determine the extent to which any re-count involves manual or electronic counting. I have no plans to bring forward any specific proposals in regard to e-counting at this time but I will keep the issue under review.</p>
