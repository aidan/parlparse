 DEFRA officials have considered numerous reports on whether cephalopods experience pain and suffering, but the current scientific evidence is not clear-cut.

 The Department is continuing to hold constructive discussions about the project in Gloucestershire which, to the Department&#039;s knowledge, is keeping the beavers in captivity and is therefore not a re-introduction project.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what environmental impact assessment has been carried out into the process that converts vegetable oils into biodiesel of diesel quality.  [43911]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60130w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The most common process for converting vegetable oil into biodiesel is trans-esterification. This process is well known from years of use in the oleochemical sector. However, the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership will be looking at the specific environmental impacts of biodiesel processing as part of their work on developing draft environmental standards for biofuels. The impacts in terms of pollution to air, land and water are controlled by the Environment Agency. A pollution prevention control permit is required where biodiesel is being produced for own-use by six or more people or for commercial operations producing more than 5,000 litres a year. The processing of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and tallow is also subject to waste management controls. Various studies have assessed the greenhouse gas impact across the whole production process from raw material to finished biodiesel. UK-produced biodiesel typically gives greenhouse gas savings of around 55 per cent. compared to fossil diesel.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60130w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The current skin test for bovine tuberculosis is an effective test. It is the accepted standard laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of the disease in a cattle herd. Under EU law, the gamma-interferon diagnostic blood test may be used to supplement the skin test. It is considered marginally more sensitive than the skin test, but less specific. This means that it results in a higher probability of false positives. EU legislation allows for the gamma-interferon test to be used to pick up cases missed by the skin test, but not to overrule it.

 The UK Film Council provides financial assistance to film projects to help deliver a consistent flow of high quality and culturally significant films. All film projects are selected according to an assessment of their cultural and creative merits. Funding will generally be given only to projects that are wholly or substantially capable of certification as a &#039;British&#039; film. However, the UK Film Council is able to exercise discretion and may still elect to finance a film if there are other strong cultural reasons for doing so.

<a name="stpa_129">The Royal Armouries currently runs a programme called &#039;Memories&#039;, which records through DVD the reminiscences of veterans from the Second World War about the Department for weapons they either used or encountered during conflict. A DVD is currently on display in the main entrance to the Royal Armouries in Leeds, and 10 more Second World War veterans will be interviewed by the end of February. The project is in its early days and it is estimated that it will cost &#163;7,000 in 2005&#150;06, with plans for further development.

 The Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) was allocated to regeneration partnerships and funding by local authority area is not collected centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. 1,027 SRB schemes were successful under the six rounds of the SRB including thematic, pan or sub-regional schemes that each embraced several local authority areas. &#163;5.706 billion of SRB funding was allocated over the schemes&#039; lifetime of up to seven years. Details of the schemes have been made available in the Library of the House. These include an indication of their location (except for the thematic or pan-regional schemes) and region and their lifetime funding.
