<i> [holding answer 27 February 2007]:</i> Rail season ticket prices provide a discount on the cost of the daily peak return. This incentivises passengers to buy season tickets and benefit from the flexibility that they bring. For example, the standard class weekly season ticket from Oxford to London costs &#163;92.80, which is less than three times the &#163;39.30 cost of the daily peak return. Season ticket holders who work at home up to two days a week still save money over the cost of daily tickets. The Department is not currently reviewing this structure.</p>

 The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal operating authority with responsibility for managing flood risk in England and undertakes an annual National Flood Risk Assessment. The 2004 assessment (NaFRA 2004) identified 1.9 million domestic and commercial properties at risk of flooding in England, with 285,000 being at significant risk (defined as a probability of flooding in any one year greater than 1.3 per cent. or one in 75). NaFRA 2005 identified 2.1 million properties at risk of flooding with 517,000 being at significant risk. The results from NaFRA 2006 will be published shortly&#151;indicative results suggest a similar number of properties at risk of flooding, but a slightly lower number at significant risk compared to 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="70228w0003.htm_para0"><a name="07022856000487">This estimation is a complex process and, although techniques are developing rapidly from research to operational methodology, they are not yet able to track real annual changes in flood risk on the ground. Any changes between annual assessments are almost entirely due to changes in data and analysis techniques. An improvement in the 2005 assessment was that the number of houses in the &#145;no data&#146; category was significantly reduced from the 2004 assessment to less than 1 per cent. of the total. This inevitably added properties to each of the identified risk bands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="70228w0003.htm_para1"><a name="07022856000488">Funding for flood risk management has increased significantly in recent years and the Department remains on target to achieve the spending review 2004 target of improving the standard of protection for at least 100,000 households over the period 2005-06to 2007-08. The NaFRA estimates are one factor informing spend on flood risk management within the overall departmental funding allocation set in the 2004 spending review up to 2007-08.</p>

 Local authorities and internal drainage boards are currently forecasting to spend &#163;12.7 million of DEFRA grant on capital flood risk improvement projects in 2006-07. This excludes local authority spend on coast protection projects which also often provide significant benefits in terms of reducing flooding from the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="70228w0003.htm_para2"><a name="07022856000491">The original allocation of &#163;15.7 million has, therefore, been reduced by &#163;3 million which has been transferred to the Environment Agency&#146;s capital flood risk budget.

The review is looking at three main strands: doctrine (particularly the preparation of personnelfor all tasks and scenarios they may face); secondly, officer and non-commissioned officer training and performance; and the disciplinary system. The review will also examine issues surrounding recent and current investigations into individual training.

 The Military Managed Ward (MMW), located in the main body of Selly Oak hospital (which is the primary reception hospital for service casualties from operations overseas), reached initial operating capability just before Christmas 2006. It provides clinical care, by a combined team of military and civilian personnel, for military patients whose clinical condition allows for them to be nursed in this ward. There are military managers involved at every level on the MMW, with a Military Ward Manager responsible for all aspects of the military presence on the ward, whether staff or patient issues, and for liaising with appropriate authorities. The MMW Ward Manager is assisted by three Military Deputy Ward Managers who are responsible for the planning and delivery of patient care to both military and civilian patients, although they primarily focus on military activity.

Each military patient in the Birmingham area now has a named military nurse whom he or she can contact at any time on clinical and other issues, and a military nurse team member visits every military patient being treated at a Birmingham hospital three times a day. This is in addition to the work of the Defence Medical Welfare Service (now reinforced by the Army Welfare Service), who visit patients regularly, and each deployed task force provides military liaison officers on the ward.</p>

Among this age group, 27 per cent. of binge drinkers admitted that they had committed an offence in the past 12 months. The Home Office no longer uses the definition of binge drinking that was used in this report and now follows the Department of Health&#146;s guidelines.

Staff are notified of their retirement date between 6-12 months before their 65th birthday and are informed of their right to request to work past that date. Any such requests are considered carefully and, if refused, attract a right of appeal.

 The routine use of prisons to hold immigration detainees ended in January 2002. However, it was made clear that there would continue to be a need to hold small numbers of individual detainees in prison for reasons of security and control. That remains the case and may apply to both failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders. In addition, individual foreign nationals who have been convicted for criminal offences in the United Kingdom may be held in prison accommodation pending deportation or transfer to the immigration detention estate on release from their prison sentences.

IPS intentions in using biometrics to deliver the National Identity Scheme were set out in the Strategic Action Plan published in December 2006.

 Government funding for police authorities is chiefly allocated using a funding formula that provides an assessment of the relative need of each police force in England and Wales.

This revision incorporated more recent data from the 2001 census, changes in the structure of policing, and more up to date analysis of how the characteristics of different areas affects policing demands. To avoid large changes in grant resulting from this revision, each police authority was guaranteed an increase in formula grant of at least 3.1 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>

We have no record of the Director having made representations to the Home Office that the 12 year rule was an impediment to the operation of the Agency or affected performance against its published targets. The Government made a number of changes to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in the Serious Organised Crime Act 2005 in response to proposals from the Agency, although there was no proposal to amend the 12 year rule.

The UN World Food programme (WFP), which has been providing assistance to the camps since 1986, has raised concern over the nutritional status of the refugees. The UNHCR and WFP have been focusing on the 90,000 most vulnerable beneficiaries of aid. The WFP also reported a decline in contributions causing serious breaks in food distributions over the last six months. In response, the EU donated a further US$1.3 million to provide food aid to Western Saharan refugees at the end of January 2007, supported by the UK whose share of the contribution will be over US$200,000. Saharawi refugees started arriving in Algeria in 1976, and have been totally dependent on outside assistance for the past 30 years. Estimates vary as to the number of refugees. Algeria and the Polisario refuse to allow a census in the camps. They say they will do so once there is movement in the political process.</p>

But Dr. Larijani made clear to Dr. Solana that Iran was not prepared to do so and President Ahmadinejad also said publicly that Iran would not suspend enrichment. The E3+3 therefore decided that there was no choice but to seek measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter, targeted on Iran's sensitive nuclear and missile activities.

 Iran's nuclear programme is of serious concern. The nature of the programme, Iran's history of concealment, its failure to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its refusal to take essential confidence-building steps have added to international concerns that Iran's ambitions may not be, as it claims, entirely peaceful.</p>

They would enable Iran to develop the capability to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapons. Iran has produced small quantities of enriched uranium at its pilot fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, but is still some way from mastering the technology. Once it has done so, the time it would require to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon, should it go down that course, would depend on a variety of factors including the scale and efficiency of the centrifuge cascade being used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="70228w0015.htm_para4"><a name="07022856003047">It is imperative that Iran should take the steps required by the UN Security Council and the IAEA Board, including suspending fully all enrichment related and reprocessing activities.

We remain committed to a negotiated solution and continue to urge Iran to meet its obligations and return to talks on the basis of the generous proposals presented to Iran on 6 June 2006 by EU High Representative Javier Solana.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the <i> (a)</i> average and <i> (b)</i> longest period was between the date of an incident relating to health and safety and the date on which a health and safety prosecution was instituted in (i) magistrates' courts and (ii) Crown Courts in each of the last five years .

 The table shows, each of the years from 2000-01 to 2004-05, the time in days between the date that the Heath and Safety Executive (HSE) became aware of a health and safety incident and the date on which prosecution was approved and the proceedings were then instituted. The data comefrom cases, instituted by HSE&#146;s Field Operations Directorate, which were heard subsequently in magistrates' or Crown courts in each of these years. The range reflects the different circumstances of each case. Some may be relatively simple, whereas others can be very complicated, with complex technical issues, with a number of dutyholders to investigate, and with complex evidential and legal issues to be considered. Necessary and inevitable delays may arise in cases involving deaths, due to the necessity for the police and CPS to investigate and consider possible manslaughter charges, and for an inquest to be arranged and held, before any possible health and safety charges can be taken forward. These delays can be significant.</p>

This concluded that migrant workers are at no more risk than any other workers doing the same job. However, migrant workers tend to work in higher-risk sectors of the economy, Since the greatest risk factor for an accident at work is the job workers do, migrant workers as a group face disproportionately higher risks. HSE already targets its activity towards those at greatest risk, which will therefore target migrant workers working in high-risk sectors or occupations.</p>

 We recognise that not only does voluntary work make an invaluable contribution to society and local communities, but it can also help improve an individual&#146;s readiness for employment. As long as people continue to satisfy the rules of the benefit, volunteers receiving any benefits can continue to perform their voluntary activity for as many hours as they wish, without affecting their entitlement in any way. Last year we made changes to make it clear that volunteers could be provided with, or expenses for, meals taken away from home while engaged in voluntary work without their benefit being affected.</p>

However, there is an exception to this rule for people undertaking voluntary work. Volunteers must be willing and able to take up employment with one weeks notice and to attend a job interview within 48 hours. These arrangements allow volunteers to continue to receive benefits while being engaged in voluntary work. Voluntary work is also treated as one of the steps a jobseeker must take to look for work where that improves their chance of securing work.</p>

2. Malta, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the European Union and therefore became part of the European Economic Area in May 2004. Winter fuel payments could be paid to eligible former UK residents living in these countries from winter 2004-05.<br>
3. Pensioners living overseas were first paid in winter 2002-03, these payments included any arrears due for earlier winters. It is not possible to give a separate breakdown of these earlier years.<br>

In such cases, patients would then be moved to a suitable bed, in either a single sex bed or single sex bay, as soon as practically possible.</p>

 The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 provide an exemption from challenge on age discrimination grounds for employers making redundancy payments under the statutory redundancy scheme, or those who have more generous individual schemes which nevertheless mirror the structure of the statutory scheme. If employers had age discriminatory individual redundancy schemes which did not come within these exemptions, they should either have made the necessary amendments to their schemes or stand ready to justify them in the event of legal challenge. In the period since the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations came into force, we have met the Employers Forum on Age, the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation to discuss this subject.</p>

This makes it more successful than the previous mechanism, the non fossil fuels obligation, under which the proportion of renewables rose from 0.2 per cent. of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent. in 2002. We wish to build on this success with an approach that increases the deployment of renewable generation, maintains investor confidence and increases value for money for the customer.</p>

 Customer reviews are a normal part of the PAYE process. They are needed where either an incorrect amount of tax has been paid or where there are inconsistencies on the record. Such inconsistencies often arise as a result of changes in a taxpayers circumstances such as moving jobs from one employer to another.

<p><a name="stpa_563"><a name="70228w0025.htm_para4"><a name="07022880001246">The latest estimate of the balance of the National Insurance Fund at 31 March 2012, taking into account the changes proposed in the Pensions Bill is &#163;74,124 million. This is projected to be 91.8 per cent. of expenditure made on national insurance benefits in the financial year 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_564"><a name="70228w0025.htm_para5"><a name="07022880001247">The surplus in the NIF is available to finance general public spending and is invested in Government securities. Any surplus of income over expenditure in the NIF is used to buy gilts. This reduces the Government&#146;s need to borrow elsewhere. But itmeans that the surplus is already taken into accountin financing Government spending. Any increase in benefits, which reduced the surplus, would result in increased Government borrowing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_565"><a name="70228w0025.htm_para6"><a name="07022880001248">The Government Actuary&#146;s Department will make a full assessment of the impact of the Pensions Bill on the National Insurance Fund in their Quinquennial Review of the National Insurance Fund to be published later this year.</p>

 The National Burn Care Group (NBCG) has been carrying forward the recommendations of the burn care review.

 The Secretary of State has had no recent discussions regarding aspects of the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004. As part of the new deal for carers, the Department has committed to developing the Prime Minister&#146;s 1999 Strategy for Carers. An inter-departmental group, whose members will include the three national carers&#146; organisations, is being formed to focus on this work which is likely to include consideration of carers&#146; access to learning and leisure opportunities. As the work develops, other key stakeholders will be involved and consulted.</p>
