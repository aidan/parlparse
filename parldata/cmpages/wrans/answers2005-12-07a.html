In September 2005, the UK hosted the third and final Replenishment conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, chaired by UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. The Secretary of State confirmed that the UK is doubling support for the global fund in 2006 and 2007 to &#163;100 million in each of these two years. The UK&#039;s pledge amounted to 10 per cent. of the US $3.7 billion pledged to the global fund for the two-year period by international donor. The amount pledged by 29 donors represents more than half of the global fund&#039;s total resource needs for the two-year period.

<a name="stpa_7">The global fund conference also addressed the context within which the global fund operates. These discussions built on the &#039;Three Ones&#039; principles and the UK co-hosted &#039;Making the Money Work&#039; meeting, which had established a global task team (GTT) to improve AIDS co-ordination among multilateral and international donors. As a result of the GTT, the UK expects significant improvements in how the UN and international donors such as the global fund work together to support countries develop and lead effective responses to AIDS. To support this work, the UK doubled our contributions to UNAIDS for the next two years.

The statement backs efforts to give people around the world better access to condoms and effective information. It advocates a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to HIV prevention including sexual and reproductive health information and services, harm reduction programmes for injecting drug users and reliable access to sexual reproductive health commodities.

<a name="stpa_9">For World AIDS day, the UK also published a cross-governmental briefing paper on harm reduction: &quot;Tackling drug use and HIV in the developing world&quot;.

This re-affirms the UK&#039;s long-standing commitment to developing new prevention technologies, and brings our total investment in mircobicides to over &#163;50 million.

 Afghanistan has made remarkable progress over the last four years and with strong commitment from the Government of Afghanistan and the international community has moved away from a predominantly humanitarian situation. To date 3.5 million refugees have returned home, the number of functioning health clinics has increased by 60 per cent., and over 5 million children are now in school. Many Afghans however remain vulnerable. During the winter in particular many suffer the effects of nature, lacking basic elements of protection. The Government of Afghanistan have begun contingency planning and drawn up a work plan to help minimize the impact of this winter upon the most vulnerable through the provision of basic relief supplies. In line with Afghanistan&#039;s needs, DFID&#039;s support has evolved from

 The UK Government are committed to the development of an open and rules-based international trading system that fulfils its potential to contribute to the reduction of poverty in poorer countries. Our key policy commitments on trade and development, as well as our objectives for the current Round of multilateral trade talks, are set out in the Government&#039;s White Papers, Making Globalisation a Force for Good (July 2004) and Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor (December 2000). The UK Government are working hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements.
</p>

<a name="51207w03.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_26">The UK Government do not support forced liberalisation or unfettered free trade but trade that is fair as well as free. The UK Government supports the view that developing countries need to decide on the timing, pace and sequencing of any market opening in line with their own national development and poverty reduction plans. In the context of the WTO negotiations we are firmly committed to ensuring that developing countries are given appropriate flexibility to adjust to trade reforms.

<a name="stpa_27">In the longterm, the removal of trade barriers, if managed properly, can help developing countries gain better access to developed country markets and more competitively priced inputs. By increasing Aid for Trade, (AFT) the UK hopes to help poorer countries seize the opportunities presented by more open markets. DFID will treble its support to &#163;100 million a year by 2010 to help boost poor countries&#039; capacity to trade. This shows the UK re-affirming the commitment at the G8 summit to help developing countries trade their way out of poverty.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions he has had with his G8 colleagues about funding for the Global Fund since the London conference on 5 and 6 September 2005, what assessment he has made about the level of money pledged to the Global Funds as a result of the London conference; what firm pledges have been received from donor countries to the Global Fund who were unable to make commitments at the London conference; and if he will make a statement on the UK&#039;s commitment to the Global Fund.

meetings, to ensure that the Gleneagles commitment to the Global Fund is met. We will also re-double our efforts to make Global Fund resources work better and demonstrate good results. This is crucial if the Global Fund is to widen its funding base and achieve the longer term sustainability it needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51207w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_29">At the London conference, donors pledged US$ 3.7 billion for the two-year period 2006&#150;2007, more than half the estimated US $7 billion needed to replenish the Global Fund for this period. This is a significant achievement which has enabled all existing Global Fund projects to continue plus provided funding for a small number of new projects. The Replenishment conference also focused on improving the Global Fund performance at global and country level. To make the Global Fund&#039;s money work effectively, the UK also pledged at the Replenishment conference, to double our contribution to the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) from &#163;8 million to &#163;16 million for the financial year 2005&#150;6. Replenishment of the Global Fund is an on-going process. A follow-up Conference will be held in June 2006 to secure additional pledges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51207w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_30">Donors who were unable to make pledges at the London conference (due to their funding cycles) included Canada, the US and the EC. Since the conference, Canada announced a firm pledge of Can$ 250 million (around US$ 213 million) (this was included in the US$ 3.7 billion pledging figure). The US House and Senate Conference Committee have now approved US$ 450 million for the Global Fund for 2006. This is US$150 million more than was anticipated in London. In addition, the US may appropriate more through the forthcoming Health and Human Services Bill. The European Commission&#039;s 2006 budget is still being finalised and the Financial Perspectives governing the budget from 2007 are yet to be agreed. Currently the European Union (including the Commission and members states) has pledged almost 60 per cent. of the commitments made at the conference to the Global Fund&#039;s finances for 2006 and 2007.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51207w04.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_31">At the Replenishment Conference, the UK doubled its funding to the Global Fund from &#163;51 million for 2006 and &#163;51 million in 2007, to &#163;100 million for 2006 and &#163;100 million for 2007. Our contribution amounted to some 10 per cent. of the total US$3.7 billion pledged. Overall the UK has pledged 359 million (US$ 640 million) to the Global Fund over seven years (2002&#150;08). DFID will continue to encourage donors to do as much as they can to substantially increase their contributions to the Global Fund.

on studies from the World Bank, the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that suggest substantial gains for developing countries resulting from developed country liberalisation of agricultural and industrial trade. Of course, the level of gains for developing countries depends on the level of reform in developed country agriculture policies and liberalisation efforts undertaken by developing countries themselves. If the current round of trade talks are really to deliver their Development objectives, then clearly, as the Prime Minister has said, all sides need to move further and allow poor countries to trade their way out of poverty.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the increase in UK passengers using no-frills carriers has been since 1998.  [35240]</p>




<p><a name="st_116"><a name="51207w14.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 Airlines commonly referred to as no-frills carriers include Ryanair, easyJet, bmibaby, Jet2, MyTravelLite, Thomsonfly and flyGlobespan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51207w14.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">In 1998 the total number of passengers using the no-frills carriers listed above (together with Debonair, which ceased operations in 1999) at UK airports was 7.7 million. This had risen to 53.4 million by the end of 2004. The number of UK based passengers travelling on these carriers rose from 4.4 million in 1998 to 37.9 million in 2004.

<p><a name="qn_117"><a name="51207w14.html_wqn3"><b> John Hemming: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the change in United Kingdom passenger numbers in <i>(a)</i> 2010, <i>(b)</i> 2020 and <i>(c)</i> 2030 if air fares were to remain constant in real terms compared with 2005.  [35242]</p>




<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51207w14.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The only estimate that has been made was an illustrative sensitivity test included in Air Traffic Forecasts for the United Kingdom produced by DfT in 2000. This considered the impact of fares remaining constant in real terms throughout the 1998&#150;2020 period in place of the central assumption of a 1 per cent. annual decline. This sensitivity test showed that passenger traffic at UK airports in 2020 would fall from the central forecast of 401 million to 301 million. However, this was based on the very simple assumption that a 10 per cent. rise in fares would lead to a 10 per cent. fall in demand. In practice, rising real incomes at home and overseas are likely to have a substantial positive impact on the demand for air travel.
</p>





<p><a name="qn_118"><a name="51207w14.html_wqn4"><b> John Hemming: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the annual reduction in air fares has been in the UK since 2000 for the <i>(a)</i> business, <i>(b)</i> leisure and <i>(c)</i> no-frills carrier sectors; and what assessment he has made of these figures in relation to the forecast assumptions contained in the Air Transport White Paper.  [35243]</p>




<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51207w14.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The average fare paid on international no frills flights has dropped by 16 per cent. over the 2000&#150;04 period. Other international leisure fares (excluding those included as part of a holiday package) have only fallen by 2 per cent. Average fares paid by international business passengers have fallen by 20 per cent. between 2000 and 2004, but this in part reflects the relative weakness of the long haul sector after 2000, and reduced use of premium cabins by business passengers on short haul flights. The headline reduction in fares in the national forecasts supporting the White Paper was on average a 1 per cent. fall per annum in real terms over the period 1998&#150;2020.

 HM Revenue and Customs does not collect data on VAT from individual goods and services. Supplies of demolition services are standard-rated for VAT. However, where demolition services are provided as part of a single supply contract for the construction of new zero-rated buildings and are supplied immediately before construction starts, the liability of the entire supply contract (including the demolition services) follows that of the zero-rated buildings. VAT charged in relation to demolition on most commercial developments will be reclaimed.

 A reduced rate of duty for biodiesel was introduced in July 2002 in recognition of its environmental benefits and its higher production costs than conventional diesel. Fuel produced from vegetable oil is eligible for this lower rate (currently 27.10 pence per litre) if it meets the legal definition of biodiesel for tax purposes set out in section 2AA of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps her Department plans to take in response to the recent report by the Higher Education Funding Council for England that ethnic minority candidates face a significantly lower chance of receiving an offer to study law.  [34928]</p>




<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51207w20.html_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The report &quot;Higher Education Admissions: Assessment of the Bias&quot;, by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) re-works a previous study from 2002 (based on 1996/07 data) that found that applicants from ethnic minorities were disadvantaged. It is good news that the re-examination of the data does not show the same biases in HE admissions as suggested by the original research. HEFCE did however find that ethnic minority applicants had lower chances of receiving an offer when applying to study law than would be expected given their predicted grades and other factors. A certain amount of caution needs to be attached to these findings, due to the age and other inadequacies of the data. It is important to look at what has happened more recently, and HEFCE&#039;s proposals for more research in this area will do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51207w20.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_168">It is not acceptable for any bias to be found for any subject or minority group. While admissions are the sole responsibility of institutions, the Government do have a legitimate interest in the fairness of the admissions process. That is why Professor Steven Schwartz was invited to lead an independent review of the HE admissions system. That review found that admissions processes are generally fair but established a number of underpinning principles that the sector has been encouraged to adopt. The Department, as requested by Professor Schwartz, plans to undertake a follow-up review of progress in 2007/08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51207w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_169">Institutions must not be complacent and must strive to eradicate biases as they develop their fair admissions policies and practices. Research such as this and the follow-up work that HEFCE is recommending will help institutions address the problems identified.

 The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) provides a route out of crime and into treatment for drug misusing offenders, using their contact with the Criminal Justice System as an opportunity to engage them in treatment and support. The intensive elements of the programme, which include testing for class A drugs on charge for certain trigger offences, are operational in 97 basic command units (BCUs) (67 Drug Action Teams) within England and three drug/alcohol partnerships in Wales. Other key elements of DIP are delivered in all areas of England and are being rolled out in Wales.

<a name="stpa_203">The intensive areas are listed in table 1. Since the programme began, over 31,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP. Latest figures show that over 2,000 DIP clients entered treatment in October 2005 and that the programme is on course to achieving the target of 1,000 offenders per week entering treatment by March 2008.

<a name="stpa_204">From 1 December, the police in Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire police force areas, are able to test for class A drugs on arrest for certain trigger offences as an alternative to on charge for those who test positive and require them to attend an assessment with a drug worker. These new powers will be expanded further on 31 March 2006. Acquisitive crime&#151;to which drug related crime makes a substantial contribution&#151;is going down and fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005.

Notes:<br>

1. A winding up scheme is one which has notified the Pensions Regulator that it has commenced winding up procedures.<br>

2. Schemes are required to notify the Pensions Regulator of changes in scheme status as soon as is reasonably practical. This means that the data for the year ended 31 March 2005 is provisional.<br>

3. The figures are based on information held on the register as at 14 October 2005. The effective date for the commencement of wind up is based on the last scheme status change date.<br>

4. Total membership includes active, deferred and pensioner members. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of these numbers.<br>

5. During 2005&#150;06 the Pensions Regulator will continue with its plans to issue all occupational pension schemes that are registered in the UK a scheme return form. This will provide the Pension Regulator with access to enhanced data on schemes that are in the process of winding up in future years.<br>
