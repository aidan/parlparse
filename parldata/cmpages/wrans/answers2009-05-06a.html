Grade 1 land is that with very minor or no physical limitations to agricultural use. Yields are consistently high on these soils and cropping highly flexible since most crops can be grown including the more exacting horticultural crops. Grade 2 land has some minor limitations which exclude it from Grade 1. A wide range of agricultural and horticultural crops can usually be grown though there may be restrictions in the range of horticultural crops and arable root crops on some types in this grade.<br>

 There are no specific rules governing the holding of events funded from the trade union political levy on the parliamentary estate; but the general rule is that facilities provided by the House for accredited trade union representatives are not available for party political activity or political campaigning, whether or not it has been funded from the political levy. Similarly, as a general principle, office space and facilities for Members are provided to help carry out parliamentary duties effectively and not for unrelated party purposes. The rules governing the purposes for which Members may use committee, conference, meeting and interview rooms are provided on the parliamentary intranet.</p>

* Date episode ended<br>
This field contains the date on which a patient left the care of a particular consultant, for one of the following reasons: Discharged from hospital (includes transfers) or moved to the care of another consultant.<br>
ICD-10 Code used for alcohol intoxication<br>
F10.1 - Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of Alcohol: Acute Intoxication<br>
<i> Alcohol-Related Admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment the Food Standards Agency has made of the likely effects on manufacturers and retailers of nutritional supplements of the provisions of Article <i> (a)</i> 13.3 and <i> (b)</i> 16.1, 17.1 and 18.4 of the EU Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation in relation to the role of the European Food Safety Authority.

 The regulation has transition periods to allow food business operators to respond to the effect of decisions on the authorisation of health claims, such as the need to re-label if claims are not authorised. Any delays in completing the process set out in the provisions to these articles could affect the ability of food business operators to respond to new conditions on products within normal re-labelling cycles and additional costs could occur. This possible outcome was discussed in the impact assessment the Food Standards Agency finalised in July 2007.</p>

 The Health Protection Agency (HPA) advises the Government in relation to the protection of communities from radiation hazards, including those associated with exposure to non-ionising radiation such as the radio waves from wireless communication systems.

general population. On the basis of current knowledge and experience, exposures are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones and well within the internationally accepted guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The Agency also considers it sensible, as with any new technology, to adopt a precautionary approach, and keeps the situation under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="90506w0010.htm_para0"><a name="090506104000734">HPA announced in October 2007 that it was to carry out a systematic programme of research into wireless local area networks (WLANs) and their use. At the same time HPA stressed that it had good reasons to expect the results from this research to be reassuring and that there is no reason why schools and others should not use wireless fidelity (WiFi) equipment. This work is ongoing and expected to be complete in 2010. It includes assessments of exposures around selected items of WiFi equipment through measurements and computer modelling and is part of the Agency's ongoing programme of work in the area of electromagnetic fields. Details can be seen on the HPA web site at:</p>

Its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising radiation (AGNIR) also prepares reviews of the evidence for health effects. The most recent AGNIR review of health effects in relation to radio waves was published in 2003 (see Documents of the NRPB, volume 14, number 2) and this is also available on the HPA website. AGNIR is about to prepare another review of the health effects of radio wave exposures and this is expected to take two to three years to complete.</p>

 Funding is provided to the forums by Communities and Local Government for them to take forward the regional strand of the inter faith framework, &#147;Face-to-Face and Side-by-Side&#148;.

However we are aware that in some circumstances they may fund third party organisations to support the wider regional implementation of the inter faith framework.

 It has been our policy for some time that smoke alarms have a vital role to play in saving lives as they provide the vital early warning of fire and therefore help people to escape. Since 1987, the Government have conducted high profile national and regional television campaigns promoting smoke alarms which have proved very successful. Ownership has increased from 9 per cent. in 1987 to the current level of 80 per cent. and we are seeking to raise it further as evidence suggests that those without alarms are often in those groups who are most at risk from fire. The Government are committed to running further smoke alarms ownership and maintenance campaigns as part of this years programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"><a name="90506w0019.htm_para17"><a name="09050710000639">Furthermore, in 2004, Communities and Local Government invested &#163;25 million pump priming capital over four years in the Home Fire Risk Check initiative. This funding resulted in just under 2 million Home Fire Safety Checks by fire and rescue services in England, installing over 2.4 million smoke alarms. Research into the impact of the Home Fire Risk Check initiative demonstrates it was responsible for 57 per cent. of the fall in accidental dwelling fire deaths. The research also concluded that the Home Fire Risk Check grant was responsible for 13,670 fewer fires and 888 fewer non-fatal casualties. The value placed on these figures showed a total benefit of &#163;926 million to &#163;1,943 million to the economy.</p>

 No specific assessment has been made on the effect on antisocial behaviour of levels of sales of alcohol from off-licenses, however the Government are aware that alcohol is a factor in some instances of antisocial behaviour and a number of actions have been taken to address the issue. These include the provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill which will introduce a mandatory code for all alcohol retailers, and will give licensing authorities new powers to clamp down on specific problems in their areas. We have also given &#163;3 million to Crime and Disorder Reduction partnerships (CDRPs) in order to undertake multi-agency enforcement activities on specific alcohol-related problems. We have made available a further &#163;1.5 million to our top 50 priority areas which have the highest levels of alcohol-related crime and disorder and public concern about drunk or rowdy behaviour. This money has been used to tackle under age sales, to confiscate alcohol from under 18s and to run communications campaigns to tell local people what action is being taken in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"><a name="90506w0022.htm_para5"><a name="09050718000108">A number of antisocial behaviour tools and powers are also available which include written warnings, home visits, Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, Parenting Orders/Contracts, Crack house and premises closure orders, antisocial behaviour orders and dispersal zones. We have recently just finished a series of 13 regional Alcohol Enforcement Skills Development training workshops for front-line practitioners covering the use of these tools and powers and those available under the Licensing Act. In addition, we are legislating to improve these powers, including increasing the fine for anyone not obeying an instruction to stop drinking in a Designated Public Place Order (DPPO) area, making it easier for the Police to disperse antisocial drinkers, and introducing a new offence of persistent underage possession. We are also encouraging wider use of Acceptable Behaviour Contracts and have recently extended the alcohol arrest referral pilots to include under 18s. We are working across Government to take these actions forward.</p>

 There has not been a race impact study conducted as the UK Border Agency does not remove children who are British citizens.

Some data on whether those on the NDNAD have convictions are available from the Police National Computer (PNC), but not as part of its routine functions and not within the cost limit for parliamentary questions. However, the National Policing Improvement Agency does periodically obtain information on the number of people on the NDNAD who do not currently have a conviction recorded on PNC.</p>

However, this figure includes those who have been convicted and their records deleted, and those where proceedings are still ongoing, as well as those who have never been convicted. It would be possible to break this figure down by police force area only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 From 2001, and following the anthrax incidents in the United States of America, the United Kingdom&#146;s Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Resilience programme has provided the framework for comprehensive planning and preparation for dealing with the possible consequences of a CBRN attack. In addition, the Government&#146;s wider Counter Terrorism Strategy (CONTEST) deals, among other things, with all aspects of protection to the public, including security advice to the private sector. While for security reasons it would be inappropriate to detail all aspects of such planning, the Government&#146;s approach is to prevent terrorists from obtaining or using hazardous materials; to put in place safeguards to protect the public, public places or critical national infrastructure from such attacks; and to ensure that measures are in place to reduce the impact of any such attack should it occur. The Health and Safety Executive has, for example, produced guidance on &#147;Biological/Chemical Threats by Post&#148; and general advice to businesses is provided by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 April 2009]:</i> The Government are fully committed to safeguarding vulnerable children and I am clear that it is important we secure the right level of support for these children within the family justice system. Officials from the Department, the Legal Services Commission (LSC), the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) have already had discussions about how to achieve this.

The European Social Fund (ESF) has already been used to invest in Jobcentre Plus, its Rapid Response Service and Train to Gain, the combination of which have already proved to be effective in helping workers and areas affected by restructuring.

Information for parliamentary questions is usually obtained from the Jobcentre Plus management information portal. This does not contain the level of data requested and therefore data has been taken from an alternative source known as Dataview, extracted from resource management (RM). In a minority of cases it has not been possible to identify the region or district that an individual works in. This is due to the data not being available in RM.<br>
