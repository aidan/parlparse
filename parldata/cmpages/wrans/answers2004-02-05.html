<P>
<a name="40205w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In accordance with Section 91 of the Police Act 1997, I have agreed to re-appoint Sir John MacDermott as Surveillance Commissioner for Northern Ireland with effect from 1&nbsp;October 2003 to 30&nbsp;September 2004. The remit of each Surveillance Commissioner covers the whole of the United Kingdom so that any Surveillance Commissioner can act in jurisdictions other than his own.
<P>

<a name="40205w01.html_para1">The right hon. Sir John MacDermott has served as a Surveillance Commissioner since 1998.
<P>

<a name="40205w01.html_para2">The Commissioners are appointed under the provisions of Part III of the Police Act 1997. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 extended the Commissioners' remit. Since the authorisation of intrusive surveillance operations forms a key component of the Government's response to serious and organised crime, I attach considerable importance to these appointments and I am delighted that Sir John has accepted his re-appointment. In conjunction with Sir Andrew Leggatt, their substantial judicial experience, particularly of the criminal justice system, will provide independent oversight of surveillance operations, which although operationally important, must also be subject to stringent safeguards.

<sup>(2)</sup> For the years 1980&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are as follows:<P>

<P>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<P>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<P>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<P>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<P>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<P>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol.<P>

For the years 2001&#150;2002 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<P>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<P>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<P>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<P>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<P>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<P>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol.<P>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<P>

<a name="40205w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what changes have been made to the Barnett Formula with regard to the updating of population statistics; and when he expects the Barnett Formula to equalise spending per head between England and Scotland.  [151762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Barnett formula is updated periodically to take account of population estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics. As set out in the Statement of Funding Policy, the latest mid-year estimates are used; the ONS published mid-year estimates for 2002 in September 2003. Spending plans for Scotland were published in the "2002 Spending Review: New Public Spending Plans 2003&#150;06" (Cm 5570, July 2002) and plans for the 2004 spending review period will be published later this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will publish for each year from 1998&#150;99 to 2005&#150;06 a table showing the levels of expenditure in England comparable to that expenditure in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Northern Ireland, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Scotland and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;Wales that is both within the assigned budget and within the scope of the Barnett formula, at the same level of programme detail as is provided in the analysis of 2002&#150;03 provision in Annex C of the third edition of Funding the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly: A Statement of Funding Policy.  [152446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Barnett formula is used to determine increases in spending of the devolved Administrations, rather than the previous levels of spending in England or the devolved Administrations. Information on subprogrammes for earlier years was published in Annex C of the first and second editions of the Statement of Funding Policy in 1999 and 2000.

<P>
<a name="40205w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) how many and what proportion of claims for the child care tax credit have been subject to follow-up checks in each year since its introduction to establish whether the child or children are being cared for by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;registered childminder, nursery, play scheme, or out of school club, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;a child care scheme run on Crown property which does not need to be registered, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;schools and other establishments exempt from registration, <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;providers of care for children aged eight years and over which is approved by specifically accredited organisations and <i>(e)</i>&nbsp;an approved home child care provider; and how many of those checks resulted in (i) investigations, (ii) penalties, (iii) prosecutions, (iv) convictions, (v) end of year overpayment recovery and (vi) cessation of the award;  [152739]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the level of fraud in the child care tax credit element of the working tax credit;  [152740]
<P>
(3) how many allegations of non-compliant application for child care tax credit have been reported to <i>(a)</i> the childminder's hotline and <i>(b)</i> his Department; and how many of those allegations resulted in (i) investigations, (ii) penalties, (iii) prosecutions, (iv) convictions, (v) end-of-year overpayment recovery and (vi) cessation of the award;  [152741]
<P>
(4) how many calls have been made to the childminder's hotline in each of the last 12 months;  [152743]
<P>
(5) if he will estimate the cost of running the childminder's hotline in the last year; and how many full-time equivalent staff are employed to deal with calls.  [152744]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The child care tax credit was part of the working families and disabled person's tax credits (WFTC and DPTC), which were available between October 1999 and April 2003. It contributed to the cost of eligible child care for working families. It was replaced in April 2003 by the child care element of working tax credit (WTC).
<P>

<a name="40205w02.html_para3">Applications for WFTC and DPTC could be investigated for a number of reasons, including where there were concerns about claims for the child care tax credit within the applications. However, this was only one component part of the award. An inquiry may involve more than one element of non-compliance, and it is not possible to say how many investigations related only to this particular aspect. However, the Inland Revenue successfully prosecuted and convicted 14 cases where child care was a consideration. Of these, six were solely concerning child care.
<P>

<a name="40205w02.html_para4">For WTC, the Inland Revenue will be able to arrive at an error rate for the tax credit population when it is in a position to carry out a full random inquiry programme on a complete set of finalised awards for 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="40205w02.html_para5"><P>

<a name="40205w02.html_para6">A dedicated telephone line was set up in February 2000 for child care providers as a result of consultation with the National Child Minders Association. This gave child care providers the opportunity to tell the Inland Revenue about any concerns regarding claims for child care costs. Up until 31&nbsp;March 2003, over 2,100 allegations were received in respect of WFTC and DPTC.




<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2004 : Column 1004W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40205w02.html_para7">With the introduction of working tax credit (WTC) in April 2003, a new service, the Childcare Provider Helpline, was set up to deal with queries about the scheme and receive information about specific concerns relating to claims to child care costs. Between then and the end of January the helpline has handled over 3,800 calls. It is run as a very small part of the tax credits helpline and it is therefore not possible to isolate the number of staff handling these calls, or the cost.
<P>

<a name="40205w02.html_para8">It is not possible to identify the number of allegations that have been reported outside of the Childcare Provider Helpline. Every allegation received is given careful consideration and, where there is sufficient reason, steps are taken to examine the circumstances more closely.

<a name="40205w03.html_para0">All children will receive a Government endowment of &#163;250 when their Child Trust Fund account is opened. Families on child tax credit, with an income below the threshold (currently &#163;13,230) will receive an additional &#163;250. The additional endowment for children in low income families will help give their Child Trust Fund accounts a good start and ensures that the Child Trust Fund is both a universal and progressive policy&#151;helping to extend opportunity to all, while targeting support to those that are most in need. The Government have confirmed that there will be a further progressive payment at age seven. This structure provides a foundation on which the Government will build in future.

<P>

<a name="40205w03.html_para1">Financial information and education are key to helping people make better financial choices throughout their lives. The Government view Child Trust Fund holders as the best judge of what most meets their future needs. By enabling children to interact with their own savings and investment account, and accompanying this with financial education in schools, the Child Trust Fund will help young people to understand the advantages of saving. The Government will commission a range of teaching and learning materials to meet children's needs at different ages, moving towards guidance on possible uses of financial assets, including continuing to save, as the child grows into adulthood.
<P>

<a name="40205w03.html_para2">We do not believe that setting targets for saving in the Child Trust Fund would be helpful since it risks distorting savings priorities. Information and guidance accompanying the Child Trust Fund will encourage parents to consider their savings priorities&#151;be that the repayment of any debt, the need for 'rainy day' savings they can access and/or longer-term savings for their child in the Child Trust Fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The performance of the UK labour market over recent years has been strong by both international and historical standards. In 2002 the standardised inactivity rate for persons aged 15&#150;64 was 23.4&nbsp;per cent. for the United Kingdom, well below the EU average of 30.2&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40205w03.html_para5">Sharp declines in the unemployment rate have boosted UK GDP growth, and a falling inactivity rate would increase labour supply and add further to the growth rate of the UK economy. That is why this Government attach priority to reducing the inactivity rate. In addition to helping the unemployed back to work, and increasing the skills of the lowest skilled workers, Government policies aim to encourage inactive people who are able to work back into the labour market.

 Crematoria are one of many categories of process regulated under the Local Air Pollution Control regime. It is normal practice for local authority regulators to include in LAPC authorisations conditions requiring monitoring of relevant emissions. It is open to operators to undertake such monitoring themselves or to contract out to external organisations. Local authorities may also commission their own compliance monitoring where they consider there is a case for doing so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 21&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1251W, on Chechnya, what plans his Department has to make direct representations to the Chechen authorities regarding human rights conditions in Chechnya.  [152347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The respect of human rights in Chechnya is primarily the responsibility of the Russian Federal Government. Consequently UK Government representations have been, thus far, to the Federal Government. That said, we are currently considering appropriate representations to the local authorities in Chechnya regarding human rights. However, this is complicated by the fact that our diplomats in Moscow are precluded by security considerations from travelling to Chechnya.

<a name="40205w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Some Chechen extremists had clear links to terrorists in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. Chechen groups set up an "embassy" in Kabul in early 2001. Some Chechens fought with the Taliban and al-Qaeda against the Northern Alliance and subsequently against Coalition forces. We have no strong evidence of Chechen involvement in Iraq, although some media bulletins have reported Chechens in military action there. We have no evidence of Chechen involvement in the conflict in Kashmir.

Arjan Erkel, a Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) worker and Dutch citizen, was kidnapped in Dagestan in August 2002 and remains in captivity to this day, and Kenneth Gluck, a MSF worker and US citizen, was held by militants for a short time in January 2001. A number of EU (including UK) and US nationals were taken hostage during the Dubrovka theatre siege in October 2002. One US, one Dutch, and one Austrian citizen died during the rescue attempt by Russian security forces.

Copies of these reports are in the Library of the House. The study concluded that short-term habitation for limited numbers would be possible but only on a subsistence basis while any long-term settlement would be precarious, and costly. No final decisions have been taken on any further phase of this feasibility study.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w07.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Neither I nor the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) have made any estimates of this nature as the costs will be variable. 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2004 : Column 1022W</I><P>
However, the bidding process for Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning has been designed by HEFCE to keep additional costs to a minimum, while ensuring a rigorous selection process. At stage one, institutions will be able to draw on existing practice and readily available information. At stage two, institutions will be provided with additional funding as a contribution to their costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w07.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 This information is not available centrally. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) does not collect information about the number of universities that have widening participation units. Most of the 131 higher education institutions funded by HEFCE have widening participation strategies, which set out how they intend to use their widening participation funding allocations. The organisational structure an institution puts in place to administer their strategy varies from institution to institution.

 My Department published a paper "Higher Education Funding&#151;International Comparisons" on 12&nbsp;December 2003, giving an overview of tuition fee, student support and widening participation arrangements in 13 OECD member countries. Copies of this paper are available in the Library of the House. This was followed by a further Departmental paper "Variable Fees&#151;International Evidence" on 22&nbsp;January this year, giving evidence on the effect of tuition fees on access in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reason he will make subscription costs from higher education institutions to the Higher Education Academy mandatory for the first three years.  [152651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w07.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England has determined that, for the first three years, institutional subscription to the HE Academy should be a condition of grant. This indicates the importance that the Council attaches to quality enhancement and the valuable role that the Academy will play. Institutional subscription will enable the HE sector to support the Academy in its set up phase and give institutions a direct stake in the new organisation. It will also provide much-needed financial stability for the Academy during its crucial early period. It is anticipated that after this initial three year start up period, the Academy will be self sustainable through membership subscriptions and other marketable services.

 The HE Academy will play a major part in enhancing the role of teaching and learning in universities and colleges. It will support curriculum and pedagogic development; facilitate the professional development of all staff teaching in HE; and develop and promote good practice. Paul Ramsden has been appointed as the Chief Executive and will take up post in August 2004 prior to the launch of the Academy in October 2004. The Academy will encompass the existing functions of the Institute for Learning and Teaching in HE (ILTHE) and the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w07.html_spnew5"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 My Department has responsibility for expenditure on higher and further education for England and student support for England and Wales. Planned expenditure on these areas for 2003&#150;04 represents 1.33&nbsp;per cent. of UK gross domestic product (GDP).

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) plans to announce its teaching and research allocations to institutions for the academic year 2004&#150;05 in March. They estimate, however, that the funding available for teaching in that year will be &#163;3,830&nbsp;million, including funding for widening access and improving retention and for rewarding and developing staff. That represents a 5&nbsp;per cent. increase on the equivalent funding for 2003&#150;04.

The main reasons for the rise in estimated spend on advertising in 2003&#150;04 are: the increased spend on the aimhigher campaign, which targets 13 to 16-year-olds with no history of higher education in their family about the benefits of higher education and gives 16 to 19-year-olds information about how to apply to university and the financial help available to them; increased promotion of Foundation Degrees to employers; and upweighting of publicity for the Connexions service to teenagers

 The income of a student's parents is not taken into account when assessing entitlement to student support in a number of circumstances. The most commonly applied are: the student is aged 25 or over; is currently or has been married; parents are deceased or cannot be found; the student is irreconcilably estranged from their parents; has been self-supporting either through earnings, benefits or training allowances for three years before the start of the course. These arrangements have been in place throughout the existing student support package which was introduced in 1999.

 In the first year of the national scheme, all young people aged 16 who are planning to continue their education from September 2004 in a school, sixth form college or a College of Further Education, can apply for an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA). In the existing EMA pilot areas young people who plan to continue their education into Years 13 and 14 from September 2004, can apply for an EMA. Entitlement to an EMA is dependant on an assessment of household income. Any young person who lives in a household with an income of &#163;30,000 or less is eligible to apply for an EMA.

 Information on the costs associated with the proposal in the Higher Education Bill to allow universities to set their own tuition fees is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8&nbsp;January alongside the Bill. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the costs vary greatly according to the decisions that higher education institutions take, and they cannot be estimated precisely at this stage. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House; it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.

<P>
<a name="40205w09.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his reply of 22&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1405&#150;07W, what the

assumed distribution was in the model of the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;size of means-tested loan taken out and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;size of fee loan, net of any fee remission.  [151860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w09.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> In estimating the 13 years figure as the average time for loan repayment&#151;22&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1405&#150;07W&#151;the modelling was undertaken across all students rather than being a figure for an 'average student'. The estimate is based on the whole distribution of borrowers rather than on an 'average student' or a student with average debt&#151;there is therefore no one level of debt on which the estimate is based. Factors that were taken into account in developing the model include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) The future pattern of demand for Higher Education by parental income;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) The proportion of students studying in London, at home or elsewhere;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) The propensity of students to take out loans;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) The distribution of fees actually charged by Higher Education institutions from 2006/07;</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(v) The distribution of lengths of courses (based on internal modelling); and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(vi) The pattern of withdrawals from HE courses (based on internal modelling).</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40205w09.html_para0">The model was applied on the basis of a separate fee grant and HE grant as set out as follows. Once the grants are combined, as announced by the Secretary of State to the House on 27&nbsp;January 2004, the balance between maintenance loan and fee loan will be slightly different, though the overall impact is likely to be small.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) We currently expect that in 2006/07 around 50&nbsp;per cent. to 55&nbsp;per cent. of students will be eligible for the full value of the means-tested maintenance loan of&#151;on average&#151;around &#163;4,000. The remaining students are expected to be eligible for at least the non means-tested element of the loan&#151;an average of around &#163;3,000.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) For fee loans, our estimates have been prepared using an assumption that 75&nbsp;per cent. of students could be charged &#163;3,000 and 25&nbsp;per cent. of students &#163;1,200 (an average fee of &#163;2,550). We expect around 50&nbsp;per cent. to 55&nbsp;per cent. of students will receive some fee remission. Under these assumptions, the 40&nbsp;per cent. to 45&nbsp;per cent. of students who receive no fee support would be eligible for an average fee loan of &#163;2,550.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40205w09.html_para1">As noted above, this is on the basis of a separate fee grant and HE grant. Under the combined grant scheme, we expect that 50&nbsp;per cent. to 55&nbsp;per cent. of students would receive all or part of the HE grant of &#163;2,700.
<P>

<a name="40205w09.html_para2">We then assume that 85&nbsp;per cent. of students will take up maintenance loans and 80&nbsp;per cent. of students take up fee loans. Loan take-up is assumed to be independent of parental income.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w09.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The statutory pay and conditions of service for teachers in the maintained schools sector in England and Wales are based on the recommendations of an independent pay review body&#151;the School Teachers' Review Body.
<P>

<a name="40205w09.html_para3">The Government play no part in setting the levels of pay in the higher education and further education sectors as universities and further education colleges are independent and autonomous bodies. Pay levels are subject to negotiations between employers and the representative trade union bodies, and will therefore vary from institution to institution.

<P>
<a name="40205w09.html_wqn3"><B> Charles Hendry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills under his proposed top-up fees plans, what the difference in take home pay would be between two graduates, one of whom had been liable to pay fees of &#163;3,000 and the other of whom had not, at salary levels of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;&#163;15,000, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;&#163;25,000 and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;&#163;35,000.  [153084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w09.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Loan repayments do not depend on the level of fees charged to a student or their level of outstanding debt. They depend on their salary level after graduation, so there will be no difference in monthly take home pay between graduates who were liable for different levels of fees. Monthly repayments for a graduate on &#163;15,000 will be zero; for a graduate on &#163;25,000, they will be &#163;75; and for a graduate on &#163;35,000, they will be &#163;150.

 Funding for widening access and improving retention forms part of the teaching grants paid by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to higher education institutions. For the 2003&#150;04 academic year, HEFCE allocated &#163;3.4 billion of teaching funding, of which &#163;265&nbsp;million, including &#163;10&nbsp;million for disabled students, related specifically to widening access and improving retention. For 2004&#150;05, HEFCE have recently announced that they will allocate some &#163;3.8 billion in teaching funds, including &#163;273&nbsp;million for widening access and improving retention. HEFCE funding is provided as a block grant and it is for institutions to decide how to spend that money.

<a name="40205w10.html_para3">Following the disclosure of some of the conclusions contained in Lord Hutton's "Report of the Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. David Kelly CMG" before its publication on 28&nbsp;January, Lord Hutton set up his own investigation into the handling of all copies of the report prior to its publication.

 We seek to ensure the most effective and efficient protective security arrangements for public figures in the light of the changing threat from terrorism and other continuing risks. It is not our policy to comment on the details of protection arrangements for individuals, as to do so could compromise their security.
<P>

<a name="40205w10.html_para4">An exercise has obviously been conducted in rearranging the particular level of threat to those no longer in post and arrangements have been made where this is judged to be appropriate based on the security threat to the individual concerned.

<a name="40205w10.html_para6">We now have record police numbers of 136,386 as at 31&nbsp;August 2003.
<P>

<a name="40205w10.html_para7">We do not currently collate the number of graduates recruited into the police service centrally and cannot therefore say how many graduates have been recruited. However, we have reason to believe that the Police Service continues to be an attractive career option for graduates. Since April 2003 we have been rolling out a new police assessment centre. So far 4,244 candidates have gone through this of which just under 25&nbsp;per cent. were graduates or post graduates. The Accelerated Promotion Scheme for Graduates was replaced in April 2002 by the High Potential Development (HPD) scheme which recruits both graduates and non graduates, externally and from within forces, with the potential to reach at least superintendent rank and ensures that they are equipped with the necessary skills to become highly effective in middle management, command and leadership roles. The scheme provides a structured yet flexible career framework which can lead to the most senior positions in the police service. A high proportion of graduates are recruited onto the scheme which is actively marketed via university careers fairs, other graduate events and targeted marketing in graduate publications and literature placed in universities. Latest statistics show that 50 (67&nbsp;per cent.) of those successful in gaining a place on the scheme are graduates on application.

<a name="40205w14.html_para9">The IDG on transitions consists of representatives from the Departments of Education, Employment and Learning, and Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and at one meeting representatives from the Social Security Agency were co-opted for advice. The IDG has met on seven occasions and has taken advice from a range of interests including the Education and Library Boards, the Education and Training Inspectorate, a number of schools and parents groups, a community Health and Social Services Trust, the Carers Forum, a cross section of voluntary groups and an MLA with a special interest in the transitions process.

 The Government's decisions are not imposing a 'one size fits all' system. All existing school types, including Dickson plan schools, have a place in the new arrangements, provided they meet the requirements of the Entitlement Framework. Academic selection will end and new transfer arrangements will be based on informed pupil and parental choice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w15.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) on what basis <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;HIV, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cancer and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;multiple sclerosis were included in the draft Disability Discrimination Bill's definitions of disability; and if he will make a statement;  [152568]
<P>
<UL>(2) on what basis <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;restricted growth conditions, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;mental ill health and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;high functioning autism were excluded from the draft Disability Discrimination Bill's definitions of disability; and if he will make a statement.  [152569]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w15.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Anyone with a restricted growth condition, mental ill health or high functioning autism who meets the current definition of disability in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is treated as a disabled person for the purposes of the Act and is entitled to protection against disability discrimination. A disabled person is defined in section 1 of the Act as a person who has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
<P>

<a name="40205w15.html_para2">In the particular case of people with progressive conditions (such as HIV, cancer or multiple sclerosis), the current definition treats them as disabled if their impairment has some effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, even if not substantial, provided that it is eventually likely to have that effect.
<P>

<a name="40205w15.html_para3">We propose through the definition of disability clause in the draft Disability Discrimination Bill to extend the current definition of disability in the Act for the progressive conditions of HIV infection, cancer and multiple sclerosis to anyone who has that condition whether or not it has an effect on normal day-to-day activities; although there is a power which could be used to exclude cancers which do not require substantial treatment. The provisions relating to HIV infection and cancer follow recommendations by the Disability Rights Task Force. The extension for multiple sclerosis followed consideration of case law. No conditions already covered by the 1995 Act would be excluded by means of the draft Disability Discrimination Bill.

1. The DSS/DWP figures refer to prosecutions undertaken specifically by the Counter Fraud Investigation Services in Scotland. These figures cannot be broken down separately into individual benefits and include successful prosecutions for all benefits paid by the Department, including Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance. Figures relating to prosecutions carried out in Scotland by the National Investigation Service can only be obtained at disproportionate cost.<P>

2. The local authority figures are for successful prosecutions carried out by local authorities in Scotland in respect of Housing Benefit fraud and Council Tax Benefit fraud.<P>

3. Information on the number of people successfully prosecuted by local authorities in Scotland is available only as a total figure for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit and can not be provided separately.<P>

4. For figures prior to 1999&#150;2000, the Fraud Information by Sector database shows completed cases commenced in the relevant period. Due to the elapsed time between commencement of an investigation and completion of a prosecution there are cases which are inserted into previously completed data for earlier periods. All totals are therefore correct at the time when quoted but subject to adjustment at a later date.<P>

5. Reliable information for local authority prosecutions in Scotland is not available for 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many whole time equivalent staff were employed by his Department on anti-benefit fraud programmes in each of the last six years; what the operational costs were in each of those years; how much additional benefit was recovered in each case; and what the unit cost ratio of cost to benefit was in each case.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pond: </B>

<P>

<a name="40205w15.html_para5">The overall aim of the Department's anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system which is secure from first claim to final payment. The implementation of this strategy means that an anti-fraud focus is integral to the work of all staff in the Department, as is dealing with the wider agenda of error and incorrectness in benefit payments. It is therefore not possible to account for the cost of anti-fraud work separately.
<P>

However, we estimate that approximately 500,000 pensioners in the London region (rounded to the nearest 50,000) are eligible for Pension Credit, which represents approximately 41&nbsp;per cent. of the number of people in London aged 60 or over. Information on numbers of Pension Credit recipients in the London boroughs is given in the table.

<a name="40205w17.html_para7">The event was part of a series of activities organised by the FSA to promote public debate on the issue of the promotion of food to children, following the publication of the research review commissioned from Professor Gerard Hastings of Strathclyde University in September 2003. In October 2003, the FSA published a paper setting out a range of possible policy options that might be considered as a result of the Hastings findings.
<P>

<a name="40205w17.html_para8">The purpose of the event on 27&nbsp;January was to provide members of the public with an opportunity to debate the issues publicly with each other and with stakeholders drawn from consumer organisations, the food and advertising industries, public health and children's organisations. A report of the event, along with views gathered at other stakeholder events, will be used to inform the FSA board decisions on what advice to offer to Ministers.
<P>

<a name="40205w17.html_para9">The chair was chosen on the basis that he was independent and fair. The six main panellists were selected to provide a balance of views and a range of expertise and experience to reflect the range of issues under discussion.
<P>

<a name="40205w17.html_para10">Over 450 people attended in person at the QEII centre. 439 viewed the debate online via the FSA's web-site and an estimated 1,000 watched on digital television.
<P>

<a name="40205w17.html_para11">One noble Member of another place attended. A number of apologies were received from hon. Members but no representations were made by any right hon. or hon. Members to change the date.
<P>

<a name="40205w17.html_para12">The total cost of the event was &#163;147,000, of which &#163;143,500 was allocated to production and a further &#163;3,500 for planning and preparation. Staffing at the event was provided by FSA staff.

 The cost of animal and genetically modified (GM) insulins varies between different manufacturers and presentations. The national health service list price of animal insulins is between &#163;0.66/ml and &#163;1.85/ml, and GM insulins, between &#163;1.05/ml and &#163;2.60/ml. Although the prices of individual insulins vary, the overall cost of medicines to the NHS is controlled by the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme which limits the profits companies are allowed to make through their trade with the NHS.

Similarly, the meningococcal C vaccine, introduced in November 1999, resulted in a reduction in the number of laboratory confirmed cases of meningococcal group C disease by around 95&nbsp;per cent. in babies under 12 months of age. Oral polio vaccine has been extremely effective in eliminating poliomyelitis from the UK.

<a name="40205w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Crown Court in Exeter is due to relocate to purpose built accommodation at the end of 2004. The new premises will provide additional courtroom capacity, which takes account of the projected workload for Exeter over the next 20 years.
<P>

<a name="40205w20.html_para0">The impact of the new Exeter Court on the Crown Court in Barnstaple will not be considered until the new Exeter Courts are fully operational. If, at that stage, it is thought appropriate to make any changes to the current arrangements consultation with all interested parties will take place. There is therefore no immediate impact on the Crown Court in Barnstaple.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what selection procedure was followed for the appointment of Lord Hutton to oversee the Dr. Kelly inquiry.  [152676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40205w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Where a Government decide that they wish to invite a senior judge to conduct an Inquiry, the Prime Minister invites the Lord Chancellor to recommend a suitable judge. This process was followed on this occasion, and, after consulting the senior judiciary, the Lord Chancellor proposed Lord Hutton and he accepted the appointment.
