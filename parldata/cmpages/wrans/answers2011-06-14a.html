I support the FA's intention to remain a member of FIFA and the decision to send the result of the inquiry held by James Dingemans QC to FIFA—although this was solely a matter for the FA.</p>

 The Department currently does not directly commission research on gambling. In the last two years the Gambling Commission has undertaken research into a range of issues associated with gaming machines and published several independent reports. Building on the Commission's work, the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board, which now determines the strategy and priorities for research, education and treatment, has included research on gambling machines within its strategy to be implemented through the Responsible Gambling Fund (RGF). The RGF's first project on terrestrial gaming machines is due to report in the summer and will seek to identify the distribution of machines across Britain against population density and socio-economic information. RGF has recently invited tenders for its second study in this area which will explore the relationship between gaming machines features and consumer behaviour in Britain.</p>

 Where necessary the Ministry of Defence consults with other Government Departments on the implications that international agreements may have on our acquisition programmes. In this case there are no implications for the import of the Watchkeeper system to the United Kingdom. The Watchkeeper system is classed as a Category II system in that it does not have the ability to carry a 500 kg payload to a distance of at least 300 km. Exports of Category II systems are permitted under Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines in accordance with national export licensing arrangements.</p>

 As I explained in my reply to the hon. Member on 7 June 2011, <i>Official R</i>
               <i>eport</i>, column 161W, prisoners have access to television in-cell as part of local incentives and earned privileges schemes. Prisoners rent the televisions from the prison service for a weekly rental charge of £1 per set per week or part week. The rental charge is deducted from prisoner's earnings which average £9.60 per week. The revenue from this charge is used to purchase new and replacement televisions and the costs associated with the switch off of the analogue TV signal. There are no plans to raise this charge.</p>

The National Offender Management Service does not record centrally which prison establishments provide communal television. However, most public sector prisons provide communal television viewing facilities. The National Offender Management Service Central Accounting System does not record separately expenditure on television equipment purchased for use in communal viewing areas. To identify these costs would require examining each establishment's payment records and this would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice announced in the Green Paper, “Breaking the Cycle”, published in December 2010, that it will test a local approach to payment by results. The aim is to encourage local statutory partners to reduce crime and reoffending, and enable them to reinvest any savings that their success realises for the justice system in further activity to prevent reoffending in their communities.</p>

The London Crime Reduction Board (LCRB) is supportive of the opportunity to test this justice reinvestment approach in London. The members of the LCRB Delivery Management Group, including the Metropolitan Police Service, London Probation Trust, Greater London Authority, Metropolitan Police Authority and London councils, have agreed to support the pilot areas to unlock barriers to delivery; identify opportunities for collaboration, and share good practice.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan), discusses a range of issues with the First Minister. The Secretary of State and I also regularly meet representatives of higher education institutions and other stakeholders to discuss a variety of issues including the importance of funding for research and development in Wales. For instance, I visited the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) in August last year to see the high quality research they carry out.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">“To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether the Office of Tax Simplification review of tax administration for small business includes consideration of VAT registration; and when he expects the Office of Tax Simplification to report its findings.”</p>

            <a name="11061469000466"> 
            <p class="tabletext">The OTS's interim report on small business taxation was published on 10 March 2011. The report included a short section (paragraphs 4.61-4.66) on VAT, which did address the question of the registration threshold. Our conclusion was: “On balance we think the registration threshold should stay as it is, though it is an area that is worth further study.”</p>

            <a name="11061469000467"> 
            <p class="tabletext">The Chancellor responded to this report in Budget 2011, and commissioned the OTS to look into tax administration in the final report on small business taxation. On 9 May 2011, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the OTS Chairman, Rt Hon Michael Jack, outlining the Government's response and setting out priorities for the next stage of the Office's work in more detail<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

            <a name="11061469000468"> 
            <p class="tabletext">As set out in the Exchequer Secretary's letter, the remit of the work on tax administration will require the OTS to “examine closely small businesses' experience of tax administration and their contact with HMRC at key stages of their annual cycle” and to "give specific consideration of the issues involved in starting and growing a new business." The terms of reference for this work are attached in the annex of this document.</p>

            <a name="11061469000469"> 
            <p class="tabletext">Over the summer, the OTS will gather evidence and conduct research to determine the areas of tax administration that ought to be prioritised. The operation of VAT registration is very much within the remit, although we understand that HMRC is already working hard to improve the registration process. As highlighted in the interim report, the OTS is also interested in the administrative difficulties related to VAT and international trade that pose particular problems for small businesses.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">An exact date for publication has not yet been determined, but the OTS has been asked to deliver recommendations on tax administration for small business ahead of Budget 2012. We would be happy to inform the questioner when the report is published.</p>

 As set out in the Statement of Intent, published on 31 March 2011, all educational institutions must obtain both Highly Trusted Status (HTS) by April 2012 and a current and satisfactory full inspection or audit by one of the eight listed bodies or their equivalents in the devolved Administrations by December 2012 in order to sponsor new international students. As a transitional measure, all sponsors that do not meet new educational oversight requirements and/or do not have Highly Trusted Sponsor status from 21 April 2011 are subject to a limit on the number of Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) they can issue to international students.</p>

 A complete response to this question is not possible as much of the required information is not readily available or held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Therefore, the response is limited to information about UK Border Agency staff numbers (employed by the Home Office immigration and Nationality Directorate until 31 March 2007; and the Border and Immigration Agency until 31 March 2008); applications and cases; and service standards.</p>

For 2007 onwards, the table splits staff between front line and corporate services. Front line staff deal with immigration cases overseas (visas); at the border (arriving passengers); and in the UK (permission to stay). This distinction cannot be made for the period before 2007.</p>

 The latest police recorded crime figures, in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin “Crime in England and Wales 2009/10”, show that there were 306,602 shoplifting offences in the 12 months to December 2010. This is a 3% reduction on the 316,297 offences in the 12 months to December 2009. The British Retail Consortium's Annual Crime Survey 2010 estimated the cost to the industry from all retail crime at £1.1 billion per annum.</p>

Ports of entry are not Government buildings. The premises from which the UK Border Agency (UKBA) operates are all leased from privately owned UK port authorities.

Any establishment or undertaking, which includes community groups, schools and businesses, must notify the Environment Agency of: their name and address; a description of the waste operation; and the place where the operation is being carried out (by post code or Ordnance Survey National Grid reference point).</p>

The incident resulted in a fatality which meant it was led by Northamptonshire police who had to perform an investigation in accordance with their Road Death Investigation Manual. This required the northbound carriageway to be sterile of traffic so the police closed the motorway.</p>

 We are clear that annual growth in the EU budget must be curbed.

However, there remains scope for rationalisation in this area of the budget, including administration costs. In addition, the European External Action Service must fulfil its commitment to budget neutrality over time, and as such the Council and Commission budgets for external spending also need to contribute to efficiency savings.</p>

               <a name="11061482000655"> NHS Cancer Screening Programmes held a workshop with front-line cervical screening staff in March 2011 to develop recommendations on how this will be achieved. Advice to the service, including implementation guidance, will be issued later in the summer. The intention is that, subject to meeting certain criteria, local cervical screening programmes will implement HPV triage in 2011-12 and HPV test of cure in 2012-13. Implementing both improvements in the same year would risk the quality and safety of the current programme, and put an unnecessary burden on colposcopy services.</p>

1. These data represent new HIV diagnoses made in Berkshire West PCT, within which Reading is located. The area of diagnosis is not necessarily the area of residence of an individual and therefore data are not currently presented lower than PCT level.
2. Diagnoses are from reports received by the HPA to the end of December 2010. Numbers will rise as further reports are received.
3. Patients may live with HIV for many years before they are diagnosed. Therefore, new diagnosis data does not necessarily reflect recently acquired infections.

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>Estimate of Alcohol-related admissions:
The number of alcohol-re la ted admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at
www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf
The application of the NWPHO methodology was updated in summer 2010 and is now available directly from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data.
<sup>(2)</sup> Finished admission episodes (FAEs):
FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that the figures provided for eligible FAEs relate to English resident patients with a known sex and age only and not admissions in England of individuals who reside in other parts of the United Kingdom or foreign nationals. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients.
<i>Note</i>:
Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

 There are a number of initiatives planned or in place to raise awareness about the benefits of organ donation and to encourage more people to add their name to the organ donor register (ODR). Much of the work is led by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) in liaison with a number of partners in the private, public and third sectors to encourage people to join the ODR (for example, when registering with a doctor).</p>

The campaign included a tour of shopping centres in areas with a high concentration of Black and Asian communities, visits to Hindu, Sikh and Muslim faith organisations and places of worship, advertising on Black and Asian television channels, radio stations and newspapers, a social media campaign and a poster display in community shops and outlets.</p>

As set out in Skills for Sustainable Growth, which was published on 16 November 2010, apprenticeships will be at the heart of the further education (FE) and skills system. Alongside apprenticeships and entitlements for the low skilled, we will prioritise Government funding for work place learning in small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs; those with fewer that 250 employees). We have also given further education and training organisations increased freedoms and flexibilities enabling them to respond to the needs of the learners, employers and communities they serve.</p>

 Flood defence projects in themselves do not generate revenue streams which can help fund the costs of any capital provided by the Green Investment Bank (GIB) or pay back other sources of financing. The benefits of flood defence projects tend to be in terms of avoided losses, land and property values, and insurability against flood damages. We do not therefore anticipate that the GIB will be making any such investments.</p>

Officials are currently engaged in that process.

                     <sup>(1)</sup> ‘Other rented accommodation’ refers to a more temporary arrangement than ‘Own residence’, for example where a number of students each rent a room in the same house on a yearly basis.
<sup>(2)</sup> Covers enrolments not currently in attendance at the institution for reasons such as industrial placement or language year abroad.
<sup>(3)</sup> Covers enrolments whose term-time accommodation was classified as ‘other’, ‘not known’ or ‘missing’.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. Figures are based on a HESA standard registration population and are rounded up or down to the nearest five, so components may not sum to totals.
2. The categories ‘Private-sector halls’ and ‘Other rented accommodation’ were introduced to the Student Record in 2007/08.
3. Prior to then the majority of enrolments in these categories were classified as ‘Institution maintained property’ or ‘Own residence’.
