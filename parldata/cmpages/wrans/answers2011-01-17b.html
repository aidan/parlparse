 The Forestry Commission has withdrawn 17 designated ancient woodlands valued at £3.5 million from its 2010-11 asset sales programme. Due to the uncertainty in completing the sale of any woodland on a given time scale, the Forestry Commission's asset sales programme has flexibility built into it. That flexibility has ensured that the Forestry Commission does not expect there to be an impact on its budget from the withdrawal of these woodlands.</p>

 Chapter 3 of the International Energy Agency's report is a valuable analysis, which provides a thorough overview of possible future scenarios for world oil markets between 2009 and 2035.

Under the New Policies scenario demand continues to grow steadily to 2035. All of the growth comes from non-OECD countries (57% from China alone), mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels. The main sources of increased oil production include Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Brazil and the Caspian region. The role of unconventional oil (particularly Canadian oil sands and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil) is expected to expand rapidly, enabling it to meet about 10% of world oil demand in all three scenarios by 2035.</p>

National Grid data indicate that generating output from operationally metered wind turbines (which account for 40% of wind generating capacity) was 67% higher in November and December than in July and August.

 The Department estimates that the net savings from wind power in 2009 were 5.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is based on an assessment of the weighted average carbon dioxide emissions of the fossil fuel mix in that year.

For this reason, and due to the fact that formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant, it is not possible to say how much grant has been provided to each local authority after floor damping for supporting people. The spending review has secured £6.5 billion of investment in supporting people over the next four years.</p>

Payments to existing pensioners were unaffected. No estimate has been made of potential savings arising from this change. We expect that the change to payment in arrears will be cost-effective in the longer term because it makes it more likely that the Department can action any necessary changes before a payment is issued, thus reducing the number of overpayments and in particular reducing the distress which may be caused when overpayments are made following a death.</p>

 Commodity index funds have become popular vehicles for speculation and investment in commodity markets in recent years. It is difficult to be definitive about the role of speculation in agricultural price spikes. Food supply and prices in developing countries are affected by a number of factors including global energy prices, global stock levels, the size of harvests, changes in exchange rates and national agricultural trade and marketing policies. On balance we are sceptical about the degree to which speculation played a significant causal role in 2007-08. The Government continue to monitor relevant research in this area with interest.</p>

During the field operation, all questionnaire returns will be tracked and, where levels of response are low, additional field staff will be deployed to provide help on the doorstep and to collect the outstanding questionnaires.

We are looking to make full use of their language skills and the support they can provide for local communities groups. We specify that additional languages are desirable for all posts, and information about any staff with language skills will be provided to their field managers. This should enable them to manage their team on a local basis and move staff to any particular area where their language skills will be of most use.

These plans will be used by all area managers and community advisors to engage more effectively with the black and minority ethnic populations and other diverse communities, such as short-term migrants. ONS appointed 41 community advisors (with language skills) in August 2010, 24 of whom are working in London, to encourage the involvement of black and minority ethnic population groups in the 2011 Census.

Such difficulties may arise because of disability, literacy or language issues.

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). These use disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for HBAI figures is single financial years. For countries and regions within the UK, three survey years have been combined as single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. Incomes are presented in 2008-09 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.<br>
5. Families are defined as a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children, including same sex couples (civil partnerships and cohabitees) from January 2006. A household is made up of one of more families and is defined as a single person or group of people living at the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one meal a day together or share the living accommodation (i.e. a living room). In line with the wording of the question, analysis has been carried out at the family level.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="110117w0003.htm_para35"><a name="11011733000131">The recent Dental National Dental Decontamination Survey, which took place very soon after HTM 01-05 was published, demonstrated that 70% of practices in England were already compliant with these essential quality requirements, with approximately 20% very close to compliance. This demonstrates that for the majority of practices, compliance with the HTM 01-05 guidance has not been problematic.</p>

This is important for Israelis, for Palestinians and for the international community, including the UK. We understand the depth of Israeli security concerns. But the strength of our friendship means that we can and must say frankly that we were disappointed that Israel did not renew the freeze on settlement construction and that peace talks are currently on hold.

 Katherine Jenkins and James Blunt were due to fly to Afghanistan on a civilian chartered aircraft on 20 December 2010. Due to a technical issue a spare part was required. Unfortunately, by the time it took to arrive and once a time to enter European airspace was reallocated (which was beyond our control), the crew had exceeded their duty time, necessitating the cancellation of the flight. With the general disruption to the airbridge and to civilian flights into and out of the UK as a result of snow, they were understandably unable to rearrange their schedules. Therefore regrettably, the visit did not take place.</p>

 The Department for Education has been exploring the practicality of a new national signposting service in detail, together with relevant partners. I have recently written to Professor Eileen Munro, to ask her to consider this issue as part of her wider review into child protection, and she has agreed to take this on as part of her remit. I have placed a copy of the letter, which details some of the progress to date, and lays out the scope for Professor Munro to consider this issue, in the House Libraries.</p>

Frontline practitioners need to be able to provide support for the most vulnerable children when they move across local authority boundaries or access services in more than one area. Experience and research have shown the potential value of a quick and reliable means of discovering whether a child or young person has been or is the subject of a child protection plan and/or whether they are or have been a looked after child or young person. Following the roundtable discussion, we agreed that it is worth considering a national approach to these issues.</p>
</ul><a name="110117w0005.htm_brev2"><a name="1101187001354"><ul><p class="tabletext">We agree that any national approach must be fit for purpose, proportionate and relate to a clear need. It must also be cost effective and have benefits for the front line of child protection. This was not the case with ContactPoint. However, while recognising that ICT can never be the whole answer to improving frontline practice, it is worth considering whether ICT might play a useful role in supporting aspects of social work and the protection of children and young people-as indeed you have pointed out in your first review report. Our next steps on a possible national signposting service must therefore be taken forward in that context.</p>

If a new ICT system is the solution, or part of the solution, the children in scope should be limited to: those who are looked after; those with child protection plans; and, subject to further consideration of legal issues particularly relating to consent, those who have been the subject of section 47 investigations, it is important that any database only contains details of children known to be at risk, otherwise it could fall into disrepute. Clear criteria would also need to be in place for the removal of a child's details from the database.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 December 2010]:</i> Both primary and secondary schools must deliver the statutory science curriculum which includes age appropriate information on human biology; this is part of the national curriculum. In addition secondary schools are required to provide sex education as part of the basic curriculum which must include education about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. However, all schools are encouraged to provide a broad programme of sex and relationships education (SRE) through non-statutory personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education.</p>

The proposal for an interns' training wage does not fully acknowledge that some interns are already entitled to a minimum wage.</p>

 The diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems suffered by sentenced prisoners is for medical professionals under the NHS prison mental health in-reach programme.

 Our review of the law in relation to squatting is not only looking at squatting in residential properties but also squatting in non-residential properties. As part of that package we need to take account of all of the coalition commitments, including those to uphold the right to peaceful protest and to guard against the proliferation of unnecessary criminal offences.</p>

These may not be typical cases of 'squatting', but we need to recognise the various forms trespass can take when exploring the possibilities for strengthening the law in this area.</p>
