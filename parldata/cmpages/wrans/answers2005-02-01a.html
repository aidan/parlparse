This value for money analysis and robust competition in the bidding process, both of which were highlighted as key factors in the decision to use PFI in the value for money guidance issued by the Treasury last summer, ensure that the public sector pays a fair price for the services it receives from PFI projects and for the risks which the private sector bears.

 We are not aware of evidence specifically on cyclists and the safety of using mobile phones. But the Highway Code already tells cyclists to keep both hands on the handlebars except when signalling or changing gear. The police have powers under sections 28 and 29 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, as amended, to deal with cyclists they consider to be riding dangerously, or carelessly or inconsiderately, through using mobile phones or for any other reason.

<i>[holding answer 25 January 2005]:</i> The Commission published on 8 December 2004 its proposals for a regulation on total allowable catches and related measures for fishing in 2005. In relation to North sea cod, these proposals included maintaining the total allowable catch at the same level as 2004, a further strengthening of the days at sea rules and a series of closed areas in the North sea. fisheries Departments received numerous representations on the Commission&#039;s proposals from fishing interests, environmental organisations and others. The recently established North Sea Regional Advisory Council produced advice for the Fisheries Council on the proposal. The Government was also informed by advice from its fisheries scientists. At the Fisheries Council on 21&#150;22 December 2004, the Commission withdrew its proposals for closed areas but secured agreement to a strengthening of the days at sea regime. The total allowable catch of North sea cod for 2005&#151;which had been agreed in discussions between the EU and Norway&#151;was confirmed at 27,300 tonnes, the same level as in 2004.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50201w06.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Sixth Edition of the RAF Manual of Flight Safety, officially described as Air Publication (AP) 3207, was issued in March 1993. This was superseded by the Seventh Edition, issued in 1998, which was itself replaced by a Joint Service Publication (JSP) 551 in July 2003. It is likely that the Sixth Edition will have been subject to a number of amendments (effected by replacing loose-leaf pages) during its period of currency. It is therefore unlikely that we could reconstruct&quot; the original version of the Sixth Edition, even if a copy of its later state were to come to light. All other copies have been destroyed in line with departmental procedure.

<a name="stpa_43">It is the nature of such documents that there is no reason for anyone to retain them once they have been superseded; perhaps more so once they have been replaced a second time. Therefore it is unlikely that any systematic search would reveal a copy of the Sixth Edition of AP 3207.

<a name="stpa_44">In the case of AP 3207 the organisation responsible for its production, the RAF Institute of Flight Safety, has itself been superseded by the Joint Service Defence Air Safety Centre&quot; (DASC). We have asked the DASC whether they have a copy of the Sixth Edition, but the only version of AP 3207 they hold is a copy of the Seventh Edition, which had itself been subject to three sets of amendments before it was replaced by JSP 551. I am happy to place in the Library a copy of the Seventh Edition of AP 3207, should the right hon. Member consider it useful.

Sea Cadets will be actively involved in all T200 events as a visible demonstration of the Past Glories&#151;Future Horizons&quot; theme. It is planned that over the three days the Fleet are in the Solent (the rehearsal day, the review day and the dispersal day) there will be 2,000 cadets on board ships in the Fleet Review, allowing them to experience the Review at first hand. Significant participation is also planned at both the Son et Lumiere and the International Drumhead Ceremony and for the International Festival of the Sea around five hundred cadets will be involved in a multitude of displays. Furthermore, it is planned that places for Sea Cadets will be made available at the St. Paul&#039;s Cathedral Service on 23 October and, on the same date, naval cadets will play a key part at the Celebrations in the Square&quot; Grand Finale event in Trafalgar Square.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50201w08.html_spnew0"><b> Estelle Morris  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2005]:</i> One of the challenges in completing digital switchover will be to make sure that residents in flats and other multi-dwelling units can access digital television services. Many residents living in multi-dwelling units already access digital television services either through communal systems that are capable of transmitting digital signals or through the use of other antennae.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_47">In order to help identify the issues for residents who live in multi dwelling units, we established a dedicated Housing Communications Group as part of the Digital Television Action Plan. The Housing Communications Group includes representatives from leading housing bodies including the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation, the National Landlords Association, tenants groups such as TPAS and TAROE and representatives from the Digital Television Group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_48">In June 2004, DCMS and DTI wrote to all local authorities, registered social landlords and around 70 housing bodies to alert them to digital switchover and to encourage them to factor this in when preparing plans to develop new housing stock or refurbish or upgrade existing stock.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">In August 2004 we commissioned NOP to carry out a research project to investigate the progress made by social landlords. This research will enable us to have a better assessment of what is needed and to get a representative picture of when social landlords believe they will be able to upgrade systems for digital switchover. We hope to publish the findings of this study very shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_50">We have also started work, in association with the Chartered Institute of Housing, to produce comprehensive new guidance later this year setting out the options available to landlords who have properties 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2005 : Column 785W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
with analogue communal systems which need to be upgraded. The guidance will be aimed at both the private and social sector landlords and housing developers. We also plan to issue separate guidance for householders which will cover the issues for tenants living in MDUs.

Non ring-fenced core funding for public libraries is paid to the 149 library authorities in England as part of the Local Government Finance Settlement.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="50201w10.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 One third of the world&#039;s population still lacks access to essential medicines. The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines in developing countries, including for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. There has been significant progress in this area. A combination of increased donor financing, competition from generic medicines, offers by research-based companies and improved health systems has led to a reduction in the price of first line antiretroviral medicines of as much as 98 per cent. over the last four years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_69">The UK Government have contributed to this reduction in prices in a number of ways. We worked with our international partners at the World Trade Organisation to reach the decision of 30 August 2003 allowing developing countries with no, or insufficient, manufacturing capacity in their pharmaceutical sector to import copies of patented medicines. These can be imported from countries such as India, following the issuing of a compulsory license in both the importing and exporting country. This important decision should help to increase the supply and availability of quality medicines.

<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_70">DFID has significantly increased its funding for AIDS related programmes, including for treatment. The Department has committed to spend at least &#163;1.5 billion on AIDS- related programmes over the next three years, and have doubled our funding to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Increased donor financing to buy medicines has contributed to the reduction in prices by increasing demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_71">DFID has also committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to strengthen developing country health systems. This includes support to pharmaceutical procurement systems. Good quality systems can help to reduce prices. In addition, the UK supports the World Health Organisation&#039;s (WHO)&#039;s work on &#039;pre-qualification&#039; which increases access to quality, affordable medicines&#151;both patent and generic&#151;in developing countries.
</p>

<a name="50201w10.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_72">The UK Government have also worked directly with stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, to increase access to medicines. In 2001 the Prime Minister established a high level UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World&quot;. This reported in November 2002, recommending more support for research and development for diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries, and a global framework to facilitate voluntary, widespread, sustainable and predictable, differential pricing by pharmaceutical companies.

2.Information for new deal for disabled people relates to people gaining a job and is from the start of the programme in July 2001 to March 2003.<br>

Information is not available on numbers leaving the programme.<br>

3.Information is not available on the length of time new deal 50 plus leavers have not claimed a benefit. Information provided is on those gaining a job and receiving the new deal 50 plus employment credit up to March 2003, and recorded job entries from April 2003 to October 2004.<br>

4.Information is not available on the length of time new deal for partners leavers have not claimed a benefit. National information for new deal for partners (on jobs gained) is for the period May 1999 (start of the programme) to March 2004.

5.Information is taken from the DWP Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study which contains all benefit claims that can be linked to the records on the New Deal Evaluation Database. These records currently cover the period July 1999 to March 2004.<br>

6.The period July 1999 to March 2003 has been used for information provided on leavers from new deal for young people, new deal 25 plus and new deal for lone parents, and people gaining a job through new deal for disabled people, to allow a full 12 month period to elapse before subsequent benefit claims.<br>

7.The proportion not claiming a subsequent benefit does not include people who continued an existing benefit claim which started before the start of the job and continued after the job start.<br>

8.The working age benefits referred to are: jobseeker&#039;s allowance, income support, incapacity benefit, severe disability allowance, invalid carer&#039;s allowance, bereavement benefit, and widow&#039;s/widower&#039;s benefit.<br>

9.All figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

The quantity of files destroyed increases because the department continues to create large volumes of paper records, notably in case files, which once they reach the end of their business life are automatically destroyed. The use of disposal schedules setting out when files can be destroyed will continue to be applied to ensure the department only keeps those records that it needs, or that it has agreed with The National Archives should be held for permanent preservation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes have been promulgated in each of the past five years to the guidelines or other criteria for the retention or destruction of departmental files.  [203299]</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50201w19.html_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The Home Office has maintained a consistent approach to the retention and destruction of files. The requirements to keep records of Government business are set out in the Public Record Act. The National Archive (TNA) produces guidance that further details the requirement so that only material of historical significance is held and transferred to it for permanent preservation. That guidance sets out how long different types of record should be held for and a process for scheduling disposal. The Department has consistently followed this guidance to ensure that records are held for as long as required to meet business needs, that ephemeral material is then destroyed and that only material of long term historic value is transferred to TNA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_146">Since 1999, the Home Office has produced 86 schedules for the disposal of records which are specific to its administrative activities. It also disposes of its records in accordance with over twenty guidance notes produced by The National Archives (TNA) over the last five years, covering disposal schedules, managing records in the electronic environment, as well as overarching record management guidance. Further details of this guidance can be found on TNA&#039;s website at:

<a name="stpa_152"><i>(a)</i> The Council Decision provides for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the treaty. That procedure provides for qualified majority voting in the Council and the application of the co-decision procedure in the European Parliament. The move to QMV and co- decision is not new. The treaty of Amsterdam, in force since 1999, provided that five years after its entry into force, member states would take a unanimous decision to move some or all immigration and asylum measures to QMV and co-decision. Within the Nice treaty, in force since 2003, member states adopted a declaration slightly amending the Amsterdam arrangements. The move to QMV and co-decision for asylum measures became automatic, once common rules and basic principles had been agreed. Member states reaffirmed that they would endeavour to move remaining immigration measures, or parts of them, to QMV and co-decision from 1 May 2004 or as soon as possible thereafter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w19.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_153"><i>(b)</i> The Government supported the move to qualified majority voting because EU co-operation on asylum and immigration issues over the last five years has been valuable to the UK and we are keen to see measures in this area adopted without the delays experienced under unanimous voting in a Council of 25 member states. The Council decision has no effect on the UK&#039;s Title IV protocol, negotiated at Amsterdam. We will continue to be able to opt-in to immigration and asylum measures which are in the UK&#039;s interest. The decision also does not affect the UK&#039;s frontiers protocol, which allows us to maintain our own border controls.

 Roll out of the probation and prison OASys IT systems has gone well. The prison service completed its roll out by the end of 2004 and all probation areas have been using OASys IT since last summer. However our plans to connect the two systems are behind schedule.

<p>
<a name="50201w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_179">We decided that it made sense, first, to pilot a limited version of the software that would provide the connection between the two systems, with full deployment of the final version of the software to follow at a later date. At the beginning of 2004 our aim was to begin the pilot in July and have the final version ready for deployment in September, with a view to completing roll out across the probation service and prison service around the end of 2004.

<p>
<a name="50201w22.html_para1">
The pilot began in July as planned, linking one probation area to several prisons. However the effort needed to develop and support the pilot was greater than expected, which delayed completion of the final version of the software until the end of November. The final version is now in use across the prison service and in the pilot probation area.

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="50201w24.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Sharp End&quot; magazine is for frontline police officers, Community Support Officers and police staff. It aims to inform them about changes which are making a difference to their working lives. The Government have a duty to explain how its policies impact on this key audience, and our research shows they would welcome it.

<p>
<a name="50201w24.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_188">The Sharp End complements the local information police officers receive from their Chief Constables and other sources. The first issue included articles on new antisocial behaviour powers, best practice on cutting burglary, preserving scenes of crime and using new techniques such as automatic number plate recognition, the introduction of new equipment such as non-lethal weapons (&#039;tasers&#039;) and how officers can stay fit for their job.
