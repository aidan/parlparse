To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much of her overall bilateral aid budget in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98, <i>(b)</i> 1998-99 and <i>(c)</i> 1999-2000 will be delivered through local co-operative, mutual or community-owned organisations. [35104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I regret that my Department does not allocate or record expenditure in this way. Many bilateral aid projects work with and through local NGOs, groups and people.

 Since October 1993, the UK has provided over &#163;38.6 million in humanitarian assistance to Burundi; including our share of assistance provided through the European Commission. Our bilateral assistance is channelled through UN agencies and international Non-Governmental Organisations. We also continue to be a major supporter of human rights work in Burundi. This month, we pledged a further &#163;0.8 million to the UN's human rights operation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to review the enforcement of compensation orders; and what assessment he has made of the advantages of establishing a victim compensation fund.  [35064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government have implemented provisions in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, currently being piloted in Norfolk and Manchester, which will allow courts to impose community service orders, curfew orders or a disqualification from driving for up to 12 months on those in default of paying fines or compensation orders. This Act also enables courts to impose an attendance centre order on such a defaulter aged under 25 where this had previously been possible only for those under 21. The Working Group on the Enforcement of Financial Penalties, set up by the Lord Chancellor's Department, continues to look for improvements in the enforcement of financial penalties and has issued good practice guidance to magistrates' courts on the subject.
<P>

<a name="80320w01.html_para0">The question of whether those awarded compensation by the courts should receive payment from some sort of central compensation fund is being reconsidered as part of the current comprehensive spending review.

 Article 7 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism requires that any such matter be referred to the United Kingdom prosecuting authorities for consideration. Article 7 also requires that their decision to prosecute be taken in the same manner as in the case of an offence of comparable seriousness alleged to have been committed in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1998]:</i> The Environmental Audit Committee's report was published on 10 March. It was not possible to give detailed consideration to the Committee's recommendations at that late stage of the Budget preparations. The Government will, however, formally respond to the Committee's report in due course.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what factors governed the length of time taken to answer the letter from the hon. Member for North Essex of 28 November 1997 relating to Government policy on EMU.  [35417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Inquiries have revealed that the hon. Member's letter was mislaid during an accommodation move in the Treasury and only recently came to light. This is regrettable; steps have been taken to ensure no other correspondence has been affected in this way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have met with the Association of British Credit Unions. The Government support fully the credit unions' ethos of self help and thrift, and the encouragement they give people to save. We are currently examining ways--including some of those which the hon. Member has raised--to promote further growth, whilst continuing the movement's current focus on poorer communities. We will announce our intentions once the deliberations are complete.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his policy in respect of selecting national champions from amongst United Kingdom suppliers bidding for defence export orders; and if he will make a statement.  [34710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As a general policy the Ministry of Defence, by means of the Defence Export Services Organisation, DESO, provides equal support to all United Kingdom suppliers bidding for defence export orders. 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 1998 : Column: 745</I><P>
However, both Government and industry accept that, where there is a likelihood of competing British firms damaging each others' prospects and thereby jeopardising British success, DESO should concentrate its support on the company most likely to win.
<P>

<a name="80320w02.html_para0">In adopting this approach we aim to work by mutual agreement with industry and the following general principles are applied:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> MOD (DESO) will not intervene, unless it is considered necessary to avoid damage to British prospects;</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what factors led his Department's personnel to donate a tour of RAF Leeming to the British Field Sports Society; what guidance his Department issues on such matters; and if he will ensure that similar tours are provided on request for groups opposed to field sports. [35222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 1998]:</i> Visits to RAF Stations by local organisations and local residents are made generally at the discretion of station commanders. They are designed primarily to maintain and promote good relations with the local communities and to raise awareness and understanding of the Royal Air Force, and particularly of the functions of a station and the reasons why its operational activities, which can be intrusive, are nevertheless necessary. All requests for such visits should and will be judged in this overall context.
<P>

<a name="80320w02.html_para1">It is in this context that RAF Leeming donated a tour of the Station as a prize for a charity auction being run by a local landowner, the proceeds of which went to the British Field Sports Society.

[35552]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The latest available figures show that at 1 January 1998, personnel from the ethnic minorities represented about 1 per cent. of the total Regular Armed Forces strength. Ethnic minorities represented: 0.94 per cent. officers and 0.72 per cent. other ranks in the Naval Service; 0.94 per cent. officers and 1.05 per cent. other ranks in the Army; and 1.12 per cent. officers and 1.27 per cent. other ranks in the RAF. No information is collected at present about the number of people from ethnic minorities in any of the Reserve Forces. I hope, however, to be able to make an announcement shortly about the introduction of ethnic monitoring among the Reserve Forces.

<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 1998 : Column: 747</I><P>
the source of the thallium cited in tables 4.65-4.66 of the Government Agency's volume, "Monitoring at Castle Cement"; what was the total thallium content, gas phase and particulate phase of emissions to air on 28 and 29 October 1996; and what factors underlie the difference in thallium inputs and outputs between the No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 stacks.  [34455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w02.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has advised my officials that some 75-80% of thallium emitted in the cement manufacture process comes from the raw material used, with the remainder emanating from the fuel. The Agency further advises that Tables 4.65 and 4.66 of the Air Quality Monitoring Report indicate that the total amount of thallium released to air from kilns 5 and 6 was 0.02kg on each of 28 and 29 October 1996, with 95% being emitted in the particulate phase. The Environment Agency has explained that kilns 5 and 6 use the "wet" production process, whilst kiln 7 use the "dry" process. The two types of process differ in many characteristics including releases. Differences in thallium releases are a feature of the difference in process technology and are higher in the "dry" process. A wet scrubber due to be installed on kiln 7 in April will reduce emissions of thallium from that kiln. The Environment Agency has advised that it is in the process of making further investigations into thallium and that it would be happy to provide further information direct.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the Government's policy on the designation of footways for the use of shared facilities in respect of pedestrians and cyclists.  [34547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w02.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Shared use facilities do not offer a ubiquitous solution to providing better conditions for cyclists. They are very much a last resort measure, where there is a safety problem which cannot be solved on the road.
<P>

<a name="80320w02.html_para2">Conversion of a footway to a cycle track may be feasible in ensuring the continuity of a cycle route where numbers of pedestrians are low, or where there is a road safety problem which cannot be solved on the carriageway. Decisions on what is appropriate in particular cases fall to individual local highway authorities, who are able to take account of local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80320w02.html_para3">The Department intends to review existing guidance to local authorities, and to update it so that it fully reflects policies for promoting both cycling and walking. The review process will involve consultation with interested organisations.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Transport Minister, Glenda Jackson, has asked me to reply to your parliamentary question asking what would be the saving in construction costs if the planned split level roundabout proposal for the western end of the A27 Polegate Bypass were to be replaced by an at-grade one.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No detailed analysis has been carried out, but we estimate that the savings would be in the order of &#163;2.5 million. However, there could be additional costs to offset this. For example, if we were to put the junction at ground level the surplus material from the excavation of the split level roundabout would not be available for use as say, noise screens, and material would probably need to be brought in. There would also be the cost of designing the revised scheme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Polegate Bypass has completed the statutory procedures and major changes now, such as making the Cophall junction at-grade, may require further orders (because of a knock-on effect to a side road and on the alignment of slip roads).</FONT></UL>

<a name="80320w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A further list of UK proposals has today been sent to the European Commission. This consists of 24 new candidate Special Areas of Conservation, boundary extensions to 13 existing sites already submitted to the Commission as candidate SACs and the addition of further qualifying interests on another 10 candidate SACs. This represents a significant step forward in the implementation of the Natura 2000 network in the UK.

I hope to announce the submission of further sites in the near future.

<a name="80320w04.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Robert McCartney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her answer of 26 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>336-37</i>, on what statutory authority she authorised to the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights to provide advice on issues beyond those set out in its statutory remit; and on what statutory basis it is permitted to expend moneys in such circumstances.  [34615]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w04.html_spnew0"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 Given the broad terms in which it is cast, the advisory role which the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights has under section 20 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 is wide. Successive Governments have acted on this basis, but have also sought advice on other issues from SACHR on an extra-statutory basis. All of SACHR's functions are paid for by moneys provided by Parliament from the Northern Ireland Office Administrative, Law, Order, Protective and Miscellaneous Services, Class XV Vote 1.

 <i>[holding answer 19 March 1998]:</i> I believe that, in general, major sporting and cultural events can bring significant direct and indirect economic benefits to Northern Ireland, help to bring the two sides of the community together, and assist in projecting a more positive image of the area to an international audience. The relocation of any football or other sporting club to Northern Ireland is, however, a matter for that club and the relevant governing bodies in the sport concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many applications from mature students were received in the year 1997-98; and how many there are for the forthcoming year.  [35413]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w05.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Centrally held information on applications to higher education courses covers only those applying through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) for full-time and sandwich degree, DipHE and HND courses. It therefore excludes those applying for part-time and post-graduate courses and also those who apply direct to the institutions rather than through UCAS.
<P>

<a name="80320w05.html_para5">The UCAS data for the 1997-98 academic year show that 97,400 or 24% of home applicants to full-time and sandwich undergraduate courses in the UK were mature students. Final figures for the 1998-99 academic year will not be available until the autumn, but the latest figures published by UCAS show that, as at 15 December, the number of applications from mature students was 18% down compared with the same point in 1997-98. This fall in part reflects trends in demographics and the numbers of potential entrants with the relevant entry qualifications. Even so, these figures are not a particularly good guide to final numbers for mature applicants as typically only 50% apply as at that date. More recent evidence suggests some recovery in mature applicant numbers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what provision will be made for childcare for children of mature students whose spouses are in full-time work.  [35414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 FE Colleges are often ideally placed to help parents, including those who are taking vocational and other courses to further their employment prospects, by providing on-site childcare. The Government have allocated &#163;5 million to the Further Education Funding Council for 1998-99 to increase the out of school childcare provision available in FE colleges.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what was the ratio of mature students to non-mature students in higher education in each of the past five years; and what are the figures for the forthcoming year.  [35412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The figures for the five years up to 1996-97 are given in the table. Figures for 1997-98 are not yet available. Although the Department produces projections of total student numbers these are not disaggregated by age.

 We have no plans to change the repayment schedules of loans taken out under the existing scheme.

<a name="80320w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is not possible to answer the question in the form requested as our records contain only closed cases. The most expensive closed case in 1996/97 financial year was R. v. Maxwell & Others which concluded in September 1996. The costs to the Legal Aid fund of this case to date are &#163;14.85 million. Although all claims have now been determined, eight bills remain to be re-determined and therefore it is not yet possible to give the final cost of the case.

 The total of Gross payments (including payments on account) made during 1996/97, the last full year for which records are available, from the Legal Aid Fund for Criminal Legal Aid in the Higher Courts was &#163;1,923.54 million. Over the same period, receipts totalled &#163;447.87 million. Net expenditure (including payments on account) was &#163;1,475.67 million.

<P>
<a name="80320w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 For the county courts, information is collected centrally only on the total number of personal injury claims issued and cases heard in England and Wales. It is not broken down into the number of claims brought or occasions when compensation was paid in respect of injuries received at work. The information requested could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. In the High Court, the only information available is the number of personal injury cases disposed of after being set down for trial. Again, these data are not available by type of claim or by region and could also be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="80320w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I understand that the power rating of different digital set top boxes are currently expected to be in the range of 10-30 Watts; equivalent to a low power light-bulb. It is expected that this will fall as refinements are made to designs. How much this adds to electricity demand and Carbon Dioxide emissions will depend, as with current analogue decoders, on how long consumers leave their decoders switched on, and how quickly they adopt digital television services. It is not possible to predict either of these factors with any certainty at this stage. The net impact in the longer-term will also be affected by the savings in energy consumption, estimated at roughly 5 Mega Watts, from eventual closure of the analogue transmitters which are always on and which run at significantly higher power levels than their digital replacements.

The reference was framed by the DGFT to enable the MMC to look at all aspects of the supply of raw milk in England, Wales and Scotland. It is for the MMC to decide what factors they will take into consideration in the course of their inquiry, within the framework of the reference.

Overall GP numbers are increasing and the average list size continues to fall (down to 1,705 in April 1997).
<P>

<a name="80320w07.html_para3">We have also taken steps to simplify the remuneration and operational aspects of the GP contract to relieve the burdens on individual GPs.

Any Civil Service appointment beyond the limited period allowed for under these arrangements may be made only after fair and open competition and selection on merit under the terms of the Commissioners' Recruitment Code.

 The human rights situation in Colombia is serious and continues to be of concern.

<P>

<a name="80320w08.html_para2">In addition to helping to facilitate a dialogue between the Colombian military and human rights NGOs, the UK also contributed, both directly and through the EU, to the establishment of the UN Human Rights office in Bogota which is tasked with helping the Colombian Government to develop programmes for the protection and promotion of human rights. The UK also provided funding towards the visit of Organisation of American States (OAS) observers to the local and municipal elections in Colombia in October last year.

 We are concerned about the human rights situation in Cambodia. We seize every suitable opportunity to raise our concerns with the Cambodian authorities. Most recently, as EU Presidency, we delivered a formal demarche on human rights to the Cambodian authorities on 26 February. Our Ambassador at Phnom Penh raised human rights with Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on 11 February. I pressed the Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister strongly on these issues during the latter's visit to London on 21 January.

 We are providing electoral assistance for Cambodia through the European Union. The EU assistance package--totalling 9.5 mecu--is being disbursed subject to strict political conditionality.

 We strongly support the work of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative to Cambodia.

I pressed the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia strongly on these issues on 21 January. As EU Presidency, we delivered a formal demarche on human rights and the need for investigations to senior Cambodian Ministers, including Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, on 26 February. The Cambodian Government have recently agreed to accept UN experts to help facilitate investigations into human rights abuses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research he has commissioned into the public health effects of fluoridation of the public water supply.  [34463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80320w10.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Relevant research has been sponsored by the Department and its predecessors and by the Medical Research Council, the main agency through which the Government support biomedical and clinical research. The initial programmes of research were described in the <i>Report of the United Kingdom Mission on the Fluoridation of Domestic Water Supplies in North America As a Means of Controlling Dental Caries</i> (HMSO-1952) and <i>Ministry of Health: Report on Public Health and Medical Subjects 105</i> (HMSO-1962) on health surveys carried out in Watford, Kilmarnock and part of Anglesey. Subsequent studies have considered fluoride and cancer, fluoride and mutagenicity, and the effects of fluoride on bone. The extensive scientific literature on fluoride indicates that optimal fluoridation of the water supply is harmless and results in substantial reductions in dental caries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when he expects the expert group on cot deaths to publish its final report; what factors have led to the delay in publication; and if he will make a statement.  [34501]<P>

 The Expert Group on Cot Death Theories held its last meeting on 16 March 1998. The results from additional research commissioned by the group were not available until autumn 1997 and the time needed to fully assess this data was greater than expected. The group will report to the Chief Medical Officer in April and hopes to publish its report as soon as possible thereafter. Abstracts from the report will be available on the internet.
