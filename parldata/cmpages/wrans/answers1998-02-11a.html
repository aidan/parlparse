Of these, 75 appeals have been dismissed or withdrawn and one has been allowed. These figures exclude dependants.

<a name="80211w01.html_para1">It is estimated that, during the period 1 February 1997 to 31 January 1998, a total of 580 dependants arrived with Czech and Slovak asylum applicants at the Port of Dover. I regret that it is not possible to provide an accurate breakdown of this figure by date of application.

<a name="80211w01.html_para2">In the case of the one appeal which was allowed, the Adjudicator recommended that the case should be reviewed within six months.

 Local authority secure units accommodate a number of categories of young people. Those for whom my right hon. Friend is responsible are convicted under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. On 30 January 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 182 of these: 170 male and 12 female. The youngest male detainee on that date was aged 11 years and 8 months; the youngest female, 13 years and 9 months. Costs vary from unit to unit, but the average weekly placement rate at 1997-98 prices was &#163;2,628.

<P>

 Information available centrally shows that ten prosecutions resulted from the use of automatic speed cameras in the Dyfed Powys Police area in 1995 and 38 in 1996.

<a name="80211w02.html_para0">I understand from the Chief Constable of Dyfed Powys that the Force targeted roads on which excessive speeds were known to occur rather than accident black spots. There is therefore no information available on the impact of the use of these cameras on local accident statistics in Dyfed Powys. However, I can refer the hon. Member to the evaluation of the effectiveness of automatic speed and traffic light cameras in reducing traffic casualties which we published in 1996.

 The figures requested are given in the table. The projection on which the table is based is the central or regression projection which assumes that trends in sentencing which have been observed over the last 20 or so years continue. Alternative scenarios are available which give a prison population by 2005 of 92,600 (custody rates increase at about the rate observed between 1992 and 1996, or of 64,400 (custody rates and sentence lengths remain at 1997 levels). The latest long term projections of the prison population in England and Wales were published in a Home Office Statistical Bulletin issue 2/98) on 29 January 1998. The bulletin describes the methodology of the projections in more detail.

<P>
<a name="80211w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Valuations by Managers and Processors of Claims are certainly among the sources used by the Firearms Compensation Section when assessing claims from individual shooters under Option C of the Compensation or Ex Gratia Schemes, but they do not provide conclusive evidence of value. Claims under Option C from firearms dealers must be supported by documentary evidence, in the form of invoices or equivalent documentation, of the cost to the dealer of the goods surrendered. Valuations in themselves cannot replace this evidence needed for these types of claim.

<a name="80211w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 No special arrangements exist. However, the normal arrangement to meet critical shortfalls of staff availability is to supply detached duty staff from other establishments. Exceptionally, where a critical shortfall can be forecast (for instance in the case of cumulative staff absences on maternity leave) and this exceeds the nominal allowance for leave and sick absence, governors are advised to make bids for extra funding to cover this contingency.

 When Parliamentary time allows, I intend to introduce legislation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure for disqualifying unfit company directors. This will make it possible for a person who under the present law is or could be subject to an application for a disqualification order instead to give an undertaking to the Secretary of State which would have the same legal effects as a disqualification order made by a court. I also wish to make it easier for firms in financial difficulty to make voluntary arrangements with their creditors by introducing into the existing statutory framework the option of a moratorium to give the company's management a breathing space within which to put a rescue plan to creditors.
<P>

<a name="80211w03.html_para6">A working party is reviewing the current state of regulation in the insolvency profession and recently issued a consultation paper "Insolvency Practitioner Regulation--Ten Years On". Responses to that will inform their final report to the Secretary of State and the insolvency recognised professional bodies. Another working party, chaired by Mr. Justice Ferris, is considering remuneration of office holders and is expected to report in the spring. These findings and conclusions of both groups will be given very careful consideration when received.

<P>
<a name="80211w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Historic data on the installed electrical capacity of combined heat and power schemes in the United Kingdom are available only for the year in which surveys of CHP schemes were carried out. These are as follows:
<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para3">

<BR>
1977: 2,800 MWe
<BR>
1983: 2,250 MWe
<BR>
1988: 1,800 MWe
<BR>
1991: 2,300 MWe
<BR>
1996: 3,600 MWe.

<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para4">It is estimated that in 1997 installed capacity grew to about 3,750 MWe with a further 250 MWe under construction.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w04.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Alan W. Williams: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what was, for each member country of the European Community, <i>(a)</i> the installed capacity of combined heat and power, <i>(b)</i> total electricity generation capacity and <i>(c)</i> CHP as a percentage of total electricity generation capacity, at the latest available date. [28973]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The latest available information on combined heat and power in the European Community relates to 1994 and is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para5">While the UK has a comparatively low percentage of electricity produced by CHP, the installed capacity of CHP schemes is the third largest in the Community. Countries with high proportions of electricity generated by CHP plants (Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Austria) have publicly owned local district heating networks which can distribute the heat produced by CHP. District heating schemes of this type have not been economically attractive in the UK because of the generally shorter heating season and highly developed gas and electricity transmission networks.
<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para6">It should be noted that the definition of CHP can vary between countries. For some countries, the whole of the generating capacity of an installation is counted as CHP, even if only a small part of the heat produced is used. For the UK, for schemes that are CHP in part only, the corresponding portion of generating capacity is included rather than the entire capacity.

<P>
<a name="80211w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Four of the Research Councils have been supporting over two hundred students each year on research Masters or "MRes" courses on a pilot basis. This is the third year of the pilot, and there are currently some 235 students on over 30 courses.
<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para7">Continued monitoring by the Research Councils indicates that many courses are proving very successful. Some others--for a variety of reasons--have not fared so well. Overall, the MRes continues to make good progress, with courses providing high-quality research training and the students positive about their experience. The development of the MRes is further proof of the ability of UK higher education institutions to provide innovative, high-quality education. I am placing a copy of the latest report from the Research Councils, together with a related press statement, in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para8">Given the experience with the pilot and the need to subject all expenditure to periodic review, I have decided that the individual Research Councils should now be free to develop the MRes by reviewing and redefining their support. Reflecting the success to date, I would expect the level of the Councils' support for MRes studentships to continue at least to match the 1997 intake. The MRes must remain a self-standing degree, and its design, including a significant research component, should also be unchanged.
<P>

<a name="80211w04.html_para9">I believe that these guidelines will provide the necessary framework for the Councils and institutions to develop the MRes for the future. The Councils will continue to monitor the MRes to determine, over time, its role in preparing students for employment and for a PhD.

 An independent evaluation of the Democracy Programme was conducted late last year, confirming the value of the programme. A new draft Regulation--the legal basis for the Programme--has been tabled before the European Council, extending the programme to the former Yugoslavia. The Funds-- 15 mecu per annum in 1998--are to be disbursed in two ways. Firstly, small-scale NGO projects, i.e. projects initiated by beneficiaries, will be selected by the network of EU Delegations. Secondly, a limited number of larger-scale projects will be developed, including a continuation of the joint programme with the Council of Europe and joint programmes with other international organisations. The Commission is to tender the contract for the administration of the programme, currently being run by the European Human Rights Foundation. The Commission does not intend for there to be a call for proposals in 1998.

 The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994 (as amended) place a requirement on anyone carrying out gas work to be competent to do so. This requirement applies equally to gas fitters registered with the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI) or people carrying out so-called 'DIY' work. The standards against which competence is assessed are set out in the Health and Safety Commission's (HSC) 1988 Approved Code of Practice (ACoP), 'Standards of Training in Safe Gas Installation'. This ACoP has a special legal status.
<P>

<a name="80211w07.html_para0">If an individual is prosecuted for a breach of the 1994 Regulations, and it is proved that the relevant provisions of the ACoP were not followed, a Court may find that individual at fault, unless they can demonstrate that the law was complied with in some other way. At the beginning of this year a new nationally accredited certification scheme for individual gas fitting operatives came on stream. It will run in parallel with the ACoP scheme until the latter is phased out on 31 July 1998.
<P>

<a name="80211w07.html_para1">The 1994 Regulations, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), also place a statutory duty on any employer with employees carrying out gas work, or self-employed person performing such work, to be a

<a name="80211w07.html_para3">Currently, CORGI is the only body to seek and obtain approved status.
<P>

<a name="80211w07.html_para4">Following a review of CORGI in 1995, the HSE published new criteria for approved bodies which charged them with introducing a new nationally accredited certification scheme for gas operatives by January 1998. This scheme sets out the <i>national</i> standards against which individual gas fitting operatives are assessed for competence.
<P>

<a name="80211w07.html_para5">On 13 January 1998, the Health and Safety Commission agreed that there should be two reviews of the statutory registration scheme, together with a comprehensive look at the underpinning legislation, ie the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994 (as amended). The first review, which will start shortly, will look at the extent to which, and how well, CORGI has met the criteria issued in 1995. It will also draw up the criteria against which registered bodies will need to operate for the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001. It is expected that the outcome of this review will be known in the Summer.
<P>

<a name="80211w07.html_para6">The second review, which will start later this year, will be a comprehensive evaluation of the statutory registration scheme taking particular account of the impact of the new nationally accredited certification scheme. Running in parallel with this will be an examination of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994 (as amended). The outcomes from these overlapping reviews should be known by December 2000. All interested parties will be invited to contribute to these latter reviews.
<P>

<a name="80211w07.html_para7">In relation to the causes of gas incidents and the competency of gas fitting operatives, the HSE has established an industry working group to consider this. The group, comprising industry representatives, trade unions and consumer groups, is looking at the causes of gas-related carbon monoxide incidents with a view to taking preventive measures where appropriate.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> A 1983 review of police reported accidents by the then Senior Medical Adviser at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency found that insulin-treated diabetes was responsible for 17 per cent. of 1,600 reported accidents involving collapse at the wheel in which the driver survived. A review of 100 of those accident cases revealed that 35 per cent. of the drivers had suffered from altered consciousness and 62 per cent. from complete loss of consciousness. More generally, the Secretary of State's Honorary Advisory Panel on Diabetes and Driving constantly reviews research findings on the road safety aspects of driving by diabetics treated by insulin as part of their role in advising the Department.

 The cost to install the existing office automation (OA) systems in the Department of the Environment was &#163;7.55m, and in the Department of Transport was &#163;6.29m. The new office automation system is effectively a merger of the two existing systems using the best aspects of each and the estimated cost is &#163;3.6m. Incompatibilities existed between the two systems at technical, user, document interchange and the cultural level. Although both systems used similar technology there were a number of differences in the detail of their technical architectures.

We have not set departmental targets for Ministers or for civil servants to reduce car mileage. My Department is discussing with other Government Departments what targets would be appropriate for the setting of Green Transport Plans for all main Government buildings.

The Queen's University, Belfast, undertook a study of "restricted" drivers in Northern Ireland (those in their first year after passing the driving test) for the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland in 1992-93. The latter study included a comparison with the findings of the Great Britain study and found no evidence that the number of accidents in the first year in Northern Ireland was reduced by the existence of the "restricted driver" regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the Prime Minister's oral statement of 4 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1046, regarding the increase in the area of green belt land since 1 May 1997, if he will list <i>(a)</i> the location and size of the increase, <i>(b)</i> the area of green belt land on which planning permission and

<P>

<P>
<a name="80211w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> There has been a net increase of nearly 4,000 hectares of Green Belt in adopted development plans since 1 May 1997. The Hertfordshire Structure Plan, adopted in January, provides for an addition of 5,400 hectares to the Green Belt, as well as the deletion of 800 hectares from the Green Belt to the west of Stevenage. The exact boundaries of these changes have not yet been established at local plan level. Other Green Belt deletions have been adopted in the Bradford local plan (ca. 90 hectares) and in the Newcastle Unitary Development Plan (543 hectares).
<P>

<a name="80211w08.html_para4">We do not have comprehensive information available on decisions taken by local planning authorities affecting the Green Belt, and it would be disproportionately costly to collect it. However, the figures for individual planning cases which the Secretary of State has called in and for which permission has been granted since 1 May 1997 amount to less than 100 hectares. For cases where permission has been granted by planning inspectors following appeal, the figure is about 320 hectares. In most or all of these cases the physical development itself is likely to have covered only a small proportion of that area. In addition, on 28 July 1997 the Secretary of State issued his decision granting permission for the Birmingham Northern Relief Road (BNRR), the route of which passes through Green Belt in the West Midlands conurbation. The total land taken for the BNRR (including temporary acquisition for the purpose of construction) is 623 hectares, of which 600 hectares are in the Green Belt. One hundred and seventeen hectares of the total land taken for the road are to be used for landscaping to mitigate its environmental impact; and land temporarily acquired will be returned to the landowner following completion of construction works.
<P>

<a name="80211w08.html_para5">The total Green Belt in England was estimated as 1,555,700 hectares in September 1993. More recent figures are not yet available. Against that total, the net increase represented by development plan changes referred to above is equivalent to about 0.25 per cent.; and the total area of Green Belt affected by the planning permissions referred to in the previous paragraph represent around 0.06 per cent.

 Agricultural holdings are not separately listed in the MOD element of the National Asset Register; rather, they are included within the Land and Buildings entries for various Top Level Budgets. This reflects the fact that their main use from a Defence perspective is as training areas.

2. The 1995-96 FRS is the latest for which data are available. The figures are based on sample counts and are subject to sampling error and to variability in non response.<P>

3. Figures should be treated with caution. Questions on assets are a particularly sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have a relatively low level of response, and hence higher levels of imputation, compared to other parts of the survey. Responses are imputed in around one in ten cases. Evidence also suggests some under reporting of capital by respondents.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> (a) Four FCO officials at grade 3 equivalent and above have retired or have taken early retirement since 1 May as part of an ongoing programme of senior management structure retirements on structural grounds. Their grades were: a DS1, a DS2 and two DS3s. (b) Officers at this level will have taken periods of normal annual leave, but these records are not held centrally. (c) None was dismissed. (d) & (f) About a quarter of the officers at grade 3 and above have changed jobs since 1 May either as part of the normal rotation of ambassadors and other senior staff, interchange with other Government Departments or on promotion. Such moves are planned up to a year in advance especially to/from foreign postings or where training is required. A high level of mobility is a feature of FCO work and roughly a third of all UK based FCO staff change jobs in any given year. Statistics on the precise number of moves and reasons for them could be provided only at disproportionate cost. (e) A DS2 and a DS3 have gone on loan to other Government Departments since 1 May.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The Agreement contains positive elements, notably the commitments to self-determination and to respect for human rights. But the main group fighting the Government of Sudan, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, is not a party. They prefer to pursue the regional peace initiative of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development which has the support of the British and other western governments. We have urged the Government of Sudan to demonstrate its commitment to peace by implementation of the Khartoum Agreement's clauses on human rights and by improving its treatment of Southerners. We have yet to see significant progress on this.

 We have good relations with Honduras, but look forward to developing them further with the new government of President Carlos Flores. A bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement came into force in 1995. Bilateral trade grew in both directions in 1997, particularly from Honduras to the UK. The UK has a small bilateral aid programme focused on the forestry sector and contributes approximately 15 per cent. of the European Union programme which, at US $100 million a year, is the largest to Honduras.

<P>
<a name="80211w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The site for the Millennium Experience was chosen after an open competition conducted by the Millennium Commission. None of the four sites shortlisted by the Commission was in a green field location. One of the main reasons that the Commission selected the Greenwich peninsula above the other shortlisted sites was the greater lasting legacy provided by the enormous regenerative benefits that the project would bring to one of the poorest areas of London and a site that had lain derelict and polluted for over 20 years.




<P>

<P>

<a name="80211w12.html_para6">The costs of bringing the Millennium Experience site up to an acceptable condition for redevelopment are being borne by English Partnerships, the Government's regeneration agency. This forms part of their overall regeneration plan for 300 acres of the Greenwich peninsula. The infrastructure costs specifically associated with the Millennium Experience site, including services, landscaping, a new pier and other works fall to the New Millennium Experience Company. These are in the region of &#163;30 million.
<P>

<a name="80211w12.html_para7">It would however be misleading to seek to compare these costs directly with the costs associated with developing a green field site. All sites have individual characteristics that affect planning requirements, their amenity value and the costs of development.

 Queen's Counsel, barristers and solicitors all continue to wear their traditional court dress. The fact that solicitors may now exercise rights of audience in the higher courts is not a reason to extend the wearing of wigs in court. Queen's Counsel, whether barristers or solicitors, have their own distinctive ceremonial and court dress, which differs from that of the outer Bar. There is no reason why solicitor QCs should be expected to dress differently from other QCs.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many honorary appointments as QCs have been made in each year since 1992; and what criteria are used to select them.  [27836]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Honorary silk is awarded on the personal recommendation of the Lord Chancellor after consultation within the judicial, professional and academic community. The criterion employed is exceptional distinction in the law outside the field of advocacy.
<P>

<a name="80211w13.html_para1">In the years 1992-1997, there were six, seven, four, three, six and eight appointments respectively. The names of those awarded honorary silk this year will be announced on Thursday 9 April.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many solicitors applied for silk in each year since 1995; and what percentage were successful.  [27834]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Five solicitors applied for silk in 1995 and none were appointed in 1996 (zero per cent.). In 1996 six solicitors applied and two of them were appointed in 1997 (thirty three and a third per cent.). Seven solicitors applied in 1997 and the names of successful applicants will be announced on Thursday 9 April.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend has no plans to interview applicants for Queen's Counsel. Silk is primarily an award for forensic advocacy, and an interview would not be an appropriate test of this.

<a name="80211w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Advice on the early signs of prostate cancer is provided in a leaflet available from the Health Promotion Wales and the NHS.
<P>

<a name="80211w13.html_para5">The introduction of prostate cancer screening has been considered by the Government's National Screening Committee. They concluded that current evidence does not support a national screening programme for prostate cancer in the United Kingdom. Current screening technologies (including the PSA Test) have a limited accuracy that could lead to a positive result for those without disease. Follow-up procedures could thus cause unnecessary harm to healthy individuals.
<P>

<a name="80211w13.html_para6">There is at yet no national consensus of medical opinion about the correct management of early localised prostatic cancers. In Wales, specialists in prostate cancer are working together to develop standards and guidelines as part of the work of our Cancer Services Co-ordinating Group (CSCG). This work, which will draw on the studies world-wide, will ensure that we have a high quality consistent service for men across Wales based on the best clinical evidence. During the course of 1998 CSCG plan to issue in Wales standards for urological cancers which will include prostate cancer. The development of guidelines will ensure that all patients should have access to appropriate diagnostic and treatment facilities. When these guidelines are published steps will be taken to ensure dissemination to the NHS in Wales.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State considered all aspects of these cases in October 1997 at the five year point in their sentences. She decided that they had not yet served a period that reflected the gravity of the crime they committed and asked that the cases be considered again in October 1998.

 Any public comments that the Secretary of State made were in accordance with normal Government policy on such cases, namely that bail in Artt's case is a matter for the US authorities, whose policy, as I understand it, is to oppose bail in extradition cases. Also, it remains our policy that time served abroad by prisoners at large from the UK does not normally count towards sentences served in this jurisdiction. At the Secretary of State's request the Director of Security in the NIO, who was accompanying her in America, met Artt's attorney to listen to and pass on their representations.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1998]:</i> The support was a transitional measure to enable the industry to adjust to the new circumstances after 20 March 1996. The impact will be a matter of economic adjustment among the various sectors of the meat industry affected. Information on numbers of fallen beasts buried on farms is not available. My officials monitor the situation, however, and have been informed by the enforcement authorities that there is no noticeable increase in the illegal disposal of fallen animals.

 One letter has been received by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what guidelines he has issued with reference to safeguarding the non-political status of senior council officials; what is the role of councillors in respect of the termination of employment contracts for senior council officials; and what guidelines he has issued regarding the termination of employment contracts for senior council officials.  [28589]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80211w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The Government believe it is important that councils and the public can rely on politically impartial service from senior local government officials, and that councils respect the political neutrality of officials. The political activities of certain local government officials are restricted by Part 1 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 and by regulations made by the Secretary of State under that Act. Scottish Development Department Circular 28/89 advised local authorities of the effects of the 1989 Act and letters of 25 April 1990 and 1 August 1990 from the Scottish Development Department advised local authorities about the regulations made under the 1989 Act. I have arranged for copies of these to be placed in the Library of the House. The Government intend to review the number and level of local government officers covered by political restrictions.
<P>

<a name="80211w17.html_para4">Councillors, as employers, have a role should they consider there is the need to terminate the contracts of Chief Executives or chief officers. Local government, through COSLA, have in place agreed procedures which allow councillors to report such matters and participate in any investigating and disciplinary committees which are set up. However, given the unique position of Chief Executives, arrangements are in place between the local authority employers and staff associations for any proposed disciplinary action to be investigated by an independent third party.
<P>

<a name="80211w17.html_para5">No guidelines have been issued by central government regarding the termination of employment contracts for senior council officials. This is a matter for local authorities themselves and would depend on the terms and conditions on which the appointment had been made.

<P>

 The Secretary of State has no role in respect of breaches of the National Code of Conduct. Neither has he any role in respect of breaches of the conditions of service for local authorities' chief officials which are entirely matters for local authorities as the employer.

<a name="80211w17.html_para6">The Government are, as part of our consideration of the ethical framework for local government in the light of the third report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, considering what changes may be necessary to the code of conduct for councillors and how a revised code might be enforced.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many butchers have been <i>(a)</i> cautioned and <i>(b)</i> prosecuted for selling beef on the bone; and if he will make a statement.  [28004]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Enforcement of the prohibition on the sale of bone-in beef by butchers is the responsibility of local authorities. I am not aware that any butchers have been cautioned or prosecuted for such sales although I understand the Procurator Fiscal is currently considering a possible prosecution in Scotland. Normal practice would be to take legal action only after warnings and advice had been given. Local authorities are enforcing the law, and I expect them to continue to do so.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what meetings he has had with representatives of the knackers industry in respect of current problems with the disposal of fallen stock; and if he will make a statement.  [26820]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I met representatives of the Licensed Animal Slaughterers' and Salvage Association (LASSA) on 17 November 1997 to discuss the disposal of fallen stock. The Government consider that it is the responsibility of the livestock industry to ensure that there are suitable arrangements for the collection and disposal of fallen stock. My officials are discussing future arrangements with LASSA, the Meat and Livestock Commission and the farming industry.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will investigate the methods of slaughter of <i>(a)</i> chilled and <i>(b)</i> frozen sheepmeat imported into the UK from (i) within and (ii) outside the EU; and if he will assess the extent to which it meets UK slaughtering and meat hygiene standards.  [27064]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The slaughter of sheep in all EU Member States must comply with Community rules governing the protection of animals at the time of slaughter and killing (Directive 93/119/EC). It is a requirement of these rules that meat imported from Third Countries must be from animals slaughtered or killed in accordance with conditions equivalent to those applying in the Community. Common rules on meat hygiene standards, applicable in all Member States, are similarly laid down in Directive 64/433/EEC. For imports from third countries, Directive 72/462/EEC requires compliance with equivalent conditions to those in Directive 64/433/EEC for the hygienic production of fresh meat.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by what means his Department monitors the beef import regulations introduced on 1 January.  [25673]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1998]:</i> All consignments of animal products imported directly into the United Kingdom from outside the European Union (EU) are subject to checks at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs), including checks on the certification requirements on specified risk materials introduced under the Specified Risk Materials Order 1997. Single Market rules permit only random spot-checks at destination on animal products traded within the Community. Consistent with those rules, a daily sample of randomly selected consignments from EU member states are subject to documentary checks by Ministry officials for conformity with the new unilateral controls relating to specified risk material.
<P>

<a name="80211w18.html_para6">Data on the number, type and results of veterinary checks on beef consignments at Border Inspection Posts, most of which are operated by local authorities, and the number and outcome of the random documentary spot-checks on beef consignments arriving from or via other EU Member States are being collated on a monthly basis from 1 January 1998, the date when the Specified Risk Material Order came into force. No data are yet available. They will be published in the Ministry's BSE Enforcement Bulletin which is placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="80211w18.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the average age of cattle at slaughter from which beef is imported from <i>(a)</i> the Republic of Ireland, <i>(b)</i> the Netherlands, <i>(c)</i> France, <i>(d)</i> Botswana, <i>(e)</i> Namibia and <i>(f)</i> Australia. [20714]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80211w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> European Community rules do not require the certification or documentation accompanying beef traded within the Community or imported from third countries to include information on the age of animals at slaughter.
<P>

<a name="80211w18.html_para7">The sale of meat for human consumption originating from animals over 30 months old from the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands or France would be a breach of our legislation. Botswana, Namibia and Australia are exempt from these requirements.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to the answer to the hon.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> The requested information on completion dates is given in the table. Once final reports have been received and evaluated, they are made available through the Department's library and their availability publicised in the Government's Food Safety Information Bulletin. This usually occurs within three months of the project completion date. However, publication of results in peer reviewed scientific journals is encouraged throughout the lifetime of the Department's research projects, and in many cases precedes the availability of the final reports.

(22) New variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) was identified in March 1996; to date there have been 23 deaths. Although the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) have concluded that there is convincing evidence that the agents causing BSE and nvCJD are the same, the scientific evidence to date does not tell us anything about the route of infection. SEAC's advice is that the most likely explanation for the nvCJD cases to date is exposure to BSE before the specific bovine offals ban in 1989.<P>
