This did not happen as it was deemed an unfunded additional financial burden. Instead the then Secretary of State wrote to Margaret Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association to encourage local authorities to improve their already strong track record on payments to suppliers.</p>

In addition, mothers are reducing smoking in pregnancy, a high proportion are initiating breastfeeding, mothers are coping better with pregnancy, labour and parenthood and are more confident as parents.

1. These statistics are based on the Households Below Average Income series, sourced from the Family Resources Survey.<br>
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication "Households Below Average Income" (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
4. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) modified equivalisation factors.<br>

At the same time, Miriam González Durántez had separate discussions with the Cabinet Secretary and the Cabinet Office Director of Propriety and Ethics to ensure there was no conflict between her work and the Deputy Prime Minister's official responsibilities.

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="101209w0002.htm_para63"><a name="10120967000094">We recognise the importance of consulting with local authorities and with schools to inform the design and development of the new service.

 We will establish an all-age careers service, open to all young people and adults through a range of channels, including a website, helpline and face-to-face support. We will develop the detail of the new service in discussion with local authorities, schools and the careers sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="101209w0002.htm_para64"><a name="10120967000097">Alongside this, schools will take responsibility for securing access to independent, impartial careers guidance, whether from the all-age service or other high quality careers guidance services. They will have the freedom to fulfil this responsibility in ways that best meet the needs of their students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_482"><a name="101209w0002.htm_para65"><a name="10120967000098">With the establishment of an all-age careers service, local authorities will no longer be expected to provide a universal careers guidance service to young people. However, they will continue to support all vulnerable young people aged up to 19 (and up to the age of 25 for those young people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities) to participate in education, employment or training. Decisions as to the targeting of such services will be for local authorities.</p>

 The new arrangements for careers guidance, based on the core principles of independence and professionalism, will require schools to work in partnership with expert careers advisers. We will take steps to promote high quality, impartial careers guidance by responding positively to the recently published report, 'Towards a Strong Careers Profession', produced by the Careers Profession Task Force. The report makes 14 recommendations to establish and enhance the principles of professionalism in the careers sector including the development of common professional standards and a code of ethics. The advice in this report is based on an extensive programme of consultation and evidence gathering over the past year, as well as the shared expertise of task force members. Reports on progress made against the recommendations will be made available in March 2011 and March 2012.</p>

 The Government have made a commitment to source food, subject to no overall increase in costs, meeting British or equivalent standards of production. In addition, we are developing Government Buying Standards for food and catering. We are proposing that these standards, which are mandatory for central Departments, include a range of sustainability and nutrition criteria. Our timetable to introduce these standards is March 2011 and Departments will report in June 2011 on the amount of food procured during the year April 2010 to March 2011 that meets these Government Buying Standards.</p>

A full EQIA will be published in the coming months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="101209w0003.htm_para25"><a name="10120968000020">In reaching the decision to end the education maintenance allowance (EMA), the Government closely assessed the evaluation evidence and other research which indicated that EMA does not effectively target those young people who need financial support to enable them to participate in learning. The evidence suggested that around 90% of the young people who receive EMA would still have participated in learning if the scheme was not available. Data from the 2008/09 Family Resources Survey suggests that the removal of EMA will have a negligible impact on the number of children in poverty. From 2011/12, EMA will be replaced by an enhanced learner support fund that will be administered by schools and colleges themselves, targeting those young people who face a real financial barrier to participation.</p>

 This Department sets no specific targets for numbers of graduate apprentices. Apprenticeships are open to all suitably-qualified people aged 16 and over. I was pleased to be able to announce last month that total funding for adult apprenticeships will rise by up to £250 million during this Parliament, so that by 2014-15 up to 75,000 more places will be available than under the previous Administration. However, whilst graduates are eligible to take up employment as apprentices at any level, Government funding is not available to support their training.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 December 2010]: </i>Under our proposals and for the first time all part-time undergraduate students in England will be eligible for loans for their tuition costs provided: they are personally eligible in terms of residency; they do not already hold a qualification which is at an equivalent or higher level to the qualification for which they now intend to study; they are studying on a course which is designated for support; and they are studying at an intensity rate which is at least one-quarter of an equivalent full-time course. Currently 60,000 part-time students receive tuition grants. Under our proposals we estimate 175,000 part-timers may be eligible for loans. No eligible part-time students will have to pay for their tuition costs up front and they will not have to begin repaying until they are earning at least £21,000.</p>

 The all-age careers service will be operational from April 2012, although young people and adults will be able to start accessing new arrangements for careers guidance from September 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_525"><a name="101209w0003.htm_para41"><a name="10120968000258">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has allocated £82.8 million in 2010-11 for careers guidance for adults, which will be provided by the Next Step careers service in that year. The Department for Education (DfE) has allocated £466.7 million to local authorities for the Connexions service in 2010-11, through the area-based grant. Resources are not allocated separately to 'universal' and 'targeted' activities within the Connexions budget, and the Department does not collect data on local authority spend in those areas. However, we estimate that, of the total budget for Connexions in 2010-11, around £200 million funds careers advice and guidance activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"><a name="101209w0003.htm_para42"><a name="10120968000259">Following the spending review, BIS and DfE are working through the detail of their spending settlements and are unable at this stage to confirm the funding that will be available for the all-age service in 2011-12 or 2012-13. There are 12 officials within BIS and 16 officials within DfE currently working on this policy, although some of these officials have other areas of responsibility. There are also 10 individuals in the Skills Funding Agency who devote some of their time to the development of the all-age service.</p>
