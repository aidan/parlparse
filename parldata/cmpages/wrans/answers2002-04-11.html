To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to his answer of 9 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 485W, in what manner the PSNI activity data collection will break down activities of the police; what the objectives and terms of reference for this exercise are; and in what way the results of such analysis will be made public.  [29809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w02.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy:  </B> 
The PSNI activity analysis collection will break down activities in accordance with the ACPO National Police Activity Based Costing Model. This model is focused on the District/Basic Command Unit and encompasses the total cost of policing a given geographical area. It includes all of those policing services which are delivered by DCU staff, and includes contributions from Headquarters operational or organisational support units. The six core areas of policing activity to be analysed are crime, road traffic, public order, public reassurance, call management and prisoner handling. Each of these core areas are broken down into Incidents (and by association incident related activities) and Non-incident Related Activities. For example, Crime is broken down into Violence (sexual offences, robbery, violence against the person), Burglary (dwelling, other), Theft of or from a Motor Vehicle, Theft other (shoplifting), Criminal Damage, Drugs (Class A), Other Crime and Crime Desk/Telephone Investigation Bureau.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Whitehead:  </B> 
The average total Band D council tax payable in the area of Sedgefield Borough Council is &#163;1,194. This is made up of:

<P>

<a name="20411w05.html_para5">The figure of &#163;1,194 per Band D property in Sedgefield is equivalent to &#163;784 per dwelling. The difference is due largely to the fact that almost 90 per cent. of dwellings in the area that are liable to pay council tax are in Bands A, B or C.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to tackle low housing demand and abandonment. [48708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Byers:  </B> 
Nine areas, where streets of boarded up and abandoned homes have led to a spiral of decline and misery for thousands of local residents, will get the opportunity to work with Government to establish pathfinder projects. Their aim will be to provide lasting solutions for communities blighted by derelict homes through investment and innovation. The lessons learnt can then be applied to other areas.
<P>

<a name="20411w05.html_para6">Pathfinders will be formed in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, East Lancashire, Oldham and Rochdale, South Yorkshire, Humberside (Hull), Tyneside, North Staffordshire (Stoke), and Birmingham and Sandwell. The size of the pathfinders will be significant ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 properties.
<P>

<a name="20411w05.html_para7">I am clear that the pathfinder projects will have to make some radical decisions in order to regenerate these areas. It is not sufficient to tackle the housing problem alone. Local authorities must work closely together with 



<P>
<P><I>11 Apr 2002 : Column 512W</I><P>
their partners&#151;the police, the health authority, the Regional Development Agency, Housing Corporation and private sector&#151;to rejuvenate our towns and cities.
<P>

<a name="20411w05.html_para8">Low demand and abandoned housing is a major problem. But it also provides a unique opportunity to restructure and rebuild our cities for the twenty first century. We must now seize that opportunity. The Government will work with local people to deliver the change necessary and bring hope to those communities.

<P>
<a name="20411w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Byers:  </B> 
I have today published directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are available on my department's website at: www.railways.dtlr.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="20411w05.html_para9">The directions and guidance set the SRA two main objectives: to work with the rail industry to achieve substantial lasting improvements in performance; and to work within its statutory framework to deliver the key targets for rail in our Ten Year Plan. The SRA also has other objectives, especially in relation to: leadership for the rail industry; driving up standards of punctuality, safety and comfort across all franchised services; and a much clearer and focussed approach to franchising.
<P>

<a name="20411w05.html_para10">A response to the consultation on the draft directions and guidance has been published today and is available on my department's website.

against her Department under the Human Rights Act 1998; and what has been the cost to public funds to date in <i>(a) </i>legal fees to defend cases and <i>(b) </i>compensation payments. [45093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w06.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells:  </B> 
Human rights are now integrated in the general law and are rarely the sole basis for a challenge. The department is involved in comparatively little litigation. However, it has been involved to date in three cases where proceedings have been brought which raise issues under the Human Rights Act 1998. It is often difficult to attribute costs specifically to the human rights aspects of cases, so it is not possible to give an aggregate figure for legal costs defending human rights points. The department has not to date made any compensation payment associated with a Human Rights Act case.

<i>[holding answer Wednesday 10 April 2002]: </i>The BBC's accountability to Parliament is reflected primarily through the Royal Charter and Agreement. The Royal Charter is debated by Parliament before it comes into force and the Agreement is subject to formal approval by this House. In addition, the BBC's Annual Report and Accounts are laid in Parliament and Members have the opportunity to ask the BBC Chairman and Governors questions at an open event on the day of publication. The BBC is also subject to inquiry by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which in recent years has held hearings on the BBC's Annual Report, and the Secretary of State is often required to answer questions in this House concerning the BBC. Under the 1991 transfer of responsibilities agreement between the BBC and the Home Office, when the Corporation assumed responsibility for administering the television licensing system, the BBC is accountable to the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee for the value for money of the collection and enforcement arrangements.

<P>
<a name="20411w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw:  </B> 
This is an historic day or international justice and for the human rights of every citizen of the world. Today, at the United Nations in New York, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Ireland, Mongolia, Romania and Slovakia deposited their instruments of ratification to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). These ratifications 



<P>
<P><I>11 Apr 2002 : Column 529W</I><P>
bring to 63 the number of states to have committed themselves to this landmark Convention and therefore activates the Statute, which will enter into force on 1 July 2002.
<P>

<a name="20411w10.html_para0">The ICC will try those individuals accused of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, irrespective of their rank or position. In future, tyrants will know that their actions are not beyond the reach of international justice. The victims of their crimes will, for the first time, be able to look forward to the prospect of real justice. The culture of impunity, which has shrouded human rights violations for too long, will be over.
<P>

<a name="20411w10.html_para1">This government has always been an enthusiastic supporter of the Court. It is our belief that the global rule of law is stronger than the local rule of tyrants. We played a major part in drafting the Statute, and worked hard to secure the passage of the International Criminal Court Act through this Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, to enable us to be amongst the first 60 states to ratify. I pay tribute to my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), and to all those who have worked to see establishment of the ICC.
<P>

<a name="20411w10.html_para2">The ICC will be a permanent court acting as a permanent deterrent for all potential tyrants. In time, this will be the law which transcends borders and embodies global values. As ever with all institutions of the law, its practice will be as important as its founding principles. We are committed to ensuring that it does its job fairly and impartially. We hope shortly to nominate a British candidate to be one of the judges of the Court.

<a name="20411w11.html_para2">The Lisbon agenda is a 10 year programme and there is still much to be done. We wait to ensure that individual Councils make a practical reality of the Barcelona conclusions on the liberalisation of energy markets, the availability of Broadband, final agreement on a Community Patent and the adoption of an EU R&D Framework. Member states will also need to work closely with the European Commission in its work on an Entrepreneurship Green Paper, reform of state aids policy and exploiting biotechnology.
<P>

<a name="20411w11.html_para3">In taking this work forward, both Ministers and officials will continue to be constructively engaged with the Commission, our opposite numbers in other member states and the European Parliament, as well as ensuring that the voice of UK and European business is listened to by all key EU players.

I have today placed in the Libraries of the House recommendations to industry to consider limited but worthwhile changes to its Infrastructure Code of Practice. The proposed changes are intended to improve the transparency and conduct of negotiations for third party access to UKCS pipelines and processing facilities. This is the final element of the Departmental response to its consultation on Oil and Gas Infrastructure: Access Provisions and Voluntary Arrangements, which included a review of the effectiveness of the voluntary Code. The recommendations build on views expressed and suggestions made in response to that consultation.

I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20411w12.html_para3">The toughness grades of steel used in shipbuilding are regulated by the International Association of Classification Societies through their unified requirement UR S6. The current version of UR S6 permits limited use of grade A mild steel, as well as grade AH high tensile steel, in structures contributing to overall strength.
<P>

<a name="20411w12.html_para4">This standard limits the use of grades A and AH steels according to their rolled thickness and mean air temperatures in expected area of operation, requiring grades with a higher standard of fracture toughness for high thickness and low temperature.
<P>

<a name="20411w12.html_para5">There are no plans to ban the use of grade A mild steel or to reappraise the use of high tensile steels for merchant ship construction, given the fracture toughness now achieved with grades A and AH.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many cases have been brought against his Department under the Human Rights Act 1998; and what has been the cost in <i>(a)</i> legal fees to defend cases and <i>(b)</i> compensation payments.[45057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills:  </B> 
We do not collect central records of all cases in which the Human Rights Act 1998 is relied on. Human rights are now integrated in the general law and are rarely the sole basis for a challenge. We do monitor centrally those cases which we consider may be of particular significance to this department. We have recorded 29 cases to date.
<P>

<a name="20411w12.html_para6">We do not collect separate information centrally about the costs to public funds, legal fees or compensation payments in cases which include a human rights issue. In most cases it will be difficult to identify costs referable to the human rights element.

<a name="20411w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills:  </B> 
It is for individual bodies subject to the Code to make their own arrangements for the procedure used to review cases internally where information has been refused and the applicant has made a complaint. Appendix 5 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information Monitoring Report for the year 2000, published in September 2001, sets out the target times adopted by bodies subject to the Code for deciding the results of an internal appeal. The majority have adopted a target of 20 working days or less. The target for decision on an internal appeal within this Department is 20 working days.

Today I have published Households Below Average Income for 1994&#150;95 to 2000&#150;01. This is a report published under National Statistics arrangements with results that cover Great Britain. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20411w15.html_para3">The report shows the position during the financial year 2000&#150;01. Consequently, it does not reflect the full impact of policies introduced part way through that year, or the changes introduced since&#151;for instance the Children's Tax Credit or enhancements to tax credits and benefits made in 2001.
<P>

<a name="20411w15.html_para4">Nonetheless the report shows that this Government's policies are working. The new economic stability has delivered strong income growth since 1996&#150;97 that is consistent across the whole income distribution. Furthermore our priority to target help to those most in need has delivered real improvements for those on the lowest incomes. There have been significant falls in the numbers of people below "absolute" low-income lines (1996&#150;97 low-income thresholds in real terms). There are now 1.4 million fewer children and 1.1 million fewer pensioners below 60 per cent of 1996&#150;97 median income in real terms (after housing costs).
<P>

<a name="20411w15.html_para5">Against this backdrop of rising prosperity across the income distribution, we are still reversing the long-term trend of rising relative income poverty for children that we inherited. There are now around half a million fewer children living in households below 60 per cent of contemporary median income.

As indicated in my written answer on 15 December 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 274W&#150;275W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) the Review has covered the functions and organisation of the Ministry of Defence's four medical agencies&#151;the Defence Secondary Care

Agency (DSCA), the Defence Dental Agency (DDA), the Defence Medical Training Organisation (DMTO) and the Medical Supplies Agency (MSA)&#151;and other aspects of medical provision. I announced the results of the initial phase of work in my written answer of 17 October 2001, <i>Official Report, </i>columns 1223W&#150;1224W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright).
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para1">The Review Team has now completed its work, and I am today placing a summary of its conclusions in the Library of the House. In brief, the main points are that:
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para2">There must be a clearer focus on delivery of the two key Defence medical outputs&#151;deployable operational medical capability, and timely appropriate healthcare for Service personnel;
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para3">Accountability for the delivery of these outputs by both central and single-Service authorities must be defined unambiguously, as part of a clear tri-Service strategy and plan;
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para4">The Surgeon General (SG), working to the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, will be empowered to undertake effective oversight and direction of the DMS in meeting the key output requirements, including those elements which remain under single-Service management;
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para5">A stronger partnership will be established between the DMS and the National Health Service;
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para6">Management capabilities throughout the DMS will be strengthened, drawing on expertise from the parent Services and, where relevant, the NHS;
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para7">The Defence Medical Services will be re-aligned and restructured to focus more effectively on the two key Defence medical outputs. The DSCA will be disestablished on 31 March 2003, with its training-related functions transferring to an expanded medical training agency, and healthcare commissioning being undertaken by a new group within the Surgeon General's staff. The MSA has now transferred into the Defence Logistics Organisation as of 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20411w16.html_para8">The review has provided an important opportunity to take stock of the progress that has been made since the announcement of the New Strategy for the DMS at the end of 1998. It is no surprise that it has concluded that while much has been done over the last three years there are further steps to be taken&#151;and changes to be made&#151;that will help the process of restoring DMS capability and ensuring that key Defence medical outputs are delivered. The Government is committed to achieving those aims and, subject to the normal consultative process, to implementing the outcome of the review.

Member to the answer I gave him on 25 February 2002, (<i>Official Report</i>, column 682) which gave details of new and existing measures to deter and detect fraud and theft. It is a prime feature of delegated line management responsibility to operate procedures protecting assets from theft and damage. These procedures are always subject to review. They are enhanced where possible through central initiatives directed at the deterrence and detection of fraud and theft and the introduction of resource accounting arrangements. Recent developments include the promulgation of a policy statement on fraud and theft and the development of a programme of fraud and theft awareness training across the department. Key controls, such as the maintenance of asset registers requiring a physical description of assets, spot checks and random searches, authorisation to remove assets from sites and physical security are underpinned by published guidance and direction.

Premier Prison Services, who operate the court escort contract in the west Midlands and mid Wales, are required to deliver prisoners to magistrates courts in their area 30 minutes before court start time. In the six months to February 2002 over 20,000 prisoners have been escorted by Premier Prison Services to those courts and of these approximately 82 per cent. have arrived by the time stated in their contract. A further seven per cent. have arrived before court start time.

Late discharges from prison, long journeys occasioned by the general population pressures on the prison estate and circumstances beyond the control of the parties involved may all be contributory factors in any individual case.

There are five versions of the accredited Sex Offender Treatment Programmes (SOTP) delivered in prisons: a core programme for all except those with learning difficulties and those at low risk of re-offending; an adapted programme for those with learning difficulties; an extended programme for those at high risk of re-offending; a rolling programme for those at low risk of re-offending; and a booster programme for those who have completed other versions of the programme and are preparing for release.
<P>

<a name="20411w17.html_para1">The Prison Service's targets for numbers of prisoners completing versions of the programme in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are 950 and 1,240 respectively. Versions of the programme are currently delivered at 25 prisons. This is planned to rise to 27 prisons in 2002&#150;03 and 28 in 2003&#150;04. Prisoners may need to be transferred in order to undertake the programme.
<P>

<a name="20411w17.html_para2">It is not possible to be precise as to whether provision exactly meets demand. For example, the programme is also delivered to those serving sentences for other offences but who have previous histories of sexual offending; and some offenders have to be excluded from treatment temporarily or permanently because clinical assessment at the start of the programme is that they are unlikely to be responsive. However, the Prison Service keeps the programme under review to ensure its availability to all eligible prisoners with sentences long enough to complete it.

At the end of February 2002, a total of 13,963 prisoners were held in overcrowded conditions. This is 20 per cent. of the prisoner population.
<P>

<a name="20411w17.html_para5">Most overcrowding is attributable to the numbers held two in a cell designed for one, commonly known as doubling. Within the total overcrowding figure above, 12,516 prisoners were held doubled.

The female prison population on 15 March 2002 was 4,229. This was 146 below the total certified operational capacity of 4,375 for the same day. The Government sets no target for the prison population as it is for the courts to determine who is sent to prison. The Government will provide the places necessary to accommodate safely and securely those sentenced by the courts. New prison capacity is opening this year for female prisoners. Buckley Hall, a 350 place prison near Rochdale, will change function shortly from male to female use. Female capacity will increase by 80 places later this year when two ready use units are opened at Morton Hall in Lincolnshire.

Where it can be demonstrated that exceptional additional costs could not be met from existing police authority budgets or reserves it is open to forces to apply for a special grant. Any such application would be considered within existing Departmental provision for special grants.
<P>

<a name="20411w18.html_para1">In general terms we would expect police authorities to meet the additional costs of policing Golden Jubilee events from within their existing budgets or reserves. Criteria for consideration of a special grant application were agreed in 2000 between the Home Office, Association of Chief Police Officers and Association of Police Authorities. Under those criteria police authorities are normally expected to meet additional costs up to 1 per cent. of the force budget set by the policy authority. Grant would be considered in relation to the balance of cost above that 1 per cent.

There was no Home Office expenditure in connection with the Golden Jubilee in 1999&#150;2000. In 2000&#150;01, &#163;72,375.15 was spent on the administrative costs of setting up the Golden Jubilee Unit, which is co-ordinating the arrangements for the Jubilee celebrations
<P>

<a name="20411w18.html_para2">Responsibility for the Golden Jubilee Unit was transferred to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport following the General Election. Funding had passed through the Home Office accounts in February 2002: up to that point &#163;721,861.53 was spent by the Golden Jubilee Unit. This comprised &#163;594,824 on the Unit's work in co-ordinating arrangements for the celebrations, &#163;95,110 in grants and &#163;31,927 on providing information about how to stage the jubilee events. Of the grant expenditure, the majority &#163;50,000 was given to the "London String of Pearls" (as a contribution to the costs in opening up buildings to the public during Jubilee) and the rest to the Commonwealth Institute (to help towards the cost of its role in the planned national parade).

<i>[holding answer 21 March 2002]:</i> The term alcohol-related crime potentially covers any criminal act where the perpetrator may have been drinking alcohol prior to, or at the time of, the offence. While the relevant offence may be recorded, there is at present no requirement on police forces to record whether or not the offender had been drinking. Many forces do, however make their own assessment of alcohol-related crime problems, to inform their operational policing decisions.

The use of animals in experiments and other scientific procedures is strictly regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which is widely regarded as the most rigorous piece of legislation of its type in the world. It offers a high level of protection to animals whilst recognising the need to use animals in

research. It also requires the latest ideas and technology to be taken into account when deciding whether the use of animals is justified.
<P>

<a name="20411w20.html_para0">We are working to ensure that the highest possible standards of animal welfare are applied and that animals are used only where it is fully justified. To this end, the Home Office has developed and put in place a strategy to ensure that policy is reviewed continuously as scientific and ethical considerations evolve, checking that the costs to animals are minimised and remain outweighed by the potential benefits of the work; compliance and high standards are reinforced through consistently applied inspection, training, guidance and (if necessary) infringement procedures; the advice of the Inspectorate, other welfare and scientific expertise, and the products of local ethical review processes is harnessed in ensuring that there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed or refine the procedures to minimise suffering (the 3Rs). It also ensures that these are rigorously applied in every case and that the highest standards of animal welfare are implemented.
<P>

<a name="20411w20.html_para1">It is also our strategy to encourage the development and use of alternatives and relevant databases through research funding and education, and through support for the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM); to take a lead in formulating European policies, standards and targets which neither disadvantage the United Kingdom nor drive work abroad to countries where lower standards apply; to liaise actively with legitimate interest groups and encourage the Animal Procedures Committee to take a more public role and offer broadly based and independent advice to Ministers; and to seek to make the administration of the 1986 Act as transparent as possible.

<P>
<a name="20411w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley:  </B> 
The interim rules for livestock movements, which we announced on 5 February, allow greater flexibility for farmers to move their animals. The 20 day standstill rule has been waived for some types of movement, subject to conditions and we will continue to keep these arrangements under review. However, veterinary advice is that the 20 day standstill needs to remain in place for the time being as a disease control measure. A copy of a document explaining the Veterinary basis for the Interim movement rules has been placed in the Library of the House and is available on the DEFRA website.

We cannot be certain as to the precise origin of the Classical Swine Fever and Foot and Mouth Disease outbreaks in 2000 and 2001.

<i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> Directive 2001/82/EC consolidated a number of Directives concerning veterinary medicinal products into a single text. Its purpose was not to introduce any substantive changes to the controls on veterinary medicines that 



<P>
<P><I>11 Apr 2002 : Column 587W</I><P>
previously existed. Therefore there are no likely effects on employment as a consequence of its implementation. Nor is there anything in Directive 2001/82/EC that would limit animal owners to buying veterinary medicines from veterinary surgeons.
<P>

<a name="20411w25.html_para0">However, the European commission has proposed amendments to Directive 2001/82/EC, one of which would require medicines for food-producing animals to be supplied only in accordance with a veterinary prescription. Under UK legislation veterinary medicines for which a prescription is required may be supplied by veterinary surgeons or registered pharmacists. In its present form this particular proposal could result in UK farmers having to pay more by incurring veterinary surgeons' fees when obtaining those medicines that are currently available without veterinary intervention. Furthermore, it could restrict the number and types of veterinary medicines that may be supplied by registered agricultural merchants and saddlers, to a limited range of products for dogs and cats. This could have significant adverse effects on those businesses.
<P>

<a name="20411w25.html_para1">In considering this proposal the Government has taken account of its likely impact on the supply of veterinary medicines and has agreed that, during negotiations, UK officials should seek to modify the proposal to enable a flexible approach to the distribution of veterinary medicinal products that takes advantage of existing national practices, so long as consumer protection and animal welfare can be demonstrably assured.

August application of these manures on grassland and land sown with autumn sown crops allows time for uptake of nitrate by growing crops; the closed period is limited to September and October where the risk of nitrate leaching remains high.

The Environment Agency received a report of pollution entering the River Aire from a closed landfill site in March 2000. The incident was investigated and was categorised as a minor incident which has a limited effect on water quality. Their enquiries showed the cause of the incident to be a malfunctioning pump carrying leachate from a decommissioned landfill site to the public foul water sewer. North Yorkshire County Council is responsible for maintaining the pump and is taking steps to gain access to the land, which is controlled by a tenant farmer, in order to carry out the necessary work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher:  </B> 
The government has supported a number of studies into the health effects of various sources of noise. A number of these consider road traffic noise including: "Health Effects based Noise Assessment Methods: A Review and Feasibility Study", which is available on the DEFRA website (www.defra.gov.uk), and "The effects of relieving traffic congestion on noise exposure, noise annoyance, well-being and psychiatric morbitdity: annex to the by-pass study" which is available from the Department of Health. The government is also contributing to the European study: "Road traffic and Aircraft Noise exposure and Children's cognition and Health" (RANCH).
<P>

<a name="20411w26.html_para19">Road traffic noise does not generally fall within the legal definition of a public nuisance and, as such, there are no figures available relating to this. The government does, however, take the issue of noise seriously and periodically records people's attitudes to noise. This exercise established that in 1991 29 per cent. of respondents who reported hearing road traffic noise stated that they were adversely affected by it. This survey has recently been repeated and the results are expected to be published in May.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps <i>(a)</i> her Department and <i>(b)</i> the Government have taken to encourage environmentally and socially responsible investments in least developed countries. [46561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20411w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher:  </B> 
There is an increasing understanding by institutional investors and financial service providers of the benefits of environmentally and socially responsible investment. The demand for more disclosure by investors on social and environmental policy has been stimulated by the disclosure requirements of the 2000 amendment to the Pension Act, and the debate about replicating these requirements in other areas.
<P>

<a name="20411w27.html_para2">The Department has taken the lead in working with the UK financial services sector on the "London Principles&#151;finance and insurance for sustainable development". The Principles encompass three key areas: pricing asset and exercising ownership; providing new finance; and risk management. The Principles will be launched later this year as part of the UK's contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We hope that they will serve as a model for resolutions on financial sustainability at the World Summit.

The sustainable management of forests, including conservation, is a cornerstone of our forestry policy, and it was then the main issue discussed at the United Nations Forum on Forests which I attended in New York last month. This event provided an international stage to promote sustainable forest management, and in my speech to the Forum I highlighted the lead being taken by the UK, including our joint work with industry and NGOs, the development of a forest business sectoral sustainability strategy, and the introduction of a UK Standard for independent certification of forests.
<P>

<a name="20411w28.html_para4">It was, of course, this work on certification which led to the Forestry Commission recently being awarded the World Wide Fund for Nature's Gift to the Earth Award.

Many private owners are now following suit.

<a name="20411w28.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher:  </B> 
The management, conservation and sustainable development of forests was one of the key issues at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. The main outcome for forests was the adoption of a Statement of Forest Principles which included a commitment by countries to publish national forest programmes. In 1994 the UK set out its aims for forestry in <i>Sustainable Forestry&#151;the UK Programme</i>. In 1999, we published our strategy for sustainable development for the UK, <i>A Better Quality of Life</i>. This includes a section on forests and woodlands setting out the contribution that forestry can make to meeting sustainable management of forests in the UK. We also facilitated the development of the <i>UK Woodland Assurance Standard</i> for forest certification and environmental labelling of wood products. About 40 per cent. of the UK's woodlands have now been certified, including the entire public forest estate.
<P>

<a name="20411w28.html_para6">The UK has made considerable progress on forestry issues by increasing timber production and the environmental and social outputs from forests. These outputs are reported in British Timber Statistics and Forestry Commission Facts and Figures, which are in the Library of the House. Following consultation with stakeholder groups and the public, the Forestry Commission will be publishing a new set of indicators of sustainable forestry in the UK. These will make an important contribution to the monitoring processes set out in <i>A Better Quality of Life</i> and the <i>UK Forestry Standard</i>.

DEFRA's Ministerial team and officials already take full account of the interests of the food and farming industries in developing and delivering Government policy, in liaison and co-operation with others in Government. The creation of DEFRA signalled our intention to deal with and balance the needs of these industries, the wider rural economy and communities, and the urban and rural environment in the round. The Prime Minister and Secretary of State's seminar on 26 March with leaders of farming, food, rural, environmental and consumer bodies exemplified this approach. The seminar served to initiate a comprehensive process of engagement with a wide range of stakeholders. This process will help inform the construction of a new strategy for sustainable food and farming to be launched this autumn.

The target will not be met for several reasons including that progress towards re-establishing beef export markets has been severely hindered by the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic and the continuing illegal French import ban. The conditions of the Date-based Export Scheme have also discouraged potential exporters which is why we are pressing for a relaxation of the Scheme requirements to permit establishments to be dedicated to export on certain days rather than full time.

The Government's assistance to the Overseas Territories has declined gradually from &#163;52.6 million in 1997&#150;98, when the Montserrat volcanic crisis was at its height, to &#163;39.6 million in 2000&#150;01. The British Virgin Islands graduated last year from the need for our support; and programmes in Anguilla and Turks and Caicos Islands are now limited to technical assistance. Financial aid, however, continues to be provided for both St Helena and Montserrat. Our ultimate goal, which is shared by the Overseas Territories, is to increase local self-sufficiency to levels where our assistance is no longer required.

Substantial progress has been made, since the onset of the volcanic crisis, in returning normality to life in the northern half of the island. Basic infrastructure and essential public services have been restored; housing has been provided for those in need; and a range of expertise has been supplied in support of Montserrat's efforts to recover from the crisis. The focus now is upon sustainable development and eventual return to self-sufficiency for the island. With this in mind, a new airstrip and measures to attract specialist tourism and private sector investment are under consideration. A new volcano monitoring facility, incorporating special viewing areas for visitors, will be commissioned later this year. The volcano, now scientifically classifed as "persistently active", continues to pose a threat to the southern half of the island, including the former capital town of Plymouth. These areas remain uninhabitable. The risk to northern areas of the island is presently judged to be negligible.

The project is the second phase of post-graduate training for primary healthcare managers at Bir Zeit University. The project began in 2000 and to date has spent approximately &#163;1.1 million. In 2000 it spent &#163;0.7 million, &#163;0.3 million in 2001 and &#163;0.1 million so far this financial year. An initial estimate of the damage is approximately &#163;28,000.

There are severe localised food shortages in parts of Malawi. At this time of year most households depend on the market for basic foods, but grain prices have risen enormously, reducing access by the poor. The maize crop to be harvested from April onwards will provide some relief, but consumption of green maize may have had a significant impact on overall yields and therefore on household food security. Shortages can be expected throughout the 2002&#150;03 agricultural season.

DFID's aim is the elimination of poverty. The UN Millennium Development Goals are the main yardsticks against which we measure progress towards this aim. At country level progress towards development goals is principally the responsibility of African governments, in partnership with the donor community. The international community is working with developing countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa, to promote country-led and participatory Poverty Reduction Strategy processes. These processes are intended to develop national policy strategies, agree priorities, and help to develop an institutional framework in which governments can be held to account by their own citizens. The role of donors is to provide financial and technical support to enhance governments' capacity to develop and implement these strategies.
<P>

<a name="20411w33.html_para3">Aid effectiveness has improved in recent years, partly as a result of increasing international agreement on how aid can be most effective in reducing poverty and building capacity in the poorest countries. The evidence shows that aid is effective particularly in those countries with good policy environments and where there are large numbers of poor people, and in such situations has been effective in promoting economic development and poverty reduction. In Uganda aid has supported growth (averaging around 7 per cent. over the past decade) with extreme poverty reduced by over 20 per cent. since 1992, to 35 per cent. of the population. In Tanzania, where GDP growth has more than doubled between 1988 and 2001, HIPC benefits, World Bank and donor aid have helped finance primary education, with net enrolment in primary schools increased from 57 per cent. in 1999 to 65 per cent. in 2001.

From 1995&#150;2002, the Mount Cameroon Project team worked closely with the Cameroon Ministry of Environment and Forests to establish field level community management of timber and wildlife resources. The Community Forestry Development Project in Cameroon continues to work up these and other field projects into ways for communities to manage their wildlife resources under the Forest Law.

DFID routinely assesses the effectiveness of the methodologies used in poverty reduction initiatives. Participatory poverty assessments (PPAs) are an important tool used widely in poverty reduction programmes to ensure that decision-makers are aware of poor people's views.

Our Country Strategy Paper is focused on encouraging the sustainable management of forestry resources, of which bushmeat forms a part. The Community Forestry Development Project is working within the Government of Cameroon to establish community wildlife protocols for sustainable bushmeat harvesting. We are supporting the development of a Forestry and Environment Sector programme, one of the conditions for which is enhanced provision for poaching control campaigns. The programme will include a substantial community natural resource management component.

DFID has undertaken a Wildlife and Poverty Study to identify how best to ensure that poor people's wildlife resources are used for effective poverty reduction. We are pleased with the initial Phase One report and the public interest it has attracted.

It highlights the lack of reliable aggregate data as to the extent of this dependence, the difficulty and expense of collecting that data, given that so much of the bushmeat trade is illegal, and the lack of proven instruments to enable poor people to manage bushmeat resources sustainably.

refugees have been able to return home from Pakistan through the joint voluntary repatriation programme established by the Pakistani and Afghan Governments with UNHCR. However, significant numbers continue to cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan, particularly into Balochistan province, with 10,000 Afghans crossing in the past week. UNHCR reports the majority are fleeing drought conditions in Afghanistan; some are now discussing returning to Afghanistan.

<a name="20411w34.html_para4">DFID has provided &#163;3 million to UNHCR's operations, in response to the current crisis, to support its operations for refugees in the region, including in Balochistan province. This has included technical personnel, material and financial support. At the request of UNHCR, we have provided three relief flights to Iran and Pakistan transporting tents, shelter material and communications equipment. We have also provided a specialist site planner to UNHCR in Pakistan to assist with the setting up of new refugee camp sites. UNHCR and its partners are working to improve the conditions in all refugee camps, including the water supply, sanitation and health facilities in the waiting area at the border. We have also provided &#163;7 million to the World Food Programme's regional programme, which includes food aid support to refugees in Pakistan&#151;7,000 families waiting to enter Pakistan have been provided food rations. In addition we have provided &#163;6 million to NGOs, much of which has been directed towards Afghans in neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, and &#163;11 million to support communities in Pakistan most affected by the influx of refugees. We have also provided &#163;15 million to support the Government of Pakistan in its economic reforms.

Relations between Afghan refugees and local communities in Balochistan are reported by agencies in the region to be reasonable in areas where refugee communities are established. The current influx of 40,000 new refugees is reported to have increased tensions somewhat in the Chaman border area, particularly over water supplies, but no major incidents have occurred.

Donors and developing countries committed themselves to a new partnership in the "Monterrey Consensus". Developing countries recognised that they need to set in place the right policies to create an enabling environment for foreign direct investment and for the mobilisation of domestic resources through promoting good governance and pro-poor economic policies. In return donor countries agreed to provide better support for developing country efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals

by: giving more official development assistance; enhancing aid effectiveness; ensuring better market access for developing countries; providing support to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to negotiate in international trade fora; ensuring that the HIPC process provides heavily indebted poor countries with a genuine exit from unsustainable debt; and taking steps to strengthen the voice of developing countries in the international financial institutions.
<P>

<a name="20411w35.html_para0">At the Barcelona Council on 15 March, the European Union agreed a package of measures to support the Monterrey Consensus. This included a commitment to increase EU development assistance. The EU average oda/GNI ratio is currently 0.33 per cent., and the EU has committed itself to raise this average to 0.39 per cent. by 2006. The implication of this is that the EU will provide an additional $20 billion of oda between now and 2006, and an additional $7 billion a year from 2006. The Americans followed the EU lead on aid volume by announcing that they would provide an additional $10 billion between 2004 and 2006 and $5 billion a year thereafter. This represents a 50 per cent. increase in US aid. Financing for Development is the first UN Conference that has delivered a concrete increase in oda, and the additional $12 billion a year from the EU and the USA represents a historic reverse in the decline in global oda levels over the 12 years.

The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is not a financing mechanism or an institution that runs projects. Rather, it is an African-owned and led process which encourages African nations to share best practice, undertake peer review and learn from successful experience in building effective states and reducing poverty. It has not yet sought direct funding. Proposals are currently being developed by NEPAD with the assistance of different African institutions in the areas of economic and corporate governance, infrastructure, agriculture and market access, financial and banking standards, and peace and security.
