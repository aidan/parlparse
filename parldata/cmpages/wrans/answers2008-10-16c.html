<i> [holding answer 14 October 2008]:</i><i> </i>The Government are committed to paying the right benefits to the right people at the right time. As part of that commitment we have specific strategies in place to tackle both fraud and error.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="81016w0003.htm_para0"><a name="08101683000266">We have a well defined and successful strategy for tackling benefit fraud based on preventing, detecting and deterring fraud.

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="81016w0003.htm_para2"><a name="08101683000268">We are now applying the same drive and determination to tackle error. In January 2006, the Department created a task force with a specific aim of reducing official error in the most vulnerable benefits and has subsequently published and implemented its first ever error reduction strategy, published in January 2007. The strategy addresses both over and underpayments and is based on preventing new error from entering the system; ensuring that customers and staff comply with benefit rules and identifying and correcting existing errors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="81016w0003.htm_para3"><a name="08101683000269">The Department has also established a dedicated Benefit Simplification Unit to tackle complexity in the benefits system which is a major cause of error.</p>

English Heritage has invested over &#163;21 million to improve the visitor experience at sites like Kenilworth, Battle Abbey and Audley End. English Heritage average admission prices have traditionally been behind that of the market. In 2007-08 the average adult admission charge for English Heritage properties was &#163;4.09, while the average for all attractions in England was &#163;5.00.</p>

<i> [holding answer 13 October 2008]:</i> A first pilot of a mobile detention solution ended in January 2008. It focused on the needs of immigration officers operating at small ports without short term holding facilities. The deployment in Poole and Newhaven was used to hold people discovered in vehicle searches as a more secure alternative to transporting them to police stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="81016w0017.htm_para0"><a name="08101698000311">The integration of customs and immigration activity at ports as part of the creation of the United Kingdom Border Agency has led to a review of existing port holding facilities. That will inform a future decision on the deployment of any future mobile capability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="81016w0017.htm_para1"><a name="08101698000312">During the course of the pilot, the merit of using this type of facility for both pre-planned enforcement operations and to apprehend illegal immigrants was also considered. As a result, the need for a revised vehicle specification was identified to provide the additional flexibility required by UKBA's operational enforcement officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="81016w0017.htm_para2"><a name="08101698000313">Using the revised specification, a second mobile detention pilot started in the Northampton area on 30 September 2008.</p>

 None. Drinking banning orders have not yet been commenced under the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006.

 Motoring offence statistics do not identify the place of residence of those offered fixed penalties or whose licences are endorsed by court order. The offer of a fixed penalty, whether or not accompanied by penalty points, is not automatic, but a matter of police operational discretion in every case. If a case goes to court and is endorsable the court will decide the number of penalty points to be endorsed, within the scale prescribed for the offence, or may decide for special reasons not to order endorsement.</p>

<p><a name="st_316"><a name="0810171000184"><a name="81016w0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="0810171002037"><b>Ann Keen:</b>
 The free universal check up for those aged over 40, to which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister referred on 23 September, is the vascular checks programme. This will put in place an integrated, systematic population-wide vascular risk assessment and management programme for those between the ages of 40 and 74. The programme will assess people&#146;s risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease. People will be recalled every five years unless they are identified as having a high risk of vascular disease or have previously untreated or undiagnosed existing vascular disease, in which case they will be managed appropriately through primary care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="81016w0021.htm_para0"><a name="0810171000185">The vascular check will include a number of well-evidenced tests for vascular disease and diabetes risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol measurement, and Body Mass Index and questions such as age, gender, smoking status, physical activity, and family history. Each person will be given the results of their tests, which will be an individual assessment of their vascular risk, and advice on how to manage it. Following this, appropriate interventions will be offered depending on the individual&#146;s level of risk. We estimate it will take two appointments at about 15 minutes each to complete the check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="81016w0021.htm_para1"><a name="0810171000186">The check is designed to be undertaken in a variety of settings to ensure maximum possible take up. For example, it can be undertaken in a general practitioners surgery, a pharmacy or other community settings such as community centres. Primary care trusts (PCTs) will commission this service and in doing so will decide the most appropriate locations in which it should be delivered bearing in mind the local needs and circumstances of their population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="81016w0021.htm_para2"><a name="0810171000187">It is difficult to estimate the number of tests that will be undertaken during the first year of implementation in 2009-10 since many PCTs are already running vascular checks type programmes in their areas. Also, implementation of this programme will be phased and so the number of checks carried out in the first year will depend on the pace at which each PCT decides to roll it out. The estimated average cost of a vascular check used in the first phase of the modelling that underpins this programme was in the region of &#163;33.50. This figure may be subject to change as further modelling work is currently underway to refine costings, following a consultation exercise over the summer. The funding to implement this programme will be allocated to PCTs.</p>

 Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the NHS in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been on-going improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.

 The information requested by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) cannot be separately identified on the Cabinet Office&#146;s accounting system. To seek to identify the costs involved would require consulting individual budget holders across the Department who in turn would have to identify relevant expenditure in order to obtain a total for the Department. The Department estimates that the cost of obtaining this information would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold as stated by my hon. Friend the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury on 28 November 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 87WS.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

*** 10 &lt; CV &lt; 20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV ≥ 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>

 Start-up grants for academies are designed to enable a new body&#151;the academy trust&#151;to effect a complete educational transformation for the pupils. To this end, start-up grant provides for substantial new resources in terms of books, equipment and materials. If the academy is not full, start-up grant also helps meet the overhead costs of the senior and middle management teams, so that these can be of a size and quality to carry through that transformation, and various transitional costs during the period in which new buildings are being constructed. It also meets necessary expenditure on transforming the ethos of an academy such as uniform and induction costs. The length of time over which start-up grant is payable depends on the rate of pupil build-up and building completion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="81016w0029.htm_para13"><a name="08101722000024">The level of start-up grant for academies is therefore, in most cases, substantially higher than that for a Fresh Start school, which has a more limited purpose. Giving poorly performing schools a Fresh Start can be a very successful way to raise standards. In some cases, this may be the appropriate short-term action, prior to a long term solution such as an Academy or a Trust. Giving a school a fresh start means closing and reopening it on the same site under the normal school reorganisation procedures. Schools requiring a Fresh Start are allocated revenue and capital funding on the basis of need based on the size and phase of the school. Capital resources to support a Fresh Start of a school will involve either a re-build of the school or development of suitable teaching facilities needed at neighbouring school to enable closure of the school needing a fresh start.</p>

4. Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>
5. The actual revenue funding that individual schools in England receive via their school budget shares is a matter for individual local authorities to decide locally through their own local funding formulae (subject to satisfying the minimum funding guarantee for schools from 2004-05 onwards). Consequently, the amount of money allocated to each school in England depends very much on the individual local authorities&#146; own policy for funding their schools. Different authorities retain varying amounts of funding centrally to spend on behalf of their schools while others chose to give schools more autonomy over how they spend their money by devolving more funding to the individual schools.<br>
