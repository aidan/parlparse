<a name="00606w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ronnie Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what advice he has received from the Environment Agency on a possible extension of the salmon netting season in North-East England.  [124985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following a debate in the House on 10 November 1999, I undertook to obtain advice from the Environment Agency on the implications of extending the salmon netting season by 20 days in North-East England. I emphasised that I would not wish to proceed with any measure that was not in the interests of salmon conservation. I also sought the Agency's advice on whether additional measures were needed to conserve large salmon in river fisheries in the autumn, particularly in the North-East.
<P>

<a name="00606w01.html_para0">I have now received the Agency's advice, which I have accepted. I am placing a copy in the Library of the House. In summary, the Agency has advised that such an extension would substantially increase the level of exploitation of both multi-sea-winter salmon and grilse and would not be in the interests of salmon conservation. The Agency does not believe at present that there is an immediate need for further measures to restrict exploitation by either rods or nets in North-East England, and notes that half of the rod catch in North-East England in 1999 was released. Nevertheless, it will continue to keep the position under review.

 The figures are set out in the table. Most but not all will be transferred to the farming industry. The farming industry also benefits from higher food prices as a result of the CAP, which are paid for by consumers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what percentage of claims under the over-30-months slaughter scheme for the period between 29 April and 25 May 1996 remain unresolved.  [123435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In July 1999, the Agricultural Departments put in place arrangements for the Intervention Board Executive Agency to make ex gratia payments in respect of certain bovine animals, referred to as "Early Casualty Cases". These were casualty animals requiring emergency slaughter on welfare grounds, and which could not be presented onto the Over-30-months Slaughter Scheme between 29 April and 24 May (9 June in Scotland) 1996 solely due to the limited casualty processing facilities then available under the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00606w01.html_para1">Applications for Early Casualty Case payment were invited during the period 23 July to 31 August 1999. The Intervention Board received claims for payment on 132 animals put down during the relevant period in 1996, and a written response has been provided to each of these. Therefore, no cases remain unresolved.
<P>

<a name="00606w01.html_para2">Payment was made in respect of 115 animals. Eleven were found to be not payable, and six did not respond to requests for further information.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hurst: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what payments were made under the over-30-months scheme in each month during the past two years.  [123411]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The number of animals slaughtered under the OTMS and the amounts of compensation paid in each month over the period are set out in the table. It is not possible to relate directly the compensation paid to the number of animals slaughtered in any month mainly because payments are generally made up to five weeks after the date of slaughter. Apart from the compensation payments, expenditure totalling about &#163;115 million in 1998-99 and &#163;130 million in 1999-2000 was incurred for services such as slaughtering, rendering, incineration, storage and transport.

<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Minister raised the issue of the lifting of the US import ban on UK beef during his visit to the USA in February. The Chief Veterinary Officer and officials from our Embassy in Washington DC have also lobbied for the lifting of the US ban. The USA currently bans the import of beef from all European Union countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2000]:</i> Under state aid rules, the European Commission must approve the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS) before it can be introduced. To begin that process, the scheme was formally notified to the Commission on 30 March. The Commission has since carried out its initial study of the scheme and raised a number of questions; my officials have already answered these. The outgoers element of the scheme will be introduced as soon as possible following Commission approval. At present we are working towards introducing the ongoers element in early autumn. The outgoers scheme will operate using a sealed bid system, with the expectation that a good proportion of the &#163;26 million plus the additional funds for which bids have been made will be available for the ongoers element.

Additionally, the Food Standards Agency has recently commissioned a feasibility study of methods to monitor potential adverse reactions to novel foods and the outcome of this will help to establish whether, and if so in what form, a practical monitoring system might be established.

The coalition goes to exceptional lengths to ensure that the right target is hit, including the employment of very strict target clearance procedures and precision guided munitions. We conduct painstaking battle damage assessment after every bomb is dropped. For these reasons we are confident that, in the vast majority of cases, released ordnance by coalition aircraft lands on, or very close to, its intended target.

On a number of occasions the Iraqis have claimed that coalition aircraft have caused civilian casualties when allied aircraft have not released any munitions, or even been flying. The most recent example of this was on 17 May this year, when it seems very probable that the civilian casualties which the Iraqis claimed were caused by coalition activities, were in fact caused by an Iraqi air defence weapon.

 Further to my statement of 16 May 2000 in which I announced that it is our intention to lease four C-17 Globemaster aircraft to meet the Royal Air Force short to medium term airlift requirement: following termination of the original Short Term Strategic Airlift competition on 5 August 1999, the Ministry of Defence explored a number of options. These included discussions with Boeing and the US Government on ways of reducing the cost of meeting the RAF's requirement with a possible C-17 lease package. These discussions focused on the most cost-effective means of providing training and logistic support. Following our decision to lease four C-17 aircraft, a UK/US Government agreement has now been signed to provide C-17 training and training support services for the programme at an approximate cost of &#163;8 million. A similar agreement will be put in place to cover the logistic support for the aircraft, but the details, including final costs, have yet to be agreed. Both agreements are expected to run for the full term of the aircraft lease.

 The Government keep the obscenity laws under general review and are determined to ensure that they remain effective in protecting the rights and freedoms of different people to have access to, and to be protected from, certain types of material. The Obscene Publications Act 1959 continues to provide a flexible regulatory tool, applying equally now to material published on the internet as it does to other media. Data for 1998 show that the Act continues to be effective with 196 prosecutions under the Act, 176 of which led to convictions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Video Recordings Act 1984 requires that all videos, apart from a small category of exempt works, must be submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for classification. I am satisfied that, in general, the Act provides an effective means of regulating material released on video. I am concerned, however, about the implications of a recent High Court judgment for the small category of videos classified as suitable for sale only in licensed sex shops to those aged 18 and above (Restricted (18) videos).
<P>

<a name="00606w04.html_para3">On 16 May, the High Court dismissed the BBFC's application for Judicial Review in respect of appeals against their decision not to classify seven sexually explicit videos in the Restricted 18 (R18) category. The Board had focused their application for Judicial Review 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jun 2000 : Column: 178W</I><P>
on the possible harm which the videos might cause to potential viewers, particularly children. I am considering the implications of the Court's decision and intend to publish a Consultation Paper shortly to seek views on whether there are any additional steps that can be taken to protect children from exposure to sexually explicit material.
<P>

<a name="00606w04.html_para4">Under the Video Recordings Act 1984, I am responsible for designating the authority responsible for classifying videos. I have so designated the President and the two Vice-Presidents of the BBFC. The designated authority is required to submit an annual report to me, which is then laid before both Houses of Parliament. I laid the report for 1999 on 24 May. Since his appointment as President of the BBFC, Andreas Whittam Smith has held two series of 'roadshows' in cities around the country as part of a dialogue with the public on classification policy. The Board is also conducting separate research surveys about its classification policy with members of the public.
<P>

<a name="00606w04.html_para5">The Video Appeals Committee is responsible for considering appeals by distributors against the decisions of the BBFC. It contributes to the Board's Annual Report which contains a section on the appeals they have considered together with a list of all its members. Appeal hearings are also open to members of the public.

<P>
<a name="00606w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The information requested is shown in the following table. The latest provisional estimates for January 2000 show that as few as 0.9 per cent. of pupils were in one teacher classes of over 35 pupils in maintained secondary schools in Kingston upon Thames local education authority area.
<P>

<a name="00606w05.html_para0">Provisional national estimates of class sizes in maintained secondary schools in England were published in Statistical First Release "Class sizes in maintained schools in England: January 2000" on 14 April 2000. Information by local education authority area has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00606w05.html_para1">The element within the Kingston upon Thames SSA which relates to secondary pupils of compulsory school age has risen from &#163;19.44 million in 1997-98 to &#163;22.70 million in 2000-01. Over the same period, funding per secondary pupil of compulsory school age in the local education authority has increased in real terms from &#163;3,010 to &#163;3,300. It is open to Kingston upon Thames to use some of these increased resources to employ extra teachers.
<P>

<a name="00606w05.html_para2">In addition, schools in Kingston upon Thames received a total of &#163;791,000 in direct grants in May 2000 as their share of the &#163;290 million funding increase that was announced in the Budget of 21 March 2000.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service aims to make a major contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market and to the Government's objectives of high and stable employment and growth, equality of opportunity and social inclusion. ES works closely with employers and with its private, voluntary and public sector partners to provide a quality service for all people without a job and to promote employment opportunities for all who can work. It aims to attract a diverse range of vacancies and to fill those vacancies quickly by matching the right people and skills with the right jobs. Its chief priority is to help individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It does this through correct application of the JSA regime, delivery of the New Deals and the pilot ONE service, and provision of appropriate information, advice, training and support. The Agency has achieved much over the past three years. The challenge and opportunity now facing it is to sustain continuous improvement in its services to jobseekers and employers and to make those services more accessible and relevant to customer needs, through effective use of modern technology and close working with a wide range of partners.</FONT></UL>

Finland are carrying out a full life cycle risk assessment of MTBE under the European Communities Existing Substances Regulation (793/93/EEC) in order to decide whether any further measures are necessary to protect human health and/or the environment. The draft risk assessment is due to be discussed in depth for the first time by the EU technical experts in June this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will list the sites at which toxic ash from Byker Heat and Transfer Station, Newcastle, was spread in contravention of the operating licence; when this contravention was first reported to the Environmental Agency and when action was taken to correct it; and if the remedial action has been completed at all locations;  [123748]

<UL>(2) what investigations have been made, and what conclusions have been reached, by the Environment Agency about soil, plant and animal contamination at Byker City Farm, Newcastle; what caused those investigations to be made; and when they started.  [123851]<P></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> The Byker Reclamation Plant is the subject of two Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) authorisations issued by the Environment Agency under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. While the IPC authorisation for the Heat Station provides that landfill is the preferred waste disposal option for ash from the plant, disposal by another means is not in contravention of the authorisation. This is because the disposal of waste is subject to the duty of care and the waste management licensing provisions of Part II of the 1990 Act, and section 28 of the Act provides that no condition shall be attached to an IPC authorisation to regulate the final disposal of waste.
<P>

<a name="00606w09.html_para10">The possibility that ash from the plant might have been used for the construction of footpaths and other purposes was first raised by a local resident during discussions with the Environment Agency on another mater in August 1999. At a public meeting organised by Newcastle City Council on 19 January 2000, it was confirmed by the City Council that sampling would be undertaken to establish the composition of the ash. The Environment Agency then wrote to the City Council's direct works contractor, "Cityworks", on 2 February to request details of the dates, locations and quantities of ash used for the construction of footpaths etc. The sites which have identified as receiving ash from the Heat Plant, and the estimated tonnages, are as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment the Environment Agency has made of the likelihood of storm flow and storm sewer overflow, into Jesmond Dene and Ouseburn, Newcastle; and what the likelihood will be if the Newcastle Great Park scheme in its present form is fully developed.  [123852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> I understand from the Environment Agency that improvement work has been carried out to intermittent discharges that can, under storm conditions, discharge diluted sewage to the Ouse Burn. These improvements are at Acomb Crescent on the Red House Farm Estate and Three Mile Inn at Gosforth. Further improvement works on the Lower Ouse Burn at Byker are at the design stage. Other sources of contamination include the de-icing run-off from Newcastle Airport which has affected the entire length of the Ouse Burn. The Agency has developed a scheme with the Airport and Northumbrian Water that now conveys the run-off to Howden sewage works for treatment, with notable water quality improvements.
<P>

<a name="00606w10.html_para0">Potential sources of pollution from Newcastle Great Park have been pre-empted by the Agency at the planning stage. The developers have been encouraged to incorporate Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs) into their proposals which will mean that water quality will be maintained or perhaps even improved if the

 Designation of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) is the responsibility of the Countryside Agency, subject to confirmation in each case by the Secretary of State. I am not aware of any plans by the Agency to designate the Welland Valley as an AONB.

<P>
<P>

 Bilateral air services agreements are based on the principle of fair and equal opportunity, and this requires that rights are granted reciprocally. The UK-US negotiations are conducted in accordance with this same principle.

<P>
<a name="00606w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 UK charter passenger airlines already have reciprocal rights under the Bermuda II arrangements, and dominate the UK-US charter market. We continue to press the US Government to open up their domestic market to UK cargo carriers.

 The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force, which was set up by my Department in 1997 to look at practical ways of reducing vehicle emissions, is publishing its final report, "The way forward--the final report of the Cleaner Vehicles Task Force", today. The report covers five main areas:

<a name="00606w11.html_para5">There has already been progress on the Task Force's interim recommendations, published in the 1999 report "Driving the Agenda". For instance, we announced in March that we would be spending &#163;6 million this year on a Cleaner Vehicles Programme to take forward the Task Force's recommendations on retrofitting. Industry has acted too, with the motor industry adopting a label providing information about emissions on all new cars. We look forward to seeing rapid progress on the recommendations contained in this report.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para6">Copies of the final report, along with a background paper published by the Task Force on the environmental impacts of vehicle production and disposal and the reports of the Technology and Testing and Alternative Fuels sub-group, are available in the House Library.

<P>
<a name="00606w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> We shall ensure that the process of sifting will be open to public scrutiny during public consultation on the shortlisted options following completion of the study.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para7">A very large number of options will be considered during the sifting process, which is designed to reduce the options to a manageable number, so that those can be appraised in sufficient detail to support a meaningful public consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Director General of Water Services. He has set out his position on the balance between measured and unmeasured water charges in "Tariff structure and charges: 2000-01 report", a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are no plans to meter all domestic properties, so no estimate has been made of the cost of doing so. Under the Water Industry Act 1999, companies in England and Wales must install a meter in any home when requested by the consumer, free of initial charge. The number of meters installed will depend on consumer choices. In his determination of water company price limits, the Director General of Water Services has allowed for &#163;202 million capital and &#163;53 million operating expenditure for the costs of installing optional meters in 2000-05.

<a name="00606w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Director General of Water Services publishes an annual report on "Tariff structure and charges", a copy of which is in the Library of the House. This report gives details of the percentage of domestic properties who pay for water supplies according to volume. The figure for 2000-01 is estimated to be 19.6 per cent., based on forecast data provided by water companies. The equivalent figure for 1999-2000 was 17.1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para12">In some instances a property may be fitted with a meter, but be charged on an unmetered basis. The Director General of Water Services collects only information relating to the number of meters that are installed and used as the basis for charging.

[124649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government published "Water Industry Act 1999: Consultation on Regulations" on 12 October 1999, a copy of which is in the Library of the House. Fifty-three responses were received relating to the proposals for assisting low-income households who pay by meter.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para13">Following that consultation, the Government laid the Water Industry (Charges) (Vulnerable Groups) Regulations 1999 on 22 December 1999, and made minor clarificatory amendments in the Water Industry (Charges) (Vulnerable Groups) (Amendment) Regulations 2000, which were laid on 3 March 2000. Both came into force on 1 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para14">The Regulations offer assistance to low-income households with water meters, who might face hardship as a result of high water use for basic household purposes.

 Under the Water Industry Act 1999, companies must produce charges schemes, which include details of the basis on which they wish to charge for water and sewerage services to homes. Schemes are subject to approval by the Director General of Water Services.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para18">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has issued guidance to the Director General on the approval of schemes for companies operating wholly or mainly in England. In considering whether or not to approve a new basis of unmeasured charging, key factors are the transitional effects of any change, any proposals for managing such effects and the impact of the new basis of charging on different groups, particularly vulnerable customers. Because of the potential social impacts on customers, the Director should not approve the widespread introduction of new unmeasured charging arrangements, without full consultation with the Secretary of State. The Government will continue to consider any proposals that come forward provided that they address the key factors.
<P>

<a name="00606w11.html_para19">The Secretary of State's guidance under the 1999 Act and other background on water charging policy is set out in "Water Industry Act 1999--Delivering the Government's Objectives" published on 3 February, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

 Water companies do not charge their customers for payment of bills at post offices. Post Office Counters Ltd. levy a handling charge (currently &#163;1 per transaction) for paying bills at post offices. This charge does not apply to GiroBank account holders.
<P>

<a name="00606w12.html_para0">There is significant variation in the policy of water companies in England towards payment of water bills at Post Offices. Information available from water companies indicates that five companies currently subsidise all of any Post Office handling charge on behalf of their customers:

<a name="00606w12.html_para14">Payment arrangements for the other companies vary. Such arrangements include part-subsidising the Post Office handling charge, or fully subsidising it for certain groups of customers (such as pensioners). All companies which do not offer an option to pay free of charge at Post Offices offer alternative locations (such as banks and shops) where free payments can be made.
<P>

<a name="00606w12.html_para15">Under the Water Industry Act 1999, water companies have to submit their charges schemes to the Director General of Water Services for approval. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has issued guidance to the Director General of Water Services on the approval of schemes, which encourages companies to offer a range of payment options to customers, particularly those on low incomes, which they can take up at no extra cost. In approving schemes for 2000-01, the Director required all companies to ensure that charges schemes made provision for making cash payments free of charge at reasonably accessible locations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will make a statement on the progress of granting special status for the Forest of Dean; and what advice he has given to local planning authorities concerning the Forest of Dean and the local minerals plan;  [124168]

<a name="00606w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Countryside Agency decided in November last year not to pursue the designation of the Forest of Dean as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty at this time but instead to devise a package of regeneration measures to deliver integrated rural development in the Forest.
<P>

<a name="00606w12.html_para16">The Government Office for the South West has submitted comments to Gloucestershire County Council on the initial and revised deposit drafts of the Minerals Local Plan, with a request that they be drawn to the attention of the Inspector at any public local inquiry and be made public. We are still considering a proposal from the Countryside Agency that we should advise the Council to treat the Forest of Dean as if it were an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty for the purposes of the Minerals Local Plan.

<a name="00606w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Countryside Agency. The Agency's approved budget of &#163;55.1 million for this year has been set against its main objectives as agreed with my Department. The Agency is responsible for the allocation of moneys within the budget to individual projects. I understand that a project officer has been appointed to take forward the delivery of integrated rural development in the Forest of Dean.

<P>
<a name="00606w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 When the review of Part L of the Building Regulations was announced in February 1998 it was indicated that this would be a very open process with full consultation on what might be included in the review in advance of the development of the proposals by the Building Regulations Advisory Committee. This open process has been widely welcomed, but has raised a number of issues that have had to be explored before fully considered proposals for public consultations could be published. However, it is expected that the proposals will be published shortly with responses requested by the end of September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency understands that there are three levels of flag symbols used to signify the safety level of swimming conditions on bathing beaches.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Red and Yellow flags signify that Lifeguards are on patrol and that Swimming or Boogie Boarding should only take place in the area between the flags.</FONT></UL>

 The then Secretary of State for Transport announced in Parliament on 9 March 1992, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 409-10W, that following acceptance of the recommendations of the coastal review that the role of Her Majesty's Coastguard needed to be clearly defined and promulgated and that by the authority given to him by the Coastguard Act 1925 it had been agreed that:
<P>

<a name="00606w13.html_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Her Majesty's Coastguard is responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of civil maritime search and rescue within the United Kingdom search and rescue region. This includes the mobilisation, organisation and tasking of adequate resources to respond to persons either in distress at sea, or to persons at risk of injury or death on the cliffs or shoreline of the United Kingdom.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00606w13.html_para1">Thus, in response to incidents on or to seaward of recognised recreational beaches, HM Coastguard can mobilise, task and co-ordinate search and rescue helicopters, RNLI inshore and all-weather lifeboats, Coastguard Rescue Teams and Beach Lifeguard Units where provided by local authorities. Elsewhere on the coast the same search and rescue units can be mobilised and tasked though Beach Lifeguard Units are not normally found other than on recreational beaches.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w13.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the possible correlation between the age of fishing vessels and accidents involving fire, explosion, foundering and loss of life for <i>(a)</i> over 12 metre and <i>(b)</i> under 12 metre vessels.  [124485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Marine Accidents Investigation Branch (MAIB) has examined all reported accidents to UK fishing vessels, irrespective of length, involving fires and explosions, and floodings and founderings from 1992 to September 1999. No examination has been made of the correlation between the age of fishing vessels and the fatal accidents.
<P>

<a name="00606w13.html_para2">The MAIB's figures show that the accident rate for floodings and founderings, for under 12 metre vessels up to 10 years old, and for over 12 metre vessels up to 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jun 2000 : Column: 211W</I><P>
20 years old, is unremarkable but deteriorates thereafter. For all vessels more than 40 years old, the rate improves. For fires and explosions the correlation is similar to floodings and founderings for vessels over 12 metre vessels, but there is no meaningful correlation for under 12 metre vessels as the number reported to the MAIB is small.
<P>

<a name="00606w13.html_para3">The MAIB concludes generally that the accident rate increases for all vessels in the 20 to 40 bracket largely because maintenance does not reach the level required to prevent these types of accidents. However, the rate improves for vessels more than 40 years old because the worse performing vessels have been removed from the fleet, and the remainder have been extensively refurbished.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received on his Department's plans to reform trust ports, specifically with regard to plans to abolish the present trust port election system.  [124574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Our plans for reform of trust ports are set out in "Modernising Trust Ports--A guide to good governance" published in January. This guidance, drawn up with the assistance of trust ports and the Scottish Executive, includes advice on the appointment process in trust ports. In a few trust ports appointments are made by local election. We have not proposed to abolish these arrangements but we have offered further advice on improvements to ensure that elections are held in a more open and accountable manner. We have only received representations from two Scottish ports, which are being considered by the Scottish Executive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Our proposals seek to improve democratic accountability by ensuring that local elections for trust port boards reflect current electoral standards and are more representative of each port's community of stakeholders. Such improvements are also intended to deliver candidates with the skills required for governance of the ports.

<a name="00606w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government and the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) will publish their "Revitalising Health and Safety" Strategy Statement tomorrow, and copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House. The strategy is about improving health and safety conditions in all of Britain's workplaces.
<P>

<a name="00606w13.html_para5">The Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 was a landmark in making Britain's workplaces safer. The Act provides for good, effective regulation of health and safety and has transformed Britain's workplaces. We can see the results--the number of deaths at work today is a quarter of the 1971 level. Britain is now one of the safest countries in which to work. But in today's modern economy, it is unacceptable that hundreds of people still die in workplace accidents, and 25,000 more leave the workforce never to return as a result of being injured, or made ill, by their work.
<P>

<a name="00606w13.html_para6">This Government are determined to build a fair and decent society for everyone, not just the few. A better deal for working people is central to that vision--safe and healthy working conditions are at the core of that vision. Tomorrow, the Government and the HSC will embark on a new 10 year programme of improvement. For the first time ever, the Government and the HSC will set national targets to cut work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses. We will implement 44 separate measures to that end. These will include motivating employers to raise their game, giving further support to the important work done by safety representatives, and giving more help to small firms in their management of health and safety. Above all, we will inject new impetus into the health and safety system to prevent accidents and ill health causing misery to thousands of people.

<a name="00606w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 On 14 December 1999 I announced that, as part of the Government's programme of regular five-yearly finance, management and policy reviews of non-departmental public bodies, my Department would be conducting a thorough review of The Housing Corporation in 2000.




<P>
<P><I>6 Jun 2000 : Column: 213W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00606w14.html_para0">The "Prior Options" stage of the review has been completed and I have placed a copy of the report in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00606w14.html_para1">The purpose of the Prior Options stage was to assess the extent to which The Housing Corporation's functions were necessary for the achievement of the Government's policies, and whether there was scope for contracting out or transferring all or part of its functions to another body.
<P>

<a name="00606w14.html_para2">The Government's Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all" affirms the Government's commitment to improving the quality of social housing and its management, supporting the transfer of up to 200,000 homes from the local authority sector to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and to the continuing allocation of funding to RSLs for new social housing. There is therefore a continuing need for a mechanism to regulate the RSL sector to protect public investment, to promote improved performance in the sector and to allocate funding for new social housing. Against this background, the Government accept the Prior Options Review conclusions, that the Housing Corporation should continue to be responsible for registration and regulation of RSLs in England; should continue to allocate funds for new social housing; and that its status as a non-departmental public body remains appropriate to the Corporation's functions.
<P>

<a name="00606w14.html_para3">The Housing Corporation is already taking forward a number of recommendations in the report. In particular it is: strengthening its regulatory skills, especially in business and finance; working to establish a full Best Value regime to promote improved performance in the RSL sector; will set up an inspection process to support this regime; and will continue developing its funding arrangements and processes for making investment decisions.
<P>

<a name="00606w14.html_para4">The report identifies a number of issues to be examined in the second stage of the FMPR, including a review of the Corporation's organisational framework; exploring the options for an appeals mechanism for dealing with disputed regulatory judgments; the case for strengthening the Corporation's powers; agreeing a concordat between the Department and the Corporation for joint working on policy development; and reviewing targets set for the Corporation.
<P>

<a name="00606w14.html_para5">I am grateful for contributions received in the course of the Review from The Housing Corporation, National Housing Federation, local authority associations, Chartered Institute of Housing, Audit Commission, Council of Mortgage Lenders, individual RSLs and numerous other bodies and individuals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w15.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the annual cost of his Department's and its agencies administration of benefit payments <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> as a percentage of spending on benefit payments.  [124254]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The estimated cost of administering the social security benefit system in Northern Ireland in 1998-99, the latest year for which information is available, was &#163;125.6 million. This equates to 4 per cent. of benefit expenditure which amounted in total in that year to &#163;3,168.8 million.
<P>

<a name="00606w15.html_para0">Responsibility for this subject has been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly and is therefore no longer a matter for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w15.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what staff and technology are shared between his Department and its agencies and the Department of Social Security and its agencies; what work is undertaken <i>(a)</i> on behalf of the DSS and its agencies by his Department and its agencies and <i>(b)</i> by the DSS and its agencies on behalf of his Department or agencies in the last year; and what payments have been made in each case.  [124255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland does not share staff with the Department of Social Security (DSS) in Great Britain. The Department's Child Support Agency provides child support services for those DSS clients living in Eastern England. The Department receives &#163;25.5 million from DSS in respect of this business. The Social Security Agency also provides benefit processing and administration services to DSS for clients living in the Lewisham, Neasden and Brixton areas of London, for which it receives an annual payment of &#163;10.4 million from DSS. The Department also provides a storage and retrieval service to DSS for social security order book foils for which it receives an annual payment of &#163;4.9 million.
<P>

<a name="00606w15.html_para1">The Department for Social Development uses the DSS computer systems to administer social security benefits and to deliver Child Support services. The Department pays DSS &#163;7.7 million for the use of these systems and for the installation and maintenance of the equipment on which they run.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00606w15.html_para2">The DSS also provides the Department with a number of other ancillary services, such as publishing and distribution, fraud inspection, work measurement and Child Support decision making. DSS receive &#163;510,000 for these services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w15.html_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> This information is not available. For leisure centres, analysis carried out by Sport England in 1998 using the Facilities Planning Model developed in association with the Scottish Sports Council and Edinburgh University estimated that 96.6 per cent. of people living in England live within 15 minutes drive of a sports hall with at least three courts, and 85.1 per cent. of people in England live within 15 minutes drive of an indoor swimming pool. I have placed a copy of the Facilities Planning Guide published by Sport England in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if his Department will conduct an internal review under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information into the non-provision of the information requested by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central on regional ticket sales to the Millennium Experience.  [124365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00606w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> My hon. Friend the Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting wrote to my hon. Friend on 6 December 1999. Following an investigation by the New Millennium Experience Company into the pattern of ticket sales, it was discovered that most were purchased from central sales points, including the Dome call centre, and it is therefore impossible to provide any meaningful statistical breakdown of visitors by region. I am satisfied that the reason for the non-provision of information in this respect is that the information does not exist, rather than that it is being deliberately withheld.

 The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is required to meet the Government's clear inflation target of 2.5 per cent. RPIX inflation. Dual target systems have in the past led to macroeconomic instability for example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The MPC takes into account all relevant information, including asset prices, in making its judgment on interest rates to achieve the Government's inflation target.

 In line with the Government's commitment to provide security in retirement for the poorest pensioners, the minimum income guarantee has been increased by 4.6 per cent., in line with the increase in average earnings.

 The Government fully recognise the links between social deprivation, poor diet and physical inactivity. The Acheson report commissioned by the Government highlighted the phenomenon of food poverty as a very important consideration within public health. The link is confirmed by the recently published National Diet and Nutritional Survey for young people. This shows that, for example, among manual social groups only 22 per cent. of boys consume fruit compared with 39 per cent. in non-manual classes. A similar picture also emerges in the case of girls in manual classes, with only 29 per cent. consuming fruit compared to 43 per cent. among their non-manual counterparts.
<P>

<a name="00606w18.html_para1">The social class patterns for physical activity are less clear. Lower levels of leisure time exercise seem balanced by more active jobs for those on the lowest incomes.

 Unlike hospices for adults, children's hospices provide mainly respite care for children with complex needs and their families. To be worthwhile, such care needs to be convenient and flexible to the needs of the family, so a number of different models, including respite at home or in hospices or hospitals, are available in different localities. Where there is a hospice, I know these services are highly valued by users and by the local health economy

 We allocate funding to health authorities on the basis of the relative needs of their populations.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> Under the provisions of the Osteopaths Act 1993, the General Osteopathic Council is responsible for the development, promotion and regulation of the profession of osteopathy. During the transitional period of registration, which ended on 8 May 2000, the Council decided to require all applicants to complete an extensive 'professional profile and portfolio' as evidence that they meet its criteria for 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jun 2000 : Column: 233W</I><P>
the safe, lawful and competent practice of osteopathy. In some cases the registrar may also request an interview or a test of clinical competence before making a decision.
<P>

<a name="00606w19.html_para7">We were not involved in the development of the 'professional profile and portfolio', but it appears to be based firmly on the principles of determining competence and could form a basis for professional lifelong learning. It is an innovative and comprehensive approach which should go a long way towards giving the public the assurance they deserve that all registered osteopaths are able to practice osteopathy safely and competently.
<P>

<a name="00606w19.html_para8">It is an inevitable consequence of an effective professional self-regulatory scheme that, either at its inception or subsequently, some practitioners will not meet the standard required for safe and competent practice and will either have to take remedial training or find alternative employment. From information provided by the General Osteopathic Council, of the 1,911 practitioners whose applications for registration have been decided so far only 80 have been refused.
