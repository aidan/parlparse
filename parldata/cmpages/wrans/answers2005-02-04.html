 All water bottles disposed of from the Refreshment Department&#039;s restaurants, bars and banqueting rooms in the Palace of Westminster are recycled, as are the bottles purchased from the Refreshment Department by the Serjeant at Arms Department for use in Westminster Hall, Committee and other meeting rooms in the Palace. Glass water bottles sold in the self-service cafeterias are not currently recycled, as most of these are bought by customers for consumption elsewhere, and there are no recycling facilities for empty bottles in the other buildings on the Parliamentary Estate; the re-cycling of glass bottles from these areas is being actively pursued. The Refreshment Department estimates that approximately 50 per cent. of its total purchases of water bottles are recycled. None are sent for disposal in landfill sites.

 Since its establishment in 2001 Defra has put in place a comprehensive programme of action on issues including sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of some our achievements to date can be found at http://defra/corporate/achievements. htm. I am confident that the Kingston upon Hull, North constituency will have benefited from these.

Through our national strategy for waste, we are committed to delivering a step change to more sustainable waste management, including tough national targets to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&#150;04, and 25 per cent. by 2005&#150;06. To help local authorities achieve their own targets Defra&#039;s Waste Minimisation Fund was set up in 2002. As a result of successful bids for money from this fund by Kingston upon Hull City Council, the residents of the city should over the next few years reap the benefits, with a total of almost &#163;2.4 million being awarded to the city council for the period 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 for projects to expand kerbside recycling schemes across the city covering a total of 110,000 households, including those in the Kingston upon Hull, North constituency.

River water quality has improved along the River Hull over the last seven years. In 1997, none of the river&#039;s length within the city council area was considered to be of fair or better chemical quality, while by 2003 70 per cent. was measured as being of fair chemical quality. Over this same period the biological quality of the river has been of fair quality or better throughout. These improvements reflect Defra&#039;s policy to improve river water quality, which is one of the headline indicator&#039;s of sustainable development and to raise compliance with the EC Water Framework Directive.

 There have been underlying changes to the provision for and the funding of under fives which mean it is not meaningful to give per pupil funding over time. These include the abolition of flat rate nursery vouchers and changes from a nursery formula based on the number of eligible pupils in an area, to a formula based on the number of nursery places made available in an area. Additionally, authorities have been increasing provision to meet the commitment to universal nursery education for all three and four-year-olds and in recent years LEAs have been funded for extra pupils to allow them to reach universal provision.

 Anti-social Behaviour is not a crime type and as such there is no definition from which the number of incidents could be reliably calculated, particularly going back seven years which pre-dates the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Alcohol related crime is the same, many crimes occur as a result of alcohol but again as it is not a crime category in itself we could not reliably measure it.

<a name="50204w06.html_para1">
The latest provisional data shows that, up to 31 August 2004, 28,743 penalty notices for disorder have been issued by police forces in England and Wales of which 12,978, or 45 per cent., were paid in full within the 21 day payment period. If the penalty is not paid or a court hearing requested within this time then a fine is registered against the individual. The evaluation of data from the pilots of penalty notices for disorder showed that payment of fines added to the penalties paid on time resulted in an overall payment rate of 70 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w06.html_para2">
Information from the Department for Constitutional Affairs shows that the payment rate for financial penalties was 59 per cent. in 2001&#150;02, 55 per cent. in 2002&#150;03, 74 per cent. in 2003&#150;04 and 79 per cent. in 2004&#150;05 (August to October).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w06.html_para3">
However, as a result of revisions in the method of calculating the payment rate, direct year-on-year comparisons cannot be made and although recent changes to the way data are collected from Magistrates&#039; Court Committees allows confiscation orders to be excluded, it is still not possible for fines, costs and compensation to be identified separately, so the figures relate to financial penalties in general, as opposed to fines in isolation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w06.html_para4">
The Department for Constitutional Affairs&#039; Enforcement Programme is delivering a wide programme of change aimed at improving the enforcement and administration of financial penalties. The national payment rate is currently (Q3 2004&#150;05) at 80 per cent., up 9 per cent. on the same period last year, and performance is on trajectory to meet the 78 per cent. national target at the end of the year. The ongoing work of the Programme includes improving the intelligence available to enforcement teams through a variety of information-sharing measures, national implementation of the new legislative framework for enforcement provided by the Courts Act and taking the opportunity offered by the launch of HMCS to introduce more effective and efficient ways of working. The Programme has also devised and supported a series of nationally co-ordinated fine enforcement blitzes, with the most recent&#151;&#039;Operation Payback 2&#039; in November 2004&#151;resulting in a positive impact on the payment rate of &#163;1.7 million.

 Electoral registration officers (EROs) are responsible for compiling the electoral register and may require a person applying to be added to it to give additional information if they are in doubt as to whether that person is eligible to be registered. They may also refer to other records kept by the council or the registrar of births, marriages and deaths if they consider that further checks are necessary. It is an offence under the Representation of the People Act 1983 to fail to comply with a request for information from an ERO or to provide false or inaccurate information to a registration officer.

 From available records, senior UK military officers visiting Chile briefly met General Pinochet in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army, a position he held between 1990 and 1998, on a limited number of occasions. Two such meetings occurred with the visits in March 1995 of the then Chief of the Naval Staff, and in 1996 of the former Vice Chief of the Defence Staff. In addition, General Pinochet was present at a lunch attended by the then Secretary of State for Defence during his visit to Chile in December 1996. The UK Defence Attach&#233; in Santiago met General Pinochet in the course of routine duties, and other British embassy staff did so at official state and military functions.

Traditionally all income from court fines has been returned to the consolidated fund and re-allocated through the spending review process. However since 2002&#150;03 DCA has piloted a scheme aimed at increasing recovery rates of fines, in order to increase the effectiveness of the punishment as a deterrent. As part of this scheme DCA retain a proportion of the fine income to finance enforcement costs. DCA DEL was adjusted to take account of this new arrangement.

The vast majority of our expenditure on external consultants is associated with our major Information Communications Technology (ICT) and Estate Construction programmes.

<p><a name="50204w22.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 We welcome the work by the US Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) which is a necessary measure to ensure transparency and accountability in the spending of Iraqi oil revenues. The SIGIR report examines whether the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) established and implemented adequate managerial, financial and contractual controls over disbursements made to Iraqi Ministries. The report states that CPA accounting procedures were insufficient.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w22.html_para3">
CPA procedures were deficient by the standard of western governments, but the SIGIR report must be considered alongside the following points:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The difficult operating conditions in Iraq, which meant that procedures were sped up to get Ministries up and running and reconstruction projects off the ground. The alternative would have been to institute a system that could have delayed expenditure for months.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The progress made by the CPA in improving financial management in the Iraqi Ministries and of the budget process. The CPA introduced a transparent framework for management of the national budget and took measures to improve reporting and recordkeeping. But implementing measures took time, which was inevitable given the total lack of transparency under the former regime.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w22.html_para4">
In addition the SIGIR report does not tally with the report by the UN-mandated International Advisory Board (IAMB) into CPA management of the Development Fund for Iraq (FPI). The IAMB was set up to oversee audits of the DFI and ensure that the objectives set forth in UNSCR 1483 were met. Although concerns were raised over the lack of metering of Iraq&#039;s oil pipelines and controls over oil sales, it concluded that
