 Further to the answer I gave on 19 July 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 867W, the UK Polar Medal Assessment Committee (UKPMAC) is an independent committee that makes recommendations for the award of the polar medal to Her Majesty the Queen by the Secretary of State for Defence. In addition to the chairman and secretary, who are members of staff at the UK Hydrographic Office, the UKPMAC has an additional eight independent members. All UKPMAC members are experts in polar matters and nine of the 10 members are in their own right holders of the polar medal. The names of the independent members of the UKPMAC are not in the public domain to protect the integrity of the process.</p>

 The impact assessment for ‘The Aviation Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2010’ estimated that the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS will increase average UK air fares by approximately 6% to 7% in the period between 2012 and 2020. This analysis is based on the assumption that airlines will pass on the additional costs of emissions trading to passengers. However, it was noted that there is significant uncertainty over the precise impact on all types of air fares.</p>

 Some sectors of community transport, such as services provided under section 22 permits, are already eligible local bus services for the purposes of statutory concessionary travel, if they are sufficiently accessible to the public. Local authorities are also able to offer concessions on any form of community transport on a discretionary basis.

 Electric vehicles, along with other ultra-low emission vehicles, play an important role in the decarbonisation of UK road transport. The rate at which both the electric and other ultra-low emission vehicle market develops will be determined by a range of factors, such as consumer acceptance and oil prices, which are difficult to predict. Independent forecasts suggest that hundreds of thousands of ultra-low emission vehicles could be on the road in the period running up to 2020.</p>

The Government believe that there is strong strategic case for such a network as it would boost economic growth, spread prosperity and provide an attractive alternative to domestic aviation.

These measures include support for consumer incentives, development of recharging infrastructure, a programme of research development and demonstration work and the Green Bus Fund.

 It is a priority for the Government to improve the value for money the railway offers for taxpayers and fare payers. To that end, we continue to encourage Network Rail to explore and exploit opportunities to maximise its commercial revenue. It is ultimately however, for Network Rail to determine the best response, within the regulatory and incentives framework established for the company by the independent Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

 Ministers have received representations on this issue from another Member. Compensation arrangements between Network Rail and Train Operating Companies are governed by the track access agreements between the parties. Compensation payments relate to the overall level of performance over a period, and depend on the extent to which delays during that period were caused by Network Rail or train operators. The regime for compensating passengers depends instead on whether delays on a particular service exceeded the relevant threshold, and does not depend on the cause of that delay. For this reason there is no direct correlation between the two sets of compensation payments.</p>

The majority of the testing programme is carried out by a pool of private veterinary practices authorised by AHVLA to carry out the testing. The TB testing programme is agreed with DEFRA and devolved Administrations each year and AHVLA do not foresee any change to the agreed programme of testing at present and have no current plans to reduce veterinary officer or lay testing resources in regional offices.</p>

 We have considered the provisions of the Bern convention and are confident that our proposed policy complies with the requirements. The proposed policy contains a number of safeguards to ensure that culling does not lead to a detrimental impact on local badger populations. These include having a 'closed season' over the badgers' breeding season during which no culling can take place, and limiting both the number of licences that may be granted in any one year and the number of badgers that may be removed in each licensed area. DEFRA will also commission independent monitoring that will assess annually badger activity in each licensed area. If badger activity is found to be very low, mitigation measures can be put in place to ensure there is no local disappearance in any licensed area (eg stopping activity under the licence for the remainder of that year, or stipulating areas of land where culling would not be permitted).</p>

 There is a range of data already available on badger populations from both national and local surveys. In addition to these sources of information, applicants for culling licences would be required to provide Natural England with information regarding the number of main setts on the land which forms part of the application. From these, Natural England will be able to advise applicants on the estimated range of the number of badgers they would be expected to remove during the six-week intensive cull.</p>

The reason for the exemption is that there are instances where ponies are left to remain in a semi-feral existence and do not react well to handling, such as on Dartmoor, New Forest and Exmoor. In these circumstances it is better to be able to read the identification mark externally rather than to scan the animal which would involve handling it and causing distress. We realise that the pony would need to be handled when it is branded and at certain other occasions but these are kept to a minimum and when it is necessary.</p>

               <b>Mr Paice:</b>
 The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman), will be discussing these issues inter alia with her international colleagues, including South Africa and Colombia, in the context of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) which will be held in Rio from 4 to 6 June 2012. Furthermore, Lord Henley took part in the ministerial roundtable on Forest and Landscape Restoration, in Bonn, on 2 September and I participated in the ‘Forests Indonesia’ conference on 27 September.</p>

 None. In our "Consultation on the registration of new town or village greens", we propose that the fee imposed on an application to register a new green would be received by the local authority to which the application is made. The fee would typically represent only a small proportion of the costs of processing an application and our proposal includes an option to refund the fee to a successful applicant.</p>

6 The medicine flupentixol is used for both depression and psychosis but is classified differently in prescription data and hospital data. Prescription data classify Fluanxol under depression and all other forms under anti-psychosis; hospital data classify all use under treatment of psychosis. In the table, any cases where the brand name Fluanxol appears are included but cases where only the chemical name has been used, and it is not possible to determine for which purpose the drug has been used, have been excluded.

Higher proportions were found among boys than girls (1.7% and 0.9%) and 8 to 10-year-olds had twice the rate of five to seven-year-olds (1.7% and 0.9%). The lowest rate, 0.4% was found among five to seven-year-old girls rising to the highest rate of 2.1% of eight to 10-year-old boys. Other reports, including “Truth Hurts—Report of the National Inquiry into Self-Harm among Young People” (The Camelot Foundation and Mental Health Foundation, 2006) which indicated a prevalence rate of between one in 12 (8.3%) and one in 15 (6.7%) across the United Kingdom for young people, aged 15 to 25, report higher prevalence rates.</p>

 ‘Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer’, published on 12 January, sets out a range of measures to improve cancer survival rates in England. It shows how we intend to tackle preventable cancer incidence, improve the quality and efficiency of cancer services and deliver outcomes that are comparable with the best in Europe. The strategy sets out an ambition to save at least an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15 through earlier diagnosis of cancer and improved access to screening and radiotherapy. To support earlier diagnosis of cancer the Government have committed over £450 million over the next four years.</p>

Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including a pancreatic cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>
