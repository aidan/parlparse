<a name="80604w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, for what reasons the format of investment holdings in the 1997 Annual report and Accounts has been changed from that in the 1996 edition in respect of information concerning overseas trusts.  [44231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The list of larger investments in the 1997 Annual Report and Accounts adopted a higher threshold (&#163;6 million) than that in the 1996 Report (which applied a threshold of &#163;3 million for UK equities and &#163;1 million for overseas investments with overseas trusts listed as a separate category under the list of overseas investments). This focuses clearly on the largest holdings, which contribute the greater part of the fund's performance, and also reflects the overall increase in the Commissioners' investments since the threshold was last reviewed. No overseas investments over &#163;6 million were held.

<a name="80604w01.html_para0">In view of the Commissioners' decision to increase its overseas equities in 1997 and to outsource the management of the overseas portfolio to three separate

<P><I>4 Jun 1998 : Column: 296</I><P>
external fund managers during 1997, with a consequent large increase in the number of individual overseas equity holdings, it was considered opportune to align the disclosure threshold for overseas holdings with that for UK equities.
<P>

<a name="80604w01.html_para1">The overseas investment trusts held at 31 December 1996 represented the Commissioners' only exposure to the markets of the Far East. As a result of the appointment of external overseas equity managers during 1997, many of the overseas investment trust holdings were disposed of by the end of 1997.

<P>
<a name="80604w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 June 1998]:</i> The Dorchester Road Relief Road scheme was submitted by Dorset County Council for consideration as a PFI scheme for the February 1998 list of local authority PFI projects. Announcing decisions on the list, the Government made it clear that decisions on support for a number of local road schemes (including the Weymouth road scheme) had been deferred until the approach to the appraisal and prioritisation of road schemes had been clarified in the national Roads Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will introduce measures to limit the generation of smoke from building products;  [44025]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on the timetable for implementing individual member state's new European Union standards relating to test methods used to determine the fire resistance of construction products;  [44023]
<P>
(3) if the test method in British Standard 476 Part 33 permits the evaluation of the generation of smoke from building products; and what assessment he has made of the suitability of this as a performance standard for regulatory purposes.  [44024]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Building Regulations 1991 are intended to secure the health and safety in and around buildings, and paragraph B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations makes functional requirements to cover fire safety. Guidance on how these requirements may be met 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 1998 : Column: 298</I><P>
are given in Approved Document B, and, as far as materials used in construction are concerned, performance standards are set based on recognised test methods.
<P>

<a name="80604w01.html_para2">With regard to the generation of smoke from building products, the only recognised method of test available that measures smoke production is BS 476: Part 33 which relates to a full scale room test for surface products. This test gives an indication of the toxic hazard by the measurement of certain toxic gases and also the hazard of reduced visibility can be estimated by the measurement of the production of light-obscuring smoke. Because of the size of this test, it is not considered practicable to introduce it as a performance standard for regulatory purposes.
<P>

<a name="80604w01.html_para3">Approved Document B (Fire Safety) makes reference to a number of BS 476 parts that are considered to give acceptable methods of test and the key parameters usually considered in fire tests are the heat release rate and flame spread. These in themselves will also have an effect on smoke production. I therefore have no proposals at present to introduce the large-scale test given in BS 476 Part 33 as part of the performance standard for regulatory purpose. However, the use of a fire engineering approach is recognised in Approved Document B and the BS 476: Part 33 method of test could be used as part of the justification for a particular fire engineering solution.
<P>

<a name="80604w01.html_para4">The Single Burning Item (SBI) test being developed in support of the Construction Products Directive, does also address smoke production and we will need to take account of this when revising Approved Document B in the light of any future harmonised European Standards.
<P>

<a name="80604w01.html_para5">The European standards for resistance to fire have been passed to National Standards bodies (in the United Kingdom, the British Standards Institution) by CEN, the European Standards Organisation, for a formal vote, expected to be completed by the end of this month. If there is a positive vote, the test will be ratified and published towards the end of this year by the national standards bodies. Decisions have yet to be taken on the

 This information is not held centrally. The Environment Agency took on responsibility for managing and regulating the water environment and controlling industrial pollution and wastes in England and Wales on 1 April 1996. Between then and 31 March 1998, it undertook 1,233 successful prosecutions, of which 229 were in its Midlands region. Local authorities and other bodies also have responsibility for enforcing some environmental controls.

 Technique LLC has been the agent in Oman for several UK companies for a number of years. In view of this, HMG officials have had some contact with company staff, primarily through the British Embassy in Muscat. From information readily available within Government, I am not aware of any evidence that HMG was informed of any commission payments to Technique LLC by Astra. Any commission payment made by a non-state company such as Astra, or companies related to it, to a foreign company such as Technique LLC, would have been a matter solely for the companies concerned.

<P>
<a name="80604w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Agencies are increasingly co-operating to pool the information they hold so that they can asses the risk presented by any individual sex offender and devise plans to monitor the offender's behaviour and reduce risk to the public. The Government are encouraging this multi-agency approach to both assessment and management in the community.




<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 1998 : Column: 304</I><P>

Sex offenders are subject to a risk assessment by the agency (or agencies) responsible for them on release from prison and/or whilst under supervision in the community. In the case of offenders subject to restrictions under the Mental Health Act, this assessment takes place before consent is given to their being granted leave of absence or transferred or discharged from hospital.

<P>
<a name="80604w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There are a number of statutory safeguards already in place. Criminal record checks are available on people working in the statutory sector where they have substantial unsupervised access to children. They are also available on teachers in the private and voluntary sectors. The Police Act 1997 contains provisions which will widen access to criminal record checks when they are implemented. The Sex Offenders Act 1997 imposes a requirement on those convicted or cautioned for sex offences against children and other serious sex offences to notify the police of their name and address and any changes to these. This allows the police to monitor sex offenders in the community and to take action where appropriate to warn potential employers of 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 1998 : Column: 305</I><P>
any risk they might present. The Government have made it clear that such information must not just sit on a computer or gather dust on a file and the police and probation services have responded positively and responsibly using this information for the protection of children and vulnerable adults, as intended. The Government are also introducing sex offender orders in the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>] which will apply to sex offenders if their behaviour indicates a possible threat to the public. The courts will be able to make an order to impose prohibitions necessary to protect the community.
<P>

<a name="80604w03.html_para4">There are also a number of other measures in place to prevent those considered unsuitable to work with children from gaining employment with them. The Department for Education and Employment maintains "List 99" which contains information about people whom the Secretary of State has barred from working in schools; the Department of Health operates a Consultancy Service Index which enables local authorities and private and voluntary childcare organisations in England and Wales to check on suitability of those they propose to employ; and many professional bodies have codes of conduct which set out members' responsibilities in this area and provide for disciplinary action to be taken when these codes are breached.
<P>

<a name="80604w03.html_para5">We are concerned that these safeguards are not fully integrated and that there is a need for a more streamlined approached to ensure that there are no loopholes. For this reason, the Government are setting up an inter- departmental working group of officials to consider additional safeguards to prevent those who are unsuitable from working with children, including the possibility of a central register backed up by a new criminal offence to prevent those on the register applying for work with children. In looking at this subject, the group will draw upon the consultation exercise "Sex Offenders: A Ban on Working with Children"; and on recommendations made in the report of Sir William Utting's review of safeguards for children living away from home (particularly those recommendations dealing with choosing the right staff) and the Government's response to this review which is expected to be published by the Ministerial Task Force on the Children's Safeguards Review in the summer. The group will also consider whether further measures are necessary to protect 16 and 17 years olds who may be vulnerable to abuse by those in a position of trust, such as carers, teachers and leaders of organised residential activities. It is expected that the group will make its final recommendations to Ministers by the end of the year.

 The term used by Prison Service to refer to an apparent suicide is "self-inflicted death". This is a broader definition and includes all those deaths where it is clear that the person has acted specifically to take his or her own life. It is not restricted to the official verdict from the Coroner's inquest, where verdicts of "suicide", "open" or "misadventure" may be recorded in cases where there was doubt about a person's intent to end their life.

 The Government's priority in revising the Firearms Rules is to implement the changes to firearms licensing provided for in the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and as recommended by Lord Cullen in his report on the Dunblane tragedy. Because of the pressing need to introduce the new Rules, the prescribed firearms licensing forms will be published in English in the first instance but we have discussed with the Welsh Language Board our wish to produce these complex forms in Welsh as well as English. We will publish Welsh language versions of the forms as soon as possible.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. These tables show lone parents' Social Security benefit entitlements (excluding Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit)<P>

2. An unemployed lone mother's Social Security benefit entitlement (excluding Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit) is made up of <i>(a)</i> Income Support (IS) or, for some lone mothers, JSA; <i>(b)</i> Child Benefit (ChB); and <i>(c)</i> Free School Meals and Welfare Foods (FSM & WF). There is no regional variation in the rates of these benefits<P>

3. Lone mothers who are unemployed and in receipt of Income Support (IS) or JSA may receive help with their housing costs--through Housing Benefit (HB) or Income Support Mortgage Interest (ISMI)--and with their council tax--through Council Tax Benefit (CTB)<P>

4. Gross benefit entitlement figures for lone mothers (ie before housing costs) would show a variation by city, since rents and Council Tax (and therefore Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit) vary by city<P>

5. IS claimants are entitled to welfare foods (free milk tokens and vitamins) for any children they have under 5 years old and free school meals for children they have aged 5 and over. The value of free school meals is based on the January 1991 figure uprated by the RPI food component each year. The value of welfare foods is an estimate based on the average cost of a pint of milk<P>

6. The figures assume:<P>

<i>(a)</i> take up of full benefit entitlement, and<P>

<i>(b)</i> the family has no capital or disregarded income<P>

7. The figures shown assume one child to be under 5, another between 5 and 10 years old and the third between 11 and 15 years old<P>

8. The removal of the lone parent rate of Child Benefit, which is reflected in table 2, is subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary regulations<P>

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80604w06.html_para10">Concessionary television licences are not provided under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, but under the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Licence Fees) Regulations 1997 (made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1947) which is the responsibility of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Under these Regulations, a concessionary television licence costing &#163;5 is available to people living in residential homes and certain types of sheltered accommodation. There are currently 651,000 beneficiaries under this scheme. It is not known how many people qualify for the concession and fail to claim, but the number is likely to be low, since applications for the concession have to be submitted by housing managers, who are generally well aware of the existence of the concessionary scheme.

<P>

<a name="80604w06.html_para12">The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (Section 2(1)(b)) places a duty upon local authorities to make arrangements to provide a disabled person with, or to assist that person in obtaining, wireless, television, library or similar recreational facilities, where the authority is satisfied that this is necessary in order to meet that person's needs. The number of persons receiving such provision is not known.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Insolvency Service is implementing a new grading and pay system to come into effect on 1 August 1998. As part of that, it is looking at some adjustments to the case loads of some official receivers' offices, which will be achieved by the re-allocation of the work of some county courts between those offices. Consideration of those re-allocations has yet to be concluded, and I am therefore not yet in a position to provide a full list of the changes. I have however given an undertaking to supply the list to the Trade Union Side of the Agency National Whitley Committee by 2 July, and a copy will be made available to relevant staff: that timetable is expected to be met. The changes will take place over a period of time. The timing will be dependent on a number of factors, including current staffing levels in offices, but I do not see them involving any redundancies, compulsory transfers or office closures.</FONT></UL>

Companies House accepts documents in good faith.

Failure to do so could lead to consideration of prosecution.

 It will not be possible to make such an assessment until the Commission publishes its detailed financial plans for individual Member States. The Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals are complex; we will also need further details from the Commission on the new Structural Fund framework, the related rural development measures, and proposed rural Community Initiative before we are able to make an assessment. One of the Government's objectives is to see that there is a sensible balance between rural and urban areas, which will be helped if Member States have flexibility in administering the funds.

 ECGD has received an excellent response from the UK exporting and financial community to its Consultation Paper. The Minister for Trade will be leading discussions which ECGD will be having with banks and exporters to consider the various suggestions made. The focus will be on ways of enhancing exporter competitiveness and improving the cost-effectiveness of ECGD interest rate support. This work will inevitably take several months and extend beyond the scheduled 30 June expiry date of ECGD's current support facility, the Fixed Rate Export Finance scheme. Therefore, to ensure continuity of service to exporters and banks while this work is being undertaken, the Government have decided to extend the validity of the current scheme for six months until 31 December 1998.

<a name="80604w08.html_para2">The Council discussed a new Regulation on the labelling of genetically modified soya and maize, which aims to provide information to consumers. It reached political agreement on much of the substance of the company law Regulation, which forms part of the European Company Statute. It reached political agreement on three common positions. It agreed (by a qualified majority with Sweden and Portugal voting against and Ireland abstaining) on a Directive on mutual recognition of qualifications, which consolidates the existing legislation providing for certain professionals to work in Member States other than their own. It agreed common positions by unanimity on draft Directives on the legal protection of conditional access services, ie, that is, services where access is conditional upon prior authorisation and payment, such as pay-per-view TV; and on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations, which consolidates existing health and safety legislation in this field, extending its scope slightly and promoting environmental protection.

We will support a common European Union approach to target assistance to help poor households, reduce vulnerability to future disasters, promote confidence and trust between North Korea and the outside world and gain greater access for international agencies to implement their humanitarian activities more effectively. We support the implementation of the European Commission's 1998 programme. In addition we will consider proposals for support from NGOs and UN agencies, within the above framework.

 The additional revenue yield from introducing VAT at 5 per cent. on the construction of new dwellings is estimated to be &#163;550 million. There is no official estimate of the expected yield from introducing VAT on the construction of other new buildings currently qualifying for zero-rating.

 Responsibility for the transport industry lies with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. However, the impact on the ferry industry and on the ports of Ramsgate and Dover of the abolition of duty free will depend on the nature of the successor regimes which are being discussed at official level in Brussels.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the liability to customs checks is of <i>(a)</i> mail sent by national postal administrations to the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> mail carried by express couriers to the United Kingdom.  [43800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w10.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The liability to customs checks for anti-smuggling purposes is the same for mail sent by a National Postal Administration and that carried by express couriers. Provision for such checks is contained in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. Checks on both types of traffic are also undertaken for fiscal and regulatory purposes under the Community Customs Code, which is European legislation. However, some differences apply to the treatment of postal packets, which is subject to national provisions under the Post Office Act 1953 and the Postal Packets (C&E) (Amendment) Regulation 1992.

<i>Official Report</i>, column <i>151</i>, regarding discussions between officials of the British Embassy in Washington and the United States authorities concerning Lloyd's of London, who initiated those discussions; what matters were discussed; who was present on each occasion; what requests were made to the United States authorities by the British representatives present; and what requests were made to the British representatives present by the United States authorities.

<a name="80604w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The discussions were initiated by the British Embassy and concerned the case of Richards <i>et al v </i>Lloyd's of London then before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Only one such meeting took place at which a First Secretary from the Embassy met four Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attorneys. The Embassy asked the SEC to recognise that any intervention by them in the Richards case should take account both of the British Government's interest in protecting policyholders by insurers continuing to meet their insurance obligations and the regulatory role of Lloyd's in protecting the interests of policyholders. The SEC made no requests to the British Government.

<a name="80604w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The supervision of European Union credit institutions is already subject to a series of harmonising Directives, which impose minimum standards in a wide range of areas and help facilitate the Single Market. The Commission is responsible for ensuring that they remain up to date, and take account of developments in financial markets. The advent of Stage 3 of EMU does not change this responsibility.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Deposits in UK banks, along with those in banks of other EU members, are covered by arrangements drawn up under the Deposit Guarantee Directive, which sets out minimum standards that apply throughout the Union. Stage 3 of Economic and Monetary Union has no effect on those arrangements.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer who will supervise and regulate transnational banks under Stage 3 of Economic and Monetary Union.  [44458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The European Banking Directives, which harmonise standards of supervision of credit institutions within the EU, are based on the principle of Home State supervision. Although they may operate or offer services anywhere in the Union, credit institutions are required to have their registered office and head office in the same Member State, and the supervisory authorities there are responsible for its supervision throughout the EU. Stage 3 of Economic and Monetary Union will not change these arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 We are committed to protecting the rights of tenants, and those in shared accommodation are no exception. We have issued a consultation paper today proposing the introduction of a full system of licensing for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), in line with our Manifesto commitment.
<P>

<a name="80604w10.html_para1">We value the contribution of the private rented sector, and HMOs play their part by accommodating a wide range of households including mobile workers and other single people. However, while many HMO landlords are providing perfectly acceptable accommodation, there is concern about both the physical condition and management of some HMOs.
<P>

<a name="80604w10.html_para2">Licensing would allow authorities to refuse a licence where an applicant is not a fit and proper person to hold an HMO licence. This will provide a powerful mechanism for preventing exploitation of tenants. For example, licences could be refused for those with relevant criminal convictions. Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, this could include Housing Benefit fraud.
<P>

<a name="80604w10.html_para3">Licensing would also enable local authorities to take a co-ordinated approach to regulating HMOs across departments. This should be a benefit for landlords.
<P>

<a name="80604w10.html_para4">We therefore propose to make it mandatory for all local authorities in Scotland to introduce HMO licensing. Councils were given discretionary powers to licence in 1991, but so far only seven have used them.
<P>

<a name="80604w10.html_para5">A consultation paper setting out our proposals has been sent today to a wide range of bodies with an interest in HMOs, with a request for comments by 30 October 1998. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the House Libraries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what consultations were held with user groups in advance of communication of the Health Service Circular, Wheelchair Voucher Scheme: funding in 1997-98 and 1998-99 (HSC 1998/004).  [43867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w11.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The circular authorised health authorities to use surplus funds from the National Health Service wheelchair voucher scheme for powered indoor/outdoor and other wheelchair provision. It was a short-term initiative which ensured that available funds were kept within wheelchair services in 1997-98. It did not affect the funding available for the NHS wheelchair voucher scheme and powered indoor/outdoor wheelchair provision in subsequent years and did not involve any change in policy towards the two schemes.

 The Department funded the national prosthetic and wheelchair services project to give continued support to wheelchair services for a three-year period following their devolution to the National Health Service. A number of professional groups (including a Wheelchair Managers Committee) continue to provide a national focus, and the Department supports this work. For example, the Department is funding work on a national training framework for wheelchair services.

 A so called "Phoenix Operation" does not, in itself, constitute a criminal offence. However, where there is evidence that a "Phoenix Operation" may have involved an offence or offences--for example there has been fraudulent trading--then the prosecuting authorities adopt the same policy as with other suspected offences, namely, to assess whether there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction; and if so, to assess whether it is in the public interest that there should be a prosecution.

 Government statistics published in "Farm Incomes in the United Kingdom" show that, in 1997 as a whole, farm incomes fell by an average of 37 per cent. in real terms. The fall in total income from farming in 1997 is largely due to lower prices received by farmers for all major commodities. The relative strength of sterling compared with 1996 has been a major factor underlying the fall in prices.

 I receive regular representations on a range of milk quota issues and on current levels of farm income, including that of dairy farmers, from farming organisations and individual milk producers. Milk quota still has a considerable positive value which demonstrates that the market believes that there is still sufficient profitability to justify this expenditure. The incomes of dairy farmers in 1998-99 are expected to be lower than in 1997-98, mainly as a result of lower milk prices.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pursuant to his oral answer of 22 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1132, on sea levels in the Thames Estuary and River Medway, what progress the Environment Agency has made in respect of its surveys into projected sea level rises.

<a name="80604w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I regret that my reply of 22 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1132, may have been misleading. The Environment Agency undertakes surveys of areas at risk of flooding and as preliminary studies for proposed defences. The interpretation of such surveys and studies take into account Ministry guidance on sea level rise. However the Agency is not carrying out surveys relating solely to projected sea level rise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Any form of intimidation of Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) staff, and in particular that which prevents staff from carrying out their duties to protect public health, is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. All available measures are used against those responsible, and, in all possible cases, the MHS refers incidents for investigation with a view to prosecution. Obstruction of MHS staff in the performance of their duties is an offence under section 33 (1) of the Food Safety Act 1990. Serious cases of assault are referred to the police.
<P>

<a name="80604w13.html_para4">In accordance with EU rules, current GB meat hygiene legislation provides for the mandatory licensing (by the GB Agriculture Departments) of all abattoirs, cutting plants and cold stores producing meat which is intended for sale for human consumption. Although this legislation provides powers for Ministers to revoke such licences in certain specified circumstances, notably in respect of hygiene failures, these circumstances do not include intimidation, bullying or threats to MHS staff from the owners or operators of licensed premises or from their employees.
<P>

<a name="80604w13.html_para5">Nevertheless, the assault of MHS staff in the course of carrying out their duties at licensed premises would probably amount to the hampering of adequate health inspection for the purposes of the GB meat hygiene legislation. In such circumstances MHS staff have powers to serve a notice on the operator of the premises prohibiting the use of the part or parts of the premises concerned until such time as it is clear that the safety of MHS staff is secured. The effect of such 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 1998 : Column: 343</I><P>
action could result in the stopping of some or all of the production of the premises involved. Because the Government will not tolerate assaults on MHS staff, I have instructed the MHS to remind the industry of the powers available, and that where the MHS exercises those powers, it will do so with the full support of Ministers.

 No information is available on the number of instances of intimidation, threats and bullying against Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) staff which have occurred in the last year.
<P>

<a name="80604w13.html_para6">However, to get a better understanding of the true extent of instances of intimidation of its staff, the Meat Hygiene Service, together with UNISON, has sent out a Violence/Intimidation at Work Questionnaire to all its operational staff. The survey sought information on the number of instances of threats, verbal abuse and harassment as well as physical attack or injury that MHS staff had been subject to since 1 April 1995.
<P>

<a name="80604w13.html_para7">The questionnaire was sent to the 1,500 operational staff of the MHS. The provisional results of the survey indicate that staff have reported 403 instances of some form of intimidation and violence since 1 April 1995, the date the Agency was launched. This comprises 273 instances relating to verbal threat or abuse and 130 to more serious instances of injury to MHS staff, physical threat with a weapon, racial and sexual harassment and damage to personal property.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We have given thorough consideration to the merits of the United Kingdom becoming a signatory to the Charter, which entered into force on 1 March 1998. We have concluded that it would be appropriate to do so. Part II of the Charter sets out general principles of recognition and support for indigenous minority languages and removal of discrimination against them. We readily subscribe to these principles. We also intend to specify the Welsh Language in Wales and, when the necessary procedural arrangements are in place, the Gaelic language in Scotland under the provisions of Part III which require adherence to a number of specific measures taken to promote the use of these languages in public life. It is also intended to specify the Irish language in Northern Ireland at an early date. Part II of the Charter will apply to the Scots language. We will be considering which, if any, other languages should be bound by the general principles in Part II and might be specified under Part III in due course.

<P>

<a name="80604w16.html_para6">The Council discussed preparations for the ad hoc meeting of Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers in Palermo on 3-4 June. This should give renewed impetus to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and prepare the ground for the third Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Stuttgart in April 1999. The Council endorsed the Presidency's handling, and reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that the meeting is a success.

It underlined the need for the parliamentary elections in Montenegro on 31 May to be free and fair and for their results to be respected by all.

 Proposals to close Derringham School were first submitted on 8 December 1997. The Secretary of State received 19 letters and a petition containing 2,975 signatures opposing the closure. The proposals were then withdrawn and new proposals were submitted on 9 March 1998. The Department has received two letters opposing the new proposals; the formal objection period ended on 9 May and the LEA has until 9 June to send copies of further objections, plus the LEA's own comments, to the Secretary of State. All relevant representations will be taken into account by the Secretary of State in reaching a final decision.

In addition, on 13 May, the Secretary of State announced a review of the future role, purpose and funding framework for TECs in delivering the Government's education, skills and enterprise objectives. The review will consider how we will give a clear focus to the role of TECs, and will develop proposals for improving efficiency and effectiveness. The review will lead to the publication of new Strategic Guidance in the Autumn which will set out the future role of TECs and the Government's expectations of them.

<a name="80604w18.html_para0"><i>Letter from Peter Collis to Mr. John Healey, dated 2 June 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked Leigh Lewis, the Chief Executive of the Employment Service, to reply to your questions about applications for Access to Work, and the financial assistance given towards the purchase of wheelchairs through the programme during the last five years. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr. Lewis. I am replying in his absence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I must start by saying that we do not monitor separately the number of applications for wheelchairs or their cost. We do, of course, note details of equipment provided in individual case files but the Employment Service does not analyse information to the level of detail you requested. However, we can supply the following related information.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service does monitor regularly the receipt, processing and outcomes of all applications for Access to Work. In addition, the Placing, Assessment and Counselling Teams have standards to meet when dealing with applications. For all

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service analyses cost information by broad categories. Wheelchairs come within the Special Aids and Equipment category but their cost cannot be separately identified. Expenditure on Special Aids and Equipment is not broken down below regional level and is available only for the last four years. This is since the introduction of Access to Work in June 1994. Table 1 below offers a regional breakdown.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Table 2 sets out the total number of people benefiting nationally over the past five years under Access to Work (and the previous Special Schemes), which include people given help with wheelchairs. We do not identify applications for wheelchairs separately but we have details, for the past two years, of the number of people making applications for Special Aids and Equipment. Again, we have a regional, but not a district, breakdown.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am sorry I have not been able to answer your questions more fully.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many children of school age in West Sussex are currently statemented on account of problems relating to autism.  [43283]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80604w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The national figures which the Department collects on the number of children with special educational needs are not disaggregated by type of special need; it is for West Sussex--as for other individual local education authorities--to identify children with autism and other types of special educational needs in their areas and to make appropriate provision. West Sussex LEA estimates that approximately 150 children with autism, including Asperger's Syndrome, currently have statements in the county. There may be other children with autistic spectrum disorders whose statements relate primarily to other types of special education needs.
