To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make arrangements to allow England rugby and football matches to be watched on the British Forces Broadcasting Service.  [86902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) is provided through a contract let by the Ministry of Defence with the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC), which is an independent limited company with charitable status. The service provides, subject to practicality and affordability, radio and television broadcasts to most locations overseas where significant numbers of British forces are stationed, such as Germany and Cyprus, together with areas of deployed operation such as Afghanistan. There are currently two radio and two television channels, although the second TV channel, which is specifically aimed at the 18&#150;30 age group, is at present only available to deployed operational areas, eg Balkans, Middle-East, Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="21216w01.html_para3">Authority to transmit any particular television or radio programme or sporting event rests with the Rights Holder for the programme or event concerned and all broadcasters, including SSVC, must negotiate accordingly with Rights Holders for licences to broadcast.
<P>

<a name="21216w01.html_para4">SSVC already provides live television coverage of all England (and other Home Nation) international rugby and football matches, subject to scheduling practicalities where fixtures clash, and makes arrangements to do so with the Rights Holders through the primary broadcaster, eg the BBC, ITV etc.
<P>

<a name="21216w01.html_para5">SSVC and the Ministry of Defence are working to further develop the BFBS with a view to providing additional television channels including, in due course, a dedicated sports channel.

 The Ministry of Defence continuously reviews its business processes and organisation to ensure that military capability is delivered with best value for money for the taxpayer. As part of the 2002 spending review, the MOD agreed the following Public Service Agreement value for money target for 2002&#150;03 to 2005&#150;06:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21216w01.html_para6">A wide range of initiatives is in hand to achieve this target, and to deliver business improvement generally across defence on a continuous basis. Key improvements include the following initiatives:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans there are to substitute depleted uranium rounds with safer and equally penetrative rounds; and if he will make a statement.  [86388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There are currently no plans to substitute DU rounds. At present no satisfactory alternative material exists to achieve the level of penetration needed to defeat the most modern battle tanks. DU ammunition therefore currently remains our most operationally effective capability and the use of non-DU ammunition would significantly threaten operational success and would potentially lead to increased United Kingdom casualties. However, I can confirm that research is continuing into more effective alternatives to DU ammunition.

 The Ministry of Defence has a comprehensive pay and allowance package in place that includes various reimbursement and compensatory allowances. There should be no Xlosers" under this arrangement but it is possible that some individuals, as their circumstances change (e.g. different types of separation, no longer living away from home etc.) might move from one set of allowances to another&#151; because their compensation needs are different. MOD is aware that there may be some individuals who will or may have been temporarily withdrawn from career courses and would seek to address any potential financial loss sympathetically.

 No central records of complaints of harassment and bullying made by civilian staff are maintained by the Ministry of Defence. The MOD procedures encourage the informal resolution of harassment and bullying complaints with the assistance of line manager and personnel managers and trade union representatives. Where complaints become formal they are resolved within the alleged offender's line management chain. There is no requirement for complaints to be reported centrally, and it would be disproportionately expensive to collect the information requested.

<a name="21216w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Type 23 Frigate was designed with the expectation of spending a high proportion of its operational time in the demanding and stressing environment of the North Atlantic. The nature of the threat has evolved with resultant changes to operational priorities and deployments, the consequence of which is that these ships spend less time in the North Atlantic. An opportunity has therefore arisen to extend the interval between major maintenance periods. Improved processes for the specification and management of equipment maintenance are also being introduced. The collective effect of these developments will be to increase the availability of Type 23 Frigate capability for operations.

 Under the current public entertainment licensing system, local authorities have set charges that can vary by thousands of percent from area to area, even for similar activities carried out at similar premises.

In the first instance, after careful reflection, the Board concluded that the application comprised a number of unique features of heritage merit which, in combination, warranted support.

<i>BBC Radio and Independent Production</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> XThe BBC acknowledges the significant contribution independent producers have made to network radio output over the past 11 years. We remain fully committed to our voluntary pledge that 10 per cent. of eligible hours on our national analogue networks will be made by independents. We also wish publicly to emphasise that we will continue to view this 10 per cent. commitment as a floor not a ceiling. We believe that our behaviour over the past five years highlights this attitude and we will work to open up commissions, where appropriate to independent producers in order to develop the UK production sector.
<P>
<BR>
 In the past our 10 per cent. voluntary commitment has not applied to our national English language analogue radio services for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are looking at how we could develop a similar voluntary commitment to that which already exists for our analogue network services. We believe that we would be able to commit publicly to an appropriate level of commissioning from the independent sector across the English language services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In doing so we must take account of the existing market conditions in order to determine a realistic and sustainable level at which to set such a commitment. We also need to consider how we balance most effectively our ambition to support the development of the independent production sector in the nations in the context of our wider commitment to production in the Nations.
<P>
<BR>
 Given current levels of take-up of digital radio across the country we do not yet feel able to extend a commitment for a particular level of independent commissioning for our new digital services. However, it is our hope that as take-up of digital radio grows and these services mature, we will be able to invite independent producers to provide content for these services where appropriate.
<P>
<BR>
 We intend to report fully on both the hours we commission from independent producers and our spend on independent production across our analogue radio networks in our annual review.
<P>
<BR>
 We hope that these commitments will act to strengthen the positive and constructive relationship with independent producers which we already enjoy."

[85437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2002]:</i> The Department are carrying out a public attitude survey on renewable energy through the COI and this should be completed in the spring of next year. We also recently undertook a public consultation exercise as part of the preparatory work for the forthcoming Energy White Paper. This examined the public's priorities for energy policy, including the role of renewables and attitudes towards changes in gas and electricity prices. The finding from this exercise are published on the DTI website http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/developep/pub con rep.shtml.
<P>

<a name="21216w09.html_para5">In addition, DEFRA regularly undertakes surveys of public attitudes to the environment which include questions on people's awareness, concerns and knowledge of climate change.
<P>

<a name="21216w09.html_para6">Most recently, the full results of the Xsurvey of public attitudes to quality of life and to the environment&#151;2001" were published in October on the DEFRA website www.defra.gov.uk/environment/statistics/pubatt/index.htm.
<P>

<a name="21216w09.html_para7">The target under the Renewables Obligation of 10 per cent. of electricity being generated from renewable sources by 2010 will make an important contribution towards the UK meeting its Kyoto targets. Achievement of the 10 per cent. target by 2010 would represent an annual saving of 2.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Achieving this renewables target is expected to cost an additional 4.4 per cent. on average electricity prices in 2010 over actual 1999 prices.

 The purpose of Part II of the Order is to minimise or reduce the pollution caused by emissions from industrial installations.

 I am aware of Dermot Nesbitt's commitment to publish a consultation paper before the end of 2002. However, I am also conscious of the potential implications which the introduction of a third party appeal right has for the operation of Northern Ireland's planning system and economy.

<a name="21216w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The temporary partial suspension of the Warm Homes Plus scheme was introduced in the early summer following a technical report that called into question the safety of converting, to oil or gas, heating systems that use high output solid fuel back boilers or room heaters. Such appliances have been found in about half of all properties eligible for new heating systems under the scheme. Installation or conversion of heating systems in other properties is continuing as before. My prime concern is for the well-being of people who have works carried out under the Warm Homes Plus scheme, and I am aiming for the shortest possible interruption of the scheme that is consistent with their safety.

A professional multi ethnic military force and defence institutions accountable to appropriate civilian control and oversight will be developed, with the support of the US as lead nation, for the coordination of assistance to the Afghan national army. Detailed implementation plans will now be prepared, with support from UNAMA and donor countries.

 The Government of East Timor and donor partners met in Dili on 9 and 10 December to review the progress the new nation has made since independence.

Oil and gas revenues from the Timor Gap remain promising and offer the prospect of longer term economic security.
<P>

<a name="21216w14.html_para0">However East Timor suffers from acute shortages of qualified and experienced personnel and this has meant that essential social services have not been delivered to many communities in rural areas.

<a name="21216w14.html_para2">The riot was brought under control in a matter of hours.

 Improving education outcomes for poor people is not primarily about donor resources. Our approach to the Fast Track Initiative is to help partner Governments put the policies and plans in place that will enable them to accelerate the achievement of universal primary education. It is important that these plans take into account the circumstances and needs of the individual country. Seven countries have prepared proposals but these need to be rigorously reviewed by local donor groups, to ensure that they are coherent with each country's existing plans (including poverty reduction strategies and medium-term economic frameworks or their equivalent), and to confirm that countries have the capacity to absorb any additional finance.

 Ethiopia's population of 67 million is growing at 2.7 per cent. per annum. Rapid population growth makes it harder to achieve the millennium development goals; when households have many children, investment in education or health per child tends to be lower, especially for poor people.

 Ethiopia underwent a major land redistribution campaign in 1975. Land was then taken into state ownership and limited rights of access were given to peasants who farmed it. Since then, increasing population has decreased the size of the individual farm holdings. DFID-funded research that was carried out in 2002 found that the average plot size was 1.41 Ha per household. In a recent comparative study of five African countries (funded by USAID) the equivalent figure quoted for Malawi was 0.99 Ha per household (National Economic Council, Malawi, 2000).

<P>
<a name="21216w14.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The problem in southern Africa is one of declining access to food. Poor people are becoming more and more vulnerable to food shortage, as successive harvest failures have eroded their savings and other assets and hence their ability to cope. HIV/AIDS and other disease burdens are compounding this problem. Inappropriate policies, serious governmance failures and a shortage of foreign exchange have contributed to a failure to come to grips with the poverty which lies at the root of this vulnerability. There have also been poor information flows and planning in relation to the short-term response to the humanitarian crisis.
<P>

<a name="21216w14.html_para7">The problem of vulnerability is also extreme in Ethiopia&#151;one of the poorest countries in the world ranking 168 out of 173 on the Human Development Index.

Furthermore, PPAs provide a forum for the poor to voice their own demands for change in public service provision by reflecting on their own experiences in dealing with government services, their perspectives on the specific constraints they experience in trying to access services, and of the quality and relevance of those services.

 Today, more than 14 million children under 15 years of age have lost one or both parents to AIDS; 11 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The implications are enormous&#151;these children will grow up without parental supervision, support or care, many without an education, and alienated from society. Many will become vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and discrimination. Families, communities and NGOs are struggling to provide support.
<P>

<a name="21216w15.html_para2">Working at the national level, we aim to ensure that orphaned and vulnerable children's issues are at the centre of national policies and budget planning, allocation and expenditure. In Zambia we are supporting UNICEF on a nationally co-ordinated community response aiming to protect children's rights, increase their access to social services (including health and education and psychosocial support) and combating stigma. We recognise that much more needs to be done to tackle this crisis and will continue to work at the regional and international level to support greater awareness and response to the escalating situation.

 HIV/AIDS is already having a catastrophic impact on sub-Saharan Africa and in other parts of the world prevalence is expanding rapidly. The epidemic will have a serious effect on the millennium development goals:
<P>

<a name="21216w15.html_para3">On the poverty goal: household expenditure rises as more is spent on health care and funerals-just as incomes are falling.
<P>

<a name="21216w15.html_para4">On the education goal: HIV threatens teacher supply and can reduce primary enrolment (especially of girls to help with domestic tasks and care of family members).

<a name="21216w15.html_para5">On poverty and food security: HIV threatens agricultural productivity, can reduce household food consumption by 15&#150;30 per cent., and could kill a quarter of the agricultural work force in worst-affected countries by 2020.
<P>

<a name="21216w15.html_para6">On child and maternal health: HIV is increasing mortality directly through infection, and indirectly through lack of adult carers; overburdened health systems are reducing access to health care.

 We are concerned at the continuing conflict in Cote d'lvoire and continue to work with others in the international community to support regional efforts to broker a viable peace agreement. Although precise figures are difficult to determine, large numbers of people, particularly among immigrant communities, but also Ivorian citizens and refugees, have been displaced due to the fighting. Most have found shelter in host communities or are in temporary camps. Several thousand migrant workers have returned to their countries of origin or crossed into neighbouring countries. At present, the west of the country seems worst affected due to on-going fighting between Government forces and new rebel groups, and the presence of large numbers of refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone, many of whom have been displaced. According to UN reports, prior to the crisis, there were a total of 72,000 refugees living in Cote d'lvoire.

according to mine clearance agencies, the number of mines in Angola is now considerably lower than the previously estimated 13 million. Nevertheless, Angola remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Earlier this month, the national coordinator of Angola's Inter-sectoral Commission for De-mining and Humanitarian Assistance (CNIDAH) estimated that Angola has about four to five million unexploded landmines. As many as 70,000 Angolans are believed to have lost limbs as a result of landmine explosions. Relief agencies in Angola also state that landmines continue to restrict the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

 The OECD-DAC data are drawn directly from the figures which the UK reports to the organisation each year. They are compiled on the basis of the international definitions agreed by all donors. The figures are often used to compare donor performance, but can be misleading if used out of context. For our own use, DFID has developed a more sophisticated commitment and reporting system that is better able to reflect the full extent of our commitments.

 Data is not held centrally in the format requested and to collate it would incur disproportionate costs. However, my Department supports a number of international sexual and reproductive health organisations that share our aim of eliminating poverty, including United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). All DFID funding in these areas is in support of the International Conference on Population and Development goal of universal access to reproductive health and is central to attainment of the millennium development goals (MDGs) specifically those related to maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS and child mortality. Without access to high quality reproductive health services and care, it is most unlikely that progress will be achieved in meeting the health MDGs. We will continue to support international organisations and NGOs which make an effective contribution to these goals, and of course the efforts of governments seeking to improve people's access to reproductive health services.

 A degree is defined in section 214 of the Education Reform Act as an award at Master, Bachelor or Doctorate level granted or to be granted by a university, college or other body which is authorised by Royal Charter or Act of Parliament to grant degrees. The qualifications framework issued by the Quality Assurance Agency indicates that the term 'degree' should only be used for qualifications which meet the expectations laid down in its qualification descriptors. If a private UK organisation without the necessary powers offers its own degrees, it would be in contravention of section 214 of the Education Reform Act 1988. Such organisations can be investigated and prosecuted by the local Trading Standards Department.

<a name="21216w19.html_para1">The findings so far are highly encouraging, indicating that EMA has had a positive effect on participation and retention among the target group, as well as on student behaviour. It is for this reason that we have announced that the scheme will be extended nationally from September 2004. The evaluation will help inform the development of the national scheme by offering evidence of different impacts from the different variants being tested in the pilot.
<P>

<a name="21216w19.html_para2">Qualitative, quantitative and implementation findings from the first and second year of the evaluation have been published on the DfES website, including via the EMA website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to harmonise pay scales between teachers in schools and further education colleges.  [85463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Unlike schools, colleges in the further education (FE) sector are independent corporations with their own pay arrangements. Colleges agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with their staff in the context of local priorities and the overall resources available to them. Pay arrangements in the sector are diverse, reflecting colleges' local flexibility. Government have no plans to change this arrangement.
<P>

<a name="21216w19.html_para3">On 19 November the Secretary of State announced that the total funding for FE is set to rise by #1.2 billion between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06, a real terms increase of 19 per cent. From next year, colleges which have demonstrated their effectiveness will have three year funding deals allowing them to plan on a longer-term basis, with increases linked to performance. We will also consolidate the funds provided for the Teaching Pay Initiative into core funding. These measures should enable colleges to address structural pay issues and to use the additional resources to narrow substantially the pay gap with schools by 2005&#150;06.

<a name="21216w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
: There are now 49 project contracts signed since 1997, covering 558 schools that the Department has supported with PFI credits of approximately 1.3 billion. The private sector partners in more than 30 projects have begun to deliver high quality services to the schools covered by the contracts. This includes more than 30 brand new or replacement schools. Information is not held centrally on the time taken from the commencement of the tendering process to the handover of the facility to the Local Education Authority.

 We are committed to encouraging young people from deprived backgrounds to aim higher, including entry to our top universities where they demonstrate the ability and potential. We want universities to hunt out the brightest students and to seek better and fairer ways of identifying talent. We have committed over #190 million for three years to the Excellence Challenge programme, which will raise the aspirations and attainment of young people in some of the most deprived areas of the country. All universities, including those in the Russell Group, are engaged with this programme and local excellence challenge partnerships all have links with at least one institution with demanding entry requirements. Through the Excellence Challenge, we have provided additional funding to universities who recruit fewer than 80 per

<a name="21216w20.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Phil Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many and what percentage of schools in England and Wales were built during the 1960s and 1970s, broken down by <i>(a)</i> local education authority, <i>(b)</i> the total amount of outstanding maintenance for each school and <i>(c)</i> the perceived lifetime of each of these schools at the time of construction.  [87226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The data that have been collected from authorities in connection with asset management plan appraisal do not show these age bands. Many schools have estates comprising numbers of blocks of different ages. Maintenance costs in the data cover both the backlog and requirements over a five year period from the date of assessment. Most of these maintenance assessments were carried out two to three years ago and do not reflect the effect of subsequent revenue and capital spending in reducing maintenance requirements. The DfES does not hold information on the perceived lifetime of each of the schools at the time of construction.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon. Member for Ashford on 9 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 28, whether all schools will be fully funded in respect of the cost of payments to teachers on the upper spine of performance related pay.  [87200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Threshold payments constitute point 1 of the upper pay scale and the threshold is fully funded. #90 million has been ring-fenced this year for performance pay, including the progression from upper pay scale 1 to upper pay scale 2. Sixty per cent. of the cost of a performance point grant for heads, deputies and assistant heads will be funded through a dedicated performance pay grant. Next year, at least #150 million 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2002 : Column 580W</I><P>
will be ring-fenced for performance pay. Schools can also use their general budgets to award performance pay if they wish to. Education standard spending has increased by #1.3 billion this year, and is continuing to increase over the next three years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what programmes are in place between school science and design technology departments and local industry to obtain hardware for school laboratories and workshops.  [85409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w20.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Nationally, through Science Year, we have secured over #4 million worth of science equipment and resources for schools from partners such as Intel, Pfizer, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the Association for Science Education. Highlights include an Intel Digital Microscope for every maintained primary and secondary school and an electronic whiteboard to every school with a science advanced skills teacher.
<P>

<a name="21216w20.html_para0">At local level, through education and business partnerships, we encourage schools and firms to work together in ways which best meet their joint needs. This can range from scientists and engineers helping with out of school clubs, to providing other resources, including hardware, where local manufacturers of the specialist equipment needed for science and design and technology are able and willing to do so.
<P>

<a name="21216w20.html_para1">From April 2001, the LSC assumed responsibility, for ensuring the provision of education/business link activity, including KS4 work experience and professional development placements (formerly teacher placements), in each of the 47 LSC areas.

<a name="21216w20.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action he has taken to monitor the effectiveness of the School Laboratories for the 21st Century scheme.  [85675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w20.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The #60 million capital funding for the School Laboratories for the 21st Century scheme was spread over two years, with construction works needing to be completed by 31 August 2002. Over the next 12 months an evaluation report will be prepared covering a sample of the 149 participating local education authorities. This will provide details of how the funding has been invested, including what the balance is between newly constructed and refurbished laboratories, and an early indication of what impact this has had on educational standards.

The grant was means tested against the student's own income and that of their parents (if the student was under 25 or not otherwise regarded as independent) or their spouse.

Local education authorities pay supply teachers in accordance with the statutory arrangements for teachers, laid down in the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document. Private supply teacher agencies agree pay rates and terms of service with the teachers they supply. However, we have introduced a range of measures designed to lever up standards of supply teaching and the recruitment and management practices of agencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what priority learning and skills councils will place upon training aimed at adults over 19-years-old.  [85500]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w22.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The training for adults over 19 is vital to both increased productivity and improved social inclusion. The priorities for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) were announced in the Grant Letter for 2003&#150;04, released last Thursday 5 December. One of the four high level priorities (unchanged since the first remit letter in 2000) is Xincreasing demand for learning, and achievement of skills and qualifications by adults". The LSC will be assisted in meeting this priority by the generous budget increase that is included in this Grant Letter: resources will increase from #7.5 billion in 2002&#150;03 to #8 billion in 2003&#150;04, and rising again to #9.2 billion in 2005&#150;06. This record level of investment will give the LSC the resources it needs to bring about radical and sustained improvements in adult skill levels.
<P>

<a name="21216w22.html_para3">The Grant Letter provides more detail on the priorities for adult learning, including a challenging new target of reducing by at least 40 per cent. the number of adults without a level 2 qualification by 2010, and participation by the LSC in pooled budget pilots with Regional Development Agencies. We are working closely with the LSC on the Review of Funding of Adult Learning which will set out in more detail how to meet the adult skill needs. The outcome of the Review will form part of the Skills Strategy which will be published by my Department in June.
<P>

<a name="21216w22.html_para4">Furthermore, the LSC's approach to adult training is set out in detail in its Workforce Development Strategy, released in November 2002. The development of the LSC strategy was co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit report XIn Demand (2): An Action Plan for Adult Skills in the 21st Century", and thus links into the wider Government strategy for adult skills.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the level of central Government funding for university research was for the current year in England per head of population.  [86464]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w22.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 There are three sources of Government funding for higher education research in England: The Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Research Councils and Government Departments. The most recent year for which all these figures are available is for academic year 2000&#150;01, when funding totalled #1.75 billion. Using the latest population estimates from the Office of National Statistics for 2001, at around 49,181,000, this is approximately #36 per head of population.

 The Agricultural Waste Stakeholders' Forum has met twice&#151;on 24 Septembern and 25 November. We have set up a website on which the agenda for, the minutes of and papers discussed at, these meetings are available. The address is: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/agforum/index.htm
<P>

<a name="21216w23.html_para0">At its meeting on 25 November the Forum agreed to the formation of four sub-groups to address specific issues. These are Research and Development; Information Campaign; Licensing and Exemptions; and Recovery, Re-use and Recycling of Non-natural Farm Waste. The sub-groups will meet before the Forum's next meeting on 30 January 2003 and will report their progress to the Forum.

<P>

<a name="21216w23.html_para1">Cattle aged over 30 months may only be slaughtered for human consumption if they come from a low BSE-risk Beef Assurance Scheme herd, for which the age limit is 42 months. All such cattle must be slaughtered in a licensed abattoir, test negatively for BSE, and their meat held under Meat Hygiene Service supervision until the test result is obtained. After receipt of a negative BSE test result, the animal's vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia must be removed from the carcass, under Meat Hygiene Service supervision, at a licensed cutting plant that is separately licensed by the Food Standards Agency for this purpose. Following this, the meat may be supplied to the farmer for personal consumption or for consumption by any other person.
<P>

<a name="21216w23.html_para2">The only exception permitted to this would be if an over 30 month animal was slaughtered personally by its owner for his or her own consumption, with there being no supply of the beef to any other person.

These would require approximately 1,000 of the most economically significant companies to include information on environmental, social and community issues relevant to the company's business in a new Operating and Financial Review. We have supported the Department of Trade and Industry in establishing an independent group of experts to help develop guidance on how directors should assess whether an item is material to their company and would therefore have to be included in its OFR. The group met for the first time this month and will produce guidance in autumn next year.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2000]:</i> The results of the Farm Scale Evaluations for the three spring sown GM crops, fodder maize, beet and spring oil seed rape, are expected to be published in Summer 2003. The results for winter oil seed rape will be published early in 2004. The results will show what effect, if any, there is on the diversity and abundance of farmland wildlife associated with the farmers' management of GM herbicide tolerant crops as compared with equivalent non-GM crops. This will be one factor which will inform decisions that will be taken under Directive 2001/18/EC on the release of these particular GM crops.
<P>

<a name="21216w23.html_para8">In addition there are other regulatory approvals, such as those the commercial cultivation of a GM crop. The nature and timing of any decision taken by the Government will depend on the status of each particular crop within the regulatory system. The Government has a voluntary agreement with the industry that GM crops will not be grown commercially in the UK at least until the Farm Scale Evaluation programme has been completed. No GM crops will be grown commercially in the UK until we are satisfied that they do not cause damage on the environment.

It seeks to prevent cruelty while recognising those activities which are necessary to countryside management such as the protection of animals or crops. All activities have to satisfy the two tests of Xutility" and cruelty (least suffering). The evidence on which decisions were taken include the report of the Burns inquiry and evidence provided to that inquiry, public hearings held in Portcullis House in September and submissions from a variety of organisations and individuals.

 The Government have made no such estimates. The recently proposed changes to the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme will ensure that around #47 million per annum will continue to be made available for spending on local community environmental projects, ensuring that the current level of support for these types of projects is maintained. In addition there will be around #100 million per annum of funding available under the new public spending programme for sustainable waste management projects.
<P>

<a name="21216w25.html_para1">Tax credits which have already been claimed by landfill operators, or which may be claimed until March 2003, will need to be spent under the existing LTCS arrangements. This will ensure that projects which have been allocated tax credit funding will continue to benefit until such time as they are completed.

The ONS published revised estimates for NUTS level 1 (Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the nine English Government Office Regions) for 1989 to 1999 on 21 November 2002, and will be publishing provisional estimates for 2000 and 2001 in December 2002. The ONS then plans to publish consistent sub-regional and local area (NUTS levels 2 and 3 respectively) GVA for the period 1993&#150;2000 early in 2003. These data will be supplied to Eurostat, who will, as described above, convert these to a PPP basis before publishing on an EU=100 index basis.
<BR>
However, I should like to draw to your attention to an announcement the ONS put out this week about an error in sub-national, annual business inquiry estimates which provide part of the source information for many industries. These are impacting on the ONS regional GVA publications of 21 November 2002 and 17 December 2002 referred to above. The size of the error is within the range of variability seen by changes made in the past when first published GVA estimates have been revised. We are taking the unusual step of publishing a revised series of estimates at NUTS-1, 2 and 3 level in early 2003. Therefore the regional GVA series being published in 2002 are being referred to as provisional, but because the size of the revisions is not anticipated to be outside of past user experiences they will continue to be made available, subject to being marked as provisional from now on. The announcement can be found at the NS website at: www.statistics.gov.uk/notices/Impact&#95;on&#95;other&#95;regional&#95;outputs.asp

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget last April that we are reviewing the residence and domicile rules as they affect the tax liabilities of individuals. We believe that any modernisation of these rules needs to be based on clear principles: the rules should be fair, clear, easy to operate and support the competitiveness of the British economy. Paragraphs 5.81&#150;82 of the Pre-Budget Report published on 27 November set out the latest position on the review.

 No. The award would continue regardless of the change of circumstances. Working families tax credit is a fixed award and generally runs for the period of entitlement. However, a claimant can surrender an existing award and make a new claim following the birth of a baby, the adoption of a child or granting of a parental order for a surrogate child. The new tax credits will replace the current system from April 2003 and will be more responsive to changes in family circumstances.

These also take account of the cost of overnight accommodation where a return journey on the same day would be impractical. Under both schemes an award only takes effect when a threshold level of cost has been exceeded.

 The requested information is not available. Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional problems, which affect many aspects of people's lives. They cannot be measured using a single indicator. Our long-term strategy to tackle the underlying causes of poverty is set out in our recently published XOpportunity for all&#151;fourth annual report", which provides detailed analysis on a range of indicators of poverty and social exclusion. Unfortunately, not all indicators can be broken down to the constituency level&#151;due to sample size limitations. The National Statistics website, www.statistics.gov.uk, provides a comprehensive source of information that is available at the constituency level.

Also from next April, a further #15 million will be available for the funeral payment scheme, increasing the amount allowed for unspecified funeral expenses from #600 to #700.

 There were 10 meetings of the Better Regulation Task Force during the past year. Members of the task force are unpaid, but can claim reasonable travel and subsistence expenses.

It is not possible to identify the specific costs within this overall budget. But over the period from July 1999 to the end of November 2002, the administrative and running costs of the task force, covering staff salaries, printing and publication costs etc., have totalled approximately #1,422,000.

Several authorities have identified potentially elevated levels of air pollution in small towns, particularly alongside congested streets. In these cases, authorities are required to designate air quality management areas and to draw up action plans setting out what they intend to do to remedy the situation. Details of all the air quality management areas designated by local authorities to date, together with information on their action plans where available, can be found via the local air quality management section of the National Air Quality Information Archive (www.airquality.co.uk).

<a name="21216w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The local government employers have informed the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister officials that they calculated this figure on the basis that, under the deal outlined in the Fire Brigades Employers Circular of 12 November:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Retained hourly rate would have been equal to the wholetime hourly rate</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But under the deal the current Turn-out fee of #13.93 would have been frozen, until the Turn-out fee calculated on the new basis reached this level.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21216w32.html_para3">The local government employers have informed the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister officials that under this deal the pay of wholetime firefighters would have risen; and any increases in wholetime rates would have raised retained rates, because they would have been linked.
<P>

<a name="21216w32.html_para4">The local government employers have also informed Office of the Deputy Prime Minister officials that this would have led to the typical increase for retained firefighters being 6.4 per cent. more than that for wholetime firefighters. The Fire Brigades Union rejected this deal.
<P>

<a name="21216w32.html_para5">The information which the local government employers have supplied to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister officials, as described, should allow individual retained firefighters to assess the impact of the proposals on their own annual income. Ultimately, however, it is dependent on the individual retained firefighter's workload.

 Information on the extent of overcrowding in England is available from the Survey of English Housing. As mentioned in the reply given to my hon.

 The number of households three or more bedrooms below the bedroom standard is extremely small which means that any estimate from a sample survey will be subject to a very wide margin of error. The best estimate from Survey of English Housing data, averaged over the last three years (1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01, 2001&#150;02) is 4,000 households out of more than 20 million households.

 It is for each local authority with building control responsibilities to decide on the qualifications and experience of officers employed by them on building control duties.
<P>

<a name="21216w33.html_para0">The National House-Building Council is an independent, non-profit distributing company. Inspectors employed by the NHBC carry out inspections in connection with their Buildmark new home warranty scheme. It is for the NHBC to decide whom to employ for purposes connected with that non-statutory scheme.
<P>

<a name="21216w33.html_para1">NHBC inspectors also carry out inspections for building control purposes in cases where NHBC's subsidiary, NHBC Building Control Services Ltd, is acting as an approved inspector. Under Part II of the Building Act 1984, a person carrying out regulated building work may engage an approved inspector as an alternative to applying to the local authority building control department.
<P>

<a name="21216w33.html_para2">Approved inspectors are subject to periodic re-approval by the Construction Industry Council, which is the body designated by the Secretary of State for the purpose of approving inspectors under Part II of the Building Act. The CIC have drawn up criteria for assessing the qualifications and experience of companies and individuals applying or re-applying for the status of approved inspector.

 As of June 2002, local authority statistics show that around 600 people are sleeping rough on any one night. This represents a reduction of around two-thirds since 1998 when it was estimated that nearly 2,000 people were sleeping rough on any one night.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="21216w33.html_para3">Those persons admitted from Sangatte to the United Kingdom under special arrangements are being brought here, not as asylum seekers, but on work visas to contribute and pay taxes. Once they arrive they are being given accommodation while we start the process of training and job matching. We are confident that they will be able to move on to alternative accommodation within three months. In the event of an individual being unable to find their own accommodation they would be eligible to apply for assistance from a local housing authority, but we expect numbers to be small and any burden to be spread across different local authorities.

 The Government take the problem of graffiti very seriously and are examining ways in which it they can reduce the problem. The London Local Authorities Bill, which is currently before Parliament, would clamp down on the sale of spray paints to under 18 year olds within the London area. We are looking carefully at whether we should adopt this approach nationally as part of the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how long on average it takes to introduce an anti-social behaviour order.  [86427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w33.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]:</i> A survey of anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) monitoring forms indicated that the court process was taking on average 13 weeks. To improve the effectiveness of ASBOs and reduce delays, legislative changes have been made under the Police Reform Act 2002 and new guidance published. Courts may now make an interim order to protect the community from the start of the court process, and criminal courts may make orders on conviction, thereby avoiding the need for a separate court process and making better use of court time. In addition, orders may now also cover a wider area, and from 1 April 2003, county courts will be able to make orders when dealing with other civil action.
<P>

<a name="21216w33.html_para11">We will continue to review implementation of these orders with a view to considering whether they can be further streamlined.

: Daventry is not currently a dispersal area for asylum seekers who need accommodation. Asylum seekers without accommodation will be provided with emergency accommodation while their application for support is assessed. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) does not have any current plans to use Daventry as either a dispersal area or for the emergency accommodation of asylum seekers.

 We do not believe that it is necessary to require all asylum seekers to undergo a medical examination as a matter of policy although development of the new policy initiatives introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act will effectively introduce screening to all those who attend an induction centre.
<P>

<a name="21216w34.html_para2">Once they are fully operational we intend that all new asylum applicants who go to an induction centre on arrival will undergo basic health screening. A pilot screening programme started at the Dover induction centre this summer. The evaluation of this pilot has not yet been completed. Immigration officers are obliged, under the terms of the immigration rules, to refer for medical examination anyone who mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for coming to the United Kingdom or who appears not to be in good physical or mental health. Furthermore those seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom for a period of more than six months should normally be referred.

 Chief officers can designate persons employed by their police authority as Community Support Officers (CSOs) under section 38 of the Police Reform Act 2002 when they are satisfied that the person is a suitable person to effectively carry out the functions for the purposes of which he is designated and that he has received adequate training in the carrying out of those functions. Issues such as the deployment, equipment, and supervision arrangements for CSOs are operational matters and are determined by chief officers with knowledge of the local areas where they will deploy CSOs. A chief officer can also remove a designation if he considers that the conditions for designation are no longer met.
<P>

<a name="21216w34.html_para5">CSOs are a new addition to the extended policing family. We are aiming to have 1,200 CSOs deployed nationally in 27 forces by 1 April 2003. Once the lessons from the deployment of the first batches of CSOs become clear the Secretary of State, following consultation with the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers, will issue a Code of Practice under section 45 of the Police Reform Act to which chief officers must have regard, to set out good practice in relation to some of these matters.

 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="21216w35.html_para2">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Teesside. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).
<P>

<a name="21216w35.html_para3">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reporting having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three-fifths of all the illegal income reported.

In addition, up to #55,000 will be available to provide extra support to the newly funded organisations given that they are likely to be less experienced than those applying for the other two strands, and to enable shared learning.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Hornchurch benefits from projects which cover the wider area of Havering. The Havering Drugs Action Team is receiving #566,000 this year from a combined Home Office and Department of Health fund to develop and extend local drug treatment services. These funds will rise to #924,000 by 2005&#150;06. Separately the current XDon't Buy Crime" campaign is raising awareness about purchasing stolen goods. This is part of the Home Office's XSafer Communities Initiative" under which #72,565 has been allocated to Havering for 2002&#150;03.
<P>
<BR>
One recent initiative specifically affected Hornchurch: a London Regional Transport close circuit television (CCTV) scheme called the XHewkeye Project", in which CCTV cameras and associated equipment provided coverage of a station car park. The project was a joint venture involving London Regional Transport, the British Transport Police and local partnerships. Forty-six other car parks in the London region also benefited from the scheme. The package is intended to reduce incidences of motor vehicle crime and the fear of crime for car park users and passengers.

 My hon. Friend (Lord Filkin) and the noble Baroness Scotland of Asthal represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Brussels on 28&#150;29 November.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para4">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 62 (14754/02) (a copy of which has been placed in the Library) with the exception of item 16. Ministers signed the Protocol to the Europol Convention agreed at item 4.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para5">The presidency advised on progress in implementing the Seville European Council conclusions, presenting a report on action taken to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking and on management of the external border. Member states urged the Commission to produce its overdue report on financial resources for repatriation, border management and migration projects. The Commission explained that the financial resources had to come from the current financial perspective, which required re-evaluation of existing commitments within the JHA and External Relations budgets, but that national expenditure would need to remain a significant source of funding.
<P>

of their nationals who have entered the EU illegally. Over lunch, Ministers also discussed the application of the readmission provision in the Cotonou agreement. This would allow member states to approach African Caribbean and Pacific areas countries bilaterally to ask them to take back their nationals.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para7">The Council discussed the time limits to be applied for determining responsibility for an asylum claim in the regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third-country national (Dublin II). The presidency concluded that member states would have one week in which to accept or reject a compromise package comprising a time limit of one year for responsibility on the basis of illegal entry across the external frontier and five months for tolerated illegal presence in a member state. The Council agreed that the latter criterion should apply only to asylum seekers illegally present after the entry into force of the regulation. The Council also agreed to a minutes statement addressing the possible future inclusion in the regulation's scope of applicants for subsidiary protection.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para8">The Council held a brief discussion of Articles 1&#150;19 of the Council directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection concerning the definition of a refugee and those entitled to subsidiary protection. However, two member states maintained reservations on the text.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para9">With the exception of one member state, Ministers agreed to amend Article 16 of the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in member states in line with a United Kingdom proposal allowing for the refusal of support to asylum seekers making late applications. The one other remaining reserve on the text was lifted following a change to Article 11 concerning access to labour markets.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para10">The Council also agreed a statement declaring the European Free Trade Areas and Accession States (from the date of signature of the Accession Treaties) to be safe third countries for the purposes of asylum.

<a name="21216w36.html_para11">The Council adopted a Community programme on the return of third country nationals to source countries and a programme intended specifically to address returns to Afghanistan. The Council also took note of Council conclusions agreed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 November concerning the integration of immigration policy into the Union's relations with third countries. Lord Filkin welcomed the conclusions as a positive first step but called for the monitoring of returns projects to ensure that they were effective.

issued under the 1980 Hague Convention on Child Abduction. In order to encourage other member states to accept the compromise, Baroness Scotland proposed the creation of a strict timetable to initiate custody proceedings in the home court following a non-return order.

<a name="21216w36.html_para13">Consequently, member states were also able to agree the Council Decision authorising the member states, in the interest of the European Community, to sign the Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children.

<a name="21216w36.html_para14">The Council agreed to revise the negotiating mandated for the draft agreement between the European Union and United States of America on judicial co-operation in criminal matters and on extradition.

<a name="21216w36.html_para15">The Council discussed a presidency compromise package intended to address member states' outstanding reservations on the proposed offences in the Framework Decision combating racism and xenophobia. Lord Filkin, with four other member states, agreed that proposal struck the right balance between punishing racist and xenophobic acts and protecting freedom of expression. However, the remaining member states were divided in either expressing fundamental problems with the scope of the instrument or wanting to go substantially further, in particular in reducing the threshold for criminal liability.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para16">The presidency sought agreement to its compromise proposal regarding the abolition of the dual criminality requirement in the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. This would enable member states to maintain dual criminality for a transitional period of up to five years. Although this was acceptable to the majority of delegations, including the United Kingdom, five member states maintained reservations.
<P>

<a name="21216w36.html_para17">Two member states maintained reservations on the proposed penalties for trafficking in small quantities of drugs in the Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking.

<a name="21216w36.html_para19">Under Any Other Business the presidency emphasised the importance of securing an agreement between Europol and the United States of America on the exchange of personal data. The Commission also asked the Council to consider its proposal for a Council Decision on financing certain activities carried out by Europol to fight terrorism. The latter point would be considered at the December JHA Council.

<sup>(21)</sup> As of April 2000, the Metropolitan Police force was reduced in size by a transfer of responsibility for policing some areas to the surrounding forces of Surrey, Hertfordshire and Essex. The effects of the Metropolitan Police boundary changes on 1 April 2000 were incorporated into the police funding formula and the overall transfer between the forces was in terms of financial resources, not of officers.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w38.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 We have not abandoned our targets. Following a review of the Drug Strategy, we concluded that the targets covered the right areas but, as the Home Affairs Committee noted, in some cases they were aspirational. We need targets which are challenging but achievable and which drive an emphasis on tackling problematic drug use and on reducing the harm caused by drugs.
<P>

<a name="21216w38.html_para1">The new targets are set out in the list. The targets are monitored and delivered by Departments working closely together, although each target has a lead Department which co-ordinates delivery. These are indicated in the list.

As with previous targets, more detailed information on how the new targets will be measured will be set out in technical notes available on departmental websites.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w38.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Since 1997 the number of treatment services in England has increased by a third to 715. Under the Updated Drug Strategy, the National Treatment Agency will continue to work to increase the number and capacity of all treatment services to meet the target of doubling the number of people in structured treatment to 200,000 a year by 2008.

<a name="21216w38.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Streeter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what part the concept of indefinite remedial care and harm minimisation for individuals using illegal drugs or prescribed substitutes will play as an alternative to rehabilitation and abstinence under the Updated Drug Strategy.  [86540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w38.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The primary goal of all treatment is abstinence while recognising that some drug misusers may require longer-term support to achieve this. Approaches, such as prescribing methadone or diamorphine as a substitute for illicit opiates, have proven benefits for certain individuals and for society, particularly in terms of stabilising the individual, and reducing injecting behaviour and criminal activity.
<P>

<a name="21216w38.html_para4">The Updated Drug Strategy also contains as a key element the target of reducing drug-related deaths by 20 per cent. by 2004&#151;often the final tragic result of years of risky patterns of use and poor health. Improving the basic health of drug misusers benefits them and the wider community. Programmes will focus on the key risks to health, reaching out on to the street and other places to target drug misusers in crisis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport why ecological cars licensed prior to March 2001 do not benefit from the lower road tax applicable to vehicles in this class registered post March 2001.  [87114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w39.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In order to introduce a VED scheme based on carbon dioxide CO2 emissions (in turn, based on information obtained during the EU Type Approval test) it was necessary to develop systems to enable emissions information to be held on the vehicle register at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). It was also necessary to allow time for motor manufacturers and dealers to make changes to their IT systems to accommodate the new system. Although CO2 information has been available for most new cars registered since 1997, it would have been major and very costly bureaucratic exercise to collect CO2 information retrospectively.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para0">The Chancellor of the Exchequer took these factors into account in setting 1 March 2001 as the date when the scheme should take effect. Whatever date the Chancellor had set, apparently identical vehicles registered either side of that date might have paid different VED rates.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para1">A further reason for choosing the date took into account the effect on the second hand car market. The March 2001 date coincided with the introduction of the XY" registration prefix letter and accordingly would make for a clear indication of what vehicles were, and which were not taxed under the CO2 scheme. That was particularly important as we expect and intend that the scheme to have a strong impact on incentives in the second hand market.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para2">Since CO2 emissions data are not readily available for vehicles registered before 1 March 2001 these cars are taxed on the basis of their engine capacity as a rough indicator of CO2 emissions. There are now around 9 million cars in the lower band of the engine size scheme (set at under 1549 cc) benefiting from a rate of #105, a reduction of #55 per annum on the standard rate.

 The proposed timetable for the A303 Stonehenge Improvement is:
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para3">Publication of draft orders: spring 2003

<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para7">Completion 2008
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para8">The current estimated cost of the scheme is #183 million (excluding development and land costs.) The scheme is a 10.8 km long improvement of the A303 between Amesbury and Berwick Down, upgrading the single carriageway to a dual carriageway, providing a bypass for the village of Winterbourne Stoke and taking the road in a tunnel past Stonehenge. The scheme estimate is based on a 2.1 km bored tunnel.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para9">The assessment of the impact of the works is ongoing. The details in the form of an environmental statement will be published in the spring. There will be a public exhibition and anyone will be able to comment, support or object to the proposals.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para10">To date there have been a variety of views expressed, particularly on the type and length of tunnel that needs to be built. There have also been numerous discussions with partners and stakeholders over the planning and development of the scheme. All those views are being taken into consideration.

<a name="21216w39.html_wqn3"><B> Tony Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to require the last registered keeper of a motor vehicle to pay the costs of dealing with its abandonment.  [87493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w39.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Abandoning a motor vehicle is currently a criminal offence attracting a maximum penalty of a fine of #2,500, three months' imprisonment or both. When a vehicle is abandoned, the local authority that deals with it has the power to recover the cost of removing and disposing of the vehicle from the keeper.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para11">Local authorities can seek information about the keeper of the vehicle from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The DVLA has recently made a successful bid under the Invest to Save Programme to fund an electronic link to local authorities to enable them to seek that information 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2002 : Column 656W</I><P>
more quickly and efficiently. That link is currently being rolled out to local authorities, following a successful pilot in Sussex.
<P>

<a name="21216w39.html_para12">The 2002 Finance Act contained outline powers to establish a system of continuous registration, which will ensure that keepers of vehicles remain responsible for licensing that vehicle until such time that DVLA has been properly notified of its disposal. This will ensure that it is much more difficult for keepers of vehicles to evade their responsibilities to dispose of vehicles properly, or to evade meeting local authority costs when a vehicle is abandoned. We are currently considering how this legislation will be implemented and will make an announcement in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment her Department has made of the risk of prions being transferred to meat for consumption <i>(a)</i> through blood and <i>(b)</i> by cutting equipment in abattoirs.[Transferred]  [86071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w41.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency advises me that the risk of prions being transferred to meat for consumption is currently estimated to be low. Specified risk material (SRM) controls cover those parts of animals considered most likely to harbour any transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) infectivity. The TSE regulations require that SRM neither enters the food chain nor comes into contact with any other animal material while in the slaughterhouse.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para2">Ongoing research underway includes investigation of different parts of a bovine animal beyond the currently defined SRM, and their response to an experimental challenge of BSE infected feed. This has not indicated to date that muscle tissue would itself become infected.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para3">The Agency is, in addition, undertaking research to evaluate the risk of prions being inadvertently transferred to meat at abattoirs, and possible ways through which risk can be reduced. This work in progress includes the examination of alternative cutting techniques for removal of spinal column. Results will be published once the work has been completed.

<P>
(3) whom he has recently met from the natural health specialist retail sector and its consumers to discuss the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive; what views those individuals expressed to him; and what action he intends to take.  [85086]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w41.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Directive 2002/46/EC on Food Supplements was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 12 July 2002 and must be implemented into Member States' national legislation by 31 July 2003. The Food Standards Agency is currently consulting on draft implementing Regulations.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para4">In the short-term the EU food Supplements Directive is unlikely to have any effect upon employment, profit, the number of small firms or sales in the health food industry.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para5">In the longer-term, the impact of the directive will depend upon progress in adding vitamin and minerals and their sources to the lists of permitted nutrients in the Directive and upon developments in the setting of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency is arguing the case for these maximum limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments so that there is no unnecessary restriction on the range of products that can be marketed.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para6">We have received a substantial number of representations from the National Association of Health Stores, Consumers for Health Choice, Holland and Barrett and General Nutrition Centres about the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. The main thrust of the representations is to express strong opposition to, or serious concerns about, the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products and to express the view that the proposals would threaten viability, profits and jobs in the health food sector, particularly among independent stores. They fear that the Directive will lead to a substantial reduction in consumer choice and have expressed the view that the proposals are over-regulatory in terms of the scope of the Directive and the likely costs of meeting the various requirements. They indicate their belief that there is no evidence that products in question are unsafe or dangerous.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para7">Ministers have met representatives of the natural health specialist retail sector on a number of occasions. Most recently, my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (the Lord Hunt of Kingsheath) met a representative from the National Association of Health Stores on 21 November and representatives of Consumers for Health Choice, Holland and Barrett and General Nutrition Centres on 28 November. He also attended a Consumers for Health Choice Parliamentary reception on 4 December.




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2002 : Column 664W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para8">The main regulatory burdens arising from the Directive, for example in relation to the cost of preparing dossiers and applying for registrations, would fall on manufacturers. At meetings with Ministers representatives from a wide range of United Kingdom trade associations representing manufacturers of herbal remedies and health foods have told us that that they believe the Directive will lead to greater consumer confidence and greater stability in the market and have requested that the Government should support the initiative while seeking to achieve maximum flexibility. The Herbal Forum which represents ten UK manufacturers' trade associations, covering the health food, herbal remedies, ethnic medicines and aromatherapy sectors wrote to my noble Friend on 18 November to support the case for appropriate regulation in order to ensure that the public is properly protected against inferior quality products which the current system can allow onto the market. The forum indicates that it appreciates the need for the Directive while identifying a number of areas of concern that it wishes to see addressed in European negotiations or in implementation at national level.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para9">The proposals remain under negotiation, and there are wide differences of view within the herbal sector about the possible impact of the Directive. It is therefore problematic to make reliable estimates of the kind requested in relation to the health food sector. However, our overall assessment remains that it will be possible for a very wide range of herbal remedies to be brought to the market under the Directive as currently drafted. We also share the view put to us by many people in the sector that the proposed systematic approach to standards of quality, safety and information are likely to enhance public confidence and the future prosperity of the sector. Moreover, if in negotiations we achieve the ability to extend the principle of simplified registration to an additional range of products which currently require a full marketing authorisation, in particular traditional herbal remedies with added nutrients, this is likely to lead to increased opportunities for both manufacturers and retailers and a significant expansion in consumer choice as compared with the current position in the UK.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para10">We intend to continue to engage positively in the ongoing European negotiations on the Directive, seeking to ensure the maximum flexibility, consistent with the protection of public health. In negotiations on the Directive, and in any subsequent implementation, we will also seek to contain the regulatory impact, and we welcome the stated intention of the Herbal Forum to work constructively and closely with the Medicines Control Agency to achieve this objective.
<P>

<a name="21216w41.html_para11">At this stage of negotiations on the Directive it is not yet possible to make estimates of costs of registering products. The cost of testing finished products before release onto the market is a matter for the relevant licence holders and, if they choose to purchase the service from a third party, this is for negotiation between the user and supplier of such services.

 The aims of the sexual health and HIV strategy published last year include reducing the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and reducing the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV and STIs.

<a name="21216w43.html_para0">The Department has allocated an extra #47.5 million towards implementation of the strategy. This includes #4 million for the new sex lottery awareness campaign about preventing STIs, including HIV, which targets young adults aged 18 to 30 years. This complements the teenage pregnancy awareness campaign, which also highlights the importance of condoms in preventing STIs.

This processing time

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance he has issued in respect of waiting times for MRI scans; and what the average waiting time is in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> North Staffordshire.  [85673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w43.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We do not collect waiting times for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, nor has any central guidance been issued. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all the remaining patients waiting to be scanned.
<P>

<a name="21216w43.html_para12">Where an MRI scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two months wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which will be rolled out for all cancers by the end of 2005.
<P>

<a name="21216w43.html_para13">To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners, including a replacement scanner at North Staffordshire. By 2004, approximately 100 MRI scanners will have been provided through central purchasing programmes.

<i>Key Notes:</i><P>

1. Three-month vacancy information is as at 31st March 2002.<P>

2. Three-month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more, (whole-time equivalent).<P>

3. Three-month vacancy rates are three-month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three-month vacancies plus staff in post.<P>

4. Three-month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey, March 2002.<P>

5. Staff in post data is from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September 2001.<P>

6. Staff in post data excludes staff employed by health authorities, as vacancy information was only collected from trusts, PCTs and Special Health Authorities.<P>

7. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest ten.<P>

8. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<P>

<i>Other Notes:</i><P>

9. Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts.<P>

10. Due to rounding, calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<P>

11. Figures may not match previously published data due to a different method of rounding used on the staff in post data.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what information restaurants and take-away food outlets are required to publish in relation to the presence of genetically modified foods and food products in the meals they supply; how they are able to find out about such a presence in <i>(a)</i> their ingredients and <i>(b)</i> the food which the animals which produced it were fed on; what the penalties are for non-compliance with these requirements; which enforcement authorities are responsible for ensuring compliance; how many prosecutions have been brought for failing to comply with the regulations; what the outcome was in each of those cases; and what estimate he makes of the total cost to date to (i) industry in implementing and (ii) public funds in enforcing this legislation.  [85833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21216w44.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Current labelling regulations require food sold to the final consumer or to mass caterers to be labelled as genetically modified if an ingredient contains novel genetic material (DNA or protein). There are no requirements to label products from animals fed GM feed. In the United Kingdom, these requirements also extend to food sold in catering establishments where information on the extent to which GM ingredients are used is provided to customers on demand.
<P>

<a name="21216w44.html_para0">Enforcement of the Genetically Modified and Novel Food (Labelling) (England) Regulations 2000 is a matter for the local authorities, with the penalty on conviction under these regulations being a fine not exceeding level five on the standard scale. Parallel arrangements apply in other of parts of the UK. Compliance checks are usually carried out as part of routine premises inspections and no specific costs are recorded for the enforcement of these regulations. There have been no prosecutions to date. No details of the actual costs incurred by the hospitality industry have been received in recent consultations, but the total cost to the catering industry was estimated at #1 to #2 million in the regulatory impact assessment for the Genetically Modified and Novel Food (Labelling) (England) Regulations 2000.

<P>

<a name="21216w44.html_para1">Severe side effects that could occur in anyone included generalized vaccinia and progress vaccinia and post-vaccination encephalitis. However these side effects were more likely to occur in those with any degree of immuno-suppression or in pregnant women and their offspring. Eczema vaccinatum was a very serious side effect in those with active skin lesions at the time of the vaccination. Post vaccination encephalitis could also occur in anyone.
<P>

<a name="21216w44.html_para2">The overall risk of severe complications following vaccination is low but they could be fatal. Complications occurred more frequently in persons receiving their first dose of vaccine, and among very young children.

<P>
<a name="21216w44.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The existing childhood immunisation programme has been extremely effective in eradicating diseases that previously killed and disabled large numbers of children. For example, polio vaccination has eliminated polio for more than 15 years from this country. MMR has virtually wiped out congenital rubella syndrome and has prevented any child deaths from acute measles for 10 years.
<P>

<a name="21216w44.html_para3">The impact of the childhood programme is reviewed regularly. Changes to programme are only considered following a careful assessment of all of the evidence by the expert advisory body the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. No decisions have yet been made concerning extending the programme.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) will not immediately assume financial responsibility for prison health services as a result of the transfer of Departmental budgetary responsibility for these services to the Department from April 2003.
