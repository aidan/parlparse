 There are a range of legislative and enforcement measures in place that are aimed at protecting children from sexual abuse. Through the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the law was overhauled to provide greater protection for children from sexual abuse, and a new offence of &#145;meeting a child following sexual grooming&#146; was introduced. Those who seek to harm children, whether through the online or offline environment, and whether acting alone or in groups, can expect to face the full force of the law. Of course, enforcement measures are kept under constant review in order to deal with the challenges presented by the constantly developing IT environment.</p>

 On <i> (a)</i> and <i> (b)</i> I refer to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) on 21 November, <i> Official Report</i>, column 36W.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="61122w0003.htm_para1"><a name="06112239000184">The steps which we are taking to reduce levels are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="61122w0003.htm_para4"><a name="06112239000187">We are also continuing to enforce from the record. Continuous registration requires vehicles to be either taxed or subject to a statutory off-road notice at any time. As a result, it is no longer necessary to &#145;catch&#146; an untaxed vehicle being used on the road in order to prosecute the keeper for VED evasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="61122w0003.htm_para5"><a name="06112239000188">We are using improved methods of detection (such as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment), data and intelligence to target non-compliant vehicles on the road. In 2005-06 DVLA and its local authority partners clamped over 79,000 vehicles, more than half of which were crushed. A new contract was let in May 2006 which will allow this national scheme to be expanded. We expect DVLA and its partners to clamp around 150,000 untaxed vehicles this year.</p>

These long-term arrangements are based on the UK&#146;s conditionality policy which sets out the circumstances under which DFID will interrupt or suspend aid. We will consider interrupting aid if there is a breach of the partnership commitments that form the basis of our relationship with national governments; i.e. if:</p>

Initially it would trigger discussion with the partner Government about progress with reforms and how constraints to implementation might be resolved. However, a persistent failure to achieve results would lead us to review the Government&#146;s commitment to poverty reduction. The strategic partnership arrangements are supported by individual funding instruments for each development intervention.

 The Department for Social Development supports volunteering policy and practice in a number of ways. It provides core funding to the Volunteer Development Agency as a regional infrastructure organisation to promote and support volunteering practice. It also invests over &#163;1.1 million per year under the Volunteer Bureau Initiative to improve the local organisation and infrastructure of volunteering by providing core funding to a network of 15 volunteer centres across Northern Ireland.</p>

The projects funded cover a range of issues including young people, the elderly, health and the environment, across Northern Ireland.

<i> [holding answer 22 November 2006]:</i> An initial assessment of departmental aviation emissions was carried out using air travel data from 2005-06 and the conversion factors published in DEFRA&#146;s &#145;Guidelines for Company Reporting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions&#146;. These factors are currently 0.11 kg CO2 per passenger kilometre for long-haul travel, and 0.15 kg CO2 per passenger kilometre for short-haul. For the purposes of the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, a multiplier of x2 has been applied to the estimated totals to take into account the additional climate impact of non-CO2 emissions at altitude. The calculations do not differentiate between economy and business class travel due to the minimal difference in emissions involved and the difficulty of accurately accounting for total passenger numbers on individual flights.</p>
