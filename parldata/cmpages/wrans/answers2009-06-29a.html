The estimates do not take account of the anticipated reductions in the costs of work which are expected as a result of the changes to scheme processes being enforced through the ongoing contract renegotiations with eaga which are not yet complete. A number of changes of this kind have been agreed, including the introduction of competition between installers for work which will drive down costs, meaning more homes than those quoted below may be assisted.</p>

The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of small gaseous oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered.

Families are assigned a visiting officer who acts as the link between the family and the services, assisting with such matters as repatriation, funeral arrangements and expenses, and help with necessary paperwork to procure pensions etc. The visiting officers will also direct the family to the most appropriate internal and external welfare agencies for specific areas of support.</p>

 Pensions paid under the terms of the Gurkha Pension Scheme, which is now a closed scheme, are calculated in Indian currency rupees (ICR) and paid in Nepalese currency rupees (NCR).

 The Department does not allocate funding directly to support environmental education initiatives in specific schools. Environmental education is one of the key concepts for the study of geography in the new secondary curriculum and the Action Plan for Geography supports this, by providing professional development opportunities for teachers in the regions to help them embed sustainable development and environmental education in their classroom practice. We are also working with stakeholders, including the Government Office West Midlands and local authorities, to engage and support schools work towards the DCSF's Sustainable Schools strategy which aims for all schools to be sustainable by 2020. The strategy is guided by a commitment to care for the environment both locally and nationally and a national framework has been established to help schools identify areas on which they can focus to develop their sustainability practices.</p>

The reporting requirements placed on institutions as part of their sponsor duties under Tier 4 are sufficiently robust to ensure that students who are no longer attending are reported to the UK Border Agency, while also being sufficiently flexible to allow for the different ways in which institutions monitor student attendance.</p>

These discussions included financing arrangements for the A350 XWB on which the UK, French, German and Spanish Governments are in separate negotiations with Airbus.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills pursuant to the answer of 10 June 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 925-26W, on insolvency, whether he has made an estimate of the projected increase in numbers of company administrations in 2009-10, based on the trends identified; and whether he has made an assessment of the merits of making additional funds available to the Insolvency Service to take account of the increase in the number of company administrations owing to the current economic situation.

<i> [holding answer 23 June 2009]:</i><i> </i>No official estimates of the number of company administrations in 2009/10 and beyond have been compiled by the Insolvency Service (The Service). This is because company administrations are overseen by private practice insolvency practitioners, and so do not require additional funds from The Service. Administrators have a duty to report to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills on the conduct of directors and shadow directors of a company in administration. Where an adverse report has been submitted, The Service may carry out an investigation. The Service has implemented a number of initiatives to assist in the planning and management to deal with increases in the number of adverse reports, including more pro-active targeting and prioritisation of cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="90629w0022.htm_para0"><a name="09062946000094">The Service also monitors compliance by insolvency practitioners with Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 (SIP 16 Pre-packaged sales in administrations), with which all insolvency practitioners are required to comply. Pre-pack administrations are where a sale of the business or assets is arranged before administration and executed by the administrator immediately on or shortly after their appointment. SIP 16 requires insolvency practitioners in pre-pack administrations to explain in detail to creditors the background to their appointment and the reasons for any transaction undertaken through a pre-pack.</p>

It was limited to make sure its benefits are balanced with the needs of other sectors of the car industry including the second hand market and repair businesses, and of manufacturers of other consumer durables.

<i> [holding answer 26 June 2009]:</i> The scrappage scheme was primarily designed to boost the automotive industry and restore consumer confidence not as a green measure. However, we believe that there will be some benefits for the environment as old vehicles are replaced by newer, by and large more fuel-efficient models. A summary of the wide range of Government initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from road vehicles was set out in our &#147;Ultra-Low Carbon Vehicles in the UK&#148; strategy published on 16 April 2009.</p>

 All processing of personal data in the UK must be carried out in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). The fifth data protection principle in the DPA requires that personal data is not kept for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. This principle would apply to any personal data contained in complaints against former employees, including those that are later withdrawn.
