 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps have been taken to encourage Afghan farmers to move from growing poppies to other food crops.  [193437]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41101w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 DFID is supporting organisations that are working in a number of poppy growing provinces across Afghanistan, including Badakhshan, Kandahar and Helmand. These organisations, including the Aga Khan Foundation and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, are working with farmers to help them identify and try a range of legal crops, providing seeds, fertilizer and tools. However, crops alone are not the only way to help those involved in opium poppy farming to earn a legal income. These projects also work to identify and help with non-crop and off-farm opportunities, including help with animal rearing, improving animal welfare, and training in crafts such as tailoring.

 The Advisory Group on Motorcycling (AGM), which submitted its report to Government on 2 August, commented that since the majority of novice riders choose to pass their test via the Direct Access route, as a relatively fast route to big bike riding, it is timely for Government to consider a range of issues in reviewing its effectiveness. It also recommended that the Government seek to negotiate a third EC licensing Directive to retain UK subsidiarity, in so far as possible, over training and testing arrangements, and especially with respect to Direct Access. A copy of the report is lodged with the House.

<a name="stpa_14">The AGM conducted a five-year programme of work and its report includes wide-ranging suggestions and recommendations for the future of motorcycling. The future of Direct Access is just one of a range of issues on training and testing discussed by the AGM. We are reviewing these carefully in drawing up a national motorcycling strategy that we are aiming to have developed by the end of the year. Should that review lead to proposals for change, we would consult before implementing them. Our review will need to take account of the third licensing Directive. The Commission&#039;s proposals do include arrangements which member states will have to abide by on testing to gain a licence to ride a motorcycle. But we aim to achieve a Directive which furthers the interests of road safety in the UK, and allows maximum latitude for us, and other member states, to tailor future testing arrangements to suit our own needs, and especially in respect of Direct Access.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="41101w04.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 My Department estimates the additional cost of installing a new Puffin crossing compared with a new Pelican crossing to be approximately &#163;2,500. This is due to additional items of equipment required for the crossing operation. The cost of converting an existing Pelican crossing to a Puffin crossing may be higher depending on local factors, and often equipment upgrades and other improvements are made at the same time. Local authorities are not obliged to change to Puffin crossings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41101w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_19">The Puffin crossing was developed in response to complaints arising from poor understanding and use of Pelican crossings by pedestrians and drivers, especially confusion caused by the flashing green man and flashing amber vehicle signals. With Puffin crossings, drivers are held at a red signal when pedestrians are crossing and the crossing time is automatically extended for slower pedestrians. The advantages for drivers are that the lights will change back to green sooner than at a Pelican crossing and they will not be stopped if pedestrians cross in a gap in the traffic before the signals change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41101w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_20">The Puffin crossing pedestrian signal is at the near-side of the road. This allows pedestrians to watch the traffic and the pedestrian signal simultaneously. The position of the near side signal is also helpful to visually impaired pedestrians who may not see clearly signals mounted at the far side of the road.

Note:<br>

Information for 1997&#150;99 is not directly comparable with subsequent years because of changes to the reporting system in 2000 (containers carried on ship by shipborne port to port trailers were included in 1997&#150;99, but only partially included from 2000. The ports mainly affected by this change are Grimsby and Immingham, Tees and Hartlepool and London). Estimates have been made of the number of inwards containers in 1997&#150;99, from inwards and outwards traffic combined.<br>

In addition, we do not know how many EPAs exist as they do not have to be registered before use, and therefore we have no means of contacting the attorneys to advise them of the Bill&#039;s first principles. However those appointed in such a capacity will still have fiduciary and common law duties towards the person lacking capacity. Guidance issued by the Public Guardianship Office advises attorneys that they must act in the best interests of the client at all times.

<p>
<a name="41101w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_54">The new criminal offence proposed in the Mental Capacity Bill is intended to capture those individuals who are in a position of trust, care and power over people who are then ill-treated or neglected. If an attorney under an EPA has the care of a person who lacks or whom he reasonably believes to lack capacity and ill-treats or wilfully neglects that person, he may be guilty of the offence.

 The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service strongly supports the principles of children maintaining a strong relationship with both parents where it is safe for them to do so. Co-operation between parents who separate is critical for the well-being of the children and is encouraged by CAFCASS. The service works to ensure that both parents and wider family members continue to have a real and meaningful relationship with their children through high quality, supported contact arrangements.

<p><a name="qn_82"><a name="41101w10.html_wqn0"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how proposals in the Children Bill [<i>Lords</i>] on information exchange and proposed new systems developed by local authorities will deal with children who enter and leave the jurisdiction of England from or to other parts of the UK; and what discussions his officials have had with officials from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on this matter.

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="41101w10.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 25 October 2004]:</i> Clause 12 of the Children Bill, now before Parliament, sets out proposals for databases, to be established at local, regional or national level or a combination thereof, containing information about all children in England. The databases are a tool to facilitate early intervention and help ensure effective action to meet the needs of children before a crisis develops. Practitioners working with children will be able to see who else is working with a child and if a concern about a child has been recorded. This will prompt them to get in touch with other practitioners and, together, gain a better, all-round picture of the child&#039;s needs and how they might best be met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41101w10.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_60">Our intention is that children entering England from other parts of the UK will be included on the databases following their first contact with the health or education service or another children&#039;s service. Although the databases will not contain detailed case data, they will include basic identifying data and contact details of professionals who are or have recently been working with a child, and an indicator if a professional has a concern about that child and therefore wishes to be contacted by others. We recognise the desirability of having effective mechanisms for transfer of such data between the databases in England and any appropriate systems in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41101w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_61">Clause 29 of the Children Bill contains provisions for Wales which parallel those for England. My officials will work closely with the Welsh Assembly as databases are implemented in both countries to ensure data can be transferred.

Additionally, as set out in paragraph 11 of the Command Paper, up to &#163;300 million from the sports lottery distributors will be used to fund elite sport and associated sports infrastructure development.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="41101w11.html_spnew14"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The robust and business-like approach to planning and financial controls on the part of the Olympic Stakeholders is designed to prevent such overspend. As the memorandum of understanding, laid before Parliament as Command Paper 5867, states in paragraph 17, in the event of any overspend the Government will be the ultimate guarantor. We further reported this to Parliament in a departmental minute dated 2 December 2003. As the memorandum goes on to say, the Government expects to discharge that responsibility (should it arise) in a sharing agreement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London and through seeking additional national lottery funding in amounts to be agreed at the time. At this stage however, no such specific sharing arrangements exist. Whatever the arrangements which might apply, levels of any London council tax precept would be a matter for the Mayor of London.

Notaries are currently designated for that purpose, and following discussions with their professional bodies, solicitors will shortly be added. Other professional groups may be added in due course.

 The Government looked with local authorities in the context of the Spending Review 2004 (SR04) at the pressures councils face up to 2007&#150;08, along with the scope for efficiency savings. SR04 provides continued investment in local government services with &#163;7.2 billion more in general grant for local government programmes by 2007&#150;08 over 2004&#150;05. The Gershon Review&#039;s expectation is each authority creates efficiency gains from existing budgets of at least 2.5 per cent., at least half of which is cashable. There will be no impact on authorities&#039; overall budgets as there is no intention to increase or reduce planned budgets as a result of implementing the review. Efficiency gains made by each authority can be re-invested into front line local services. The provisional local government finance settlement for 2005&#150;06 will be announced shortly which will be followed by a consultation period where authorities will be able to make written representations on the Government&#039;s proposals.

Notes:<br>

1. Data are collected at local education authority (LEA) level. Included here are the data for all London LEAs.<br>

2. Recorded here is expenditure in relation to the authority&#039;s youth service. This includes provision at residential and non-residential youth centres, including activity, outdoor and urban studies centres related to youth service provision. Also includes development workers, advisors and youth leaders not based at youth centres. This excludes any capital expenditure.<br>

3. The expenditure data to 1998&#150;99 are drawn from the annual &#039;RO1&#039; spending returns which local authorities submitted to the ODPM. Figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 were drawn from section 52 (table 3) outturn statements which LEAs submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002&#150;03 are taken from section 52 (table A) outturn statements.<br>

4. The priority age group for youth services is 13&#150;19 (although youth services can also provide support for targeted groups in the 11 to 13 and 19 to 25 age ranges). In order to provide a figure for expenditure per capita on youth services we have divided each London LEA&#039;s net current expenditure on youth services by the total population aged 13&#150;19 within that authority. The population figures are estimated resident mid year population figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and these have recently been revised following the 2001 Census. Thus for financial year 1996&#150;97 we have used the population estimate from mid year 1996 and for 1997&#150;98 we used the mid 1997 estimate (and so on).<br>

5. Data (cash terms) are as reported by the LEA at 24 October 2004.<br>

 At this time, the Government have no plans to publish a statement of their aspirations for the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in 2005. However, the Government are strongly committed to the NPT, which is the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The UK&#039;s goals for the review conference are to make the case for stronger and more effective counter-proliferation measures and to emphasise the importance of compliance with the treaty. We will do this in the context of emphasising the UK&#039;s good record on nuclear disarmament, and we will produce a final report of the studies that we have conducted on the verification of nuclear disarmament. We look forward to working with the chair and other countries before and during the Conference itself to help secure a successful outcome.

There have been a number of non-government schemes and codes of practice which have incorporated some elements of performance monitoring. The Office of Fair Trading monitors complaints and enforcement action in relation to specific offences across all consumer activity including the car repair sector.

<a name="41101w23.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_143">The Office of Fair Trading has recently approved the code of the Vehicle Builders and Repairers Association. One of the criteria to be met in order to achieve approval is that there should be in place effective means of monitoring performance against code content. The OFT also recently approved a code by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which in part covers manufacturers&#039; activity in relation to repairs required under new car warranty.

 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made clear in July, the force structure, organisation and capabilities of the armed forces are to be modernised in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The decision to cease the infantry arms plot and encouraging progress in Northern Ireland has meant that we are able to restructure the infantry as part of this process and reduce the number of infantry battalions from 40 to 36. As I have made clear in my previous answers to the hon. Member, all of the manpower freed up from the reduction in infantry battalions will be reinvested across the army, to strengthen key enabling capabilities such as engineers, signals and intelligence.

<p><a name="st_282"><a name="41101w29.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 There is currently no requirement for the Type 45 destroyer to be fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and so no requirement for a detailed costing to be undertaken. If a requirement is subsequently identified, the appropriate ship in the build or upkeep cycle would be identified as the first to receive such missiles.

2. Working age claimants are men aged 16&#150;64 and women aged 16&#150;59.<br>

3. Numbers are taken from a 5 per cent. sample and are subject to a degree of sampling error.<br>

4. Working age client group dataset excludes a small number of Incapacity Benefit (IB) claimants who are over State Pension Age (SPA), and Income Support claimants above SPA (whether or not they have a partner under SPA).<br>

5. Figures cover individuals claiming both IB/SDA and IS. There will be some additional cases where a person claims IB/SDA with their partner claiming IS on behalf of the benefit unit. The number of such cases is unknown.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures show total cost of Income Support paid to Incapacity Benefit recipients, and people receiving National Insurance Credits on grounds of incapacity, whether they receive a Disability Premium in Income Support or not, and separately, spending only for those that receive a Disability Premium. Spending on the latter group is a subset of the expenditure on the former group.<br>

2. Figures are estimates based on a 5 per cent. sample of the caseload, taken in February, May, August and November each year. They have been calculated by multiplying weekly average amounts for each group by the caseload in each group. This figure was multiplied by 52 to give an estimate of annual costs.<br>

<a name="stpa_194"><i>Letter from Mr. David Anderson to Mr Paul Holmes, dated 1 November 2004:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_149">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to reply direct to your questions about increasing awareness of the Customers&#039; Charter amongst customers and staff; about the steps being taken to improve the quality and volume of information on benefit entitlements available to customers, providing an improved telephone service and improving staff attitudes and about the National Customer Satisfaction Survey 2004. These are matters which fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_150">The current Customers&#039; Charter was developed before the launch of Jobcentre Plus and involved consultation with customers, their representative groups and our staff. Its aim was to make clear the minimum standards of service customers could expect from the new agency.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_151">Awareness of the Charter is high amongst staff. However, the results of the 2003 National Satisfaction Survey showed that less than a third of customers knew about the Charter and understood its purpose. That finding was explored in greater depth in late 2003 when an independent research organisation (GHK) was commissioned to complete a review of the Charter involving customers, their representatives&#039; groups and our staff.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_152">A number of recommendations were made from staff and customers about style, content and the need to raise awareness of our customer service commitments. We are considering these recommendations with a view to making changes to the existing Charter and how we communicate our service standards in 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_153">Jobcentre Plus has robust systems and procedures in place to ensure that both written and verbal information offered to customers on benefit entitlements is accurate. In addition, Jobcentre Plus checks the accuracy of written information it provides to its customers by a 6 monthly review of the content of all leaflets about benefits and services for people of working age. This forms part of an agreement made with the Secretary of State each year.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_154">In April 2004, we conducted research into our customers&#039; requirements of information on work and benefits. As a result of these findings the existing leaflets for working age customers are being replaced with a new range of products, restructured to better meet customer requirements and fit into Jobcentre Plus&#039; business processes. We anticipate that the new leaflets will become available on a rolling basis during 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_155">We have also changed the way we provide information and guidance to our own staff in order to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. We have implemented an electronically based system which all staff can access through their desk top PCs. The guidance is centrally maintained to ensure currency and accuracy and it is structured to provide links to learning material and other relevant guidance.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_156">Jobcentre Plus is establishing a network of modern contact centres to answer calls from customers about claims to benefit and looking for work. When the network is complete, access to Jobcentre Plus by telephone will be simpler and more straightforward.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_157">We are committed to ensuring our staff have the appropriate skills and professional approach when dealing with our customers. We have a range of learning products available on areas such as customer service, equal opportunities, interviewing and communication skills.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_158">Furthermore, we expect managers to play an important part in ensuring that correct attitudes and behaviours are displayed by observing and giving feedback as part of their role.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_159">The first National Customer Satisfaction Survey was published in September 2003 and acts as a baseline measure against which subsequent surveys can be measured. The Surveys seek to determine customers&#039; levels of satisfaction with the delivery of customer service standards as described in the Customers&#039; Charter.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_160">The 2004 National Customer Satisfaction Survey was undertaken by the Policy Research Institute (PRI), Leeds Metropolitan University. The research showed that overall level of satisfaction with the customer service provided is high, with 80% of respondents reported being very or fairly satisfied with the standard of service they received.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_161">The findings in 2004 are consistent with the 2003 baseline results with improvements showing in a number of areas of service. These include the proportion of customers considering staff attitudes as a reason for complaining which has fallen from 26% in 2003 to 19% in 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_162">We also asked respondents whether they thought service had improved, stayed the same or deteriorated in the past 12 months. 24% felt it had improved, while 69% felt it had stayed the same.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_163">While we are encouraged by these findings, we recognise the importance of continually improving customer service and, in relation to the service standards in the Charter, will continue to focus on improving the ability of staff to determine the needs of customers and provide relevant and appropriate information.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

3. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

 The NHS Plan announced that the Department would provide an additional &#163;20 million per year to establish a national cancer research network. The National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) and the National Translational Cancer Research Network were established as a result. The NCRN is currently providing national health service infrastructure support for four mesothelioma studies. These are:

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published, in February 2004, a clinical guideline for the national health service on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems. Part 1.15 of the guideline, covering applications of cryopreservation in cancer treatment, says:
