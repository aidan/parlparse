 A wide-ranging review of soldiers' career structures and terms of service is presently under way. This will include consideration of the continued utility of manning control point reviews as a structural control mechanism. In the meantime, against the background of current Army manning shortfalls, there are no plans to conduct any manning control point reviews in the next 12 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 21 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 785W, on reserve forces, what is being done to remedy the shortfall of reservists; what assessment he has made of the reasons for the difference in the level of shortfall in the three services; and if he will break down the shortfall by <i>(a)</i> rank and <i>(b)</i> branch.

 The Volunteer Reserve Forces run vigorous recruiting campaigns to meet their requirements for manpower each year. The approaches they adopt reflect their differing requirements. The Territorial Army recruits continuously throughout the year, with a surge effort in the spring. Local radio, press and regional events are used, as well as campaigns combined with the Regulars. The Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Auxiliary Air Force recruit on a unit basis, with budgets specifically allocated for this purpose. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force recruits on an ad-hoc basis as and when vacancies arise.
<P>

<a name="30605w01.html_para3">The level of shortfall in each of the Volunteer Reserve Forces varies. Each has different requirements and looks for different skills, which affects their recruitment. The Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marine Reserve and Royal Auxiliary Air Force are smaller, and recruit for a specialised reserve. They therefore have limited opportunities that arise in specific parts of the country where units are based. As a larger organisation, the

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what practices have been in place in the last 10 years to inform war widows of their right to backdate their war widows pension.  [116064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30605w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 A war widows pension may be awarded where death is due to service in the armed forces. There are no time limits for claiming a pension but as a result the onus is normally on the war widow to claim. The commencement date of any resulting award depends on the individual circumstances of the claim. There is no right for a war widows pension to be backdated, for instance, where she has failed to claim from an earlier date.
<P>

<a name="30605w01.html_para9">The normal rules provide that where death is in service or a claim is made within three months of death a war widows pension may be paid from the day after death; otherwise, a pension will be paid from the date of the claim or application for review as the case may be. Similar provision applies to the restoration of a war widows pension on the death of a second or subsequent husband.
<P>

<a name="30605w01.html_para10">In certain specified circumstances a pension may be paid from a date earlier than that provided for by the normal rules where, for instance, a widow has been prevented from claiming a pension because of ill health.

<a name="30605w02.html_para1">EU Directive 2001/18 requires that applications to place GMOs on the market consist of a substantial dossier of information about the particular GMO and scientific evidence concerned with potential risks associated with the intended use.

In addition, we have committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to support the development of health systems in poorer countries. Strengthening such systems is vital if drugs are to be safely and sustainably supplied to the poor. DFID as the second largest contributor to the Global Fund has also just increased its contribution by $80 million to a total of $280million in recognition of the need to accelerate efforts to reduce infections globally.

 The Equal Pay Act 1970 has made real headway for many women and since 1975 when it came into effect the full-time pay gap has narrowed from 30 per cent. to 19 per cent. in 2002. However the "pay gap" is not just about unequal pay (covered by the Act) it is also about employment opportunities, work experience, culture and attitudes. Legislation has enabled us to make good progress, but the Government are determined to do more and are working to reduce the gender pay gap through a variety of measures which help strengthen and maintain women's attachment to the labour market, including the equal pay questionnaire, working with the EOC to promote equal pay reviews, providing trade unions with additional funding for training representatives in equal pay issues and by requiring the civil service to undertake pay reviews.

 Consumer protection legislation, which is enforced by local authority trading standards officers, makes it an offence to supply unsafe consumer products to the UK market. The legislation applies equally to products manufactured in the UK and imported products. Enforcement statistics do not distinguish action taken against imported products. Under European Council Regulation 339/93&#151;relating to goods imported from non-Community countries&#151;customs officers have powers to detain goods for up to three working days to permit checks by trading standards officers when there is reason to believe that goods may be unsafe.

 The Government issued its response to the Taskforce Report in February 2001 and an update to the response was issued in January 2002. A key objective for the Government in supporting the thrust of the Task Force's Report was to raise international awareness of this issue and thus to achieve international cooperation in getting to grips with the issues. I believe that this has been achieved. For example, in January 2003 the Global Science Forum of the Organisation for Economic

 The UK is working through the EU for a fairer international trading system for all WTO members, with a particular emphasis on developing countries. To maximise the benefits of trade to all African countries the Government are working for the elimination of trade barriers both between themselves and with the EU. This needs to be done in a carefully sequenced manner, together with appropriate complementary policies so that the benefits of freer trade are maximised. The Government are working in partnership with developing countries, the EU and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, to help developing countries capture new trading opportunities and thus trade their way out of poverty.
<P>

<a name="30605w09.html_para2">In addition, in terms of tackling trade barriers between Africa and the EU, there are several complementary agreements between the EU and Africa. With South Africa there is the EU-South Africa Trade, Development and Co-operation Agreement, which provisionally came into force in 2000 and which aims to create a free trade area between the EU and South Africa over 12 years. In the North there is the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which aims to establish a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area with 12 Mediterranean Partner Countries, four of which are in North Africa, by 2010.

As a result of the negotiations the UK would like to see an outcome which gave all ACP countries duty and quota-free access to the EU.

 The Licensing Bill provides in clause 1 that the provision of regulated entertainment is a licensable activity. Schedule 1 to the Bill defines the provision of regulated entertainment and provides that the descriptions of entertainment include a performance of live music. Accordingly, subject to the conditions and exemptions in the Bill, live musical performances in pubs would require the authorisation of a premises licence, a club premises certificate or a temporary event notice. Under clause 134 of the Bill an offence is committed if a person carries on, attempts to carry on, or knowingly allows to take place, unauthorised licensable activities. However, entertainers such as musicians performing in pubs, who perform at unlicensed venues and do nothing else in relation to the provision of regulated entertainment would not be committing this offence.

<a name="30605w11.html_para0">Several factors have contributed to the reduction in the numbers of people starting Work-Based Learning for Adults (WBLA) since 1997. These include: the fall in unemployment since 1997; the restriction of WBLA provision to people aged 25 and over (excluding exempt groups) following the introduction of New Deal for Young People; and the introduction of New Deal 25 plus in April 2001. This resulted in JSA recipients unemployed for over 18 months becoming ineligible for Work Based Learning for Adults.

On this measure the number of children in low income fell by around half a million between 1996&#150;97 and 2001/02. The baseline for the PSA target is 1998&#150;99.

 When the Pension Credit is introduced in October this year, the rules excluding pensioners with &#163;12,000 or more in savings from any help will be abolished. Savings of &#163;6,000 or less (&#163;10,000 or less for those in care homes) will be disregarded in full.

In addition any assumed income will count towards the savings credit. Overall this means that savings will be treated five times more generously than under minimum income guarantee.

 The Pension Service has begun to write to pensioner households to explain pension credit and to invite applications. Around &#163;1.8 million people who currently receive the minimum income guarantee have been told that they will be transferred automatically to pension credit, ready for payments to be made from October 2003.

 Under the terms of the department's discretionary financial redress scheme compensation may be considered where payments are unreasonably and exceptionally delayed due to official error. An objective indicator, specific to each benefit or pension, is employed to assess whether excessive delay has occurred.

In the unlikely event of such a person being suspected of a crime over which the ICC otherwise has jurisdiction, and the domestic authorities of the state of the individual's citizenship being unwilling or unable to investigate where appropriate, then the Security Council may allow the ICC to proceed to take action, as provided for in OP1 of the Resolution.

 There are currently no powers to test arrestees for class A or B drugs. Drug testing of persons in police detention (after charge) is planned to start in Kingston-upon-Hull in the Humberside police force area in the summer of 2003 as part of the initiative to introduce drug testing across the 30 Basic Command Unit (BCD) areas with the highest levels of acquisitive crime. Data analysis will be available thereafter. The police will test under powers introduced by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, for the presence of specified Class A drugs only i.e. heroin and crack/cocaine, those most closely associated with acquisitive crime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30605w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government have set a national target of 60 per cent. of new development to be on previously developed land. Regional Planning Guidance for the South East also expects at least 60 per cent. of new development to be on previously developed land.
<P>

<a name="30605w16.html_para1">The proportion of development to be built on previously developed land will vary at more local levels as planning guidance asks each local authority to produce a local land recycling target, in light of their own circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30605w16.html_para2">Current Regional Planning Guidance states that there is no regional case for reviewing Green Belt boundaries. The recently produced Sustainable Communities Plan also contains a commitment to maintain or increase the current area of land designated as Green Belt in local plans.

 Government policy states that new housing developments should be built at a density of at least 30 dwellings per hectare. Higher densities are also expected, particularly in areas with good transport links and in town centres. Planning policy also stresses the role of good design in achieving higher density.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30605w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In order to deliver the step change in progress in tackling shortages of housing and problems of abandonment and low demand, stronger links between related regional strategies and investment plans are needed, particularly on planning and economic development. One of the key roles of the Regional Housing Boards, that have been established to advise Ministers on the allocation of housing capital resources, and the bodies responsible for overseeing activity in the four identified growth areas, will be to ensure that related strategies and plans are properly integrated. Where housing development is planned the potential will depend on the provision of infrastructure and a sustainable approach to growth, tested through regional plans and implemented through local development plans and local partnership. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working with other Government Departments and local partners on the infrastructure required.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30605w16.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Davey: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what building regulations concerning sprinkler systems are <i>(a)</i> in place and <i>(b)</i> planned for (i) houses of multiple occupation, (ii) care homes, (iii) hospitals, (iv) council offices, (v) listed buildings and (vi) domestic properties.  [116850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30605w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Building Regulations 2000 (as amended) make no specific requirements regarding the provision of sprinklers. Guidance on measures that will meet the fire safety requirements of the Building Regulations is given in Approved Document B (Fire safety). Approved Document B is intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations. This guidance is not mandatory and there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements.
<P>

<a name="30605w16.html_para5">The current Approved Document does not suggest that sprinklers should be provided in houses of multiple occupation, care homes, listed buildings or domestic properties. For guidance on the design of hospitals, the Approved Document refers to the NHS "Firecode" series of documents, which suggest that sprinklers should be installed in certain parts of a hospital and in specific circumstances. In respect of the construction of new office buildings generally, the Approved Document suggests the provision of sprinklers for those buildings of a height greater than 30 metres. The Building Regulations only apply to most building work undertaken in England and Wales. Therefore they would not be applicable to existing listed buildings unless building work was being undertaken.
<P>

<a name="30605w16.html_para6">A major review of Approved Document B is due to commence next year. As part of this review it is our intention to consider the potential of extending the provisions for sprinkler protection to new residential premises including houses, flats and maisonettes, houses in multiple occupation, old person's rest homes, children's homes and homes for disabled people. The issue of fire safety generally in hospitals and offices will also be considered as part of the review.

 The report of the accidental injury task force identified a need to strengthen the surveillance of accidental injury at regional and local levels. The Home Accident Surveillance System data was not sufficiently complete to serve as the main tool for local National Health Service surveillance because it was based on a sample of 18 hospitals across the United Kingdom, and did not include injuries on the roads. We are taking forward local surveillance in discussions on the future roles of directors of public health and public health observatories.

 <i>[holding answer 3 June 2003]:</i> The Department allocated &#163;5 million in 2002&#150;03 nationally for the provision of additional and updated personal protective equipment for health service personnel. That equipment has been delivered to hospital accident and emergency departments and to ambulance services, and relevant training programmes have been implemented. Some &#163;130,000 was allocated to health service providers who serve Nottinghamshire. This bought equipment for the East Midlands Ambulance service (EMAS) (which also serves Derbyshire and Leicestershire), Queens Medical Centre (QMC), Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust. The health community is actively undertaking training for staff. EMAS has, for example, trained 30 staff across its area of operation and has plans to train a further 30, and 60 staff at the QMC have been trained in the use of the personal protection equipment.
