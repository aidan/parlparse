 Records for cases referred by the Law Officers as unduly lenient sentences to the Court of Appeal have only been maintained by category of offence since 2000. Four cases of death by dangerous driving were referred in 2000 and so far this year six cases have been referred to the Court of Appeal.

<a name="11210w01.html_para0">For financial years 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000, summary information on commitment levels can be found in the relevant Ministry of Defence Performance Report, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. Information for years predating the 1998 Strategic Defence Review is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. We remain determined to balance operational commitments and we will commit personnel to operations for no longer than is necessary to achieve the military aim. Recent operations in Macedonia demonstrated this well. To mitigate the demands placed upon those service personnel who are deployed on operations overseas, we have introduced a new and comprehensive package of welfare support.

<a name="11210w01.html_wqn4"><B> Angus Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what review he has made of the need for home defence since the events of 11 September.  [20889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary for Defence informed the House on 4 October that the Ministry of Defence would be conducting work designed to ensure that we have the right concepts, forces and capabilities to deal with the kind of asymmetric threat that we saw on 11 September.
<P>

<a name="11210w01.html_para1">This work is on-going and is addressing, among a wide range of issues, the balance between the contributions that the armed forces make to home defence and countering threats abroad. A key part of this work is exploring the role that the armed forces, including the reserves, have in defending and protecting the homeland.
<P>

<a name="11210w01.html_para2">The lead for domestic security lies with the civil authorities, and with the police in particular. The armed forces already provide assistance to the civil authorities in a range of ways. In terms of classical territorial defence roles, the RAF is responsible for the defence of our airspace and the Royal Navy has a role in ensuring the integrity of our territorial waters.




<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2001 : Column: 533W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11210w01.html_para3">We are looking at whether we need to enhance the assistance we provide or build on our territorial defence roles. We are also reviewing the arrangements and level of co-ordination between the civil authorities and the armed forces in order to maximise the utility, and suitability, of responses to any future requests for assistance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As at 1 November 2001, the Navy had a trained strength of 37,176, of which 33,352 personnel were fully deployable and 1,638 were deployable with some limitations. The Regular Army, excluding Gurkhas and the Royal Irish, amounted to 96,255 personnel of whom 86,296 were fully deployable and an additional 7,042 deployable with some limitations. The RAF had a trained strength of 49,116 of which 45,245 were deployable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proportion of the increase in the departmental expenditure limit from 2001&#150;02 to 2002&#150;03 will be accounted for by wage costs.  [20667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The level of wage costs in the Defence budget this year and in future years will be dependent upon the outcome of Pay Review Body reports and negotiations. The Department's performance report published in the autumn of next year will give full retrospective costs.

<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what policy the Defence Procurement Agency adopts on supporting British manufacturing when purchasing vehicles.  [20881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Competition is the cornerstone of the Ministry of Defence's procurement policy and this applies equally to the purchase of vehicles. Contracts are awarded on best overall value for money. Article 12 of the EC treaty requires that member states do not discriminate in favour of national suppliers. However, where there are exemptions under the regulations we make use of them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence police require a range of vehicle types to meet operational needs. When assessing which vehicle represents best value for money against a particular requirement, the bulk purchase discounts offered by manufacturers are taken into account.

<P>
<a name="11210w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 A claim for war disablement pension may only be made after discharge from the armed forces. During the year April 2000 to March 2001 6,384 awards of war pension were made to former members of the armed forces. For the period April 2001 to September 2001 3,221 awards were made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 A Call-out Order was signed on 11 October under section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) to permit reservists to be called out for permanent service on operations arising from the terrorist attacks in the United States of America. Since then 51 reservists from all three services have been called out 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2001 : Column: 535W</I><P>
on various dates, of whom 46 have come into service. Of that 46, three have completed their tasking and been transferred to another operation. In addition, five Sponsored Reserves from the Royal Air Force's Mobile Meteorological Unit have been called out under separate powers contained in section 43 (1) of RFA 96. We expect to call out more reservists as the operation progresses.

<P>
<a name="11210w02.html_wqn3"><B> Patrick Mercer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on recruitment and retention in the <i>(a)</i> (i) Coldstream Guards and (ii) Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters' Regiment and <i>(b)</i> (1) Royal Scots and (2) Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment.  [20927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Recruitment to Infantry regiments is at about the same level this year as last. To the end of October 2001, the Army has recruited to just about 50 per cent. of target for all Infantry Divisions. Although retention data are not centrally collected at regimental level, indications are that recruitment to the specific regiments mentioned is satisfactory and on a par with last year.
<P>

<a name="11210w02.html_para0">Retention in the Army overall is currently holding steady. We expect (and need) an acceptable level of outflow in order to achieve the required manning profile. The premature voluntary exit of other ranks has fallen to 6.1 per cent. over the last 12 months. The rate for officer outflow has remained steady at 4.4 per cent. This maintains the historically very good performance and is well below the peak experienced at the beginning of the 1990s.

 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> We are not aware that DU has been used in the current conflict by the Coalition, nor are we aware of any plans for it to be used. We have no information about the use of DU in previous conflicts in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="11210w02.html_para1">In the event that it is used in future, suitable guidance will be available to UK deployed forces. It will be for other nations to take similar actions with their own forces as they see necessary. The Coalition will also liaise with the Afghan authorities and human relief agencies in the event that there is a need to issue guidance to the Afghan population.

 The security arrangements for the transportation of Ministry of Defence nuclear materials, which take particular account of the threat of an attack by armed terrorists, have been kept under constant review since their inception. These security arrangements include a review of the threat prior to the movement of these materials and a mechanism to provide for a speedy decision to suspend the operation if it is deemed necessary to do so. Suspension has not been considered necessary since 11 September, although due account has been taken of the changed threat environment.

<a name="11210w02.html_para5">In their final report following withdrawal from Iraq in December 1998, UNSCOM noted that Iraq still retained a significant WMD capability. There have been no independent inspections since then. We assess that Iraq still has that capability. There is considerable circumstantial evidence that Iraq is engaged in a programme of rebuilding manufacturing facilities disabled by UNSCOM and those destroyed during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998.

A recent World Food Programme assessment concluded that due to the combined effects of the highest incidence rate of HIV/AIDS in the world (35 per cent. of the population are infected), the deteriorating economic situation and reduction in food production, approximately 35 per cent. of the population, or about 700,000 people, now have inadequate income to procure sufficient food to meet

<a name="11210w05.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) is an Africa-wide initiative that does not focus on specific countries. NEPAD has set up teams to work on five areas, which are capacity building on peace and security, economic and corporate governance, infrastructure, central bank and financial standards, and agriculture and market access. Togo is not a member of the NEPAD Steering Committee or Implementation Committee. If Togo implements the principles set out by NEPAD, it should also benefit from the faster progress in development and poverty reduction that will ensue.

 The New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), is an Africa-wide initiative, that does not focus on specific countries. Nigeria is one of the five members of the NEPAD Steering Committee, and therefore takes a leading role in NEPAD activities. NEPAD has set up teams to work on five areas, which are capacity building on peace and security, economic and corporate governance, infrastructure, central bank and financial standards, and agriculture and market access. Work on these areas should bring benefits to Nigeria, as it will to other countries in Africa.

<a name="11210w05.html_para0">UK assistance for reproductive health programmes anywhere in the world is provided in line with the principles of free and informed choice set out at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994.

 At 6 December 2001, the Yorkshire Cultural Consortium had spent &#163;39,000 from the budget allocated to it by my Department. It has also been helped by a grant of &#163;30,000 from Yorkshire Forward. Much of the money spent so far has gone towards the research and publication of the Consortium's strategy 'Deep Roots, Real Achievements, Lofty Ambitions' which was published on 13 November.

<a name="11210w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> In order to secure the long term viability of the City of Manchester Stadium, a tenant was required to assume the operational risk and maintenance obligations, so that these would not fall on the public sector. Manchester City Football Club was identified as the only realistic long term tenant able to undertake that role. Manchester City Council and Sport England negotiated terms with Manchester City Football Club for the Club to operate the stadium after the Games. Those arrangements have been evaluated independently, on behalf of Sport England, who are satisfied that they comply with lottery funding rules.

 The Secretary of State has not directly received any representations for specific changes in the role, organisation or structure of HM Railway Inspectorate (HMRI). These would be matters for the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to consider in the context of the wider deployment of HSE resources.

 The role and remit of the Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) within the Health and Safety Executive has not changed.

 Information on investment in railways is contained in the latest (September 2001) edition of the Strategic Rail Authority bulletin "National Rail Trends". All investment in the four years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 was undertaken by the private sector.

<P>
<UL>(2) what is the Government's most recent estimate of the network's infrastructure investment needs in Control Period 2 of 2001 to 2006;  [18958]

(3) how much money had been allocated to Railtrack for renewals, maintenance and operating expenses for Control Period 2 of 2001 to 2006 prior to administration.  [18946]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department's 2001&#150;02 budget for payments to Railtrack by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is &#163;497 million, comprising &#163;335 million for network grant payable under the 2 April agreement between the Government and Railtrack and &#163;162 million for network grant in respect of the (October 2000) final conclusions of the Rail Regulator's periodic review of access charges. Projected outturn is &#163;498.6 million, the &#163;1.6 million variation from budget reflecting an allowance for inflation under the 2 April agreement.
<P>

<a name="11210w07.html_para0">While my Department has no 2001&#150;02 budget for direct investment in rail infrastructure, its budget for SRA payments of network grant to Railtrack and of Support for Passenger Services (SPRS) to train operating companies (TOCs) takes account of the Regulator's review. That review set the level of passenger access charges to be paid to Railtrack by TOCs, most of which receive SPRS. Much of Railtrack's infrastructure investment is remunerated through access charges, which provided some 85 per cent. of Railtrack's income last year.
<P>

<a name="11210w07.html_para1">It is difficult in practice to distinguish between investment in renewals and maintenance and investment in enhancement. The Regulator's review set passenger access charges at a level designed to enable Railtrack to increase both types of investment expenditure. The Ten Year Plan for Transport, published in July 2000, provided for extra expenditure on both types of investment. The SRA's Strategic Plan, to be published shortly, will set out the SRA's plans for delivering the Ten Year Plan targets within the levels of funding provided for in the Ten Year Plan.

 Between 1996 and 5 October 2001, no payments were made to Railtrack by the Treasury or the Rail Regulator. For payments made by my Department, and for payments of network grant made by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), I refer to my reply to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) on 26 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 424&#150;25W.

 In the course of discussions over the summer, Railtrack's advisers first identified three options for the company&#151;restructuring, renationalisation and, as they described it, receivership. It was agreed that Railtrack would develop proposals for the additional finance the company required and possible restructuring. Under these proposals, Railtrack requested additional uncapped subsidy from the Government, and a suspension of the regulatory regime administered by the Rail Regulator.

 Between 5 October 2001 and 5 April 2006, no payments are scheduled to be made to Railtrack by the Treasury or the Rail Regulator. Apart from repayable cash advances made since 7 October 2001 to Railtrack in administration under the Loan Agreement, no payments are scheduled to be made by my Department. For payments of network grant to be made by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) in respect of the (October 2000) final conclusions of the Rail Regulator's periodic review of access charges, I refer to Appendix D of those conclusions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Improving the quality of our rail system and increasing its use, by both passengers and freight, is an integral part of our 10 Year Plan for Transport. The Plan aims to deliver improvements across all modes of transport, at national, regional and local levels.
<P>

<a name="11210w08.html_para0">Achieving our target of increasing rail passenger patronage by 50 per cent. by 2010, and rail freight by up to 80 per cent., would help to relieve the growing pressure on our roads, and contribute to the reductions in congestion and pollution that the Plan envisages.
<P>

<a name="11210w08.html_para1">At the regional level, the Government's guidance on Regional Transport Strategies emphasises the importance of integration in supporting more sustainable travel choices. The programme of multi-modal studies currently under way, covering most of our main transport corridors and bottlenecks, is also taking an integrated approach and examining a full range of possible solutions in each case. The programme for replacement and extension of existing rail franchises invites bidders to offer proposals for local and regional integration, and the draft Directions and Guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority reinforce this aim. The Rail Passenger Partnership scheme also exists to provide financial support for local and regional initiatives to improve integration of rail with other modes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Diversionary routes are clearly important in providing alternatives where disruption occurs. Franchise agreements require train operating companies to use all reasonable endeavours to provide alternative transport where services cannot run as advertised, for which diversionary routes are one possible solution.

 Back lanes, unnamed or otherwise, should have always been excluded from the data used in SSAs. The same is true of other public ways such as Byways Open to All Traffic, bridleways, footpaths, green lanes and unsurfaced roads. This is on the basis that this group of rights of way take very little or no traffic relative to major and minor roads.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for London Underground. In many areas London Underground infrastructure is old and of varied condition. Frequently, assets are in need of replacement or renewal. London Underground inform me that they carry out a regular and ongoing programme of inspections and surveys of tunnels, signals, and track. All tunnels are thoroughly inspected several times each week to identify any track defects.
<P>

<a name="11210w08.html_para3">Should any assets be found to be in a condition which has a possible safety implication, then remedial action is taken immediately or if that is not possible, mitigating measures are taken to ensure safe operation, for example, the imposition of a speed restriction. Where necessary, more extensive and/or frequent surveys are undertaken to ensure that no further deterioration takes place before a long-term solution can be implemented. Under London Underground's tube modernisation plans, bidders will have the resources to implement these long-term solutions more quickly than London Underground itself can at present.

 I understand that prior to barriers being installed, a full risk assessment must be submitted to the HSE and the station operator who is installing the gates must carry out an operational safety assessment. Operation of the gates is assessed as part of the operational safety cases during field inspection. The gates must operate in such a way that they will be powered down, ie set to open, if unattended. There are now many

The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the total public investment in the M58 motorway since 1985.
<BR>
I am afraid that our records are not kept in a form which allows us to provide this information.
<BR>
The total spend includes monies for routine and winter maintenance which we pay to our agents in bulk: the sums are not disaggregated to individual roads. I can say however that between 1992 and 1995 we spend &#163;10.5M on major maintenance schemes on this section of motorway.
<BR>
This investment was funded by the Agency and its predecessor through the national roads vote. We can find no record of an EU grant having been received towards the cost of these works.
<BR>
I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful but if you would like any further information about this matter, the Agency's Route Manager for the M58, Roy Wood, would be pleased to help you. His telephone number is 0161 930 5686.

 Rent restructuring will have no impact on more than 60 per cent. of council and registered social landlord tenants who received housing benefit as their housing benefit will be adjusted to reflect the changes in their rents.

The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the expected reduction in vehicle movements through Aston Clinton that will result from the construction of the bypass.
<BR>
The bypass will remove approximately 70% of the current through traffic on the A41 through the village. The north-south movement on the local route between Leighton Buzzard and Wendover would continue to use part of the existing A41 in the village.
<BR>
The contract for the construction of the bypass was let in March 2001 although the start of works on site was delayed until August 2001 due to Foot and Mouth precautions. Construction is due to be completed in the Summer of 2003.
<BR>
If you would like further details of this scheme the Project Manager in our Dorking office, Andy Finch would be pleased to help you. He can be contacted on 01306&#150;878342.

 I would refer my hon. Friend to the answer given to his question on 6 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 137W. The recent agreement in the EU for a common standard for the construction of buses will lead to a change in the way the numbers of permitted standing passengers is calculated. I do not intend to introduce changes in advance of the introduction of this directive in the UK as it will cause unnecessary disruption to bus manufacturers and operators.

 All stakeholders including local and regional economic agencies are able to comment at the various statutory stages in the development of a road scheme. These include preferred route, order publication and, if necessary, public inquiry. All parties are also free to comment at the consultation stages of the series of multi-modal and road based studies being undertaken to consider transport problems associated with the trunk road network. Regional development agencies will normally be represented on study steering groups or in the wider reference groups from whom comments are specifically sought. They may also comment at the public consultation stages of regional planning guidance when the regional transport strategies are being considered.

 The new Highways Agency procurement strategy, which I announced on 22 November 2001, will speed up delivery of improvement schemes on motorways and other strategic roads in England. This will be achieved through streamlining the pre-construction phase and better procurement techniques and help to deliver the targets from the 10 Year Plan for Transport. This should significantly cut the 12 years it typically takes at present to deliver these schemes.
<P>

<a name="11210w09.html_para1">The package of measures, announced by the Secretary of State in this House on 20 July 2001, to speed up decisions on major infrastructure projects of major national significance, are expected to apply, in respect of highway projects, to the construction of a new route in excess of 30 kilometres in continuous length. This criterion and the process to be followed to designate schemes are subject to consultation before coming into force.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The Shadow SRA announced in June 2000 its intention to develop new franchises for Wales and Borders and Wessex. The SRA announced on 15 February 2001 that it had shortlisted four parties for negotiations to select a preferred operator for a new Wales and Borders franchise. On 2 March 2001 it announced that it had prequalified seven parties to prepare proposals for a new Wessex franchise.<P>

2. The SRA will announce in due course how it will respond to the Secretary of State's recent draft statement on passenger rail franchising. Although the statement emphasises the importance of delivering short term benefits&#151;essentially through existing franchises&#151;as well as longer term improvements for passengers, this does not mean that there will be no early franchise replacements; it does not rule out the proposed Wessex and Wales and Borders franchises. The SRA will, however, consider all the options for delivering benefits to passengers, and take a realistic view about affordability and what represents value for money.<P>

3. The 'Wales and Borders' managerial unit will consist of Valley Lines' services and Wales and West services within Wales and to some English destinations. Discussions are continuing with National Express Group on an early transfer of services within Mid-Wales (from Central Trains) to the new Wales and Borders management unit. Services in North Wales will currently continue to be operated by First North Western.<P>

4. The 'Wessex Trains' managerial unit will consist of Wales and West services not transferring to Wales and Borders. London Waterloo-Exeter services and Reading-Brighton services will currently continue to be operated by South West Trains.<P>

HSE is currently undertaking a detailed evaluation of the report's findings. The initial evaluation indicates that the report makes a very useful contribution to improving the understanding of the factors that influence the occurrence of 'Head Checking'.

The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent question about the budget and final cost of the traffic light installation on the A40 Trunk Road at Lea, Ross-on-Wye.
<BR>
The traffic signals at Lea are part of a package of traffic calming measures for the village that were completed earlier this year. The original budget for the signals was &#163;133,000 but the final costs have yet to be finalised and should be available next month. Auditing of the Highways Agency's accounts is undertaken by the National Audit Office, as with all government departments.
<BR>
In view of your interest, I have asked the Agency's Project Sponsor, Tom Barry, to write to you with details as soon as the final costs of the signal installation are known. He can be contacted on 0121 678 8072.

<P>
<a name="11210w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government's general policy on local authority land disposals is that authorities should seek to obtain the open market value when making disposals. However, local authorities' land disposal powers under the Local Government Act 1972 are discretionary and they may exercise them in any manner they wish.
<P>

<a name="11210w13.html_para0">The consent of the Secretary of State is required before an authority may dispose of land for less than the best consideration that can reasonably be obtained. Consent is not required to any disposal for a lease of seven years or less.
<P>

<a name="11210w13.html_para1">For certain classes of disposal any necessary disposal consent has been given by the Local Government Act 1972 General Disposal Consents 1998 and in these circumstances it is not necessary for a local authority to apply for a specific disposal consent. For example, the General Consents include the disposal in certain circumstances of the freehold or leasehold interests in property to be used for charitable, recreational and certain retail and commercial uses.

 My Department has made no assessment of Britain's national need for fluorspar.

It also indicated that about 5,000 tonnes were exported. This suggests that some 78,000 tonnes were used nationally in that year.

<a name="11210w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Local public service agreements help our drive to improve services in partnership with local authorities. Twenty local authorities negotiated agreements with the Government earlier this year, in the pilot stage of this scheme. Each authority proposes demanding targets for key local services over the next three years, covering a mix of central government priorities and priorities of the authority's area. The Government offer possible relaxations in statutory and administrative requirements, some initial financial help, and the prospect of a reward grant for achieving the demanding targets agreed. The scheme is on offer to a further 130 authorities, 119 of which have already sought an opportunity to participate. The first of these further agreements are now being concluded.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Affordable housing, when used in planning guidance, refers to low cost market and subsidised housing.
<P>

<a name="11210w13.html_para5">Social housing is normally used to refer to subsidised housing provided by local authorities or registered social landlords for rent.
<P>

<a name="11210w13.html_para6">There is no national definition of (c), (d) and (e). However, local authorities may use some of these terms in assessing local housing needs and defining what they regard as affordable housing within their area. Such definitions are usually based on the level of local incomes and their relationship to house prices or rents. In defining key workers authorities will need to decide upon those groups in need of affordable housing who contribute to essential service provision.

 On 22 August 2001 we significantly strengthened the planning arrangements for telecommunications development.

 Local authorities will have applied for the various types of financial support run by this Department. Records of these applications are not kept centrally.

The Government announced an additional &#163;300 million to cover 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 to assist councils in building care capacity. We have also recently announced our proposals for the funding of local government revenue expenditure in 2002&#150;03.

This is because, if the ACA is excluded, it is possible that the analyses on which the formulae are based would find that some of the deprivation and other indicators that appear in the formulae would change.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w14.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Building Research Establishment (BRE) and Tree Advice Trust have now completed their project to develop an objective method for assessing whether high hedges block too much daylight and sunlight to adjoining properties, and to provide guidance on hedge heights to alleviate these problems.
<P>

<a name="11210w14.html_para9">Copies of the final report of their work, together with guidelines for calculating hedge height, have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. These documents are also being published on my Department's website.
<P>

<a name="11210w14.html_para10">The guidelines explain how to calculate whether a hedge is likely to block out too much light from a garden and from the main rooms of a house. In relation to gardens, the procedure looks at what portion of the garden is shaded by the hedge and what direction it faces. For the rooms of a house, the main factor is the distance from its windows to the hedge. Some of the details of this formula have been refined in the light of the results of consultation and field-testing on a sample of problem hedges.
<P>

<a name="11210w14.html_para11">We want to encourage people to apply the BRE guidelines to their problem hedge and to use the results to try to settle matters with their neighbours amicably. We will, therefore, be preparing a leaflet specifically designed for this purpose. It will include a simplified version of the BRE guidelines as well as advice on how people might approach their neighbours with this information to try and agree a solution. We will be involving local authority, professional, consumer and advice groups in its development and expect to launch the leaflet in spring next year.
<P>

<a name="11210w14.html_para12">We recognise, of course, that in some cases guidance and voluntary action is no substitute for a legal remedy. We remain committed, therefore, to bringing forward legislation to set up a statutory complaints system for dealing with high hedge problems as soon as there is space in the Parliamentary timetable.

 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> The earnings disregard is &#163;5 for single pensioners and &#163;10 for couples. In certain circumstances, concerning the receipt of particular premiums or engagement in a special occupation, the disregard may be &#163;20 a week. These disregards have not changed since the introduction of the minimum income guarantee.

 The range of new deals help disadvantaged groups to move from welfare into work.

We have also introduced Action Teams for Jobs and Employment Zones that, between them, have helped over 32,000 people in the most deprived areas into work.
<P>

<a name="11210w17.html_para14">In addition, on 28 November we announced StepUP, a new pilot programme to help people who have not been able to find a job through new deal.

 We are always concerned to ensure that those eligible for the receipt of benefits can achieve their legal entitlements and we are particularly concerned to ensure that the poorest among our pensioners have their entitlement increased to reach the Minimum Income Guarantee.
<P>

<a name="11210w18.html_para2">That is why we launched a national take up campaign in May 2000 writing to 2 million pensioners informing them about MIG. We are following this up and from 15 October 2001 callers to the Retirement Pension telecentre who are not already receiving MIG are asked a series of questions to identify if they may be entitled and encouraged to claim if they wish to do so. Those pensioners who claim Retirement Pension by post are sent a MIG leaflet.
<P>

<a name="11210w18.html_para3">We are looking at a number of options to extend this service so that a claim to MIG will be invited automatically following certain key life events, for example when the pensioner reaches age 75 or 80 or when another benefit such as Attendance Allowance is awarded.
<P>

<a name="11210w18.html_para4">We are also working in partnership with organisations for older people to improve access to benefits and take up of the MIG. This includes projects on a national good practice guide and a survey of local take up initiatives.

<P>

<a name="11210w18.html_para5">We are developing 3rd Age Apprenticeships to increase take up of the New Deal 50 plus training provision, and employer involvement in the programme.

 Since June of this year we have met with key employer organisations and many individual employers. Their input is central to the development of our employment policies and to ensuring that our employment programmes meet local labour market needs and employers' recruitment needs.
<P>

<a name="11210w18.html_para7">We have also created the National Employment Panel to ensure that employers, and other key customers, have a strong and permanent voice within the Department.

<P>
<a name="11210w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 All personal advisers receive training in interviewing, influencing and motivational skills; effective communication and interpersonal skills; awareness of the diversity of clients and their particular needs. They are also trained in practical skills such as how to conduct In Work benefit calculations, knowledge of the local labour market and ES programmes and services. In addition to this generic training detailed guidance is available on the new deal 50 plus process through the ESCOM computer system which is accessible to advisers in Jobcentres. An Open Learning handbook has also been produced for use by advisers to support the Age Diversity initiative. This contains a section addressing specific new deal 50 plus issues.

<P>
<a name="11210w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The new deal 50-plus blend of personal advice, jobsearch help and in-work financial support has proved very successful at helping people over 50 move off benefits and back into work.
<P>

<a name="11210w18.html_para9">The only measurement of participation in the programme is the number of those who move into work and claim the programme's in-work financial support, the Employment Credit. 92 people went into work with the help of the Employment Credit from Whitley Bay and North Shields Jobcentres, between October 2000 and September 2001. Others will have benefited from the advice and help available from personal advisers.

<P>
<a name="11210w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government recognise the valuable role that final salary schemes play in providing security in retirement. They also recognise, however, that employers provide occupational schemes on a voluntary basis and consequently it is for them to determine the most appropriate pension provision to suit their business needs. We welcome the broadening by occupational pension schemes of their eligibility criteria in response to the introduction of stakeholder pensions.
<P>

<a name="11210w19.html_para0">The stakeholder pension has helped increase the size of the overall pensions market. The value of new pension sales rose by 9 per cent. in the July to September quarter of this year to &#163;2.8 billion. Regular pension premium business rose by 50 per cent. to &#163;584 million compared with the same period last year.
<P>

<a name="11210w19.html_para1">There is also evidence of sustained growth in the amounts contributed to non-state pensions from &#163;50 billion in 1997 to &#163;69 billion in 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Our aim is employment opportunity for all throughout the country. We have put in place a framework that delivers:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a platform of economic stability and low inflation, to promote sustained growth in output and jobs;
<P>

investment in education and training so people have the skills they need to take up work;
<P>
<BR>
a labour market policy with a strong work focus so all jobless people have access to vacancies, advice and help with jobsearch;
<P>
<BR>
a range of new deal programmes which help disadvantaged groups, including the long-term unemployed, move from welfare into work;
<P>
<BR>
policies such as the national minimum wage and working families tax credit designed to make work pay; and
<P>
<BR>
locally focused initiatives designed to tackle the problems of particular areas.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11210w19.html_para2">Since 1997, these policies, alongside continued economic growth, have helped to reduce long-term unemployment by 55 per cent. in Romford.
<P>

<a name="11210w19.html_para3">The new deal for young people and new deal 25 plus are playing an important part in helping long-term unemployed people improve their job prospects and move into work in Romford. Up to the end of September, they had helped over 350 long-term unemployed people move into jobs in the constituency.

 Action teams for jobs are one of a range of initiatives we have introduced to help people move into work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We have already taken a number of steps to tackle pensioner poverty.
<P>

<a name="11210w20.html_para0">We introduced the minimum income guarantee (MIG) to provide more money for pensioners as quickly as possible. For example a single pensioner aged 60 to 74 now receives &#163;92.15 a week, an increase of &#163;18 a week since 1997 over and above inflation. From April 2002 single pensioners will see their MIG rise by &#163;6 to &#163;98.15 a week.
<P>

<a name="11210w20.html_para1">From 2003 pension credit will ensure people aged 60 and over need not live on less than &#163;100 a week (&#163;154 for couples) and for the first time, saving will be rewarded instead of being penalised. Pension credit will provide a savings credit for those aged 65 and over who have saved for their retirement and have incomes up to &#163;135 a week (&#163;200 for couples), ensuring pensioners with even modest second pensions and savings will get more as a result of their thrift. In addition, we will abolish the rule which excludes pensioners with &#163;12,000 or more in savings from any help and introduce a fairer system for taking into account income for savings.

<a name="11210w21.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Starting in April next year, the Government will pilot a new approach to assist long-term unemployed people who need more intensive help to get into work. Long-term recipients of jobseeker's allowance will be guaranteed a full-time job, lasting up to a year, and paid at the national minimum wage. In return, they will be required to take up that opportunity. It is our intention to ensure that there will be a choice of jobs on offer but no choice of simply remaining on benefit. Anyone who refuses to take up a job offer without good reason will have their benefit withdrawn in the same way as those jobseekers who fail to take up an offer of suitable employment.

 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> All Medical Services doctors are trained to assess deafness in connection with medical examinations for benefit claims.

 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> Over the past year Disability Employment Advisers (DEAs) have been affected by two major developments. The new deal for disabled people network of job brokers was launched in July this year and a full network was in place by September. The Access to Work (AtW) Process Review has led to the setting up of regional AtW business centres. The AtW role previously carried out in many regions by DEAs is now delivered through specialist AtW Advisers. These changes mean that DEAs are able to place a greater focus on helping disabled people claiming jobseeker's allowance and activities such as placing, assessment and advisory work with individuals and employers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The minimum funding requirement (MFR) was introduced from April 1997, and requires pension schemes to which it applies to correct underfunding within specified periods. During the transitional period, which ends on 5 April 2002, schemes which are underfunded on the MFR basis have until 5 April 2003 to bring funding up to 90 per cent. of the MFR level, and until 5 April 2007 to bring funding up to 100 per cent. of the MFR level.
<P>

<a name="11210w22.html_para7">We are currently consulting on a set of draft regulations which will introduce changes to the current MFR in advance of its replacement. One of the proposed changes will extend these periods to allow three years for schemes to reach the 90 per cent. level, and 10 years to reach the 100 per cent. level. The consultation ends on 10 December, and we plan to introduce new arrangements before April next year.

<a name="11210w22.html_para8">The pay gap is at its lowest ever, and has halved since the introduction of the Equal Pay Act 1970. The new Earnings Survey 2000 indicates that women currently earn 81 pence for every pound a man earns.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on new bereavement benefits; what efforts have been made to publicise this benefit to the public; and under what circumstances someone would be eligible for the benefit.  [20962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w23.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Bereavement Benefits were introduced on 9 April 2001 and are available to both men and women for the first time. They concentrate the help available where and when it is needed most, on immediate needs and on families with children. Entitlement is based on the National Insurance record of the deceased spouse.
<P>

<a name="11210w23.html_para0">Since March 2000 the Department has issued leaflets on the new bereavement benefits to doctors' surgeries, Post Offices and benefit advisers. Articles explaining the new benefits were placed in a variety of magazines prior to their introduction in April 2001. In addition, to ensure that as many men as possible were able to claim Widowed Parent's Allowance from the outset, the Department identified over 11,000 potential male beneficiaries from the Child Benefit computer system and sent them claim forms in March 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> It is estimated that our proposals for the Pension Credit will increase benefit expenditure by approximately &#163;1 billion in 2003&#150;04 when Pension Credit is introduced in October 2003. This expenditure is in addition to the expenditure of approximately &#163;2&#188; billion on the Minimum Income Guarantee which has been forecast for the same period.
<P>

<a name="11210w23.html_para1">Of the additional expenditure of &#163;1 billion: approximately &#163;220 million is attributable to the changes to Housing and Council Tax Benefits; approximately &#163;450 million is attributable to the savings credit; and, the remainder is attributable to the other proposed changes such as the way in which capital is treated.

1. The costs and potential gainers have been estimated from a Policy Simulation Model which models the benefit rules in 2001&#150;02.<P>

2. The estimates are based on data taken from the 1999&#150;2000 Family Resources Survey, uprated to 2001&#150;02 prices, benefit and earnings levels.<P>

3. Costs are rounded to the nearest &#163;5 million except for Council Tax Benefit where the cost would be less than &#163;2.5 million. Potential gainers are rounded to the nearest 5,000. Costs and gainers include estimates for people who would become newly entitled to the income-related benefits in the event of such a change.<P>

4. Potential gainers cannot be summed to a total because of overlap across the different benefits.<P>

<P>
<a name="11210w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> The British High Commission in Harare has received three representations on renunciation&#151;two from individuals, and one in the form of a petition signed by a number of individuals. It has also received thousands of inquiries&#151;by telephone, fax, letter and personal call&#151;about the procedure for renunciation.
<P>

<a name="11210w25.html_para0">The British High Commission in Harare has widely publicised the procedures for renunciation, through the Zimbabwean press, its website, through the Consular Section and in briefings. The FCO has set up a procedure with the Home Office to enable dual nationals for the UK and Zimbabwe to speedily divest themselves of British citizenship in order to comply with the 6 January 2002 deadline set by the Zimbabwean Government in the recent amendments to Zimbabwean nationality law. This means that certificates of renunciation can now be issued within 10 working days.

 The future of the anti-ballistic missile treaty is first and foremost a matter for the US and Russia as parties to the treaty. We welcome the US and Russian commitment to ongoing discussions on strategic issues, including both offensive and defensive systems. We are encouraged by this, and their declared mutual intention to make real reductions in nuclear forces, confirmed by President Bush and President Putin at their recent meeting in the US.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We are liaising closely with the judicial authorities in Colombia. The tragic death of Mr. Jeremy Parks is being investigated by the Technical Investigation Corps of the Fiscalia (The Prosecutor's Office), under the supervision of a magistrate. This is the normal procedure in cases of violent or unexpected death. The magistrate's report has not yet been finalised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Casualty figures can be unreliable. Deaths and injuries are sometimes included which are not necessarily the direct result of violence. Israeli Government figures show that approximately 65 Israelis were killed in the six months before 7 March, and 166 since that date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have taken and will take all the steps we properly can to ensure that Mr. Housel, a dual US/British national on death row in Georgia, USA, is not executed. The FCO is in close contact with Mr. Housel's legal team and the Georgia authorities are aware of our opposition to the death penalty.
<P>

<a name="11210w25.html_para1">Mr. Housel's final appeal is due to be heard by the US Supreme Court early next year. International law prevents us intervening in the judicial procedures of another sovereign state. However, if the court rejects Mr. Housel's appeal, we will immediately urge the Georgian authorities to commute his sentence to a term of imprisonment.

As was made clear in the memorandum submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 30 March 1999, in response to the Committee's Fourth Report, under Article 1 of the 1944 International Air Services Transit Agreement to which both Spain and the UK are party, 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2001 : Column: 632W</I><P>
aircraft of other contracting parties performing scheduled air services are granted the privilege of overflight. A right of overflight is accorded to aircraft performing non- scheduled (charter) services under Article 5 of the 1944 convention on International Civil Aviation to which both Spain and the UK are also party.

 We are committed to extending the EP franchise to Gibraltar in time for the 2004 European Parliament elections. The Government have now decided to seek legislative time in order to introduce domestic legislation for this purpose. The content of this legislation is a matter for the UK alone: it does not require the approval of other member states. There will be no additional EU legislation. Consultations are already underway between the Government and the Government of Gibraltar on the practical arrangements.

 The estimated staff costs for the Department for Education and Skills by region of the UK are as set out. The figures reflect the machinery of government changes that took place following the June 2001 general election, including the transfer to the Cabinet Office of responsibility for the Government Offices for the Regions. The Department does not have staff outside England.

enterprise councils' agreed flexibilities. The range of young people being helped and the mix of occupational training delivered however also influenced the overall unit price. In 1999&#150;2000, the average numbers on higher value and quality modern apprenticeships were 10 per cent. higher than in 1998&#150;99 and numbers on higher value and quality national traineeships (now foundation modern apprenticeships) increased threefold. The result of negotiations and the factors for 1999&#150;2000 was that training and enterprise councils delivered a more expensive menu of training than in the previous year and the overall unit price reflects this.

<sup>(24)</sup> Totals include both students funded under the mandatory scheme and those funded under the new student support scheme. New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998&#150;99. New students in 1998&#150;99 received support for maintenance through income-assessed grants (comprising about a quarter of the support available) and non income-assessed student loans (comprising about three quarters of the support available). (The ratio for existing students is roughly 50 per cent. income-assessed grant and 50 per cent. non income-assessed student loan). In 1999&#150;2000, students who entered higher education from 1998&#150;99 onwards received support for maintenance entirely through loans, of which three quarters of the value was non income-assessed. Loans made under these arrangements are repayable on an income contingent basis.<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> Student loans are available to eligible students normally domiciled in the United Kingdom. From 1999&#150;2000 student loans have been made available to those aged 50 to 54 who plan to return to work after studying. A time series of data for England and Wales domiciled students is not available.<P>

<P>

<sup>(26)</sup> Average loan, fees, maintenance grant and additional allowance/grant/loan rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<P>

<P>

<sup>(27)</sup> Most new students in 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 were expected to contribute up to &#163;1,000 and &#163;1,025 respectively to their fees depending on family income.<P>

<P>

<sup>(28)</sup> Maintenance shown in 1999&#150;2000 relates to mandatory awards scheme students only.<P>

<P>

<sup>(29)</sup> Up to academic year 1999&#150;2000 data on additional allowances/grants/loans are included in the maintenance grants information, totalling will therefore include some double counting. 1999&#150;2000 data relating to mandatory awards scheme students will also be included in maintenance grants, however those relating to students funded under the support scheme will not, as these students received support for maintenance entirely through loans.<P>

<P>

<sup>(30)</sup> Students may receive more than one additional allowance/grant/loan. The average figures shown will include an element of double counting of student numbers. The profiles of additional allowances/grants/loans have not remained constant over the time period and this accounts for some of the variation in the average values shown.<P>

<P>

<sup>(31)</sup> For student support scheme students, grants for living costs are no longer available except for some limited allowances, eg for students with dependants; single parent students; and disabled students. Grants for students with dependants and single parents students will be income-assessed but the disabled students allowance will not.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what method of auditing applies to the administration of student loans.  [19810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w27.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Student loans are paid and administered by the Student Loans Company (SLC). The SLC is a Non-Departmental Public Body. It is also a private limited company, and so subject to external audit. The SLC's external auditors are KPMG. The SLC publishes audited accounts each year in its Annual Report. In addition, as an NDPB, the SLC is required to have an internal audit function which meets the Government Internal Audit Standard (GIAS). The SLC has an audit committee which is chaired by one of its non-executive directors.
<P>

<a name="11210w27.html_para0">Copies of the SLC's Annual Report and Accounts are placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament and are sent to Companies House.

In the year prior to March 1999, there was a decrease in the number of heads retiring, and an increase in the number remaining in the sector but stepping down to a lower grade. <P>

<a name="11210w27.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the cost of implementing Statutory Instrument 2718 and the guidance notice relating to portable buildings.  [19898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w27.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> Statutory Instrument 2718 is The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2001. This order amends the planning guidelines relating to telecommunications masts, and has no relevance to portable buildings. There has thus been no assessment of the cost of implementing this Statutory Instrument.
<P>

<a name="11210w27.html_para2">However, the hon. Member did raise the issue of portable buildings in the debate in the Second Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation on Wednesday 21 November 2001 which considered the Prayer against both Statutory Instrument 2718 and Statutory Instrument 3335, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001. The Approved Document to Part L2 of the Building Regulations, which Statutory Instrument 3335 amended, gives guidance on how portable buildings may meet the requirements of Part L2 of the Regulations under the heading "Buildings constructed from sub-assemblies".




<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2001 : Column: 640W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11210w27.html_para3">There is nothing in the guidance in the Approved Document that indicates that portable buildings will have to be disposed of after five years. It indicates that there are no restrictions at all on portable buildings that are moved from one place to another on the same site. With regard to buildings moved from one site to another the guidance is that a building constructed from external fabric sub-assemblies obtained from other premises or from a stock manufactured before 31 December 2001, would normally be considered to meet the requirement if the fabric thermal resistance or the prospective annual energy use will be no worse than the relevant performance standards given in the 1995 edition of Approved Document L.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Turnover of staff in the further education (FE) sector in the south-east of England averages 11 per cent. for lecturers and 17 per cent. for support staff. Recruitment and retention difficulties arise from competition from other institutions and the wider economy.

<P>

<a name="11210w27.html_para4">We recognise that staff in the further education sector need to be able to find affordable homes within a reasonable distance from their work place. The average house price in the south-east of England is &#163;161,748 compared with &#163;124,379 for England as a whole. By 2003&#150;04 capital investment in housing will have risen to more than &#163;4 billion compared with planned spending of &#163;1.5 billion in 1997&#150;98. The Government plan to provide 100,000 new or improved homes for low cost renting or ownership over the next three years and to review the planning guidance to local authorities in order to help them to negotiate more affordable housing. Eligibility for loans or cash grants will be dependent on local arrangements.




<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2001 : Column: 641W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11210w27.html_para5">We have also introduced a number of initiatives aimed at tackling recruitment and retention difficulties in the FE sector: the Teaching Pay Initiative, more than &#163;300 million over the next three years, to reward high calibre teaching staff and create a proper career structure for teaching in the FE sector; and additionally, pilot initiatives such as Golden Hellos, student loan write-offs and training bursaries will all attract new staff to the profession.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> In relation to nuclear material which is being transported, an offence would be committed under clause 80 of the Bill, only if an intentional or reckless disclosure of information is made that could prejudice the security of nuclear material being transported to or from a nuclear site in the UK used for a purpose mentioned in section 1(1) of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 or being carried on board a UK ship. Whether an offence has been committed will depend on the facts of the case. The courts would have to assess whether the disclosure was capable of prejudicing security and whether the requirements of intention or recklessness have been met.

<a name="11210w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> The &#163;2 million sub-post office start-up capital subsidy fund is intended to support initiatives by volunteer or community groups to maintain or reopen post office facilities in areas where the traditional post office is closing or has recently closed. The scheme provides a framework for payments of top-up grants towards the initial capital cost of setting up a sub-post office as many proposals to save rural sub-post offices fail because of lack of a small amount of start-up capital. Eligible costs are widely drawn to cover all categories of one-off costs necessary to secure the future of the sub-post office. The scheme is flexible, recognising that every case for funding will be different and will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="11210w30.html_para4">This scheme is one part of a package of measures designed to secure the future of the post office network.

 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation; Lord Sainsbury, has been in contact with Glyn Ford MEP to explain the overall UK position on the EU Chemicals Strategy. The UK position which he set out was entirely consistent with the overall Government policy on this issue, on which my right hon. Friend the Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs leads. The UK Government support the aims and objectives of the EU Chemicals Strategy. We wish to see a workable strategy which protects the environment and human health by targeting chemicals of most concern through the authorisation process while at the same time minimising animal testing, encouraging innovation and maintaining the competitiveness of the chemicals industry. We support the inclusion in the authorisation process of chemicals which are at the same time persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBTs) and which are very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB), once the necessary criteria for identification of PBTs and vPvBs are established; and also the inclusion of known endocrine disruptors when agreed scientifically valid test methods and criteria are established to identify these substances. Background briefing was also provided to Glyn Ford MEP in early September on a range of DTI issues, including on the EU Chemicals Strategy. This again was entirely consistent with the Government policy as set out above.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to her answer of 20 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 163W, on BNFL, by how much the final cost of constructing the Sellafield MOX plant differs from the carrying value in the latest BNFL published account.  [19329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Information relating to the construction costs of the Sellafield MOX Plant (SMP) was included in the report produced by the independent consultants A. D. Little assessing BNFL's business case for operation of the plant. This was published in July 2001 with certain commercially sensitive information excised.
<P>

<a name="11210w32.html_para2">As can be seen from figure 21 of the report, A. D. Little noted that PA Consulting's earlier 1997 report on the economic case for SMP considered that the construction costs were at least &#163;300 million. A. D. Little assessed that at the time of their own 2001 report, commissioning having continued since the PA Consulting report, sunk costs in respect of SMP were around &#163;470 million. BNFL's annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 March 2001 give a carrying value for SMP of &#163;473 million.
<P>

<a name="11210w32.html_para3">Please note that my answer of 20 November contained an error. It gave the carrying value of SMP in BNFL's latest annual accounts as &#163;462 million. This value was in fact taken by mistake from BNFL's accounts for the previous financial year ending 31 March 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The merger of BNFL and Magnox has brought integrated management of the Magnox fuel cycle as well as a sensible relationship between the component parts of the business. There is also now a clear strategy on Magnox power station lifetimes. Detailed information about operational costs is a commercial matter for BNFL. However, information about the commercial performance of BNFL's Magnox Generation Business is provided in BNFL's annual report and accounts.

[19331]<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<a name="11210w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Although the UK is a net exporter of crude oil, significant quantities of particular grades of crude oil are imported for processing in UK refineries. The table provides the full detail requested. Of the total of 88 million tonnes of crude oil and refinery feedstocks processed in the UK during 2000, 44 per cent. was of crude oil from the UK sector of the North sea, 37 per cent. from the Norwegian sector, with crude oil from middle east countries accounting for 3 per cent. of total UK refinery throughput during the year. Of this, the majority came from Saudi Arabia.
<P>

<a name="11210w33.html_para0">In light of the events of 11 September I am keeping security of energy supplies under constant review. Despite the response of the coalition against terrorism to the tragedy in the US on 11 September there has been no impact on oil and gas supplies from the middle east or from elsewhere in the world. As mentioned above, the UK has a low reliance on the middle east as a source of oil supplies.

It has, on the advice of Postwatch, set a target for the average performance in February and March 2002 of 92.1 per cent. of first class post to be delivered next day. An assessment of whether the target has been achieved will be made by the Postal Services Commission with Postwatch.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w33.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary (AEAC) operates a Central Purchasing Policy. Vehicles are purchased through the Home Office Framework Arrangement for the purchases of vehicles and spare parts by the Police and Fire Authorities. The advantage of operating such a policy is the value for money that this provides. The negotiation with the various manufacturers is made on behalf of the entire Police Service and the rates of discount are applied across the Service. Rates of discount available outside the framework arrangement are nowhere near as beneficial. In relation to clothing, the Constabulary purchases from a consortium with other forces, again being able to take advantage of the benefits that buying on a larger scale brings. Both of these initiatives are supported by the Police Authority as best value initiatives.

Widows are also being dealt with first, wherever possible and are given priority over estates' claims. The time taken to settle a claim will therefore depend on the number of priority points allocated to it. The problems there have been getting the scheme up and running also affected the time taken to deal with claims.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> TXU Energi has not made its Stay Warm tariff available to its "home" customers in the north-west and east Anglia, although I understand that it is considering whether to do so. The standard licence conditions for electricity introduced on 1 October 2001 removed remaining restrictions on incumbent suppliers such as TXU operating in their "home" areas. Like other suppliers, TXU remains subject to the operation of competition law, including the Competition Act 1998, which protects competitors and consumers from companies' abuse of a dominant position. It is for TXU, like companies in other markets, to judge whether offers to particular groups of consumers could be deemed anti-competitive. The Competition Act 1998 provides the opportunity for companies to seek guidance or a direction on schemes from the Office of Fair Trading.

 <i>[holding answer 28 November 2001]:</i> We are preparing the regulations necessary to apply the provisions of the Waste Framework Directive to those types of agricultural waste which are not excluded from control under Article 2. On completion, we will issue a draft of the regulations for consultation with the farming industry and other interested groups. A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is also being prepared. The RIA will form part of the consultation paper and will assess the average cost to farms of applying the Directive's provisions. I will ensure that a copy of the consultation paper is sent to the hon. Member when it is issued.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> On 28 September, the last day on which PCS members in all DEFRA offices were asked to take action, 2,102 members of staff took action. Since then there has been further action but this has affected only a limited number of DEFRA offices, and thus staff, on any particular day.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para0">Most divisions which have staff in PCS grades who are covered by the proposed pay settlement for staff formerly in MAFF have lost some staff days due to industrial action.

<P>
<a name="11210w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w37.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Industrial action, which commenced in August, has mainly affected the Arable Area Payments Scheme. Payments under this scheme are made in a payment window running from 16 November to 31 January. In a normal year 60&#150;70 per cent. of the aid would be paid out in the first two to three weeks. This year the figure is likely to be a little over 50 per cent.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> The Environment Agency already applies the same dioxin emission limit to that portion of gas generated by burning hazardous waste in cement kilns as for waste burned in incinerators. This is in accordance with the pro-rating rules of the Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive (91/689/EEC).

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w37.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 November 2001]:</i> Farms subject to Form D restrictions are eligible for assistance from the Farms Business Advice Service which was launched last year with a budget of &#163;5.25 million. It provides free on-farm advice for up to three days to farmers to help them develop better business practices, diversify or decide to leave the industry. An additional &#163;1.5 million was made available in November.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para1">These farmers may also seek help through the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para2">Under the EU state aid rules, we are unable to offer additional financial assistance to these farmers through the Business Recovery Fund, established to help a range of businesses following the impact of FMD.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if the EU eco-management and audit scheme is one of the measures of environmental management standards recognised by her Department as demonstrating a commitment to responsible environmental performance; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="11210w37.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department acknowledges the importance and value of the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The EMAS regulation, in its recently revised form, incorporates the international standard for environmental management systems, ISO 14001, to manage environmental risks and impacts and improve performance. Significantly, EMAS additionally requires the publication of independently validated information on environmental performance. EMAS therefore focuses on performance by providing for disclosure that helps to meet stakeholders' interests in openness and transparency.

 Retailers have been kept informed of the impacts of EC Regulation No. 2037/2000 through a series of stakeholder meetings (both general and specifically for retailers). My Department has also written to small retail businesses through a number of trade associations to outline the impacts of EC Regulation No. 2037/2000 on the management of waste fridges and freezers.

<P>
<a name="11210w37.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 2001]:</i> Levels of ozone are measured as part of the UK national urban and rural air pollution monitoring network. There 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2001 : Column: 676W</I><P>
are currently 120 automatic monitoring sites within this network that also measure a range of other pollutants. The number and location of monitoring sites are predominantly determined by the reporting requirements as set out in the Air Quality Framework Directive and the Air Quality Daughter Directives. The UK has been divided into air pollution monitoring areas (zone or agglomerations) for the purposes of the First Air Quality Daughter Directive.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para3">Sixteen national monitoring sites are located in rural or remote areas. These sites measure particulates (PM10), nitrogen dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide and ozone. However, not every site measures every pollutant. Table 1 lists the pollutants currently monitored at each rural monitoring station.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para4">The independent Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) has developed recommendations on natural air quality standards. The standards are based on assessment of the health effects of each pollutant. When air pollution levels are above the standard mild effects, that are unlikely to require action, may start to be noticed by sensitive people. Table 2 lists the air quality standards.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para5">Table 3 shows the number of days at rural sites on which levels of ozone were above the national standard of 100 g/m <sup>3</sup>  measured as a running eight hour average mean. Ozone episodes are caused by a combination of sunlight reacting on volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants can be transported long distances and a proportion of the ozone measured during these episodes is likely to have originated from continental sources.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para6">Table 4 shows the number of days at rural sites on which levels of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> were above the national standard of 50 g/m <sup>3</sup>  measured as a running 24 hour average mean.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para7">Table 5 shows the number of days at rural sites on which levels of sulphur dioxide were above the national standard of 266 g/m <sup>3</sup>  measured as a 15 minute mean.
<P>

<a name="11210w37.html_para8">The nitrogen dioxide standard (287 g/m <sup>3</sup>  measured as a one hour mean) has not been exceeded at any rural site at which monitoring is undertaken.

<P>
<a name="11210w38.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We considered the case for payment of optional agrimonetary compensation to the arable sector, the cost of which would largely have been borne by the UK Exchequer. While we acknowledge the difficulties that the sector is facing, we decided not to draw down these funds given the many competing demands on the Exchequer, not least the cost of eradicating foot and mouth disease. The arable sector will, however, be receiving &#163;28 million in compulsory agrimonetary compensation this autumn.

 The amount of council tax individual authorities choose to raise is a matter for individual councils to decide. Spending Review 2000 looked at pressures on local authority services funded through the Environment, Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS) block, which included increases in landfill tax and the 2003&#150;04 statutory targets for recycling and composting of household waste. SR2000 provided an increase in EPCS Standard Spending Assessment of &#163;1.1 billion over the period covered by the spending review.

<P>

<a name="11210w38.html_para5">Last year's flooding was truly exceptional and followed the wettest autumn on record. Flood defences damaged last year have all been repaired and reinstated, and in some cases improved. This means that communities are now at least as well defended as they were before the floods, and are often better defended. Longer term work to improve defences is under way in many areas. The arrangements for responding to flooding, which proved to be effective last year, have been further improved in the light of lessons learned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w40.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> The Government have looked closely at the impact of the levy on the producers of processed aggregate products (such as precast concrete) in Northern Ireland and recognise that they are at greater risk of increased international competition than their mainland counterparts, because of the land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="11210w40.html_para3">As announced in the pre-Budget report, the Government are proposing to address this by phasing the levy in over five years in Northern Ireland, beginning with a complete exemption in 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<a name="11210w40.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what environmental impact assessment he has undertaken of the effects of the introduction of the new aggregates tax; and if this includes the cost of the disposal of unsaleable secondary aggregates.  [20711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w40.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> Independent research has shown that there are significant environmental costs associated with quarrying which are not already covered by regulation, including noise, dust, visual intrusion, loss of amenity and damage to biodiversity. The levy will make the price of aggregates better reflect these social and environmental costs and encourage efficient use of aggregates, as well as the increased use of recycled aggregates and other alternatives to virgin aggregate, thus reducing the amount of extraction.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w41.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> Customs and Excise are exploring the implications of this decision with the European Commission, and will consider whether any changes are required to ensure the UK's VAT rules are compatible. The Government will consult UK businesses closely about these implications, but are not prepared to impose any unnecessary costs or burdens on them. In the meantime, UK businesses can continue to rely on current UK law, policy and practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w41.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> As the hon. Member will be aware, since pre-Budget 1997 the VAT receipts forecast is governed by a National Audit Office assumption that the VAT/Consumers' Expenditure ratio declines by 0.05 per cent. per year.

<a name="11210w43.html_para5">Chief officers of police share fully the Government's view that everything possible must be done to minimise the risk of accidents involving police vehicles, while recognising the need to ensure a prompt response to emergencies. The police are taking forward a number of initiatives to help to achieve this, including the implementation of recommendations from an Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) report on police pursuit driver training. In addition, ACPO has produced a guide to pursuit management to be used by forces, and a new police driver training course, launched December last year, introduced a universal standard for driving in England and Wales which recognises the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations.
<P>

<a name="11210w43.html_para6">It is police practice to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off. Other operational measures employed to avoid or curtail pursuits include the use of helicopters, the early deployment of tyre deflation devices across the carriageway, and the use of tactical pursuit and containment, where a number of police vehicles box in a target vehicle to bring it safely to a halt.

 Entitlement to occupy quarters was ended for Prison Officers in 1987. Since that time quarters have been sold either to occupying officers under discount sales schemes or, where vacant on the open market. Fifty quarters are retained for occupation by Chaplains who continue to have a quarter entitlement. Also, approximately 400 quarters retained on security or operational grounds are available for occupation by prison staff, and these are reallocated by Governors upon becoming vacant.

<P>

 The requested details are not collected centrally. Of the 8,593 offences of rape recorded in England and Wales in the year ending March 2001, 3,992 were detected. During the 2000 calendar year a total of 2,046 individuals were proceeded against at magistrates courts for rape. As the recorded crime figure relates to offences, and the proceedings figure relates to individuals, who may be prosecuted for more than one rape offence, these figures are not directly comparable.

<P>
<a name="11210w44.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Making a hoax call to the emergency services constitutes improper use of a public telecommunication system and is an offence under section 43 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. Data on the number of prosecutions for malicious abuse of the public telephone system are not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="11210w44.html_para3">Accidental calls, characterised by silence on being answered, account for some 20 per cent. of 999 calls.

 The target is to ensure that by 2004 levels of fear of crime in the key categories of violent crime, burglary and car crime are lower than in 2001. The measure is the British Crime Survey, and the 2001 survey provides us with a baseline against which to measure progress against this target. The 2001 baseline is: 22.3 per cent. of the population fear violent crime; 16.5 per cent. fear burglary and 18.5 per cent. fear car crime.
<P>

<a name="11210w44.html_para4">Tackling the fear of crime is critical to improving the quality of life for many. The British Crime Survey shows that fear of crime has been falling in the key crime categories over a number of years, although we know that some individuals, communities or groups may be more susceptible to fear than others. Our crime reduction programme aims to secure substantial reductions in the level of fear of crime by 2004, as we achieve real reductions in actual crime levels.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers there are in Coventry; how many are from ethnic minorities; and what measures there are to encourage more people into the police service.  [20957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w45.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B>

 We would expect a person with diabetes who injects insulin to be advised by their doctor or pharmacist about the safe disposal of their used syringes and needles.

Local authorities have a duty to collect clinical waste on request, although they may levy a reasonable charge for doing so.

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. In 1999&#150;2000, the MRC expenditure on all haemoglobinopathies was &#163;815,000. In 2000&#150;01, the MRC expenditure was &#163;823,000.

<P>
<a name="11210w49.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We recognise that staff work hard for the national health service, often in challenging environments, and we are committed to ensuring that staff feel properly valued.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many general practitioners are due to retire in the next 10 years; and if he will make a statement on the effect on the health service of these retirements.  [20263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w50.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department does not collect information about retirement intentions of general practitioners. All unrestricted principals and equivalents (UPEs) have to retire as a principal by the age of 70. Around 2,200 UPEs will reach 70 by 2011.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para0">In addition there are a further 8,880 doctors who are currently aged between 48 and 58. We might expect a proportion of these doctors to also leave by 2011. A number of doctors continue to work in the national health service after they have claimed their NHS pension until they retire fully.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para1">The target increase in the NHS Plan for GPs is at least 2,000 more by 2004. The increases are based on an assessment of what is deliverable given the numbers expected to come out of training, and what is achievable through action on recruitment and retention. This assessment is set against the number of staff we expect to leave the NHS (leavers and retirements).

 The provision of a second linear accelerator service to replace the existing cobalt unit was approved in 2000. The new linear accelerator is expected to begin treating patients in spring 2002, forming part of the trust's plan to improve cancer services.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para2">Future decisions on service provision will be made through the North West Midlands Cancer Network, of which the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital National Health Service Trust plays a key part.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w50.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Significant investment has been made available nationally to accommodate the required increase in National Health Service capacity to ensure improvements in waiting times for elective surgery and the rapid treatment of emergency inpatients. This has recently been quantified in the national beds inquiry work.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para3">I am advised that in Worcestershire it has been agreed that 86 additional beds will be required in April 2002 over previous plans. This will be financed by additional resources earmarked to meet NHS planned targets. Local health groups are looking at the extent to which these could be replaced in the longer term with alternative facilities in the community. In the meantime, three wards in the Aconbury (East) Unit on the Newtown site of the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust have been designated as medical beds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and if he will make a statement on the claim by Worcestershire Health Authority of a loss in value of its fixed assets in its 2000&#150;01 Annual Accounts before the proposed sale of land and demolition of buildings.  [20525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11210w50.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The recognised accountancy bodies have a financial reporting standard (FRS11) that requires that an annual review of the buildings, plant and equipment of an organisation be undertaken where a change has occurred or is expected to occur in the use, and therefore the value of, the asset. These financial reporting standards issued by the recognised accountancy bodies are expected to be applied by all commercial organisations in the United Kingdom in the preparation of their annual accounts.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para4">This is known as impairment of fixed assets. FRS11 requires that the accounts should recognise the change in the value immediately.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para5">During the period 2000&#150;01, the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust declared that there had been an impairment in the value of the Kidderminster Hospital Bewdley Road site due to the planned reconfiguration of service provision to develop the new diagnostic and treatment centre.

<a name="11210w50.html_para6">However, we wish to ensure that people have full information and we are, therefore, seeking to develop greater awareness of the health risks associated with oral tobacco as part of our tobacco information strategy. Our Asian tobacco campaign launched in August, focused on high risk ethnic minority populations, to address the health risks of smoking and the use of oral tobacco in order to decrease demand for these products. It is envisaged that an important element of this campaign will be the close involvement of local community organisations and many of these groups are already involved in the planning process. We have funded a training pack for trading standards officers on oral tobacco.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> The decision to centralise specialist gynaecological cancer surgery is in line with national guidance which specifies that specialised surgery for gynaecological cancers should be in a single centre of excellence serving a population of 1 million.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para7">The Mid Anglia Cancer Network currently carries out such work in Ipswich, Colchester and Chelmsford. The recommendation to establish the centre in Ipswich is based on Ipswich hospital having the facilities and capacity for development whereas Chelmsford or

<a name="11210w50.html_para8">Public consultation on setting up the Mid Anglia Cancer Network has already taken place.

<a name="11210w50.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> We welcome the publication of the King's Fund report "Future Imperfect" which contributes to the important debate about how to improve social services. We are already working with local councils and other agencies to raise standards across care. For example, on 9 October we published "Building Capacity and Partnership in Care" which encourages the development of a wide range of services to meet the diverse needs of communities.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para10">As part of the National Training Strategy for Social Care in England, the National Training Organisation for Social Care (TOPSS) are working on the development of a comprehensive framework of national occupational standards for the social care workforce. These standards describe the tasks that a worker undertakes and determines their position in the career structure that is being developed with the qualifications framework. At present there are numerous different titles given to care and support services staff. However, by relating the work that they undertake to the relevant national occupational standards there will be a national understanding of the tasks that they are undertaking.
<P>

<a name="11210w50.html_para11">On 19 October 2001, we announced a &#163;1.5 million recruitment campaign, which is designed to increase the number of people interested in careers in social work and social care work. As well as tackling recruitment problems, this campaign is designed to raise public awareness of the work that is undertaken by staff in the social care workforce.
