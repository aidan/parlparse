<p><a name="06052622001171"><b><a name="06052622002100">Mr.
McCartney:</b> Section 75 of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act has
the effect that where a purchase for an amount over &#163;100 and not
more than &#163;30,000 has been funded by a credit card, the
purchaser will have the same rights in respect of a breach of contract
or misrepresentation against the credit card company, as he would have
against the supplier
himself.</p><p><a name="06052622001172">One area of
section 75 around which there has been a degree of uncertainty relates
to overseas transactions (i.e. where a credit card is used to buy
something abroad). The Office of Fair Trading sought to resolve this
issue by way of a Court declaration. The case reached its conclusion on
22 March 2006, when the Court of Appeal ruled that section 75 of the
Consumer Credit Act 1974 does apply to overseas transactions, as well
as to domestic
ones.</p><p><a name="06052622001173">Before this
ruling and during the passage of the Consumer Credit Bill (now the
Consumer Credit Act 2006), Baroness Miller of Hendon tabled an
amendment to try and clarify the issue of overseas application of
section 75. The Government resisted Baroness Miller's amendment on the
grounds that the issue was the subject of an ongoing case at the Court
of Appeal, and that it would be inappropriate to amend section 75
before that case had reached its conclusion.</p><p><a name="06052622001174">The subsequent Court ruling of
22 March is, the Government believes, a good outcome for consumers and

Act.</p><p><a name="06052622001175">More generally,

from June this year, we will have a taskforce on women's enterprise to
encourage the development of women's enterprise working with the

ending spring 2005 to 3.4 percentage points for the year ending winter
2005. In the last four years, the number of self-employed people of
working age from under-represented groups has increased from around
80,000 to 120,000 in England. The Department and the small business
service are working with colleagues across Whitehall to help deliver

ensure financial security in retirement and reduce the risk of falling

release &#163;850 million of reserves that Royal Mail has built up
through past profitable performance so those funds can be transferred
to a special account, the pension escrow account, upon which the
pension fund trustees could draw, in the unlikely event that Royal Mail
should fail as a business. When the pension fund deficit has been
recovered and Royal Mail's balance sheet strengthened by successful
operation, it is expected that the escrow fund will be released and
surplus cash returned to the Government as shareholder. This
arrangement provides confidence to pensioners and a sustainable

Merron:</b> The Government are very concerned about the
growing divergence between the cost of public transport and private
motoring which is largely due to market forces. The rise in bus fares
mostly reflects the increased costs of labour, fuel and insurance to
bus operators. These costs need to be met either through fare increases
or subsidy. The Department makes it clear in its dealings with the bus
industry that affordable fares are a crucial factor in promoting
patronage growth and accessibility of
services.</p><p><a name="06052622001333">The
Government provides support for local bus services in the form of Bus
Service Operators Grant, worth over &#163;370 million annually to the
industry. This grant reduces operating costs and therefore helps to
minimise fares.</p><p><a name="06052622001334">In
addition, the Government have introduced free concessionary bus travel
for over-60s and disabled people and made available an additional
&#163;350 million to local authorities to reimburse to operators the
revenue foregone. As from 1 April 2008, holders of concessionary passes
will be eligible for free local bus travel in any part of the
country.</p><p><a name="06052622001335">We are

not planning a national roll out of dedicated school buses, but want to
encourage individual local authorities and Passenger Transport
Executives to consider school bus schemes as part of broader local
transport planning and decide if they would be appropriate to their
area. The Department knows from our earlier evaluation of various
small-scale yellow and other dedicated school bus schemes that
well-designed schemes have the potential to reduce car dependency for
journeys to school and the traffic congestion that results from this.
But care also needs to be taken to ensure that they are appropriate to
local circumstances and do not reduce levels of walking or cycling or
undermine the viability of important bus services available to the
wider public.</p><p><a name="06052622001468">The
Department is providing &#163;18.7 million over the next three years
to purchase 150 dedicated buses for West Yorkshire Passenger Transport
Executive&#146;s MyBus school bus scheme. The evaluation of this
scheme should be completed next year but the initial signs are that
there has been some impact in reducing the number of children
travelling to school by car and other non-transport benefits have also
been reported.</p><p><a name="06052622001469">The
Education and Inspections Bill includes provisions to improve home to
school transport, including enabling a small number of local
authorities to propose Pathfinder schemes to test innovative approaches
to home to school transport. These schemes would support school choice,
and increase the proportion travelling by sustainable
means.</p><p><a name="06052622001470">DfES has policy
responsibility for home to school transport and will be talking to
local authorities interested in running Pathfinder schemes, including
passenger transport executives where relevant, later this year. Formal
expressions of interest will only be sought after the Bill has been
enacted, and formal consultation on the Pathfinder guidance and
prospectus has taken place. DfES will support schemes, which it
anticipates will start in September 2009, with &#163;4 million pump
priming and annual revenue support building up over several years to
&#163;12 million.</p><br><notus-date day="25" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>25 May 2006 : Column 1957W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06052622000120">Small Change Big Difference

providing the above information I should explain that Roads Service
does not simply split its total budget for capital expenditure on roads
across all the district council areas. Major road improvements are
prioritised on a countrywide basis taking account of a broad range of
criteria such as strategic planning policy, traffic flow, number of
accidents, potential travel save times, environment impact and value
for money. While the actual spend on a major works scheme may be within
one district council area, the benefits of such schemes are not
confined to the district council, constituency or county in which they
are located. </p></ul><a name="06052638004070"><ul><p class="tabletext">Roads
Service expenditure on minor road improvements includes minor works,
accident remedial schemes, transportation measure and minor bridge
strengthening. The resources available for such works are allocated to
the 4 Roads Service Divisions and, in turn, apportioned across district
council areas on a needs-based priority approach using indicators such
as population, weighted road lengths and the number of accidents. This
ensures, so far as possible, an equitable distribution of funds across
the country.</p></ul><a name="06052638004071"><ul><p class="tabletext">With
regard to the capital budget for 2006-07, again it is not possible to
split this budget into counties. The total Roads Service Capital Budget

Division is as follows:</p></ul><a name="06052638004072"><ul><p class="tabletext">The initial
budget allocation for major and minor works in Western Division is
&#163;22M (&#163;7M Minor, &#163;15M Major). Our Western Division
incorporates 6 District Council areas&#151;Cookstown, Dungannon,
Fermanagh, Omagh, Magherafelt, and Strabane.</p></ul><a name="06052638004073"><ul><p class="tabletext">The initial budget allocation

the meeting of the sub-committee of the Committee on the Grant of

case for a medal for service in the Suez Canal zone in the early 1950s,
was produced by the Ceremonial Secretariat at the Cabinet Office. It
did not contain and was not intended to contain a detailed account of

continuous. Neither did the report indicate that it could be

(NPfIT) services and systems are based on modern, robust tools and
technologies which have been tried and tested widely in business and in
the IT industry. They are based on industry standard platforms that
have been underpinned by enterprise wide arrangements that achieved
large cost savings for the taxpayer and the national health service
with market leading IT products from Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, Novell and
others. They use industry standards in whose development the
Department's NHS connecting for health agency takes an active role,
where
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06052638001027">NPfIT
contracts specify service requirements and service levels rather than
the underlying technical components. However, each contract contains an
obligation for innovation and to keep up to date the technology
employed including, as a minimum, a refresh of the relevant hardware
and software platforms. Selection of the programme's suppliers was in
part informed by their technical development plans and track record for
continuing product development. In that way, the applications and
technologies procured will not remain static, but keep pace with
developing functional needs and technical
developments.</p><p><a name="06052638001028">NHS
connecting for health, under its research services contract with
Gartner, maintains an awareness of emerging technology. The agency has
also held a technology innovation forum involving contracted IT
suppliers and those with whom enterprise wide arrangements are in place
to promote technical innovation for the NHS. In specific areas where
patient safety, infection control or clinical utility is an issue, or
where innovation to address new policy requirements is needed, NHS
connecting for health has taken an active role in the definition of
standards in hardware and software to meet these
requirements.</p><p><a name="06052638001029">In

Ivan Lewis:</b> The &#145;Every child
matters: change for children&#146; programme, a joint programme
between the Department and the Department for Education and Skills,
sets out the national framework for local change programmes to build
services around the needs of children and young people. &#145;Change
for children&#146; is particularly concerned with targeting support
on children most at risk of negative outcomes, such as those associated
with running away or going missing. As part of this programme, the
Children Act 2004 reforms place a duty on a range of health bodies to
have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children and to co-operate 
<br><notus-date day="25" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>25 May 2006 : Column 2012W</b><br>with local authorities to improve integrated working arrangements so
that key people and bodies are working towards shared
outcomes.</p><p><a name="06052638001281">The
national service framework for children, young people and maternity
services published in September 2004 is a 10-year programme also
intended to stimulate long-term and substantial improvement in
children's health and in the better outcomes that are the result of
better health. The Department will be seeking to make health an
integral part of the everyday services that young people
use.</p><p><a name="06052638001282">It is possible
for any child or young person to access national health service primary
medical services by registering as a patient with a local general
practitioner practice. Where a child is being registered, an
application may be made on their behalf by a parent or other person who
has parental responsibility for them. It is also possible to access
primary care services through a NHS walk-in centre or NHS Direct where
there is no need to
register.</p><p><a name="06052638001283">Services in
all primary care trust areas, including primary, community, specialist
and acute services need to take account of young people's needs. By
creating services centred around the needs of children and families and
ensuring that every child achieves their potential, these reforms will
close the gap between those who do well and those who do not,
including, for example, children and young people who runaway or go
missing from home or

must take all relevant factors into account to strike an appropriate
balance between the needs of the local community and flood risk, and
can be challenged in the courts on whether they have exercised their
judgment in a lawful manner. The Environment Agency has succeeded in a
judicial review, where it considered an authority had not given
sufficient weight to its views of flood risk in a planning decision. To
support authorities in making these decisions the Government recently
consulted on a package of measures to strengthen the application of
planning policy for development and flood risk. Responding to figures
in the Environment Agency's High Level Target 5 report for 2004-05,
published in February, on permissions for major development permitted
against its sustained objection on flood risk grounds, my officials
have contacted the authorities about whose cases the Agency still had
concerns, and we are currently seeking the Agency's views on the

transactions fail between offer acceptance and completion. The research
study also described the reasons why transactions fail, according to
buyers and sellers. For example, the report indicated that 43 per cent.
of transaction failures were attributable to an unfavourable survey
report. The remained or failed transactions were due to a seller
deciding to sell elsewhere, unacceptable delays, chain breakdown and
the property being taken off the market. The key findings of the
research study indicated that many of the problems associated with the
current system are down to information emerging later in the process
and that buyers, sellers and the professionals all agreed that sellers
