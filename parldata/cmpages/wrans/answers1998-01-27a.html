To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what factors underlay his assessment that a possible five million new homes are required for the next century's housing needs. [24867] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has made no such assessment. The 1992-based household projections, published in March 1995, indicate a 4.4 million increase in the number of households in England in the 25 year period from 1991 to 2016. However, these household projections are not an estimate of the number of additional houses which have to be built. Rather, they represent just one of the factors to be taken into account by local planning authorities when arriving at figures for housing provision to be included in regional guidance and development plans.
<P>

<a name="80127w01.html_para3">These projections remain the latest official estimates of household formation until the 1996-based household projections are compiled around the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many prosecutions the Health and Safety Executive has carried out under the Manual Handling Regulations since they came into force; and of these how many were against <i>(a)</i> health care employers, <i>(b)</i> local government employers and <i>(c)</i> private residential homes. [25006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 came into force on 1 January 1993. Between then and 31 March 1997, the Health and Safety Executive has taken eight cases, involving the laying of 15 informations. Ten of the resulting charges produced successful convictions.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 125</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80127w01.html_para4">One case was taken against a local government employer. This case resulted in two convictions. No cases were taken against health care employers.
<P>

<a name="80127w01.html_para5">Local authorities enforce the Manual Handling Operations Regulations in private residential homes; HSE has therefore taken no prosecutions against private residential homes.

<P>
<a name="80127w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Ann Cryer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received on the allocation of a large green field site at Silsden for housing development in the Bradford Unitary Development Plan. [24969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Since Bradford City Council published their proposed modifications to the Unitary Development Plan, and their notice of intention to adopt it, we have received my hon. Friend's representations and others on behalf of the Silsden Town Action Group. Officials have also received telephone calls about the proposals for Silsden.
<P>

<a name="80127w01.html_para6">We have been aware of the public controversy about the Plan and have taken full account of the representations before concluding that intervention by the Secretary of State would not be warranted.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 2 December 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>110,</i> what guidance is given to local authorities to develop strategies for the preservation of mature street trees; and what monitoring takes place as to the effectiveness of the delivery of these strategies. [25018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Various guidance has been given to local authorities, in Circulars, research reports and other documents, on the scope and content of strategies to guide the planting, maintenance, protection and replacement of trees in their area. In particular, the 1994 report 'Urban Tree Strategies' illustrated, through a number of case studies, a range of different approaches to help other local authorities when preparing their own strategies.
<P>

<a name="80127w01.html_para7">Monitoring its effectiveness in achieving objectives should be an important element of any such strategy and should be undertaken at the local level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Traffic studies were carried out in accordance with the Department's Traffic Appraisal Manual for the schemes on the A419 in Wiltshire and A417 in Gloucestershire which have recently been completed. The studies covered the effects of the Latton Bypass, the Cirencester and Stratton Bypass, the North of Stratton to Nettleton Improvement and the Brockworth Bypass on traffic flows in that corridor. We are monitoring traffic on the new road but it will be some time before we are able to draw any conclusions as to traffic patterns.

 On 2 September 1997, the Under- Secretary of State, my hon.

However, it is not for Government to decide where the Agency will be located. The Agency itself will be best placed to decide where its offices should be.

 The development needs of the region are enormous. A major international effort is needed to assist the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda to implement sustainable development policies which benefit the poor. Britain has not traditionally been a major bilateral donor to the region. But we are working with the International Financial Institutions and the European Commission to whom we are major contributors to try to deliver effective assistance. The EC has already committed &#163;149 million (UK share &#163;10 million) to the region in rehabilitation assistance since November 1994. Further funding is available from the European Development Fund.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 8 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>433-34</i>, if all police forces have appointed a management team to deal with year 2000 compliance; and what arrangements have been made by each police force to monitor the implementation of actions to overcome year 2000 problems with particular reference to test facilities. [24725]<P>
<P>
<P>

 It is the responsibility of each police force to ensure that its information technology systems are Year 2000 compliant. Information about the management structures put in place by each force to address the problem and the arrangement for monitoring the implementation of their action plans is not available centrally. However, we are currently reviewing progress as part of the Government's determination to ensure that Year 2000 problems are identified and dealt with right across the public service. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will also monitor progress as part of its regular inspections.

 The Police Information Technology Organisation is not aware of any incidences within police forces of system failure because of the millennium problem. Forces' own audits and information provided to them by suppliers have indicated potential problems with a number of information technology systems, including Command and Control, Crime Pattern Analysis and HOLMES I. The difficulties with HOLMES I will be overcome with the introduction of a year 2000 compliant HOLMES II, which will be in place before the end of the century. A Ministerial Group is urgently reviewing within Government and outside to ensure that all other systems are also year 2000 compliant.

<a name="80127w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will publish the calculations on which the financial effects of the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>] are based; and if he will make statement. [25053] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The calculations used to estimate the financial effects of the Crime and Disorder Bill published in the Financial Memorandum are as set out. Taken as a whole, the Bill is intended to address offending behaviour more effectively and to reduce crime and it is therefore expected that this will produce significant savings to the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para1">Measures aimed at dealing with youth crime and disorder (child safety orders and parenting orders) will be piloted to enable a detailed assessment of costs. Full year costs are estimated to be &#163;3 million, based on a cost of &#163;180 per order per month and a planning assumption of 5,000 parenting orders per annum typically lasting around three months, and 1,000 child safety orders per annum typically lasting one and a half months.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para2">The introduction of anti-social behaviour orders is expected to lead to additional costs of &#163;3 million to the courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and in legal aid. This is based on an assumption of 5,000 orders annually with the majority of costs falling to magistrates' courts. Additional costs for the police and local authorities are expected to be fully offset by savings arising from the introduction of the new orders.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para3">The proposals relating to new racially aggravated offences and those concerning increased sentences for those offences are expected to result in some additional costs, but the innovative nature of the offences makes it difficult at this stage to estimate their likely financial impact.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 139</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para4">Proposals relating to the local provision of youth justice services and youth offending teams will be piloted before full implementation to enable a detailed assessment of costs. The establishment of a Youth Justice Board assumes a Board consisting of 10 members working part-time for standard daily rates of remuneration and travel and subsistence; and a small secretariat of 10 staff with a small budget for commissioning research and for developing good practice in work with young offenders. On this basis, full year costs are estimated to be in the region of &#163;1 million.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para5">Proposals intended to reduce delay in the criminal justice system include the introduction of statutory time limits and increased efficiency, especially in the Youth Court. These are intended to be cost-neutral, since it is expected that any additional costs will be more than outweighed by the benefits of speeding up the progress of cases through the system. The introduction of statutory time limits may have limited resource implications which will be assessed once piloting has determined the level at which limits should be set.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para6">The final warning scheme, action plan orders and reparation orders will all be piloted to enable detailed costs and savings to be assessed before full implementation. Action plan orders are expected to lead to savings of around &#163;2 million based on 6,000 juveniles per year receiving an order in place of current community penalties. The reparation order is estimated to cost around &#163;1 million if applied to 11,500 juveniles per year.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para7">Initial estimates of the cost of introducing reprimands and warnings, including the costs of rehabilitation programmes, are in the region of &#163;14 million. Around half of this sum is attributable to Youth Offending Teams running appropriate intervention programmes; these costs will not be incurred in every area as some areas already operate analogous "caution-plus" schemes. The other half reflects the impact of the scheme on the number of court cases and the change in sentencing patterns likely to arise from restricting the use of conditional discharge following final warnings.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para8">Proposals relating to improvements to supervision orders are expected to result in additional local authority accommodation costs of around &#163;2 million per year. This assumes that, at most, around 160 juveniles a year might be given a residency requirement. The proposals for detention and training orders for young offenders are not expected to have any significant impact on the numbers held in secure facilities. The associated increased levels of supervision are estimated to result in additional costs 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 140</I><P>
of around &#163;2 million per year based on an estimated 2,200 young people held under a detention and training order at any one time.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para9">The extended supervision for sex, violent, recalled and returned prisoners will eventually generate net additional probation service and electronic monitoring costs estimated to be about &#163;20 million per year, assuming that this will require around 600 additional probation service staff to supervise 1,100 offenders on extended supervision with 110 recalls to custody (a breach rate of 10 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para10">Proposals for drug treatment and testing orders will be the subject of local pilot projects, the cost of which are expected to be in the region of &#163;l million. The findings of the pilot evaluation will inform consideration of the need for resourcing to extend the Treatment and Testing Orders nationwide. Full implementation based on 6,250 orders per year at a cost of &#163;6,400 per order are estimated to be &#163;40 million.
<P>

<a name="80127w05.html_para11">The cost of introducing powers to release short-term prisoners on licence (home detention curfew) depends upon the extent of take-up and the outcome of a commercial competition but, on the take-up rate assumed for planning purposes, is not expected to exceed &#163;26 million per year. Against this, home detention curfew will avoid the need for expenditure on around 3,000 new prison places at an estimated cost of &#163;90 million per year which would otherwise be necessary to accommodate the rising prison population.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the Government's guidance to the Metropolitan Police Service on the use of civilians within police stations; and in what circumstances civilians may be given responsibility for the supervision of detainees within police stations. [25230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner tells me that the Metropolitan Police's civil staff are employed in a wide range of roles in support of operational police duties. There are currently 4,835 civil staff employed at divisional police stations within the Metropolitan Police District. Guidance on the use of civilians in the custody area of police stations was issued to all police forces on 6 July 1993. The guidance provided a list of tasks which were considered suitable for trained civilian staff working under the direct supervision of the custody officer.
<P>

<a name="80127w07.html_para0">The Commissioner tells me that civilian gaolers were formally introduced in the Metropolitan Police via a pilot scheme in May 1993. Since then, it has been acknowledged that, despite having no special powers, they can make a useful contribution in assisting the custody officer in the management of detained persons. Their main role is to deal with a wide range of important routine matters on behalf of the custody officer concerning general welfare, housekeeping and detention conditions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House copies of the Annual Report of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for 1996-97, which gives details of the Board's financial accounts and activities over the past eighteen months. Copies of the report have also been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80127w07.html_para1">Under section 6 of the Video Recordings Act 1984, the designated authority for the classification of video works (in practice, the President and Vice Presidents of the BBFC) is required to produce a report as soon as is reasonably practicable after 31 December. The production of the report for 1996-97 has been greatly delayed and I have expressed my concern about this very strongly to the new President, Mr. Andreas Whittam Smith. Mr. Whittam Smith has made it clear that he shares my concern and has assured me that he will be establishing a timetable for the production of the 1997-98 report to ensure that it is produced as soon as possible after the audited accounts are available.
<P>

<a name="80127w07.html_para2">I have also made clear to Mr. Whittam Smith my serious concern at the unilateral action taken by the BBFC last year to relax the guidelines for the classification of videos in the R18 category (that is, videos which can lawfully be sold only in licensed sex shops). The BBFC's change of policy was brought to my attention by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise which was concerned that material had been classified which might have been liable to forfeiture under section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act 1959 and the subject of forfeiture proceedings under section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. It was entirely unacceptable that the Board should have acted in this way. As a consequence of my concern, Mr. Whittam Smith has inquired into the handling of this matter and is putting in place procedures to ensure proper controls on the formulation of policy. He is also taking steps to improve management accountability at the Board.
<P>

<a name="80127w07.html_para3">On taking up his post, Mr. Whittam Smith outlined his proposals for reviewing the Board's classification policy and his intention to consult widely on this issue. I welcome these positive steps towards greater openness and accountability at the Board.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 13 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>165</i>, for what reasons the average turn round time between receipt of claims from the police and processing of options A and B was 19 weeks. [25926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 With over 116,000 handguns and associated equipment surrendered over a short period, an initial build-up of claims was inevitable. Processing rates were initially held up by computer problems, now resolved, and are currently determined by a combination of factors, including: the nature and complexity of the claims that are being examined; the numbers of staff available at any given point; and the time that can be spent on processing claims, as opposed to non-productive work such as dealing with inquiries. We are doing all we can to keep the length of time that claimants must await payment to a minimum. This includes weekend working; the use of casual staff and of data processors on short term contract to input the claimant details; allowing the examiners more time on processing the payments; and increasing the number of trained examiners available. A recorded telephone mailbox message giving current processing times has been introduced to reduce the distractions to staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 13 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>165</i>, on the Firearms Compensation Scheme, what was the reason for the delay in returning Mr. Fowles's incorrectly completed firearms compensation application; and if he will make a statement. [25350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Errors in the completion of compensation claims are normally identified when the claim is examined prior to payment. Having been lodged on 23 September 1997, towards the end of the hand-in period, Mr. Fowles's claim has not yet reached that stage, and the error in his claim has come to light as a result of the previous Question. The form has been returned to 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 147</I><P>
Mr. Fowles for correction. There has been no delay in notifying him of the error, and the processing time for the case will be unaffected, so long as Mr. Fowles completes the form correctly and returns it promptly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will publish the conditions that have to be met by the partner of someone seeking permission to live in the United Kingdom before they may be admitted. [25865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The term "partner" is not defined in immigration legislation or rules. Different descriptions are used and so it is not possible to give a precise answer to this Question. Someone seeking permission to enter the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as a spouse or fiance(e) must show that he or she is present and settled in the United Kingdom and that, as a couple, they intend to live together permanently and are able to maintain and accommodate themselves without recourse to public funds. The parties to the marriage, or proposed marriage, must have met. If the overseas partner is seeking permission to enter under the concession for unmarried partners, introduced on 13 October 1997, the couple must additionally show that they have been living together in a relationship akin to marriage which has subsisted for four years or more; that they are legally unable to marry (other than by reason of consanguineous relationships or age); and that any previous marriage, or similar relationship, has permanently broken down. In all cases, the overseas partner must be in possession of a valid entry clearance for entry in the appropriate capacity.

 Only a small minority of pensioners are required to complete self assessment tax returns. The Inland Revenue has produced written guidance about people who receive pensions, explaining the time limit for completing their returns, and the Inland Revenue's publicity campaign has included a significant amount of advertisement on national television and radio, designed to raise awareness of the filing date amongst all sections of the population affected by self assessment. As I explained to the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) on 14 January, there are no plans to extend the filing date of 31 January 1998.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many and what percentage of outstanding debts to the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise were recovered by his Department over the most recent period for which figures are available; what methods were employed; and in what percentage of cases litigation was pursued.

<P>
<a name="80127w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Customs and Excise's debt management objective in 1996-97 was to ensure that month end arrears did not exceed 2.3 per cent. of 12 months payment trader liability. This was achieved with a figure of 2.21 per cent. Approximately 5 million separate debts were referred to Inland Revenue local offices in the year ending 31 October 1996, of which approximately 50 per cent. (2.5 million) were paid in that period.
<P>

<a name="80127w08.html_para3">In the first instance, both Departments will issue a letter to the taxpayer. Inland Revenue may also telephone or visit the taxpayer's home or business premises before recovery action is taken.
<P>

<a name="80127w08.html_para4">The method of recovery adopted will depend on the circumstances and nature of any particular case. Inland Revenue local offices will consider granting a period of time in which to pay, taking distraint action, commencing summary proceedings or instigating county court proceedings or similar actions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. If necessary, cases will be referred to the Inland Revenue's special enforcement offices for further action, including winding up or bankruptcy proceedings. Customs, in addition to granting a period of time in which to pay, would levy distress by certificated bailiffs (or sheriff officers in Scotland), or the use of court process which may lead to bankruptcy or winding up. In addition, Customs may, in appropriate cases, support voluntary arrangement proposals received from debtors.

 The effects of a rise in the exchange rate are difficult to isolate and estimate with confidence. Generally, a sterling appreciation in the short term will tend to lead to lower GDP, manufacturing output, employment, and exports, and to higher imports, all compared to what they otherwise would have been. But such effects may be masked by other factors such as the relative strength of demand in the UK compared with the rest of the world and policy responses.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what he expects to be the effect in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98, <i>(b)</i> 1998-99 and <i>(c)</i> 1999-2000 on Inland Revenue manpower of the move to self-assessment; and if he will estimate the effect of the change on the running costs of the Inland Revenue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> The move to self-assessment will reduce Inland Revenue manpower by nil in 1997-98, by 1,400 man years in 1998-99 and by a further 1,600 man years in 1999-2000. Once the transitional costs of introducing the system have disappeared, self-assessment is expected to reduce Inland Revenue running costs by around &#163;70 million per annum.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what revenue he expects the Government to receive from &#163;100 fines on taxpayers who file their return after the 31 January deadline. [24715]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> The Government have not included any specific amount for these penalties in their forecast receipts. These penalties exist solely to deter late filing, and the Government would much prefer that taxpayers file their returns on time than incur penalties for late filing. The normal penalty charge will be &#163;100, but where the tax payable is less than this, the penalty will be reduced to an amount equal to the tax liability.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the Government's policy towards the proposal of the EU Commission that there should be a three-year trial period during which member states of the EU can impose a 5 per cent. rate of VAT on repairs to domestic housing; and if he will make a statement. [24770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w10.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> The Commission's suggestion that member states should be able to opt to apply a reduced rate experimentally to certain labour-intensive services has yet to be discussed by the ECOFIN Council, or indeed to be presented as a formal legislative proposal. The Government are carefully considering this proposal. There is, though, little evidence yet to convince us of the usefulness of reduced rates of VAT as a means of increasing employment or assisting small businesses.
<P>

<a name="80127w10.html_para0">The UK has a &#163;49,000 registration threshold for VAT, which already allows a small labour-intensive business, such as a builder doing house repairs, to trade legitimately without charging VAT.

The PSM also estimates that there are around 855,000 individuals receiving child benefit where their partner is paying tax at the higher rate. The estimates should be treated with some caution as they are based on survey data which use current weekly income which may not accurately represent current annual tax liabilities. Estimates may also be influenced by sampling error and response rates.

Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food takes the lead in European Community discussions and negotiations with a Senior Welsh Office Agriculture Department Official normally attending Agriculture Council meetings. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales met Commissioner Fischler, the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, on 11 July 1997 and 8 January 1998 and he proposes to attend a Council meeting when the items on the agenda are particularly relevant to Welsh agriculture.

The strategy is intended to tackle the inequalities in health status in Wales. Collaboration between the NHS, local government, commerce, voluntary agencies and individuals will be essential, with partners sharing the responsibility for promoting better health.

 My Department expects to publish a major consultation paper on new arrangements to replace the internal market for health and social services in Northern Ireland in February. The paper will set out broad policy aims and objectives which parallel those in the White Paper "The New NHS, Modern and Dependable", and will seek views on how the policy should be taken forward in Northern Ireland. Following the consultation process, the Government will announce specific proposals for changes to the health and social services later in the year. We have recently produced a policy paper "well into 2000" which sets out our vision of the health service which a new structure must serve.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Northern Ireland's road traffic law is broadly similar to that in Great Britain. Notable differences include:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Provisions requiring drivers after passing their driving test to display "R" (restricted) plates on any vehicle they are driving and not to exceed 45 mph have been in Northern Ireland's road traffic law since 1968. Learner drivers are also restricted to 45 mph. These provisions have not been replicated in Great Britain;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Northern Ireland's driving licences have a maximum duration of 10 years, whereas driving licences in Great Britain can remain valid up to age 70 before renewal. This difference exists because Northern Ireland licences also have photographic counterparts which have to be renewed at 10-year intervals to update the currency of the photographs as true likenesses;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. provisions have not yet been enacted to enable drivers with certain disabilities to be authorised, in certain circumstances, to give paid driving instruction;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. in Northern Ireland taxis are licensed under road traffic law rather than local government legislation as in Great Britain. It is envisaged that in future the taxi licensing provisions will be incorporated in a new Public Passenger Vehicles Order which apart from the taxi provisions, will largely replicate the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. there is no power in Northern Ireland to wheelclamp illegally parked vehicles;




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 170</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. enforcement of parking restrictions in Northern Ireland is carried out by police and traffic wardens, whereas in Great Britain they may be enforced by local authorities;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. Northern Ireland does not have the same degree of provision in relation to the regulation of heavy commercial traffic.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Steps taken to introduce (where relevant) closer harmony with the law in Great Britain have resulted in three Orders in Council since 1995.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The Road Traffic (NI) Order 1995 reviewed the road safety and construction and use of vehicles provisions and generally brought them into line with their GB counterparts.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) The Road Traffic Offenders (NI) Order 1996 amended the prosecution and punishment provisions of road traffic law and introduced a penalty points scheme and extended driving tests for the most serious driving offences.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) The Road Traffic Regulations (NI) Order 1997 dealt with regulating the movement on roads and the parking of vehicles and took account of current road traffic law in Great Britain.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="80127w14.html_para0">A draft Road Traffic (New Drivers) (NI) Order was laid before Parliament on 11 December 1997. That Order proposes to introduce new road safety measures relating to new inexperienced drivers similar to those in place in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="80127w14.html_para1">GB provisions on road traffic matters are not usually extended directly to Northern Ireland because of the difference in the responsibilities of local government in the two areas and certain differences in local conditions, such as the nature and extent of traffic problems encountered.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her answer of 1 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>8-9</i>, if she will make a statement on the rates of growth in Catholic and Protestant representation in the Northern Ireland Civil Service; and what steps she is taking in regard to future trends in representation. [23692]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) aims to create a position where Protestants and Roman Catholics are fairly represented at all levels in the organisation. There is a strong evidence of compositional change in the NICS-workforce since monitoring was introduced in 1985. At a macro level Protestants now represent 59.2 per cent. of the Non-Industrial Service and Roman Catholics 40.8 per cent. compared with 64.3 per cent. and 35.7 per cent. in 1985. Protestants and Roman Catholics are now fairly represented among a significant proportion of the Services' occupational groups and at most grade levels up to around Staff Officer and equivalent levels, which account for some 87 per cent. of the total workforce. Roman Catholic under-representation remains evident among the senior levels of the various occupational groups and is most apparent at Grade 5 level and above (i.e. the Senior Civil Service).
<P>

<a name="80127w14.html_para2">The Service has taken a number of steps within the law designed to achieve a more balanced workforce at the more senior levels, whilst adhering strictly to the merit principle in both its recruitment and internal promotion practices. These include the use of positive action advertising in appropriate circumstances and the removal of various internal barriers to promotion to encourage a better flow of staff from lower to higher grades within and between Departments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, pursuant to his answer of 12 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>109</i>, on PFI schemes, what is the capital cost of each scheme; and what agreements for payment have been entered into by each procuring agency. [23493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The capital value of each project is set out in the table. Payment arrangements vary from project to project. The service payment made in each of the Health PFI deals is a unitary payment based on the availability of the facility (or the acceptance of the IT modules) and the performance of the service. Payments would therefore be reduced if part of the facility (e.g. a ward or an operating theatre) were unavailable for any reason, or if the level of service were to fall below the minimum level stated in the contract.
<P>

<a name="80127w15.html_para0">For the Stirling Further Education Centre, Falkirk College will pay a monthly charge for occupying a fully serviced and maintained facility, the charge being subject to adjustment based on performance by the operator. The College has an option to reduce the space that they occupy with a consequent adjustment in their payments.
<P>

<a name="80127w15.html_para1">Payment arrangements for the M6 DBFO are based on a shadow toll structure under which payments to the operator will be related to the volume of traffic using the road over the project period. Provisions are in place to reduce payments in relation to the economic cost of delays and disruption associated with the operation and maintenance of the road.

<P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 174</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80127w15.html_para2">For HM Prison Kilmarnock, the prison operator will be paid on the basis of the number of available prisoner places. Payments are subject to deductions for failure to meet agreed levels of performance.
<P>

<a name="80127w15.html_para3">The tariff payment arrangements for the Inverness main drainage and Fort William sewage treatment scheme are based on a banded payment structure which relates payment to the quantity of effluent passed into the sewage works for treatment. The PFI concessionaire will also receive payment for the treatment of additional sewage sludge imported by the water authority.
<P>

<a name="80127w15.html_para4">Revenue to the joint venture consortium for the Baldovie waste to energy plant project will be based on volume based payments for the waste treated and the value of electricity sales. Further details can be obtained from Dundee City Council.

<P>
<a name="80127w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 Housing the entire Parliament in a separate new building in the Regent Road area was not considered to be a realistic option.

The computerised and map-based Land Register has been gradually replacing it since 1981 and currently covers 14 counties accounting for 60 per cent. of the housing stock in Scotland. It will extend to the whole of Scotland by 1 April 2003. If the extension programme were to be brought forward to 1 April 2000, additional costs of at least &#163;25 million would be required. This sum would cover the costs of registering properties transferring for value in terms of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979. The Registers of Scotland Executive Agency which operates the Land Register is currently involved in piloting the Scottish Land Information System which will provide integrated information services with easy and affordable access to all sources of land and property information in Scotland.

Such a grant of security required, as a matter of Scots law, that the title to the shares be transferred to the Trustee, subject to the terms of the security arrangement.
<P>

<a name="80127w17.html_para1">During the currency of the arrangement, the companies granting the security retain the power in respect of their shares to direct the Trustee regarding the exercise of certain important rights under the shares, including voting rights. Once Skye Bridge Ltd. has fulfilled its obligations to the secured creditors, the Trustee is obliged to transfer back the shareholdings.
<P>

<a name="80127w17.html_para2">The then Secretary of State was aware of, but not party to, all aspects of the funding arrangements when the Concession Agreement was signed on 16 December 1991. Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, the agreed funding arrangements may not subsequently be amended without the approval of the Secretary of State. The granting of the security did not constitute an amendment and, therefore, did not require the Secretary of State's approval.
<P>

<a name="80127w17.html_para3">Under the National Audit Act 1983, the Comptroller and Auditor General has a right of access to documents he may reasonably require for carrying out any examination into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which any department has used its resources in discharging its functions, and is entitled to require such information and explanation as are reasonably necessary. The information on the shareholding arrangement described above was available to the National Audit Office in the course of the Skye Bridge examination. The Department will continue to provide access in accordance with the requirements of the 1983 Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the impact on agriculture support and service industries in rural areas of current problems in the agricultural sector; what plans he has to provide additional economic assistance to small businesses in rural Scotland; and if he will make a statement.

 The Scottish Office monitors business performance on a regular basis through its links with representative bodies, by monitoring trends in employment, production and income, and commissioning research. No specific support measures are planned for small businesses in rural Scotland but many of them are likely to benefit from the steps the Government have taken to support the farming industry.

<P>

<a name="80127w17.html_para4">Three nuclear submarines await defuelling, Renown and Repulse at Rosyth and Valiant at Devonport. The nuclear reactors in these submarines have been completely shut down and are in a benign condition. Specific Royal Navy personnel will remain on board until the process is complete. Once the spent fuel has been removed, these submarines will be stored afloat with appropriate maintenance pending final disposal. The spent fuel will be consigned to long term storage at BNFL Sellafield.

<a name="80127w17.html_para5">In accordance with IAEA and Euratom definitions, spent fuel is not categorised as waste while the option of reprocessing remains open and a possible future use for the fuel can be foreseen. A decision has yet to be made on whether this and other spent fuel held by the Department is to be reprocessed. If it is reprocessed, some High Level Waste will be generated. If the decision is not to reprocess the spent fuel, it will be recategorised as High Level Waste. Accordingly my Department holds no material categorised as high level waste at this time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 NATO's Joint Sub-regional Commands, once implemented, will have no permanently established boundaries or areas of responsibility. Regional Commanders will be able to propose the establishment of areas of responsibility for particular Joint Sub-regional Commands in specific contingencies or missions. Such proposals will require the approval of all NATO nations. The defence and security of Gibraltar, its associated territorial waters and airspace are, and will remain, the direct responsibility of the United Kingdom.

 The UK, together with other Allies, has welcomed Spain's announcement of its intention to join the Alliance's integrated military structure. The detailed arrangements have still to be established.

 For specific operations, Regional Commanders may propose particular roles and responsibilities for their subordinate commands.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the publication of the transfer terms of Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) officers, as this falls into my area of responsibility, as Chief Constable/Chief Executive of the Ministry of Defence Police Agency.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In March 1995 my Personnel Department concluded that the transfer terms of individual officers were a private matter between the officer and the Personnel Department. Accordingly, with effect from 29 March 1995, details of such transfer terms ceased to be published in my weekly Force Orders. In resource terms the practice of no longer publishing individual officers' transfer terms resulted in reduced staff effort and a minor reduction in the cost of publishing Force Orders.

 The possible restructuring of Land Command, to which I referred in my reply of 16 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>349</i>, is one of many issues being considered as part of the Strategic Defence Review; and there are no plans, therefore, to restructure the Command ahead of the Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w18.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 There are no up-to-date disposal values available for the brigade headquarters site at Perth. On present known factors, the value of the divisional headquarters site at Craigiehall, near Edinburgh is estimated to be up to &#163;750,000 were it to be sold.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 17 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>66</i>, how many technical papers and reports were produced by the Project Director Facilities Division between 1986 and 1991; and how many of them are currently unclassified.

<a name="80127w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The purpose of the Project Director Facilities Division was to oversee the major programme of building and refurbishment projects then under way at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, Aldermaston. As such it did not produce technical papers. Details of reports and internal documents produced by the division are not held centrally and a census would require unreasonable diversion of resources. I am, therefore, withholding this information in accordance with exemption 9 of the Code of Practice for Open Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The net running cost of operating the Defence Export Services Organisation in my Department was &#163;10.94 million in Financial Year 1994-95 and &#163;16.61 million in Financial Year 1996-97.
<P>

<a name="80127w19.html_para0">During this latter year, the organisation generated some &#163;84.4 million from sales of surplus military equipment. Additionally, as a result of overseas orders, the Department annually secures around &#163;50 million in Commercial Exploitation Levies and saves around &#163;344 million on its own procurement costs by spreading overheads over higher levels of production. DESO therefore earns benefits for the taxpayer that far outweigh these costs.

<P>
<a name="80127w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide precise estimates of the numbers of young people who will require help from the New Deal. The programme will help young people who are, or who become, unemployed for six months or more, irrespective of ethnic origin or gender. The latest published data show that, in October 1997, around three quarters of those aged 18-24 who had been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for six months or more were men. The claimant count does not provide information on the ethnic origin of JSA claimants. The summer 1997 Labour Force Survey suggests that around 10 per cent. of all 18-24 year olds who had been unemployed according to the ILO definition for six months or more were members of ethnic minorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what are the start-up and continuing costs of the new central unit being established to administer means tests for foreign students applying for places in British universities; and how many staff will be employed. [25105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w20.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The central unit recently announced will handle applications from nationals of the other EU member states who are new entrants to higher education courses in England and Wales in the academic year 1999-2000 and who are seeking means tested support with their contribution to fees.
<P>

<a name="80127w20.html_para0">We are consulting the local education authorities on our proposal to undertake on their behalf the means testing of EU applicants in 1998-99. The costs of doing so will be determined in the light of the outcome of those consultations.

<a name="80127w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the total level of reserves held by each training and enterprise council; and what was the post-tax surplus or deficit for each TEC in (i) 1995-96 and (ii) 1996-97. [24834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w20.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 A list of Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs)/Chambers of Commerce, Training and Enterprise (CCTEs) and their accumulated reserves is shown in the following table. This information is drawn from each TEC's annual statutory accounts at the end of the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. Where TECs/CCTEs have subsidiary companies, the consolidated group position is shown.
<P>

<a name="80127w20.html_para1">TECs/CCTEs are allowed to generate surpluses and create reserves by subcontracting training at a lower unit price than that negotiated with the Department. Surpluses are used by TECs/CCTEs to provide working capital and on activities in support of their corporate and business plan objectives which are agreed with the Government. Examples of the use of these funds include the provision of additional opportunities within existing DfEE programmes; matching funding for European-funded projects; and other training, enterprise or economic development initiatives designed to meet identified local needs. Staff in Government Offices are currently discussing with each TEC how they can best use their reserves to support the Government's priorities.

<P>
<a name="80127w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his oral answer of 22 May 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 825-26, what was the form of the consultation process into age discrimination in employment; if he will make a statement on the meetings that have taken place as part of the consultation process indicating the individuals and organisations met and the date when such meetings occurred; and if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> visits to and (b) other contact with individuals and organisations under the consultation process to date. [25658] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The consultation on age discrimination in employment has not been restricted to visits and meetings solely concerned with older workers. It has been, and continues to be, broad-based in order to gain a wide variety of views so that a consensus may be established on how best to tackle the problems of age discrimination in employment. In addition, I have met with, and visited, a variety of organisations concerned with age discrimination and groups of older workers. These include Age Concern, the Third Age Challenge Trust and the Employers Forum on Age. On 27 October 1997, I held a meeting with a range of key figures from business, the lobby and other interested parties. The consultation is continuing into the Spring and I intend to hold another consultation meeting in the near future.

 Discussions are being held between departments, both at official level and at Ministerial level, on all matters relating to non-statutory agreements between the UK Government and the Scottish Executive. In most cases, these discussions are in their early stages in the light of the fact that such agreements cannot be finalised until the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive are established. Parliament will be kept informed of progress on these matters.

<P>

 Waiting time information collected centrally does not show separately those patients waiting for operations. The latest published figures show that, on 30 September 1997, 794 patients were waiting 18 months or more for admission to hospital. We are determined that by the end of March no patients will be required to wait that long.

<a name="80127w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The additional &#163;300 million made available across the Untied Kingdom in the current financial year has helped achieve better joint working between the National Health Service and Social Services Departments. In England alone, there are almost 1,500 initiatives and some &#163;35 to &#163;40 million of the additional money is being transferred to social services. Over the Christmas and New Year period, joint working arrangements between health and social services were greatly improved on previous years.

 The Government regard banning tobacco advertising as the essential first step in building an effective strategy to deal with smoking. However, smoking is too complex an issue and too serious a threat to health for us to rely on a single measure. Controlling tobacco consumption, and ultimately tobacco-related illnesses and deaths, requires a wide range of measures as part of a well thought out overall strategy if we are to have a real impact and see a significant and lasting reduction. A White Paper setting out the Government's tobacco control strategy will be published this year.

 From April 1999, teams of local general practitioners and community nurses will work together in new Primary Care Groups to shape services to patients.

 As we said in the White Paper "The New National Health Service", improved arrangements for commissioning specialised services will be in place by 1 April 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In England, primary care-led commissioning will be undertaken by Primary Care Groups, which will allow better co-ordination of primary care and community services, and better healthcare provision to patients in the locality. National Health Service trusts and Primary Care Groups will be able to use savings from longer term agreements to improve services to patients. In addition, there can be practice-level incentive arrangements associated with the groups' budgets, approved by the health authority.
<P>

<a name="80127w22.html_para1">Redeployment of the general practitioner fundholding Practice Fund Management Allowance will provide about &#163;3 per head of population to support the groups' running costs.

 Discussions are being held between departments, both at official level and at Ministerial level, on all matters relating to non-statutory agreements between the United Kingdom Government and the Scottish Executive. These discussions are in their early stages because such agreements cannot be finalised until the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive are established. Parliament will be kept informed on progress on these matters.

<P>
<a name="80127w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80127w23.html_para0">Recommended daily allowances have been replaced by reference nutrient intakes (RNI). The RNIs and their scientific basis are set out in the Department of Health Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy's 1991 report on dietary reference values.
<P>

<a name="80127w23.html_para1">If average intakes are at or above the RNI, the likelihood of deficiency in any group is small. Therefore, up to 50 per cent. of individuals in any group with adequate dietary intakes may consume less than the RNI. Table 1 gives information on the proportion of adults found in a survey in 1986-87 to have intakes below the RNI for the named nutrients. Vitamin D is not included in the table as there is no RNI for this nutrient in adults under 65 years of age.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 1998]:</i> All fresh meat produced in the UK, and imported into the UK from other EU Member States, must be produced in accordance with harmonised Community rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC. Fresh meat imported from third countries must come only from approved establishments in countries which are authorised by the European Commission to export to the Community. These controls are designed to ensure that the meat satisfies production requirements equivalent to those applying within the Community.
<P>

<a name="80127w24.html_para0">The Government's new unilateral controls to ensure that certain food and feed products do not contain and were not derived from specified risk material (SRM) require products to be certified as such in their country of origin by national veterinary services. Products produced before 1 January and products derived from animals born, reared and slaughtered in Australia or New Zealand, provided they are certified as such, are not subject to the SRM-freedom requirements. All consignments imported into the UK from third countries are checked at designated Border Inspection Posts. EU Single Market rules permit only random spot-checks at destination for imports from member states. Consistent with those rules, a daily sample of randomly selected consignments from EU member states is checked for conformity with the new unilateral controls.
<P>

<a name="80127w24.html_para1">Other checks carried out at places of destination are made by authorised officers from a number of different bodies, including local authorities. It is not, therefore, possible to state precisely how many people are involved in this work at any one time, except at disproportionate cost.

It was noted that the epidemiological evidence is better accounted for by the view that the BSE epidemic is due to the widespread use of animal feed contaminated with the transmissible agent of BSE than by the organophosphate theory. The Committee concluded that experimental evidence would be required to justify further consideration of a role for organophosphates in the epidemiology of BSE.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> I understand that the Commission intend to table an amended Decision to replace 97/534 before its planned coming into force date on 1 April 1998. As part of this process, the Commission have asked the Scientific Steering Committee for advice on a number of issues by the end of January. On the basis of past practice, I would expect the Commission to consider that advice and put proposals for an amended Decision to the Standing Veterinary Committee.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> There is already legislation to control on-farm burial. The Animal By-Products Order 1992, as amended, permits the burial of fallen stock only in certain circumstances and requires burial to be at a depth beyond the reach of carnivorous animals. Under the Water Resources Act 1991, it is an offence to cause or knowingly permit a discharge of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter or solid waste matter into any controlled waters without the proper authority. The European Commission is reviewing the disposal options for fallen stock and may come forward with proposals for further EU legisation.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> EU Directive 90/667, which permits the burial on-farm of fallen stock only in certain circumstances, applies to all Member States.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will review the effectiveness of the Rendering Industry Support Scheme as a means of allowing the knacker/fallen stock trade to provide a low-cost disposal service to the farmer and livestock producers; [25095]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will <i>(a) </i>authorise an immediate review of the costs to the UK economy of the externality and direct costs of the disposal of animal waste and <i>(b)</i> continue the support available via the Rendering Industry Support Scheme currently being phased out until such a review is completed; [25092]
<P>
(3) what levels of financial support have been made available for the last three years and will be available over the next two years to businesses offering a fallen stock collection service to the livestock sectors in each county within the United Kingdom; [25082]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w25.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The objective of the support to the rendering industry was to avoid the disorderly collapse of the meat chain in the immediate aftermath of the BSE crisis. This was achieved. Support of &#163;97 million was first paid under the rendering industry support arrangements in 1996-97 and up to &#163;59 million has been available in 1997-98. The conditions in the spring of 1996 which gave rise to the threat of collapse of the meat chain no longer exist and there are no plans to continue to support for the disposal of animal waste in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="80127w25.html_para1">Following the election, the Government carefully considered representations made by a wide range of interested bodies before confirming the phasing out of support in 1997-98. There are no plans to review the position again. The livestock industry has a great deal to gain from maintaining public confidence in its ability to dispose of its waste in a sustainable manner. I therefore expect it to meet the cost of disposing of fallen stock.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the impact black-market disposal of fallen stock on-farm would have on the traceability measures currently planned to enable the EU to sanction the lifting of the beef export ban. [25089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w25.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 December 1998]:</i> Fallen stock must be disposed of so that they do not enter the human foodchain and there are already measures to prevent such entry from taking place. The computerised database which will be introduced later this year will improve tracing of cattle, including those which die on farm.

<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what assessment he has made of the implications of a dead pit disposal route for fallen stock on the authorities charged with monitoring the quality of private water supplies in rural areas; [25094]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate the risks to (i) environmental, (ii) human and (iii) animal health from uncontrolled on-farm burial schemes of fallen stock; [25087]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the public health and environmental consequences of dead animals being buried on-farm in future. [25080]

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> I would expect local authorities to continue monitoring private water supplies in areas where burial pits are used to dispose of fallen stock. The use of burial pits, and other methods of on-farm burial, is controlled by legislation and reinforced by the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of the Water to avoid contaminating the environment or posing a disease risk.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will list the principles he proposes to apply in restructuring the beef-producing sector in the United Kingdom; and if producers in less favoured areas will continue to be the prime recipients of longer-term support payments; [25245]

<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The aim of our restructuring plan, which will be drawn up in full consultation with the industry, is to help the sector become more efficient, and thus less dependent on subsidies and other support.
<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para0">Our initial thoughts are that it would be appropriate to devise such a plan for both beef and sheep producers. If the plan is successful, it is possible that overall levels of production may decline. The extent to which this happens will reflect producers' decisions rather than those of Government. It is not an objective of the plan deliberately to alter the balance of production as between the less favoured areas (LFA) and non-LFA or as between the dairy herd and the suckler herd.
<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para1">It is no part of our thinking that, by putting such a plan in place, the Government will reduce the need to provide some form of continuing long-term support to hill farmers that recognises the natural handicaps which they face. But, as my right hon. Friend said in his statement to the House on 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>677-79</i>, we do need to look carefully at the way in which such support is provided and to devise ways of enabling that support to achieve positive environmental goals.

confidence or in meeting the terms of the Florence Agreement in order to get the export ban lifted. Expenditure listed under Specified Risk Material Controls is principally concerned with increased controls in slaughterhouses and other meat plants and can properly be regarded as necessary to safeguard public health. The exclusion of meat from animals over thirty months of age from the food chain is a public health measure, but the market support provided in respect of such animals is not, properly speaking, public health expenditure.

<a name="80127w26.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Minister without Portfolio (1) what steps were taken to ensure that the tendering process for the contract awarded to Brand Union conformed with European law; [25548]
<P>
<UL>(2) what is the lower limit for contracts regarding logo design or corporate identity to be placed in the <i>European Journal</i>. [25546]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mandelson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company's legal advice is that there is no requirement for contracts for corporate brand and identity (including logo design) to be advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities. Such contracts fall within Part B of the Public Services Contracts Regulations (SI 1993/3228), the obligations of which, in contracts of this nature, concern technical specifications and post-contract award information. The New Millennium Experience Company has complied with the relevant obligations and, in the case of post-contract award information, will comply when negotiations on contract details are finalised. In the circumstances, the issue of lower limits of contract value and the European Journal</i> do not apply.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w26.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Minister without Portfolio if he will make a statement on the tendering process used for the corporate identity and logo design contract awarded to Brand Union Ltd. [25547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80127w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is required to achieve some &#163;359 million of income from private sponsors, visitors and other commercial income. NMEC's aim, therefore, is to develop a brand and identity, of which a logo is an integral part, which will assist the delivery of that income target.
<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para5">After initial concept work in July and August, the NMEC Board's Executive Committee agreed in September that three companies would be invited to submit logo designs, on the basis that the status, experience and competence of those invited to tender were sufficiently similar to enable proper competition, and that no conflicts of interest arose for the Board or Executive of the NMEC.
<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para6">Two of the three companies invited to do so submitted logo proposals. NMEC's Board decided that those from Brand Union Ltd., which included a comprehensive package of design support, were superior and held the prospect of providing the quality and profile considered essential to assist the achievement of sponsorship and other income targets.
<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para7">However, it was clear that, whichever of the two bidders was chosen, further development work would be needed, both on logo and on overall brand and identity. In November, the Board's Executive Committee agreed that discussions with Brand Union Ltd. should be undertaken with the aim of refining the logo concepts and of establishing favourable contract terms. At this stage, Brand Union's work was shown to me, as Shareholder.
<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para8">Subsequent discussions and negotiations between the company and Brand Union Ltd. concluded with a proposal that NMEC would pay Brand Union &#163;50,000 to finalise 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1998 : Column: 219</I><P>
the logo design, for copyright of the logo, and for work on wider brand and identity. In addition, the company is in discussion with Martin Lambie-Nairn of Brand Union Ltd. over provision of design services to NMEC on all aspects of brand and identity.

<P>

<a name="80127w26.html_para9">On 13 January, NMEC's Chief Executive informed the Millennium Commission, in accordance with the provisions of their Grant Agreement, of its proposed contract arrangements. The Commission confirmed on 16 January that they were content with the decision.
