This is believed to be a direct and positive reflection of lower levels of crime and the introduction of penalty notices for disorder. Furthermore, the same period has seen an appreciable increase in the proportion of cases resulting in conviction. This is partly because of an initiative which means that, in most cases, the CPS has responsibility for deciding whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence and, if so, what that offence should be. The CPS has set performance targets providing for farther improvement in case outcomes in the future and it continues to work with its criminal justice system partners to ensure that these are delivered.</p>

 The OFT considers that the retail banking market works well for consumers if bank charges are transparent, subject to effective competition and consistent with the principle of fairness. The structure of individual banks' charges is a matter for their own judgment, but the OFT may investigate and take appropriate action if there is evidence that charges are incompatible with the requirements of consumer or competition law.</p>

We have also revamped the National Contact Point (NCP) which promotes the guidelines to all stakeholders in the United Kingdom.

 An application for an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992 (TWA) to permit the construction and operation of the proposed Shell Flat offshore wind farm was submitted by Cirrus Energy Ltd. on 31 January 2003. The application proposed that the wind farm would have up to  90 turbines and cover an overall area of 44 square kilometres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="61130w0005.htm_para0"><a name="06113068000338">The application was subject to consultation in accordance with the requirements of the TWA. While the public notices that advertised the TWA application specified a period of approximately six weeks for any representations or objections to be made to the Secretary of State, the process allows the Secretary of State to consider relevant submissions received after the specified date. As a result of the consultation,  15 objections are in place from: the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (holding objection), Blackpool Airport, the Ministry of Defence, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, the Countryside Council for Wales, the Royal Yachting Association, the RSPB, Lancashire Wildlife Trust, Fylde Bird Club, English Nature/Natural England, the Wildlife Trusts, Wyre borough council and three individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="61130w0005.htm_para2"><a name="06113068000340">There are no specific time scales in the TWA process for negotiations with objectors to be undertaken. Where objections to a proposal are received, the Secretary of State is required to take a decision on how to deal with them within 28 days of the final date for submission set out in the public notice. However, the TWA process enables the Secretary of State to extend that decision-making timetable in response to a request from the developer, or at his own discretion, if he feels that objections may be removed as a result of further discussions between the developer and an objector. In the case of Shell Flat, the timetable has been extended on a number of occasions from the original date of  8 April 2003 to 16 December 2006. The decision to extend the timetable has been drawn to the attention of objectors as the extensions have been granted.</p>

 Local authorities can use PFI contracts for any capital intensive projects provided that is the best value for money procurement route. No approval is required from central Government.

Current PFI credit programmes (other than housing) cover schools, waste management, transport (including street lighting, roads and light rail), social services, libraries and leisure services, joint service centres (one-stop shop access to cross-agency services), and police and fire and rescue services.</p>

 There are no plans to ban the use of hydrogenated oils and fats in goods served and sold in school canteens. However, new standards for school food, which began to be introduced from September 2006, will reduce their provision, as part of wider measures to reduce the provision of goods with a high fat content. The current food-based standards for lunch and, from September 2007, for food provided outside lunch, will reduce the provision of many foods which typically contain higher levels of hydrogenated fats and oils. And nutrient-based standards, from September 2008 in primary schools and September 2009 in secondary schools, will specify an upper limit for the proportion of energy to be derived from fat and saturated fat in an average school lunch.</p>

In deciding whether or not to grant parole, the Parole Board is required to consider the Secretary of State&#146;s directions that the board shall consider primarily the risk to the public of a further offence being committed at a time when the prisoner would otherwise be in prison and whether any such risk is acceptable. This must be balanced against the benefit, both to the public and the offender, of early release back into the community under a degree of supervision, which might help rehabilitation and so lessen the risk of re-offending in the future. The board however must take into account that safeguarding the public may often outweigh the benefits to the offender of early release.</p>

 Internationally recognised criteria for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis are routinely used for diagnosis within the national health service through the Health Protection Agency&#146;s Lyme Borreliosis specialist diagnostic service.

If either or both of these reasons applied to a child with epilepsy and it was necessary to assess the child with a view to giving him or her an SEN statement then the child would be assessed and statemented in the same way as other children with SEN. This is provided for by the Education Act 1996 and associated Regulations and set out in the SEN Code of Practice. The assessment arrangements require the local authority to seek written advice from the parents, the school, educational psychologists, health and social services and any others the local authority thinks it is desirable to take advice from.
