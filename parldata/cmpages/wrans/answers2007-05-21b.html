 DFID (and formally the Overseas Development Administration) has been providing substantial core funding to Book Aid International (BAI) for over 30 years. In 2004 BAI were made aware that DFID planned for a phased reduction in its support. However to allow BAI time to continue its efforts to diversify its sources of funding, we agreed, exceptionally, to provide further funding amounting to &#163;0.85 million over three years in support of their three-year business plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70521w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07052114000135">This time-bound grant funding has now come to an end. However, we have in the past few years regularly encouraged BAI to apply for DFID funding that is available to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) through our Civil Society Challenge Fund and Partnership Programme Agreements. While we recognise that there is strong competition among NGOs for the resources available we do hope that BAI will apply.</p>

We believe that BAI&#146;s knowledge and experience of books provision and library services in Africa after many years of DFID funding will continue to help Governments develop library and information services, and that they will remain an important development partner in the region.</p>

 There are six staff within DFID who are currently between postings.

In the meantime, they will be engaged on short-term, temporary or project work which makes best use of their skills and knowledge, and which reduces the need to use agency staff or consultants.</p>

 At the core of DFID&#146;s mission is a commitment to support developing countries to realise the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Action on child hunger and malnutrition is reflected in the first goal. Much current bilateral and multilateral aid will impact positively on child nutrition, investment in education, primary health care, water and sanitation, job creation, and rural livelihoods. DFID multilateral contributions in 2005-06 which impact positively on child nutrition include contributions to the UN Development Programme (UNDP)&#151;&#163;52.7 million, UNICEF&#151;&#163;32.4 million, World Food Programme&#151;&#163;5 million, and to the Food and Agricultural Organisation&#151;&#163;4.8 million.</p>

 No detailed assessment has been made of the potential impact on biodiversity of trends in the numbers of common species of moths. Recent research indicates that more species of common moths are in decline than are increasing in numbers, probably largely due to changes in land use and the effects of climate change. The roles that moths play in the functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity are known to be significant, because moths are generally abundant, and they have important food chain links with plants, bats and birds.</p>

The results of the research indicated that the Path generated about &#163;307 million a year for the region&#146;s economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70521w0002.htm_para4"><a name="07052114000338">We are currently considering Natural England&#146;s report on coastal access and will shortly launch a public consultation document inviting views on ways for improving access. On the same day, we will publish a partial regulatory impact assessment and the research study which we commissioned looking at the benefits and costs of each of the options. The research includes an assessment of the benefits to local economies and levels of expenditure by people using a number of the national trails.</p>

 The Nightwear (Safety) Regulations 1985 apply to nightwear including garments commonly worn as nightwear such as nightdresses, dressing gowns, bath robes and similar items. Children&#146;s pyjamas do not have to comply with the flammability standard of the regulations, but they must carry a permanent label with the wording &#145;Keep Away From Fire&#146; in red letters if they do not. The regulations do not distinguish between boys' and girls' pyjamas, and are already the most stringent in Europe&#151;most member states have no legislation in this area. There are no current plans, therefore, to review these regulations. In addition, manufacturers of clothing, including pyjamas, that do not meet the flammability standard of the regulations have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe under The General Product Safety Regulations 2005. Taken together, these regulations provide adequate flammability safety for children's nightwear in the UK.</p>

Following Management Board approval, my endorsement of the proposal in December 2002, and TU Consultation, an Invitation To Tender (ITT) was, therefore, issued. Flagship Training, based at HMS Collingwood won the competition.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 10 May 2007]:</i> Mobile phone theft is a key driver for robbery. The Government, police and industry have developed a strong partnership which has been working together to tackle escalating mobile phone theft. The Mobile Phone Crime Reduction Charter was launched by industry leaders in July 2006 and successfully achieved its target of blocking stolen handsets within 48 hours, meaning they will no longer work in the UK. The Government and Metropolitan police fund a National Mobile Phone Crime Unit to provide a national centre of excellence and operational support around the country. We have robust legislation in place to target criminals who re-programme stolen handsets.</p>

 The Planning Inspectorate does not maintain statistics of the volume of letters received from interested persons about appeals but estimates that these number approximately 135,000 per year.

The Government recognise that there is concern that the availability of information about the sex of their foetus could lead some women to seek an abortion if the foetus is of a particular sex. However, there is no evidence that this is happening in the United Kingdom. The grounds on which abortion may lawfully be carried out are set out in the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended). These do not include foetal sex alone.

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
4. The time waited groupings are mutually exclusive. To calculate the total or percentage for e.g. those waiting over three months, the values for &#145;Over three to six months&#146;, &#145;Over six months to one year&#146; and &#145;Over one year&#146; should be added together.<br>
5. A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
6. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &#147;all operations count of episodes&#148; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>
7. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
8. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

The &#147;Certified Normal Accommodation&#148; is the uncrowded capacity of the establishment. Operational capacity is the total number of prisoners that an establishment can hold taking into account control, security and the proper operation of the planned regime. It is determined by operational managers on the basis of operational judgment and experience. Within the private prison estate the CNA is built into the contract and defined as available prisoner places. When the prison exceeds the CNA up to a pre-agreed level (Operational Capacity) these extra places are defined as &#145;Additional Prisoner Places&#146; and is achieved by overcrowding.<br>

 The extension to the FAS announced in March means that we will be helping many more members over a greater length of time. Because of the extension the payment assessment rules may need to be revised to help ensure we determine FAS payments consistently for all members. We intend to ensure that the cap retains its value, even where assessments are made for members who will not be eligible for payment until many years into the future. We are looking at the best way to achieve this objective and details will be published in draft regulations for consultation.</p>

 There are two ASW pension schemes that qualify for the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS). FAS cannot make annual payments at 80 per cent. until the ASW pension schemes have completed the wind up process. In the meantime, initial payments at 60 per cent. of expected core pension are being made to 31 members of the ASW Pension Plan (Cardiff) and three members of the ASW Sheerness Steel Group Pension Fund. The current Pensions Bill will raise the level at which initial payments are made to 80 per cent. with immediate effect from Royal Assent. No payments are being made at the rates of 80 per cent., 65 per cent. and 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70521w0029.htm_para18"><a name="07052133001622">As FAS payments commence at age 65, (except in special circumstances where early access to payments can be applied for by scheme trustees for terminally ill qualifying members or to the survivor of a qualifying member), under the current scheme no-one would be expected to start receiving payments at the rate of 65 per cent. or 50 per cent. until at least 15 May 2011 or 15 May 2015 respectively. However our announcement of increased funding for FAS will ensure that by then all will receive 80 per cent.</p>

 Fatal and non-fatal accidents in industries for which the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the enforcing authority, including agriculture, are reportable under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR).

 The Health and Safety Executive has undertaken a thorough investigation of the fire at Sonae (UK) Ltd. on 20 February 2007 and has determined that this fire was caused by the catastrophic failure of either a mechanical seal or an impeller on pump number two in the thermal oil manifold room. This resulted in hot oil being discharged into the manifold room and the oil was ignited when it came into contact with a hot surface, either the handle on one of the pump valves or the impeller casing. Sonae's fire precautions were effective in limiting the consequences of the fire, despite the existence of a previously unknown void between the wall of the manifold room and the external cladding. The damage to the plant control room resulted from smoke and hot gases breaching this void, although such damage was limited to plant and equipment. There was no loss of life or injury.</p>

 1. Original planned completion date and originally planned completion costs are the date and costs agreed to by the relevant departmental management committee at the time the project or programme passed through Gate zero (or an equivalent process) of the Department's governance procedures. We expect these to change as costs and timelines become clearer through the lifetime of the project. We continually review costs at the appropriate governance points to ensure that they continue to deliver value for money.<br>
 2. The costs above represent the costs of implementing the particular project and programme. Costs of running the solutions implemented by the projects and programmes are not included above as they are more than compensated for by the savings they generate. These savings are demonstrated in the recent NAO report &#147;The Efficiency programme: A Second Review of Progress&#148;.<br>
 3. In addition to the above projects and programmes Electronic Registered Files is undertaking a pilot and a review of this project will be carried out once the pilot is completed.<br>
 4. When first conceived the Pensions Transformation Programme was to be funded by way of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) arrangement. During the early stages of development, best practice for financing the programme indicated that PFI was no longer the appropriate financing method and thus it was decided to use departmental funds. Financing the development using departmental funds has the effect of increasing the development costs of the programme while reducing the operating cost of the programme by a similar amount. Thus the actual amount of money committed to the programme is broadly the same.<br>
 5. The Child Support Agency Operational Improvement Plan is a business recovery programme and is not a change project in the normal sense of the word. The focus of the programme is the organisational and operational restructuring of the Agency to deliver significant performance improvements and get more money to parents, it specifically aims to tackle the key area of debt, compliance and enforcement. Over a three year period the programme will design, develop and implement, process and organisational change underpinned by continuing remediation of existing computer systems and the introduction of further IT enhancements.<br>

 The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="70521w0031.htm_para0"><a name="07052133001883"><i> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated 21 May 2007:</i></p>
<a name="70521w0031.htm_brev0"><a name="07052133002121"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of mystery shopper exercises at Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev1"><a name="07052133002122"><ul><p class="tabletext">Mystery Shopping is an established method, used by thousands of businesses across the UK, to provide an independent assessment of customer service. It is an important way in which Jobcentre Plus assesses the service it provides to customers, but it is not the only approach used. For example, the Average Actual Clearance Times target measures customer service in terms of benefit clearance times and Jobcentre Plus also conducts customer surveys and acts upon feedback received from individuals, partners and other stakeholders.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev2"><a name="07052133002123"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Mystery Shopping programme is one part of the Customer Service Target, which measures performance against the Jobcentre Plus Service Standards. It includes measures of the quality of service provided in key face to face and telephone contacts. The timing of calls to sites is random and can be at any time during business hours so staff do not know when they may be visited or called. Results from the Mystery Shopping Programme are published on the Jobcentre Plus website.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev3"><a name="07052133002124"><ul><p class="tabletext">The effectiveness of the Mystery Shopping Programme is regularly assessed within Jobcentre Plus and with the contracted supplier, GfK. The assessment process includes listening to telephone calls and carrying out a series of six accompanied visits per quarter with the independent assessors. This may result in changes to the wording of particular questions to increase clarity and understanding. In addition, when new programmes are introduced, or in response to customer or stakeholder feedback, new scenarios may be developed to test staff knowledge. As a result of these reviews the number and range of scenarios used by the independent assessors was gradually increased in 2006/07.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev4"><a name="07052133002125"><ul><p class="tabletext">Results from the mystery shopping programme are used to identify areas for improvement and where further learning and development may be required, either nationally or in particular sites. In the first quarter of 2006/07 national Customer Service Target performance was 1.2 percentage points below profile and, to address this, a number of measures were put in place that had been identified by the Mystery Shopping process. These included the introduction of an A to Z guidance tool which provides information on the policies and programmes that customers (or mystery shoppers) may enquire about, which we expect our staff to understand.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev5"><a name="07052133002126"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is still Jobcentre Plus' intention to provide feedback to sites at the earliest opportunity, via the supplier's (GfK) website. Feedback is an important part of mystery shopping as it helps staff and managers to understand where they need to do better in the service they provide dealing with customer enquiries. It enables Business Delivery Unit/District Performance Managers to identify local learning and development needs, or other remedial action, to ensure that the best possible service is maintained for all customers.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev6"><a name="07052133002127"><ul><p class="tabletext">For 2007/08 further changes have been introduced to strengthen and improve the &#147;mystery&#148; element by further increasing the number and range of scenarios, varying the way the questions are asked and changing the way feedback is provided.</p>
</ul><a name="70521w0031.htm_brev7"><a name="07052133002128"><ul><p class="tabletext">I hope this is helpful.</p>

 On 30 March I signed this convention on behalf of the United Kingdom at a signature ceremony organised by the United Nations at its New York headquarters. A total of 92 countries, nearly half of all UN member states, have now signed the convention.

Our signature of the convention signifies the UK's strong support for human rights at home and abroad and our intention to ratify the convention without undue delay.</p>
