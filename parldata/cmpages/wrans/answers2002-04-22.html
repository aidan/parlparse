To ask the Solicitor-General if she will list the functions of her Department that have been <i>(a)</i> market tested and <i>(b)</i> outsourced in each of the last five years, specifying the (i) money saving and (ii) percentage saving in each case.  [42987]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> In relation to the Departments for which the Attorney-General is responsible, the answer is as follows:
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para0"><i>Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para1">The CPS has not conducted any formal market testing activity in the last five years.
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para2">The CPS has, however, let a major contract for the provision of IT services under private finance initiative (PFI) principles in December 2001. The service provision is due to commence in April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para3"><i>Treasury Solicitor's Department</i>
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para4">In March 1999 a new cleaning contract was awarded by the Treasury Solicitor's Department following a competitive tendering exercise. Another contract was let, after a further tendering exercise, for the Department's security guarding function in December 1999, as a consequence of the withdrawal of the previous (public sector) supplier. There were no cost savings in either case.
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para5"><i>Serious Fraud Office</i>
<P>

<a name="20422w01.html_para6">In the last five years the Serious Fraud Office has market tested and outsourced IT, telecoms and off-site storage services. The remaining information requested could be provided only by the individual consideration of all relevant finance files for the last five years. This would involve disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Within the Ministry of Defence the policy for additional compensation to civil servants for hours worked in excess of normal conditioned hours differs depending on the grade of the employee and the duties that they routinely perform. The authorisation of overtime working has been delegated to responsible line managers and their associated finance staff.
<P>

<a name="20422w02.html_para2">Senior civil servants are not eligible for overtime payments. A few senior non-industrial staff are classed as non-overtime grades, but are entitled to payments for long hours once a monthly threshold of 10 hours has been passed. Other non-industrial and industrial staff are entitled to overtime payments normally on the basis of time and a half for Monday to Saturday overtime working, and double time for attendance on Sundays and public and bank holidays. Although not obliged to do so, staff are encouraged to take time off in lieu.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> The Government welcome the principles of EU trading to encourage European industry to gain early experience of trading in advance of international trading under the Kyoto protocol. The Commission's proposal for a EU emissions trading scheme does differ in some respects from the UK scheme; one significant difference is that the Commission's proposal is for a mandatory scheme whereas the UK scheme is voluntary. The Government are working with the Commission and other member states during the negotiation process to develop a less rigid emissions trading scheme for the EU that takes account of existing national trading arrangements and provides for them to run their course. It has always been the Government's intention that the transition between the UK scheme and any EU or international trading scheme will be as seamless as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w03.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> Although the Government recognise that carbon sinks can provide environmental and other benefits, they believe that the UK's current priority should be actual emissions reductions, rather than carbon sequestration (either as sinks or storage) because of the complexities and uncertainties involved in forestry projects and other carbon sinks. For the time being, therefore, sinks and forest sequestration projects are not eligible for entry into the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. This approach to sinks and sequestration will be kept under review.

 The UK Emissions Trading Scheme went live on 2 April with the opening of the innovative, web-based Emissions Trading Registry, which records the transfer of allowances from buyer to seller. A number of trades have already taken place.
<P>

<a name="20422w03.html_para1">A total of 34 organisations successfully joined the Scheme through a competitive auction held in March. In return for taking on legally binding emissions reduction targets, these organisations will each receive a share of the financial incentive that the Government are making available over the five years of the Scheme. They can choose to meet their annual targets by reducing emissions themselves or by buying surplus allowances from other participating organisations. To date, over 50 other organisations have opened trading accounts so that they can buy and sell allowances.
<P>

<a name="20422w03.html_para2">We expect the volume of trades and number of participants to increase in the autumn and beyond when participation in the Scheme widens as some of the 6,000 companies in Climate Change Agreements begin buying allowances to enable them to meet their targets or selling any over-achievement to other participants. Projects that produce quantified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will also be able, in time and subject to prior approval from the Government, to earn credits that can then be traded through the Scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> Direct participants in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme are currently in the process of having their baseline emissions independently verified by organisations accredited for this specific purpose by the UK Accreditation Service. These independent verification organisations will provide the Government with a verified baseline (an average of emissions in 1998&#150;2000 unless there are regulatory requirements to take into account) for each direct participant. Once they have done so, the Government will make the baseline emissions for each direct participant publicly available.

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> Three direct participants (DuPont UK Ltd, Ineos Fluor Ltd and Rhodia Organique Fine Ltd) in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme are subject to regulation under Integrated Pollution Control, and two (British Petroleum plc and Shell UK Ltd) that are subject to the Department of Trade and Industry's flare consent regime. The terms of these regulatory requirements under IPC are already available on the public register at the following local Environment Agency offices: Coverdale House, York for DuPont, Richard Fairclough House, Warrington for Ineos Fluor and Rivers House, Bridgewater for Rhodia. The 2002 flare consents for British Petroleum installations and fields in the Emissions Trading Scheme allow 1,132.55 thousand standard cubic metres of natural gas flared per day. For Shell, the comparable number is 698.17 thousand standard cubic metres of natural gas flared per day.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps are being taken to develop mechanisms <i>(a)</i> to prevent an increase in GM presence in conventional seeds and produce and <i>(b)</i> to prevent GM contamination of organic seeds and produce; and with whom this responsibility lies.  [46622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The European Union has agreed interim measures to limit adventitious presence of approved GMOs in non-GM seeds to 0.5 per cent. More specific proposals are under discussion within the European Union. These would set cross-pollination thresholds ranging from 0.3 per cent. to 0.7 per cent. (depending on the species) in seed, in order broadly to keep GM presence in the resulting produce below the 1 per cent. threshold set for food. The Government are also considering what measures might be required to facilitate the co-existence of ordinary (non-seed) GM and non-GM crops and who should be responsible for such measures. For seed production, the grower of the seed crop is normally responsible for observing rules to achieve the desired level of seed purity. With organic seeds and produce, as with conventional seeds and produce, it is not possible to guarantee that GM cross-pollination will not occur, but we would like to aim for the lowest practical level, bearing in mind relevant factors, including the need to protect non-GM produce, the views of stakeholders, the practicalities of detection at low levels, and the costs involved.

The consultation on the development of this strategy&#151;Towards a National Ambient Noise Strategy&#151;closed on 15 March this year, the results of which will be published in due course. A significant contribution to the development of the strategy will be the determination of exposure to environmental noise through noise mapping. The London borough of Havering will be considered in this exercise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK ceased all sea dumping of radioactive waste in 1982, and all sea dumping of industrial waste in 1992. The only material now licensed for disposal at sea is dredged sediment from ports, harbours etc., and small amounts of fish waste. All such disposal is rigorously controlled under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 to ensure that the marine environment and ecosystems are protected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w05.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 All radioactive discharges from the UK are within national and international dose constraints. The UK has made substantial progress in reducing these discharges over the last 25 years. Discharges now are less than 1 per cent. of what they were then. In making these reductions we have concentrated on the most harmful radionuclides. However, we accept that more needs to be done to deliver further reductions.
<P>

The UK consulted about its draft strategy in June 2000 and we intend to publish the final version in time to meet the July 2002 deadline. Copies of the strategy will be placed in the House of Commons Library. We have also consulted on draft guidance to the Environment Agency which will help ensure that decisions on discharge authorisations for nuclear licensed sites in England are consistent with the UK strategy.

<P>
<a name="20422w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Most rhinoceros species are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This means that international trade in wild-taken rhinos and their products is prohibited. The UK goes further, however, in that it has banned trade in all raw rhino horn from whatever source.
<P>

<a name="20422w05.html_para2">My officials have contacted the CITES Secretariat who confirm that although there are reports of an increase in poaching in general in Zimbabwe, they do not have any detailed information to support this. While there may be an increased risk of poaching, there is as yet no evidence to indicate that this is leading to a decline in rhino populations. We will keep the situation under review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In June 1997 the Prime Minister set a target for all local authorities in the UK to adopt Local Agenda 21 strategies by the year 2000. A Government Office survey showed that 93 per cent. of local authorities met this target.
<P>

<a name="20422w05.html_para3">The Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on local authorities to prepare a community strategy for promoting or improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area and contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom.

 The Department has conducted a consultation exercise on the proposals put forward by the Lead Shot Legislation (England) Review Group. Over 1,800 consultation papers were issued. The response rate was low. The report contained proposals for some changes to the site list in Schedule 1 of the Lead Shot Legislation 1999, removing some sites not considered important for waterfowl and adding others which were considered important. It also contained proposals for the removal of Common Snipe and Golden Plover from Schedule 2. No respondents disagreed with the recommendations.

<P>

<a name="20422w05.html_para6">In respect of sulphur dioxide, the most significant emissions reductions in recent years have come about as a result of changes in industrial practices as well as the regulatory controls we have imposed. We estimate, for example, that fuel switching from coal to gas in power stations (which began in 1992&#150;93) has reduced sulphur dioxide emissions by one million tonnes from what it might otherwise have been. We also estimate that the fitting of flue gas desulphurisation to two large coal power stations in 1993&#150;94 has reduced emissions by 0.2 million tonnes; and that the use of lower-sulphur coal has reduced emissions by about 0.15 million tonnes.In respect of particles and oxides of nitrogen, the most significant contribution has come from the reductions in road transport emissions which are largely the result of the progressively tighter European Union standards for new motor vehicles and fuels. The introduction of three way catalysts on petrol vehicles in the early 1990s, for example, is estimated to have reduced emissions of oxides of nitrogen in 1999 by about 30 per cent. compared to what emissions might otherwise have been. Improvements in diesel vehicle technology have also made a significant contribution to reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particles. The UK Government have helped to incentivise the early uptake of clean fuels (such as ultra-low-sulphur diesel and petrol) by setting preferential duty rates for them.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has no strategy to encourage members of its staff to become justices of the peace. However, in accordance with section 50 of the Employee Rights Act 1996 (ERA), Heads of Department may grant special paid leave to officers required to attend court as justices of the peace. No central records are kept of which staff have been appointed to such positions, nor of leave granted to enable them to fulfil their duties.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer of 6 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 341W, on catering services, for what reason there were increases from 1999 to 2000 of &#163;44,767.18 and &#163;6,935.57 in the costs of in-house canteen services and catering services, respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w07.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The increase of &#163;44,767.18 was largely due to the refurbishment and redecoration of the staff restaurant in our London offices at the start of 2000, involving the purchase of new catering equipment (freezers, cold counter and dishwasher), carpets and furniture. In addition, subsidies paid to catering contractors increased by &#163;6,800 per annum in our East Kilbride office and by &#163;7,300 per annum in London. The increase of &#163;6,935.57 in catering services was a result of greater usage of hospitality services (i.e. teas, coffees, buffets etc.) on offer at both locations, principally as a result of the contractors advertising the facility more widely, coupled with a sharp increase in the number of meetings being held in both locations.

 The latest survey of violent crime is contained in the 2001 British Crime Survey, which indicated that violent crime fell by 19 per cent. between 1999 and 2000. Recent recorded crime statistics produced by the Metropolitan Police show a rise in recorded street robbery. That is why we have launched an initiative aimed at reducing the level of street crime in the 10 areas of England and Wales with the highest levels of street robbery. The programmes will focus on curbing the rise in street robberies and the number of illegally held weapons, as well as the adoption of fast track prosecutions to ensure that offenders are brought to justice speedily. The budget contained &#163;180 million in new money and a further &#163;100 million to be drawn from the Criminal Justice Reserve. These funds will be used for extra police, extra support staff, an increase in police operations and an additional 2,300 additional prison and remand places.

It involves the police in targeting offenders who commit robbery, snatch theft, carjacking and offences involving the illegal possession and use of firearms. The criminal justice'agencies will prioritise these cases to ensure that those taken off the streets by the police are dealt with quickly and effectively from arrest to disposal in specially designated street crime courts in each area. We have also strengthened the powers of the courts in the 10 areas by introducing electronic

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> The Department has not commissioned research into alternative glass suppliers. However through contacts with glass manufacturers the Department has been informed that there are at least three companies supplying types of glass in the UK that enable window manufacturers to achieve the technical performance standards of Part L of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/2531) as amended by the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3335).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w12.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> S.I. 2002/440 does not set any technical standards. It enables self-certification by prescribed persons for certain types of building work. With regard to windows, S.I. 2002/440 introduces a new Building Regulation that enables members of the Fenestration Self-Assessment (FENSA) Scheme to self-certify their installation work complies with the applicable technical requirements. FENSA members may certify that work consisting only of the installation, as a replacement, of a window, rooflight, roof window or door in an existing building complies with regulation 4 of the Building Regulations. This regulation requires that the work complies with the applicable requirements of Schedule 1 of those regulations (S.I. 2000/2531, as amended by S.I. 2001/3335).
<P>

<a name="20422w12.html_para6">For building work comprising replacing windows guidance on compliance with the Building Regulations is given in Approved Documents L1 and L2.

<P>
<a name="20422w12.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the total estimated compliance costs are to <i>(a)</i> local authorities, <i>(b)</i> builders of new homes and <i>(c)</i> all installations of new windows in existing houses of Statutory Instrument No. 440 Regulation 16A; and what the average individual cost will be of applying for building regulation permission to comply with S.I. 440.  [51431]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w12.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> In the regulatory impact analysis we undertook prior to laying the regulations, we considered that there would be no cost to local authorities from the introduction of S.I. 2002&#150;440, as the provisions effectively relieve them of the burden of enforcement through building control. The builders of new homes will similarly not face a cost as the provisions deal solely with the installation of windows, and gas, solid fuel and oil-fired appliances, and plumbing in existing buildings. The cost for all installations of new windows in existing buildings through the need for installers to obtain membership of the fenestration self-assessment scheme was estimated at &#163;1,715,000 against savings of &#163;91,885,000 in the first year There will be no cost for applying for building regulation permission, as none of those registered with these schemes is required to give a building notice and pay a fee, in relation to carrying out work for which they are registered, and which is permitted not to be notified in the circumstances prescribed in the S.I.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what enforcement measures will be taken against those who do not comply with S.I. 440.  [51432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w12.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> The only offence created by S.I. 440 would be the failure of a person registered with the fenestration self-assessment scheme, not more than 10 days after the building work has been completed, to give a local authority a notice to that effect, or a certificate as evidence that the requirements of regulations 4 and 7 of the Building Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 2531) have been satisfied. Local authorities can prosecute any person that contravenes any provision contained in the building regulations under Section 35 of the Building Act 1984.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> No. S.I. 440 introduces a new building regulation that enables members of the fenestration self-assessment scheme to self-certify their installation work complies with the building regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w12.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> The Department is aware of at least three companies supplying hard-coat thermally efficient glass in the UK. There are also several other international flat glass manufacturers that might seek to trade in the UK depending upon how the market develops. There is therefore no need to put in place anti-monopoly measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The means test for disabled facilities grant makes a careful assessment of an applicant's resources and expenditure needs in order to calculate whether he is in a position to contribute towards any required adaptation to the property. The Government think that this test is fair and reasonable and because demand for DFG is very high it ensures that help goes to those most in need. Many of the detailed allowances used in the assessment are updated annually and SI 2002 No.530, which came into force on 1 April, makes the necessary changes which will be applicable for the year 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<a name="20422w13.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Local planning authorities have powers under section 97 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to make orders to revoke or modify a planning permission, prior to it being implemented, where they consider it expedient to do so. If an order is opposed, it has to be confirmed by the Secretary of State before it can take effect.
<P>

<a name="20422w13.html_para2">The Secretary of State also has powers, under section 100 of the Act, to revoke a planning permission granted by a local planning authority. However, the Secretary of State will generally use this power only if the original decision is judged to be grossly wrong, so that damage is likely to be done to the wider public interest.
<P>

<a name="20422w13.html_para3">Under section 102 of the Act, local planning authorities also have power to make an order, requiring that any use of land be discontinued or continued subject to conditions or that any buildings or works shall be altered or removed. Such an order will not take effect unless it is confirmed by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20422w13.html_para4">Section 104 of the Act gives the Secretary of State powers to make discontinuance orders himself.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The trunk road network is the national system of routes for through traffic. The Highways Agency manages this network in England on behalf of the Secretary of State. There is no definition of a strategic route but we identified a core network of nationally important trunk routes in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England" published in July 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w14.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 In recent months officials from both the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and the Social Exclusion Unit have participated in discussions held by the Commission for Integrated Transport involving the transport industry. These discussions have covered a number of issues including concessionary fares for those under 18. Both the SEU and CfIT will report later this year.
<P>

<a name="20422w14.html_para2">Free travel is provided under the education acts for school children living more than the statutory walking distances from school. Separately, school age children are often allowed half-fare travel, either funded by local authorities or by transport operators on a commercial basis&#151;usually on all journeys they make, not just to and from school or college. Many transport operators offer discounted fares to "Jobseekers". In addition, the Department for Education and Skills is developing the Connexions Card which will offer a range of commercial discounts for all 16&#150;19 year olds. The card will be capable of carrying existing travel concessions and is expected to be available nationally from autumn 2002.

 Our ports policy paper, "Modern Ports&#151;A UK Policy", published in November 2000, recognised that it is important to have a clear overall picture of trends affecting the ports industry, and especially of the potential need for new port development. We said that the Government will consider with the industry and other interests how to benchmark port performance and best practice methods. We are discussing with the ports industry how this can be taken forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the changes to <i>(a)</i> cost and <i>(b)</i> coverage of the proposed pension credit if the withdrawal rate of the savings credit were (i) 10 per cent., (ii) 22 per cent. and (iii) 25 per cent.  [20296]<P>

<a name="20422w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> The Savings Credit is designed specifically to reward pensioners with low or modest second pensions or savings. Setting the Savings Credit rate at 60 per cent. strikes the right balance between affordability and the objective of helping pensioners at the lower end of the income scale. As illustrated in the table, below increasing the rate of the Savings Credit to 90 per cent. would require an additional &#163;2 billion for a full year. It would also mean the Pension Credit would be payable to single pensioners with incomes over &#163;300 per week (nearly &#163;16,000 per year) and over &#163;430 for pensioner couples (around &#163;22,500).

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many members of staff at his Department are justices of the peace; and if he has a strategy for his Department to encourage members of staff to become justices of the peace.  [44554]<P>

<P>
<a name="20422w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Information on the members of staff who are justices of the peace is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Section 50 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA) requires employers to allow their staff reasonable time off for public duties. The civil service code (para 9.2.5) requires Departments and agencies to allow time off for attending these duties. Responsibility for the decision- making, in relation to attendance, for such activities has been delegated to local managers within the Department.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The Department continuously commissions tightly focused market research to help develop and evaluate advertising and publicity campaigns. This research will often focus on views of customers about its services.
<P>

<a name="20422w19.html_para6">For example in 2001&#150;02, campaigns where strategic communications research or creative development research have been commissioned include the drive to widen participation in Higher Education; the promotion of the relevance of science to teenagers, as part of Science Year, the child care recruitment campaign; the campaign to help those adults with basic skills gaps; and the promotion of foundation degrees and modern apprenticeships.
<P>

<a name="20422w19.html_para7">It is seldom possible to publish the findings of this type of research as these projects test creative work commissioned from advertising agencies as part of the development of the publicity campaigns and are regarded as commercial-in-confidence. This research is subject to the usual strict rules that spending must represent good value for the taxpayer and must not be used for party political purposes.
<P>

<a name="20422w19.html_para8">The Department also conducts research to help us understand the education, skills and communication needs of our customers. It has sampled and consulted on the views of teachers, parents and other groups affected by the Department's policies on specific issues. For example the project "Causes of truancy by pupils of compulsory school age" gathers the views of pupils, parents, school and LEA staff on the causes of truancy and what measures could be taken to address the issue. One of the aims is to examine the issue of absence that is condoned by parents. "A longitudinal study of factors contributing to variations in teacher effectiveness" will investigate the factors which contribute to the effectiveness of teachers at different stages of their career, working in a range of schools in different contexts, and how this changes over time. Part of this study is to track 300 teachers over three years measuring their effectiveness by pupil outcome measures and other qualitative techniques. Again it would not be possible to give details of every project without disproportionate costs.

children and young people. We arranged a consultation day with pupils on 5 November 2001 on the Education White Paper and our consultation on the 14&#150;19 Green Paper which started in February includes a young persons' document and events with young people. Most Connexions Partnerships are successfully involving young people in the design, delivery and evaluation of the service. The views of young people are also gathered through the millennium volunteers national and regional fora. We will build on these examples to promote consultation with children and young people across the Department's activities.

<P>
<a name="20422w20.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 It is not the role of the Department to decide when and where to build new schools. Local Education Authorities (LEAs) have a duty to ensure that there are sufficient school places available for children in their area. To help identify where additional places are needed, LEAs are required to produce annually a locally agreed School Organisation Plan which sets the context for the provision of school places over a five year period. Where Authorities can demonstrate a need for additional places, they can apply for capital funding support from the Department in the form of a basic need allocation. Since 2000&#150;01, Lancashire LEA has received basic need allocations in respect of 587 secondary school places. It is, however, for the LEA to decide how best to use these allocations in line with the locally agreed priorities identified in its Asset Management Plan. Any proposal to establish a new school would be made and decided locally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to the answer of 19 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 257W, on IT contracts, whether the competition being run by Becta to accredit ICT suppliers for schools will take into account the ease for schools of changing between those suppliers.

<a name="20422w20.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Accredited Service Suppliers initiative will not put in place a framework contract and hence schools will create their own formal contract arrangements with suppliers. However, all Becta accredited NGfL service suppliers will be governed by a code of conduct, which will ensure that suppliers do not impose unreasonable terms and conditions on schools and other educational customers. Part of this code of conduct will cover arrangements for termination of contracts. Rigorous monitoring of accredited supplier performance will be undertaken by Becta and accreditation will be publicly withdrawn from suppliers who do not work within the code of conduct.

<P>
<a name="20422w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> The Connexions card is a smart card designed to encourage young people to continue in learning beyond 16. Young people can collect points every time they attend a learning session, which can then be redeemed for a wide range of rewards and "money can't buy" opportunities&#151;for example, going behind the scenes at a pop concert or attending a top sporting event. Cardholders will also receive on-the-spot discounts in a wide range of high street shops.
<P>

<a name="20422w20.html_para3">The Department has developed the Connexions card through a public private partnership with Capita who are providing the technological and commercial infrastructure to support the initiative. The fact that the card and its infrastructure are smart means that it is capable of taking on more functions such as helping a school or local education authority validate the payment of education maintenance allowances or an e-purse for cashless catering.
<P>

<a name="20422w20.html_para4">The card is currently being rolled out region by region and will be available across England from autumn 2002.

<P>
<a name="20422w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Section 13 of the Education Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) sets out the general responsibility of the local education authority to provide primary, secondary and further education to meet the needs of the population of the area concerned, exclusive of the duties of further and higher education funding councils. This section applies to all children in the area of the local authority concerned, except that none of the LEA's duties under the 1996 Act applies in respect of any person who is in custody because of a court order or an order of recall made by my right hon.

It imposes a duty on the LEA to secure that sufficient nursery education for children who have not attained compulsory school age is provided for their area, whether or not by the LEA. However, section 562 of the Education Act 1996 provides that none of the LEA's duties under that Act are to apply in respect of any person in custody because of a court order or because of an order of recall made by my right hon.

 We are making a substantial investment in FE. We are putting an extra &#163;237 million into the sector in 2002&#150;03 alone, a 3 per cent. real terms increase. Total funding per student has gone up by 16 per cent. in real terms since 1997. For the academic year 2002&#150;03 the Learning and Skills Council is raising its funding rates for courses delivered by FE sector colleges by 2.5 per cent. in cash terms, the highest increase for years. The Government remains committed to bringing up the level of funding for colleges towards that of schools. We are looking to the current spending review to secure the resources colleges need to deliver our ambitious agenda for FE, and thereby to bring up funding levels.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the cost to public sector pension schemes of the House of Lords' ruling in February 2001 on the pension rights of part-time workers.  [50035]<P>

<P>
<a name="20422w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 It is difficult to estimate precisely the numbers of part-timers eligible for retrospective access to public service schemes. But on the basis of estimates that up to 60,000 part-timers may be granted access, the resulting increase in the present value of public service pension liabilities may lie in the range of &#163;0.5 to &#163;1 billion. These pension liabilities will be payable over a period in excess of 40 years.

 In terms of business creation, the Greater London area continues to out-perform other UK regions. Recent figures show that the number of VAT registrations in London per 10,000 residents is 65 compared with a UK average of 39. However, as in all regions, the level of small business activity varies markedly across Greater London.
<P>

<a name="20422w24.html_para1">Small firms in London have access to a range of national and local policies and programmes designed to support new and small businesses. These include financial support (through schemes such as the Small Firms' Loan Guarantee Scheme) and business advice and guidance. The London Regional Venture Capital Fund will be up-and-running shortly provided &#163;50 million of investment for small firms with growth potential.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 11 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 576W, on heavily indebted poor countries, if he will estimate the proportion of the additional $50 billion per annum which would be devoted to debt relief, broken down by country.  [51278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20422w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The cost of achieving the International Development Targets has been estimated at an additional US$50 billion per annum, equivalent to a doubling of current global aid. The commitment by the US and EU is a major step towards meeting the requirements for this additional US$50 billion; there has not yet been full commitment to deliver the entire amount, nor decisions made on how such an amount could be delivered if the total was achieved.
<P>

<a name="20422w24.html_para2">Debt reduction under the HIPC initiative can therefore be only one element of the additional finance required. Both the US and EU have yet to decide on how to distribute this increased level of resources, we expect that one of the ways could be through debt relief.

<a name="20422w24.html_para3">At the moment the HIPC initiative is helping to increase social expenditures in countries receiving HIPC debt relief by $1.7 billion in 2001&#150;02, equivalent to 1.2 per cent. of GDP. On average, health and education spending account for 65 per cent. (40 per cent. on education and 25 per cent. on health) of the use of HIPC debt relief.

 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> Whilst recognising the right of businesses and individuals to manage their tax affairs efficiently, the Government is committed to ensuring a fairer tax system by countering abuses and contrived avoidance schemes. Each Budget since 1997 has included measures to secure the tax base and combat avoidance by blocking tax loopholes, including those used by wealthy individuals. We will continue to stop abuses of the tax system which benefit a small minority at the expense of taxpayers generally.
<P>

<a name="20422w24.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his 2002 Budget speech reiterated this commitment when he said that, "to ensure fairness for taxpayers and businesses, we must act swiftly to close tax loopholes and be vigilant against tax avoidance". He also announced that the Government is reviewing the complex rules of residence and domicile.

The difference between the number of applications made and the number of cases heard is accounted for by applicants withdrawing of their own volition, adjournment of hearings on the authority of the regional chairmen, change in status of the patient's detention under the Act or discharge from detention by the responsible medical officer before the date of the hearing.

 Every year we make available to national health service trusts significant funds in the form of block capital allocations for the purpose of improving fire safety together with other priorities. A separate figure for fire is not identified. Further, we are currently implementing the largest ever hospital building programme in the history of the NHS which is replacing increasing amounts of worn out stock with modern, high quality buildings, which is contributing to our drive to raise the standards of the estate.

<a name="20422w28.html_para9">We are committed to ensuring that NHS dentistry is available to all who want it. In supporting this commitment the Government have invested over &#163;100 million in the last two years.

 Digital hearing aids are provided in Lancashire by the Morecambe Bay Hospitals NHS Trust, a first wave site. An announcement about which second wave NHS trusts will be providing digital hearing aids this year was made in my reply to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreman (Mr. Loughton) and the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on 10 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 465W. Fairfield hospital, Bury and Southport and Ormskirk hospital did express an interest but were unable to gain the support of the respective primary care trusts. No other sites in Lancashire expressed interest in this round. In addition to the second wave sites, we hope to be able to provide at least a further 15 sites with the training and equipment they need to start fitting digital hearing aids from April 2003. Trusts in Lancashire, together with others in England, have an opportunity to participate in this next phase.

 <i>[holding answers 15 April 2002]:</i> Appointments to the boards of national health service trusts, strategic health authorities, primary care trusts and care trusts are now a matter for the NHS Appointments Commission. While the commission does not take into account or have information on constituency boundaries, it always aims to ensure as far as possible that board membership reflects the geographical area served by the NHS body. However, board members do not serve in any representative capacity and all appointments are made on the merits of the candidates involved, in accordance with the criteria determined by the Secretary of State and the Code of Practice issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> Warrington identified health inequalities as one of its four key priorities in its Primary Care Trust application. Prior to its establishment, the PCT raised the profile of health inequality in Warrington with the Local Strategic Partnership and particularly through the Health and Wellbeing Partnership. A health inequality sub-group has been established as part of the Health and Wellbeing Partnership to bring a multi-agency focus and resource to tackle poor health in central Warrington. The PCT is working with partners to identify a Warrington Health Improvement Zone, which will form the focus for targeting resources in the future.

However PCT's, as the most local NHS organisation, are best place to understand the needs of their local population. As part of their role to improve the health of their populations, secure the provision of services and integrate health and social care, PCTs will identify priorities for action locally, in addition to national priorities that meet the specific needs of their population.

<P>
<P><I>22 Apr 2002 : Column 123W</I><P>
"Mobile Phones and Health". Radio signals from handsets were identified as a research priority because localised exposures of people using phones are in general appreciably higher than exposures to the whole body from base stations. In both cases, however, exposures need to comply with exposure guidelines.
<P>

<a name="20422w30.html_para1">The first group of proposals agreed for funding by the Programme Management Committee has generally related to the areas of research identified in the Stewart Report. Although the main focus of much of the funded research relates to the use of mobile phones, in practice many of the experimental studies will also be valuable in providing evidence on any possible effects on people of exposures to radio frequency (RF) radiation from base stations. The agreed programme includes a study on exposures from the newer types of base station that are being introduced in urban areas. Details of research now underway are given on the MTHR website at www.mthr.org.uk.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year.<P>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>

3. The expenditure is the total expenditure of the health authority and the commissioning expenditure of the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care 



trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The majority of drugs expenditure in 1998&#150;99 and a smaller element in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.<P>

4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&#150;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>

5. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties or training which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.<P>
