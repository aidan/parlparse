The report also contains numerous factual inaccuracies that were either not checked with me or my Department. The information sharing index will contain only the basic details of every child, end details, for example a GP or social worker, who are in contact with them. It will not contain case information or any subjective judgment about a child or their parents. It will not hold information about vaccinations, fruit and vegetable consumption or educational attainment. To say that it can be used to predict the future outcome for a child is nonsense.</p>

It is being developed in consultation with children&#146;s work force practitioners and will enable them to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively by providing them with contact details for other services working with the same child. Security is a key concern and access to the index will be tightly controlled and audited.</p>

Most runaways return within 24 hours, but they need effective mediation and resolution for their problems. When a child is missing for longer, it's even more important we have clear support mechanisms, procedures and responsibilities to enable them to be found and returned, safely and speedily, and their problems addressed.</p>

It covers early intervention and prevention; integration of education, social care and health services available to at-risk youngsters; information sharing to prevent young people slipping through the net; early assessment of young people's needs, including those relating to broader family issues; joined up support for children and families, through a lead professional.</p>

Local children's services are best placed to identify and engage with at-risk groups more quickly and effectively, where prevention and speed of response is vital. Unfortunately, not all runaways are reported as missing, but when the needs of such vulnerable young people become known to, and assessed as a priority by, a children's social care department, they have a duty to assess and address those needs.</p>

<a name="61128w0010.htm_brev1"><a name="0611293000578"><ul><p class="tabletext">Thank you for your recent Parliamentary questions requesting information on the complaints dealt with by the Standards Board for England (the Standards Board) and the Adjudication Panel for England (APE). The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has asked the Standards Board to reply directly to your request. I am copying this reply to her officials.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev2"><a name="0611293000579"><ul><p class="tabletext">The information you have requested has been placed in a table format for ease of reference. The table is on the enclosed sheet. In summary, 91 per cent. of cases referred to them have been upheld by the APE.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev3"><a name="0611293000580"><ul><p class="tabletext">We did not refer any completed investigations for adjudication by the APE until October 2002, since the Code of Conduct was not approved by Parliament until November 2001. You may also note that there were a relatively high number of cases referred to the APE in the financial year 2002-2003. This is because a majority of the first cases referred to the APE were register of interest cases that involved parish councillors who were opposed to the register of interests being imposed halfway through their term of office.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev4"><a name="0611293000581"><ul><p class="tabletext">You will also note from the table of statistics that the APE received and determined fewer cases than the Standards Board referred to it. This is because when the APE receives multiple cases about the same member it will normally consider all the cases at the same time, and therefore consider them as a single case.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev5"><a name="0611293000582"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is also a disparity in each year between the numbers of cases the APE received and the number it determined. This is because the APE will receive cases near the end of a financial year that it will subsequently determine in the following financial year. The normal handling time, allowing for circulation of papers and responses, is around 16 weeks.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev6"><a name="0611293000583"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have been able to provide you with the number of cases referred to the APE by the Standards Board since 2001 by region. However, we do not collate this regional information by each type of authority so I am unable to provide you with this information broken down between parish/town councils and the other remaining local authorities. This is however an area of our statistical analysis that we will look to provide in the future.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev7"><a name="0611293000584"><ul><p class="tabletext">We cannot provide any statistics on complaints relating to local authorities in Wales as, under the &#147;Local Government Act 2000&#148;, the Standards Board does not have the power to consider complaints against members of local authorities in Wales. Under the Act the Standards Board only has the power to issue guidance on the Code of Conduct to Welsh police authorities. It is the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales that considers complaints against members of local authorities in Wales, and you would need to contact him direct for any information you require.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev8"><a name="0611293000585"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is interesting to note that an increasing proportion of the complaints we receive are submitted by members of the public. 51 per cent. of the complaints we received in 2003-04 were from the public, rising to 60 per cent. in 2004-05 and rising further to 64 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>
</ul><a name="61128w0010.htm_brev9"><a name="0611293000586"><ul><p class="tabletext">I hope that this information is helpful. If you would like any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

the (i) UK and (ii) lead donor; and in how many recipient countries audits of such budgets have been undertaken by non-governmental auditors. [100664]</p>

<p><a name="st_228"><a name="0611293000385"><a name="61128w0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="0611293000656"><b>Hilary Benn:</b> DFID country offices monitor how basket funding and budget support is spent to ensure that there is evidence it has been used for the purposes agreed with partner governments. An important aspect of country monitoring arrangements is ensuring adequate audit arrangements are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="61128w0011.htm_para4"><a name="0611293000386">Given the diverse nature of the countries in which DFID works and the different partners (both government and international) involved, the design of monitoring and audit arrangements varies considerably for both basket funds and budget support. The best figures we can provide are for funds disbursed in the 2005 budget year of the countries concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_511"><a name="61128w0011.htm_para5"><a name="0611293000387">DFID contributed to some 45 basket funds in 18 different countries in 2005 and delivered aid through poverty reduction budget support in 16 countries. In all these cases, DFID staff reviewed relevant financial information on how funds were used and participated in meetings with government and donor partners to discuss progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="61128w0011.htm_para6"><a name="0611293000388">Around half of the basket funds were audited by the national audit institution and half by a specially appointed auditor. Poverty reduction budget support in 11 countries was audited by the national audit institution and in five, by a specially appointed auditor. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="61128w0011.htm_para7"><a name="0611293000389">The nature of basket funding and budget support means that common agreements usually exist between government and donors on how funds will be used and the monitoring and auditing arrangements. Therefore there is no distinction between UK and lead donor arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="61128w0011.htm_para8"><a name="0611293000390">There is no standardised definition of a basket fund. In order to respond to the question, we have defined it as having a common bank account into which at least two donors pool resources to support a government to implement an agreed sector programme or set of activities; and procedures relating to the operation of the bank account are additional to government&#146;s own procedures and are governed by an agreement between government and donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="61128w0011.htm_para9"><a name="0611293000391">Nearly all national audit institutions are statutorily independent of the executive branch of government and in this sense are non-governmental auditors, although they are the auditors of government&#146;s expenditure. In many cases and particularly in regard to budget support, this is the form of independent audit carried out.

The Referral Dental Service based in the DHSSPS undertakes post treatment dental examinations on a random sample of health service claims. Health Boards undertake inspections of health service dental practices in their area to ensure compliance with health and safety and other regulatory requirements. The Central Services Agency (CSA) undertakes pre-treatment checks on proposed courses of treatment which are in excess of the prior approval limit (currently &#163;384). The CSA also generate practice profiles of all health service practices on a quarterly basis which outline individual practitioner&#146;s treatment prescribing patterns and bench mark these against local and regional averages. Since 2005, Health Boards have undertaken probity checks of a random sample of claims from all health service dentists. The practice at 14 The Square, Portaferry would have been included in those checks which were available during the years in which it operated health service dentistry (June 1995 to January 2001).</p>

This is in part due to the huge task of transferring the management of maintenance and replacement of all parking equipment in Northern Ireland to one central control point. The pay and display machines currently operating in Limavady Central car park are relatively old and are soon to be replaced. A computer monitoring system, linked to the new pay and display machines will enable faults to be detected as soon as they occur. It is hoped this improved system will reduce the time machines are out of order.</p>

Four national alcohol misuse enforcement campaigns have been conducted over the past two years funded by the Home Office.

In addition, through the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, which received Royal Assent on the 8 November 2006, we have created a new offence of persistently selling alcohol to children if, on three or more different occasions in a period of three consecutive months, alcohol is unlawfully sold on the same premises to a person under 18. The penalty for the new offence on summary conviction would be a fine not exceeding &#163;10,000 and, where the offender is a premises licence holder, the premises licence could be suspended for up to three months in so far as it authorises the sales by retail of alcohol.</p>

NDNAD Services activity is concerned with the day to day operation of the NDNAD, for example loading DNA profiles, delivery of match reports, and handling of inquiries (principally from police forces and forensic suppliers). The costs also include maintenance of the NDNAD IT system as well as business support, including accommodation. Supplier Accreditation activity is concerned with the accreditation of the forensic supplier laboratories that analyse police DNA submissions, and thus supply DNA profiles to the NDNAD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_721"><a name="61128w0032.htm_para0"><a name="061129125000873">This accreditation involves scrutinising prospective new suppliers to the Database as well as continuous quality monitoring of existing suppliers. Data is not available for years before 2002-03, as in the past the costs of the NDNAD were tightly bound in with other costs incurred by the Forensic Science Service. The process of clearly drawing out these costs was fully resolved as part of the process of separating the NDNAD custodian from the FSS, which was completed in December 2005, when the FSS was vested as a Government owned company and the NDNAD transferred from the FSS to the Home Office. These figures do not include payments made to police forces under the DNA expansion programme which ran from 2000 to 2005, to enable them to retrieve more samples from scenes of crime and to take samples from more individuals.</p>

Police contracts require operators to provide a guaranteed speedy response, to have specialist equipment, secure storage facilities and an efficient administration department. The detailed arrangements between individual police forces and vehicle recovery operators is a contractual matter between the parties involved.</p>

The majority of our knowledge regarding the situation in the UK centres on trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_735"><a name="61128w0033.htm_para1"><a name="061129125001039">The majority of trafficked victims originate from eastern Europe and the Balkans, or from the far east (China and Thailand). Recently the UK has seen a growing trend in victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation being brought to the UK from within the EU, in particular from Lithuania. Although violence and force are often encountered in trafficking cases, evidence suggests that in the initial stages the vast majority of victims who are brought to the UK are not actually kidnapped or forced into moving here, but instead are recruited by deception. The personal freedom of the trafficked victim is severely limited and they are often controlled through the removal of their documentation, unrealistic debt-bonds, threats of violence against them or their families and in the worst cases actual physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse.</p>

An officer who is a contributing member of either the Police Pension Scheme 1987 or the Police Pension Scheme 2006 and who has two years&#146; qualifying service at the time of retirement will receive an ill-health pension which is index-linked and payable immediately.</p>

Member has asked for. A table follows with information from 1990-91 to 2004-05. From 2001-02 the rate of ill-health retirement has not been recorded as a percentage of the number of retirements but as a proportion of the number of officers in service, expressed in terms of ill-health retirements per 1,000 officers. This is a more stable measure since the number of ordinary retirements is liable to change from year to year. The figures show a very clear downward trend which started in the mid 1990s&#151;from 2,587 ill-health retirements in 1994-95 to 405 in 2004-05. The rate of reduction has been given added impetus following the Police Negotiating Board Agreement of 2002 which resulted in the issue of joint guidance to forces in 2003 on the better management of ill-health.

However since February 2004, the Police Standards Unit in the Home Office has been working closely with police forces assisting with the forensic review of undetected serious sexual assaults and rapes from the late eighties through to the late nineties, by applying the latest scientific technology to historic forensic samples and submitting the results to the police forces concerned. To date, this national programme of work&#151;Operation Advance&#151;has involved the review of 9615 forensic case files, of which 1387 were suitable for forensic review and 395 were identified as suitable for reinvestigation by the police  <br>

forces concerned. Operation Advance is an ongoing programme of work; the work has already resulted in the conviction of 22 offenders and with more awaiting trial. This work and the good practice and practical advice generated as a result have been seen by many police forces as a catalyst to create their own cold case review teams and we are confident that as many as 17 police forces have already done so and as a result are reviewing their own historic as yet unsolved cases of rape and serious sexual assault and in most cases homicide. The Home Office are committed to promoting the value of cold case reviews not least because this work is all about victims&#151;it is about bringing justice, relief, &#145;closure&#146; and freedom from fear to victims of the most horrendous crimes, often after many years. The vast majority of the offenders identified and convicted in this work have proved to be persistent, prolific and dangerous criminals with criminal convictions stretching back many years. Bringing these individuals to justice has undoubtedly prevented them from committing many more crimes in the future.</p>
