<a name="11203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Within the last five years, the Ministry of Defence has received a number of representations from hon. Members and the general public on the subject of a retrospective campaign medal for service in the Canal Zone during the period 1951 to 1954. From available records it has been determined that the Ministry of Defence has received at least two parliamentary questions for oral response, 16 parliamentary questions for written response (including this one), 340 letters from MPs on behalf of constituents and recorded as ministerial correspondence, seven early-day motions, two Adjournment debates, nine letters to a Defence Minister from other than an MP, which were answered direct by him or on his behalf by his office and 300 letters from members of the public which were variously addressed to the Prime Minister, a Defence Minister, or to Her Majesty the Queen and were answered by an official on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. It should be noted that a number of MPs have written to the Ministry of Defence on this subject on more than one occasion and a small number of veterans have written many times.

 During 2000&#150;01, the War Pensions Agency delivered efficiencies necessary to absorb the effect of pay and price pressures. By adopting a sharply focused and integrated approach to human resources and expenditure management, the agency has been able to implement additional measures to enable operation within its running cost allocation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The granting of credit to an individual is a decision for the credit companies to make. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has held talks with the British Banking Association, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Finance Leasing Authority which have assured us that their members do not deny credit to service personnel because of their membership of the armed forces; their credit worthiness is assessed in the same way as for their civilian counterparts. Although some companies will not lend to service personnel who are overseas, there are sufficient companies (including NAAFI) who will do so 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2001 : Column: 7W</I><P>
in order to provide the armed forces with adequate choice. While some service personnel may experience difficulties, I am not aware that obtaining credit represents a significant problem for the armed forces more widely. There is no intention, nor would it be appropriate, for the MOD to involve itself in the decisions taken by private companies on the credit worthiness of armed forces personnel.

 Only Senior Non-Commissioned Officers appointed to specialist recruiting roles and who have attended the Regular Recruiters Course, run by the Army School of Recruiting, are termed recruiters. While serving with the Recruiting Group of the Army Training and Recruiting Agency they are not serving at Regimental Duty. Officers and Warrant Officers serving at Regimental Duty and who will conduct duties in support of recruiting operations as Team Leaders, undertake specific courses in support of their duties. Others who will serve as members of recruiting teams are given a one-day briefing prior to their deployment. Soldiers involved in the Satisfied Soldier Scheme are briefed by recruiting staff at the local Careers Office where they are deployed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w03.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ensures that there is independent judicial oversight of the powers in the Act. The Act requires the Interception of Communications and Intelligence Services Commissioners to report annually to the Prime Minister on any matters relating to the carrying out of their functions. These reports, excluding, after consultation with the Commissioners, confidential material, are laid before Parliament. Similarly, the Police Act 1997 requires the Chief Surveillance Commissioner to make an annual report to the Prime Minister which is laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para1">The Act also requires the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to the performance of the powers and duties under this Act and to which users of the powers must have regard.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para2">The Investigatory Powers Tribunal investigates complaints in relation to any proceedings incompatible with rights conferred by the ECHR and which concern the use of investigatory powers under the Act. It also considers any complaint by a person who believes that he has been subject to any use of these investigatory powers. The tribunal would determine whether the complainant was subject to such powers and, if so, whether their use was in contravention of the provisions in the Act. The Intelligence Services Commissioner's role in this respect is to provide assistance but only as required by the tribunal.

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what recent discussions he has had with Church leaders in relation to the vulnerability of churches to vandalism.  [17024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 I have had no discussions with Church leaders on this matter as it lies outside the Church Commissioners' and my own area of responsibility.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para3">In the Church of England, the responsibility for the security of churches and churchyards lies with the individual parish authorities, although the care of individual monuments in churchyards is generally a matter for the family concerned. Advice is available from church insurers, Diocesan Advisory Committees for the Care of Churches and, nationally, from the Council for the Care of Churches. The National Churchwatch scheme also offers seminars on security in churches and the personal safety of those using them.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para4">The view of both the Church authorities and insurers is that the best safeguard for a church against theft and vandalism is for it to be kept open and in regular use. However, the duty to care for and protect our churches should not solely concern the church authorities but the whole community. Realistic prevention lies in good citizenship not taller walls.

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement on levels of poverty among clergy with particular reference to those clergy who are <i>(a)</i> retired and <i>(b)</i> about to retire.  [17025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 Clergy in office are provided with a house and paid a stipend. On retirement, a full service pension from the Church for 37 years' service amounts to two thirds of the National Minimum Stipend and a lump sum of three times the pension. Clergy are responsible for their 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2001 : Column: 10W</I><P>
own housing in retirement but are given assistance through a retirement housing scheme. Clergy also receive a state pension.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para5">The Clergy Stipends Review Group has recently published a report "Generosity and Sacrifice", which looked at the issue of stipends and pensions. The Group noted that if stipends levels are no better than adequate, the current quantum of pension is not over generous in relation to stipends or in absolute terms. It felt, however, that a number of details of the provision of the pension and stipend scheme were in need of reconsideration. The General Synod at its November sessions agreed that the report should be sent to dioceses for consultation. The responses to that consultation are likely to be considered by General Synod at the end of next year.

<P>
<a name="11203w03.html_wqn10"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, how much is being spent on the refurbishment of the Bishop of Chichester's palace; for what reason rooms hitherto publicly accessible in the palace are being converted into private rooms; and if he will make a statement.  [18368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The refurbishment is in fact on-going works, which are partly alterations and partly maintenance and redecoration.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para6">The alterations are due to the need to improve the office accommodation. This has been re-located from the first floor to a more accessible site on the ground floor and there are consequential changes flowing from that move. The cost of these alterations is approximately &#163;65,000.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para7">It should be noted that Bishop Kemp's episcopacy lasted 27 years and was unusually long. This resulted in a large number of maintenance and redecoration items 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2001 : Column: 11W</I><P>
being deferred to this scheme of works. The total maintenance cost will be approximately &#163;40,000 and this will cover general maintenance, decorations and safety related items such as upgrading the electrical installation.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para8">VAT will be additional, although it will not apply to the alterations as the building is listed. The house is a Grade 1 listed building and the quality of work needs to reflect the special status of the building.
<P>

<a name="11203w03.html_para9">The question also refers to publicly accessible rooms. Bishop Kemp did not use the Tudor room and so it was used occasionally for external functions; for example, an art exhibition was held there once a year. The Tudor room is to resume its original function as the main room for receiving visitors but it will continue to be available to the public by appointment. It is envisaged that the room will also be available for seminars.

 London Underground&#151;a publicly owned company&#151;is negotiating contracts to put in place the Government's plans for modernising the Tube. It is clearly appropriate for London Underground to evaluate these contracts in line with Treasury Investment Appraisal guidelines. The answer given to the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on 23 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 493W, made clear the terms of reference for Ernst and Young's review of London Underground's value for money evaluation of the contracts for the Tube modernisation plans.

 There is already a requirement in Great Britain to limit the performance of the heavier goods and passenger vehicles by fitting top-speed limiters. This requirement applies to vehicles having a maximum gross weight exceeding 7.5 tonnes. The relevant legislation is contained in Regulations 36A and 36B of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. The Government are currently arguing the United Kingdom's corner with our European partners on a European Commission proposal to extend the requirement for top-speed limiters to goods vehicles exceeding 3.5 tonnes in maximum gross weight, and to vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver.

 A number of tenants organisations responded to the consultation on the Housing Green Paper last year, and to the consultation this year on proposals to change Housing Revenue Account subsidy to take account of rent restructuring. We are pressing ahead with rent restructuring from April 2002. We will monitor the impact and maintain a dialogue with all interested parties, including tenants groups, about the issues arising on the implementation of the policy as it develops. It would be for local authorities and registered social landlords to consult their tenants about the rents they propose to set from April 2002.

<a name="11203w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Best Value Performance Indicators have been designed to provide a rounded view of local government's performance. They reflect the resources devoted to the different services, the efficiency with which those resources are used, the quality of the services and service users' experience. They therefore include a mix of indicators which measure inputs, outputs and outcomes; the intention is to rely increasingly on outcome indicators whenever these can be clearly identified. The number of indicators against which an authority is required to report depends on the nature of an authority and the number of services it delivers. For 2001&#150;02 unitary and metropolitan authorities are required to report performance on up to 123 indicators while for district councils the maximum number of indicators is 68. These will be reduced for 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="11203w06.html_para0">The Best Value Performance Indicators provide valuable information about the performance of individual authorities and enable local people to view the performance of their own authority alongside that of similar authorities. They will also track performance changes over time. Once best value performance plans are published in 2002 it will be possible to assess change over the two years that best value has been in place.
<P>

<a name="11203w06.html_para1">The Council of the Isles of Scilly is required to report on those services which it provides to local people. I understand that the Council has agreed to design a set of indicators appropriate to its circumstances, and will need to discuss these with the District Auditor.

 The Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions announced on 1 October a three month review of the best value regime for local authorities aimed at improving the quality of services. A review group, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Local Government and the Regions, has been set up to take this work forward. The review group has been asked to report to the Secretary of State by the end of this year. The Secretary of State will consider its report early in the new year and respond to its recommendations. The timetable for implementing any measures announced in his response will depend on their nature, but the intention is to act as quickly as possible ahead of the 2002&#150;03 financial year.

<P>
<a name="11203w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The capital costs of light rail lines will depend on a significant number of factors. These include land prices, whether the route is segregated or contains street running sections, the degree of double tracking along a section of route, whether there is a need for major works such as tunnels or bridges as well as the extent of wider impacts such as utility diversions. Cost figures will also include vehicles. An average cost figure per kilometre across all schemes is therefore not particularly meaningful. The table sets out a very crude calculation of the capital cost per kilometre of light rail schemes that are currently under development using the latest figures for the overall capital costs of the relevant scheme divided by the length of the route. The figures are given in cash terms.

 Light rail systems typically take many years of planning and promoters are encouraged to discuss their ideas with the Department at an early stage. Accordingly, it is hard to identify precisely first submission of a proposal. The table shows the period between funding being approved and the opening of schemes in operation.

 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Departmental Annual Report for 2001 (Cm 5105) contains the Departmental Unallocated Provision (DUP) set for the present financial year in table A6a. Draw-down of the DUP has been reported to Parliament in the Winter Supplementary Estimates for the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions presented on 29 November. Outturn against six month forecast for each Request for Resources will be published in the Winter Supplementary Estimates Summary Request for Supply as usual.

<a name="11203w07.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions in relation to Statutory Instrument 2718 and the accompanying guidelines, what discussions his Department has had with all other Government Departments on the number of portable buildings they use which will have to be disposed of after five years; and what the estimated cost to public funds of disposing and replacing these units will be. [19878]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Statutory Instrument 2718 is The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2001. This order amends the planning guidelines relating to telecommunications masts, and has no relevance to portable buildings. There have thus been no such discussions with other Government Departments, or estimates made, in relation to this Statutory Instrument.
<P>

<a name="11203w07.html_para3"> However, the hon. Member did raise the issue of portable buildings in the debate in the Second Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation on 21 November 2001 which considered the Prayer against both Statutory Instrument 2718 and Statutory Instrument 3335, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001. The Approved Document to Part L2 of the Building Regulations, which Statutory Instrument 3335 amended, gives guidance on how portable buildings may meet the requirements of Part L2 of the Regulations under the heading "Buildings constructed from sub-assemblies".
<P>

<a name="11203w07.html_para4"> There is nothing in the guidance in the Approved Document that indicates that portable buildings will have to be disposed of after five years. It indicates that there are no restrictions at all on portable buildings that are moved from one place to another on the same site. With regard to buildings moved from one site to another the guidance is that a building constructed from external fabric sub-assemblies obtained from other premises or from a stock manufactured before 31 December 2001, would normally be considered to meet the requirement if the fabric thermal resistance or the prospective annual energy use will be no worse than the relevant performance standards given in the 1995 edition of Approved Document L.
<P>

<a name="11203w07.html_para5"> It would thus have been inappropriate to have discussions, in relation to this Statutory Instrument and its supporting Approved Documents, with other Government Departments on the number of portable buildings they use which will have to be disposed of after five years, and what the estimated cost to public funds of disposing and replacing these units will be.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the changes made to the <i>(a)</i> measurements and <i>(b)</i> methodology used for determining the length of roads as used for the purposes of standard spending assessments for local authorities since 1997.

<P>
<a name="11203w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 In calculating Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 the lengths of roads used have been estimated from local authority returns, to the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR). Over this period DTLR (or its predecessor Departments) has made no change to the method of determining the lengths of minor roads. The Department does not hold central information on whether individual authorities have changed the basis they use for recording these lengths. Starting with the calculation of 2001&#150;02 SSAs DTLR's Transport Statistics Roads Division (TSR) have used Geographical Information System (GIS) data to make comparisons between data from local authorities and their own major road network data, ironing out differences between the two, such as the elimination of the double-counting of dual carriageways by some authorities. This exercise has now been completed in time for the 2002&#150;03 SSAs and the major road length estimates for this settlement are based on these data. No announcement has yet been made regarding the basis for minor road lengths to be used in 2002&#150;03 SSAs. This will form part of the forthcoming consultation announcement on the provisional local government finance settlement.

 Our new planning policy guidance for transport (PPG13) sets out how local authorities in rural areas should plan for new development to be primarily sited at the most accessible locations in the local area. In remote locations, well away from large urban areas most development, including for jobs and services, should be located at local service centres. These centres will include market towns and are expected to be the focal points for services in the countryside. Local service centres should be designated in the development plans prepared by local authorities. These plans form the framework within which decisions on proposals for development are taken.

 Under the Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001, 50 per cent. mandatory rate relief is available to any rateable non- domestic property with a rateable value of no more than &#163;6,000. This is provided that it consists wholly or mainly of land or buildings which were subject to the agricultural exemption from rates for at least 183 days during the one year period immediately preceding the date on which the rate relief scheme came into effect. The scheme came into effect in England on 15 August 2001. It has yet to be commenced in Wales, which is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales. The scheme will run for five years from commencement, when it will be reviewed and can be extended by Order.

 Information on the volume of correspondence from Members of Parliament received by Departments and agencies and performance in handling them is published annually by the Cabinet Office. The most recent report, covering 2000, was announced by the then Minister for the Cabinet Office on 6 April 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 325W. Between 20 June and 20 July 2001 Ministers received 1,091 letters&#151;298 of which were from hon. and right hon. Members. 78 per cent. of the replies to these were issued within the Department's target of 18 working days.

The agency has also produced a souvenir booklet, "Wireless over the Waves", which has achieved a wide circulation and is on its website.

<P>

<a name="11203w13.html_para2">Our objective in overhauling the existing regulations, which date from 1976, is simpler, clearer regulations, which are relevant to the market of today and of the future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w13.html_spnew23"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I received representations on the draft conduct of employment agencies and employment businesses regulations from the representative bodies, individual recruitment companies and workers within the IT industry.
<P>

<a name="11203w13.html_para3">Our draft conduct regulations are designed to benefit recruitment agencies, employment businesses, their clients and those seeking employment through them. They will remove unnecessary restrictions on organisations in the recruitment industry, including the IT sector, and the services they can offer, while protecting the interests of work seekers and vulnerable groups.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w13.html_spnew24"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I have no plans to review the Employment Agencies Act 1973 at the present time. The Government consider that the existing Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 1976 do not meet the Better Regulation Taskforce's five central principles of good regulation: 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2001 : Column: 53W</I><P>

[19861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w13.html_spnew25"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Recruitment and Employment Confederation estimates that about one fifth of temporary workers transfer to permanent employment each year. However, I have no breakdown by specific sectors.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Available estimates are of average weekly expenditure on fees for moving house and are shown in the attached table.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Like all estimates from sample surveys these figures are subject to sampling variability. This is particularly high for an item such as moving house fees because the sample of households who incur such expenditure is small and the amounts they spend cover a wide range. For this reason it is not possible to give reliable breakdowns by region or for buying and selling separately.</FONT></UL>

 My predecessor announced to the House on 30 November 2000 that KPMG would carry out a post- implementation review of ECGD's progress in addressing the recommendations made by KPMG in December 1999. The first stage of that review was completed last January, and was reported to the House on 31 January. I am pleased to announce that the second stage has now commenced. The review is expected to take between four and six weeks, and I will place a copy of KPMG's report in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="11203w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Legislation governing public service pensions requires public service pensions to be increased annually by the same percentage as state earnings-related pensions (additional pensions). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced on 28 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 894W that benefits such as additional pensions will be increased by 1.7 per cent., in line with the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index up to September 2001. Public service pensions will therefore be increased by 1.7 per cent. from 8 April 2002, except those which have been in payment for less than a year, which will receive a pro-rata increase.

<a name="11203w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As part of the pre-Budget Report the Government announced on 27 November that Customs activity this year to tackle cross-channel passenger smuggling of alcohol and tobacco has had a profound impact. Revenue losses from this form of smuggling have been reduced by 76 per cent. compared to last year, with cross-channel passenger smuggling of beer almost eliminated and cross-channel passenger smuggling of wine and spirits more than halved.
<P>

<a name="11203w17.html_para0">Building on these successes, and those of its wider efforts to tackle tobacco smuggling, the Government published alongside the PBR a paper "Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud" which sets out the strategic principles that underlie the Government's approach to tackling fraud and outlines the steps being taken to tackle other forms of fraud and smuggling in the alcohol sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I met Commissioner Bolkestein on 20 November and explained that the Government are totally committed both to the principle that EU citizens should be able to engage in cross border shopping for their own use in other member states and to tackling criminal smuggling. The Government are confident that the approach of UK Customs to tackling those individuals who seek to break the law by smuggling alcohol and tobacco into the UK is fully consistent with our EU obligations and that once the European Commission is fully informed of the situation, they too will be satisfied.

[19402]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 At a local level, Customs maintain specific records of all vehicles seized to deal with appeals and court cases as well as for intelligence gathering. Personal possessions are returned to the owner either at the time of seizure, or can be collected within 30 days. Tax discs are an integral part of a vehicle to legalise road use and are retained.

<P>
<a name="11203w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Once a vehicle has been forfeited to the Crown, Customs dispose of the vehicle in the most cost-effective way. If Customs choose to sell the vehicle at auction then the tax disc is sold as part of the vehicle. If the vehicle is crushed, Customs return the tax disc to the DVLA and the Exchequer is refunded.
<P>

<a name="11203w17.html_para1">In the great majority of cases any personal possessions in private vehicles are taken by the individual at the time of seizure. However, Customs allow at least 30 days for the collection of personal possessions before they are disposed of.

<P>
<a name="11203w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Customs' centrally held information on the numbers of private vehicles seized does not distinguish the location at which seizure took place, nor is the number of vehicles restored on successful appeal centrally collated.

 In the great majority of cases any personal possessions in private vehicles are taken by the individual at the time of seizure. However, Customs allow at least 30 days for the collection of personal possessions before they are disposed of. In the rare event that personal possessions are not claimed within a reasonable period, Customs dispose of them. It is not normally Customs practice to sell such items.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w18.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The FSA's Interim Prudential Sourcebook for Insurance Companies already makes provisions covering reinsurance practices.

This covers the treatment of reinsurance contracts in some detail, and requires that the accounts should properly reflect the economic substance of any transaction.

 Between 1989 and 1997, publicly planned funding per full-time equivalent higher education student fell by over 36 per cent. from just under &#163;7,600 to just over &#163;4,800. Lord Dearing's national committee of inquiry into higher education concluded in 1997 that higher education institutions could not absorb the reduction planned by the previous Government of over 6 per cent. He proposed that higher education institutions should be asked to deliver no more than a 1 per cent. reduction in costs and the Government accepted his recommendations.

<a name="11203w18.html_para7">For example, as a result of a very successful pilot programme offering girls work experience in non- traditional work areas such as construction, engineering, IT and telecommunications, my Department is taking forward taster days for girls and is currently working with the national education business partnership network on a roll-out of the programme for girls at key stage 4.
<P>

<a name="11203w18.html_para8">The science and engineering ambassadors scheme is being launched in January 2002 as part of Science Year and has been jointly developed by DfES/DTI. It will give more young people the opportunity to interact with female role models who are practising scientists and engineers. The DTI, through the work programme of its promoting SET (science, engineering and technology) for women unit and engineering policy unit enables organisations such as the SETpoints, the careers education and business partnerships, Let's Twist at Bradford college and the WISE campaign to run events with women scientists and engineers, produce posters and magazines such as SPARK that promote positive images of women in non-traditional careers. Science Year is particularly targeting some of its resources and publicity at girls. For example, television advertisements and a careers video have featured girls and women. The faces of modern science photographic project includes a large number of role models for all under-represented groups and will result in the production of a book for use by careers advisers and ConneXions officers.
<P>

<a name="11203w18.html_para9">Many colleges and training providers are actively engaged in programmes to attract more women into male dominated fields and a number of initiatives funded by the European Social Fund involve the use of women role models. WISE, mentioned above, the Association for Women in Science and Engineering, the Women's Engineering Society and the British Council are all proactively using women role models from within industry as a mechanism for encouraging other women to study in non-traditional fields.
<P>

<a name="11203w18.html_para10">We are also encouraging men to undertake work in areas where they are under-represented, such as child care. The second phase of our national recruitment campaign, "Do Something You Love for a Living" is actively promoting the recruitment of men and people from ethnic minority backgrounds into the work force while placing a heavy emphasis on training and qualifications. We

featured a male nursery nurse in one of our advertisements and screened this at times when there was likely to be a large male audience. Men are also featured in the campaign booklet and accompanying case studies and research into the effectiveness of the campaign showed that the advert featuring the man was the best-recalled one. Aside from raising the status of working in the sector, the focus on training and qualifications should encourage more men to respond to the campaign.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]:</i> The Government have provided &#163;93 million for higher education students through the access and hardship funds in 2001&#150;02, over four times the amount in 1997&#150;98. The funds are used to provide hardship payments and access bursaries, as well as fee waivers for part-time students on benefit and low incomes, and opportunity bursaries for young disadvantaged students through the excellence challenge programme.

In 2001&#150;02, the funding allocated includes access bursaries for students with children. Access and hardship funds for institutions in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are a matter for the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Executive respectively.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]:</i> The total Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) cost of administration taken from its published accounts was &#163;23.3 million in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;25.5 million in 1999&#150;2000.

<P>

<a name="11203w20.html_para1">The Learning and Skills Council has taken over the functions previously carried out by the FEFC, much of what was done by TECs, as well as various activities carried out by the Department for Education and Employment and Government offices. It has also taken on additional activities such as greater involvement and intervention at local level to raise basic skills, and managing a 9 per cent. real terms increase in the overall programme budget allocated to post-16 education and training compared to plans for 2000&#150;01. In spite of this, its overall operating costs (its administration budget this year is &#163;188 million) are significantly lower than the &#163;270 million&#151;&#163;280 million which was estimated to have been spent by its predecessors.

 Yes. For pupils aged seven (key stage 1), my Department collects individual pupil level data, by school and local education authority, for task and test results in English and mathematics and teacher assessment results in English, mathematics and science. In English, the task and test results are split into reading task, reading test, writing task and spelling. These results are aggregated at national level and published together with the key stage 2 and 3 results in a statistical release.

 The Government support a flexible approach to pupil grouping, including setting by ability where appropriate. The White Paper "Schools&#151;achieving success" emphasises the need to increase opportunities for all pupils to progress in line with their abilities. There will be more flexibility in future for younger gifted pupils to learn alongside older pupils.

 In 2001&#150;02 &#163;3.1 million has been made available to provide 2,638 free nursery education places for three-year-olds in Leicestershire. This level of funding could increase before the end of 2001&#150;02 if Leicestershire receives additional funding in the spring term as a result of its recent bid for additional places.
<P>

<a name="11203w20.html_para3">No assessment has yet been made of the total cost of providing free nursery education places for all three-year-olds in Leicestershire by September 2004. This will be dependent on the demand for places and also the level of provision that the local education authority decides to make available for three-year-olds from its own resources.

 The Department for Education and Skills does not provide guidance to local education authorities on providing additional funding to their early years development and child care partnerships for free nursery education places for three-year-olds. Such spending priorities are determined locally and are at the discretion of the local authority.

 Funding is not made available for specific categories of special educational need.

<P>

<a name="11203w21.html_para3">More than &#163;23 billion is available annually for the education of school children, including children with special educational needs. Over &#163;1 billion of this is used by LEAs to provide additional support for children with special educational needs.

 Children who experience or witness domestic violence can suffer in many ways, and the education service has a significant role to play in identifying these and children who are at risk of harm, or who are in need.

Volunteering helps HEIs to build bridges with their communities; it helps students to gain workplace experience and staff to develop their careers; and it helps voluntary sector organisations gain access to higher level skills and knowledge. The HE active community fund will assist in the creation of 14,000 new volunteering opportunities for HE students and staff.

This money helps institutions to reach out to more young people from communities who do not have a tradition of entering higher education.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> The available information on non-continuation rates is contained in "Performance Indicators in Higher Education", published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The figures show, for each individual HE institution in the UK, the proportion of entrants to full-time first degree courses who do not continue in higher education beyond the first year. HEFCE also calculates a sector-wide non-continuation rate, but nothing is published for all new universities in aggregate. Copies of the HEFCE publications covering students starting courses in 1996&#150;97 and 1997&#150;98 are available in the House Library; prior to 1996&#150;97, non-continuation rates were not published for individual HEIs.

 Where a local education authority wishes to alter the age range of a community primary school, by a year or more, it must publish notices to do so after consulting all interested parties, in particular the local early years development and child care partnership. If there are no objections and the proposals are not linked to others to be decided by the local school organisation committee, the local education authority may determine to implement them. In other cases it will be for the school organisation committee, or, where the school organisation committee does not reach a unanimous view, the Schools

 The average size of a secondary class taught by one teacher in England in January 2001 was 22.0. The January 2001 figure also shows that the secondary pupil/teacher ratio improved for the first time in 10 years and now stands at 17.1. The improvement reflects increased Government spending on schools.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

This information was taken from progress reports submitted by 403 schools in December 2000. Progress reports for schools operational as of September 2000 are currently being received but the information from these has not yet been collated.<P>

The 1998 School Standards and Framework Act provides for schools with a specialism to select up to 10 per cent. of their intake on the basis of aptitude for a specialist subject prescribed in regulations. Prior to the 1998 Act schools had greater discretion over aptitude selection and this accounts for the percentages above 10 per cent.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 28 November 2001]:</i> The Government of Zimbabwe have said that they plan to table a Public Order and Security Bill, to replace the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act, introduced in 1960. The Bill itself has not yet come before the Zimbabwe Parliament. Discussion at this stage would thus be premature. The early indications are that, if enacted, the Act could have a profoundly negative impact on freedom of expression in Zimbabwe.

 We are aware of recent aerial bombing incidents in Bahr El Ghazal which affected humanitarian operations there. The UN have made strong protests to the Sudanese Government about these incidents. We regularly call on the Government of Sudan, both bilaterally and within the framework of the EU Sudan dialogue, to stop the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian and humanitarian targets. We have urged both sides to stop immediately hostilities in order to create an environment conducive to negotiations and to engage in a continuous and sustained negotiation towards a just and lasting political settlement.

 DFID does not provide bilateral assistance to Tuvalu.

We work closely with key regional partners including the Form Secretariat, Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). Given the regional nature of the programme, it is not possible to determine exactly how much of this assistance goes directly to Tuvalu. DFID also contributes to the multilateral programmes maintained by the Asian Development Bank, World bank, the EU and the UN from which Tuvalu benefits.

 Local authorities will need to store waste refrigeration units until suitable processing facilities come on-line. The number that will require storage prior to recycling is dependent on the construction of suitable facilities for the recovery of ozone depleting substances. Some of these could be operational as early as spring 2002. Guidance on the storage of waste refrigeration units has been issued in draft and will be finalised shortly.

 In 1998 in "Raising the Quality" the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions gave guidance that water and sewerage companies should maintain their assets in a way which will deliver a high standard of serviceability to customers and the environment. Ofwat has identified this as an area for companies to include in their draft business plans for the 2004 periodic review of prices. The water industry, Ofwat and the Environment Agency are working together on the assessment of future capital maintenance needs, for the review. Asset lives are a factor in this.

These arrangements include a bilateral agreement with France and were fully tested in May 2001 as part of a joint international exercise based upon a nuclear accident at Gravelines nuclear power station, situated on the French coast. Further tests and exercises are conducted on a regular basis throughout the year to consider various nuclear accident conditions.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> The Department is responsible for energy efficiency. The latest complete figures available relate to the predecessor Department (DETR) in the financial year 2000&#150;01. The funding made available to support and promote energy efficiency in 2000&#150;01 totalled about &#163;163.5 million, 6 per cent. of that Department's programme expenditure.
<P>

<a name="11203w27.html_para2">The major elements of expenditure were on the energy efficiency best practice programme, support for the Energy Saving Trust and the home energy efficiency scheme.

<a name="11203w27.html_para4">The regulations require businesses who deal with packaging to recover and recycle specified tonnages of packaging waste, calculated by the amount of packaging handled by the business. Businesses can reduce their obligation by using less and reusing packaging whenever possible.

 The total Muslim population in the United Kingdom is estimated to be between one and one and a half million.

<P>

 The United Kingdom (UK) does not intend, generally, to apply the dual criminality test to requests made to the UK authorities under the provisions of a European arrest warrant, and therefore would not, generally, expect to apply the rule of specialty in a case where a person is surrendered by the UK to another European Union member state.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B>

extradition on the grounds that their human rights under the ECHR would not be protected by the requesting country; and if he will make a statement.  [20154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Framework Decision is intended to create a system enabling faster procedures for surrender of a fugitive as between European Union member states. Protection for the individual is provided in the domestic incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the issuing state's criminal justice system, rather than before courts in the United Kingdom (UK). This is the principle of mutual recognition on the basis of which we would similarly expect our EU partners to return those we want to bring to our courts to stand trial.
<P>

<a name="11203w29.html_para1">The question of compatibility with ECHR rights will be addressed again by the Government as part of the legislative process to implement the Framework Decision. It is conceivable that there may be a wholly exceptional case in which the UK courts may judge that there is a risk of treatment, on return of a fugitive to an EU member state, that is incompatible with the ECHR. Under those circumstances, the District Judge could refuse to execute a request for a European arrest warrant.

There are currently 502 Quality Mark holders at the General Help and General Help including casework levels, and over 1,700 organisations that have applied for the Quality Mark at General Help and General Help including casework level. The target for the number of advice providers to April 2002 is 1,250 at the General Help and General Help including casework levels.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what estimate she has made of the <i>(a)</i> cost and <i>(b)</i> burden to an advice provider of applying for a Quality Mark; and what plans she has to offer small voluntary organisations help to meet these costs and burdens.  [18843]<P>

<P>
<a name="11203w30.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Legal Services Commission is working with the Learning and Skills Council to assess the resource implications for an advice provider in applying for a Quality Mark. This work is due to be completed in April 2002 and will feed into the Legal Services Commission's Quality Mark support strategy. The Legal Services Commission has commenced a number of initiatives that have the potential to provide information about the needs of advice providers and identify barriers to accessing the Quality Mark. A number of the projects are targeted at smaller organisations including Black Minority Ethnic groups and refugee support groups.

 The Lord Chancellor issued a statutory direction to CAFCASS on 3 October instructing them to begin consultation about the issue of the self- employed guardians' contracts. This consultation is under way, and CAFCASS have written to all self-employed guardians. The discussions with NAGALRO will be chaired by an independent person, and the responses of the guardians to consultation will also be assessed independently.
<P>

<a name="11203w30.html_para1">The information we have received from CAFCASS shows that of 716 self-employed guardians, 28 have withdrawn their services altogether, and a further 90 are not accepting new cases. 175 previously self-employed guardians have accepted contracts as employed guardians. The remainder of the guardians, employed or self- employed, continue to work normally, as do the other employees of CAFCASS. In addition CAFCASS has advertised for and identified 197 people eligible for appointment as guardians.
<P>

<a name="11203w30.html_para2">At the week ending 16 November, guardians were working on 11,930 cases nationally. A further 282 cases were allocated that week. The number of unallocated cases was 177. In the hon. Member's South West Region there were 848 active cases. A further 26 cases were allocated that week and six cases awaited allocation.
<P>

<a name="11203w30.html_para3">CAFCASS is subject to independent inspection by HM Magistrates' Court Service Inspectorate. The Inspectorate will complete its first inspection next year. Its preliminary view, based on the initial visits it has carried out so far, is that:

 This Government recognise the importance of tackling age discrimination in the workplace. We have already provided voluntary guidance to help employers. By 2006, we will legislate against age discrimination in the workplace. This timescale will allow us to consult extensively with employers, individuals, and expert groups on age positive practices, and on all aspects of the legislation.

<a name="11203w31.html_para1">We are committed to employment opportunity for all, regardless of age. For those over 50, there is a comprehensive range of back to work programmes, including new deal 50 plus, new deal 25 plus and the new deal for disabled people. Government support has ensured that the employment rate for the over 50s has increased each year for the last four years. Through new deal 50 plus alone, which was launched in April 2000, more than 51,000 people have been helped into work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will place a copy of each health authority's local modernisation review for 2002&#150;03 in the Library as soon as they are received.  [14713]<P>

<P>
<a name="11203w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> The purpose of the local modernisation reviews (LMR) is to engage local partners, frontline staff, and patients' representatives in reviewing what needs to be done to deliver national health service priorities locally. The outputs from this year's LMR will inform the annual planning round and the development of the 2002&#150;03 "Service and Financial Frameworks" (SaFFs). These frameworks set out the levels of NHS activity and resources allocated to achieve the local health system's contribution to national targets for the coming year. NHS organisations will sign accountability agreements in relation to delivering their contribution to the 2002&#150;03 SaFF.
<P>

<a name="11203w32.html_para3">LMRs are local planning exercises. The Department itself does not receive copies of these documents. We are unable, therefore, to place copies of LMRs in the Library. External scrutiny to the LMR process has been secured through local peer review and involvement by lay members of the local modernisation boards.

 There are currently 20 national health service trusts taking part in the modernising NHS hearing aid services project, as listed in the table.
<P>

<a name="11203w32.html_para4">It is too early to say when a specific trust might be involved in the project. Evaluation of the project by the Institute of Hearing Research is on-going. Subject to favourable evaluation, the Department, on advice from the project's implementation team, will make decisions about how best to spread the modernised services. Trusts would be invited to be part of the project on the basis of geographical spread, preparedness to modernise, and the commitment of the local health community to the aims of the project.

 The National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease, revised in the Chief Medical Officer's Update in February 2001, sets out the policy for the prescribing of statins. The first priority is to ensure that people with established CHD are treated with statins to lower their cholesterol level either below 5.0 mmol/l or to reduce total serum cholesterol by 20&#150;25 per cent., whichever would result in the lowest level. (The equivalent figures for LDL cholesterol would be 3.0 mmol/l or by a 30 per cent. reduction, whichever 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2001 : Column: 119W</I><P>
results in the lowest level.) The next step is the treatment of those without diagnosed CHD but whose risk of a cardiac event is greater than 30 per cent. over 10 years.

<i></i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]: The NHS Cancer Plan published in September 2000 identifies two important areas where cancer prevention activity should be focused.

<a name="11203w33.html_para6">Those plans include how they are going to improve overall survival rates including smoking cessation initiatives, extended cancer screening and extension of fruit pilots. The health authority is also currently achieving high standards for urgent referral of patients with suspected cancer. In addition there are a raft of plans in the pan-Birmingham network which are addressing survival rates for all cancers, in which Sandwell health authority is included.

The first 17 PCTs began operating on 1 April 2000. There are currently 164 PCTs in operation and more are being established to become operational on 1 April 2002. A full list of these organisations has been placed in the Library.

 The establishment of primary care groups was funded using moneys released by the abolition of general practitioner fundholding. The previous Government had set aside an annual budget of &#163;180 million to run fundholding. We have used those moneys both to set up primary care groups and to improve services to patients. Approximately &#163;150 million additional moneys was used following the establishment of primary care groups.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what was the average time during which looked after children were held in care under the responsibility of local authorities in the last 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the trend.  [19203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w36.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 2001]:</i> The table provides figures on the average number of care days per child, together with the number of children looked after at any time in the year, and the total number of care days provided, for looked after children in years ending 31 March 1996 and 31 March 2000. The figures are broken down according to legal status.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para0">The figures show that the average number of days in care per child in a year has increased.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para1">Long-term trends show that although the total number who are looked after at any time in the year has been increasing in recent years, annual totals for the number who started to be looked after and the number who ceased to be looked after in the previous 12 months have both been slightly decreasing over the same period.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para2">At the beginning of 2001 the Department commissioned the Thomas Coram Research Unit (Institute of Education, University of London) to conduct a tightly focused research study into the reasons that lie behind this increase in the number of children looked after by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para3">The research is designed to assess, among other things, the extent to which drug taking, alcoholism, violence and mental health problems within the family may have been significant factors underlying decisions made by Courts and local authorities to look after children.

 <i>[holding answer 29 November 2001]:</i> At present the social services inspectorate inspects services using standards. In November 2000 the social services inspectorate produced an inspection report "Adopting Changes: Survey and Inspection of Local Councils' Adoption Services", a copy of which is available in the Library. The report provides comprehensive and up-to-date information about the current position, examples of good practice and a checklist for councils to use to review their services.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para4">One of the 50 personal social services performance assessment framework indicators directly relates to adoption (the percentage of children looked after adopted during the year, indicator reference C23).
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para5">The social services inspectorate assesses each council's performance every year, taking into account evidence from indicators, inspections and other sources. Assessment of adoption services is included as part of this overall assessment. Next year, the overall assessment will be published in the form of a star rating for each council.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para6">We are currently developing additional monitoring mechanisms including collecting information on the types of adoption support services made available by councils at present. This is intended to help councils benchmark their services against those of other councils. In addition, the adoption and permanence task force has published an audit tool (available at www.doh.gov.uk/adoption) to help councils review their adoption support services and identify possible areas for development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11203w36.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 2001]:</i> The main financial implications of the Adoption and Children Bill for local authorities lie in the provisions on adoption support, the independent review mechanism, access to information, special guardianship, the Adoption and Children Act Register and the new system of placement for adoption. In each case, any additional costs will be proportionate to the improvements in the level of service provided to people affected by adoption.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para9">Voluntary adoption agencies will principally be affected by the provisions in the Bill on the Adoption and Children Act Register, the independent review mechanism and consistent access to information. The regulatory impact assessment describes the expected impact of the Bill on voluntary adoption agencies in more detail. This is not expected to be significant. The Bill will not create any additional costs for adoptive parents and in practice will ensure that many more adoptive families get the financial and other support they need.
<P>

<a name="11203w36.html_para10">We have already made available an extra &#163;66.5 million for adoption over three years. The resources required to implement the Adoption and Children Bill will also be addressed as part of the forthcoming spending review.

 Since NHS Direct was launched in March 1998 it has handled over 8,000,000 calls. This calendar year alone it has handled over 4,500,000 calls, averaging 90,000&#150;100,000 calls a week. NHS Direct call volume data are collected as a figure for the total population area covered by a particular site and not by rural/urban split. Out of the 4,500,000 calls made to NHS Direct this calendar year, 38 per cent. of callers were advised to see their general practitioner, and 11 per cent. advised to visit a hospital.
<P>

<a name="11203w38.html_para2">NHS Direct has not been set up to merely reduce demand on other health services. It is about making sure that patients get to the right service at the right time, and giving people reassuring clinical advice so that they can look after themselves if that is the appropriate thing to do.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much money has been allocated to local authorities in England for 2002&#150;03 in relation to the transfer of responsibility for preserved rights cases from 8 April 2002; of that sum, how much relates <i>(a)</i> to the sum that is transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions relating to what would have been paid through income support and <i>(b)</i> to the costs of the shortfall between the preserved rights income support rates and existing care homes as stated in the draft guidance to local authorities regarding the abolition of preserved rights; on what basis the sum allocated to cover the shortfall referred to in (b) has been allocated between local authorities; and whether the basis for the sum allocated to cover the shortfall referred to in (b) reflects the variations in shortfall between local authorities.  [17250]<P>

<P>
<a name="11203w38.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Local authorities in England will receive additional funding of &#163;614 million in 2002&#150;03 because of the transfer to them from 8 April next year of responsibility for people with preserved rights. Of this sum, &#163;528 million is a transfer from the Department for Work and Pensions. It represents the difference between what the DWP estimate they would have spent on income support, attendance allowance and disability living allowance on preserved rights residents under the current arrangements and what they estimate will be spent on Income Support for such residents under the new system. The remaining &#163;86 million is intended to meet the cost to authorities of carrying out care assessments and the estimated shortfall between preserved rights income support rates and the care home fees of the residents concerned. We shall announce as part of the Local Government Finance Settlement how we intend to allocate these resources between individual local authorities.

 Through the National Strategy for Carers, we are making resources available to help carers. We introduced the Carers Grant in 1999, the sole purpose of which is to enable local councils to enhance provision of community care and children's services and in particular to enable carers to take a break from their caring role. To reach the NHS Plan target of ensuring that 75,000 more carers receive a break by 2004, the Carers Grant will increase from &#163;70 million this year to &#163;100 million in financial year 2003&#150;04.

Over &#163;400 million of the &#163;1.4 billion represents funds for a range of reforms to the long-term care system which we have introduced. These reforms will assist pensioners with the costs of long-term care and many of them have already been enacted. Free nursing care in nursing homes for current self-funders was introduced from October, as has a system of deferred payments to avoid people having to sell their homes when they first enter residential care. Since April the value of a property has been disregarded for 12 weeks when undertaking the residential care means test.

<a name="11203w38.html_para7">The NHS Plan makes clear that intermediate care is a priority service for older people. This was reinforced in the National Service Framework for Older People. Intermediate care has an important role to play in tackling delayed transfers of care. A recent survey indicates that good progress is being made towards meeting the NHS Plan targets for intermediate care&#151;by 2004 an extra 5,000 intermediate care beds and 1,700 supported places, together benefiting an additional 150,000 older people.
