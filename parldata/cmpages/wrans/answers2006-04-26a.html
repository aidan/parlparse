<i>[holding answer 24 April 2006]:</i> I recognise that any drought order made to restrict use of water may impact on how sporting facilities and clubs maintain their grounds. However, serious drought is an exceptional event and provisions must be in place to allow water companies to fulfil their duty to supply water to domestic customers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60426w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_40">Drought orders can be made only after careful consideration of all the issues raised by objectors to an application. A hearing will normally be held by an independent Inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. Objectors have the opportunity to be heard by the Inspector. In determining the application the Secretary of State will take into account the objections raised and the Inspector&#039;s recommendations.

This study indicated that post-1974 UDR widows were no worse off than their RUC counterparts and most are somewhat better off. The pre-1974 widows of part-time soldiers were slightly worse off when their main pension and compensation benefits are compared to that of their counterparts. However, the comparison did not take into account a number of other factors. For example, armed forces occupational widows pensions are paid for life and war widows pensions and special payments are paid tax-free and disregarded when calculating income-related and housing benefits. If these factors were taken into account case by case, the UDR widows would generally not be worse off than their RUC counterparts.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question about the effectiveness of the Enterprise Adviser Service. Initial evaluations from the Lead LSCs responsible for the delivery of the service have been very positive. The first two years of the service involved Enterprise Advisers working with nearly 1000 secondary schools in the most disadvantaged areas. This work was subsequently built on with the 2005&#150;06 re-focus of the service which brought more schools within its remit. Initial evaluations suggest that over 2000 schools are now within the scope of the service.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">Evaluations from the Lead LSCs and the Regional Enterprise Advisers all suggest that this service has had significant impact and is valued by the Head teachers and staff with whom they are working. The Enterprise Advisers were recruited from a largely private sector back-ground and as such have brought a significantly different perspective and skills set to schools. The knowledge, skills, experience and enthusiasm of the Enterprise Advisers has been a positive addition to the field of enterprise in education. Specific DfES resources for the service are due to end at the end of this academic year and the LSC is looking at how best to embed the good practice that has been fostered through this service into local and regional enterprise activity.</p>

In their first two to three years programmes were building up their services and, generally, did not operate at peak levels until the third or fourth year.

Notes:<br>

1. The north west has been interpreted as the area covered by the north west Government office region.<br>

2. Some weather stations cover areas which straddle regional or country boundaries. Any weather station which covered part of the north west or part of England has been included, even if it covered part of another region or country as well.<br>

3. The number of weather stations and the areas they cover have changed slightly over the years.<br>

4. The number of people who qualify for a cold weather payment varies greatly by weather station. For example, for weather stations covering England which triggered payment in 2005&#150;06, the number of people who qualified per weather station varied from an estimated 8,000 (for a weather station covering an area straddling England and Scotland) to an estimated 141,000.<br>

 Between 1976 and the early 1990&#039;s the UK carried out a major Geothermal Research Programme at a cost in excess of &#163;50 million. The key conclusions from the programme were that the UK is unlikely to see major developments based upon geothermal aquifers or the hot dry rock (HDR) method due to a limited resource, poor economics and limited scope for their application.

 The Forensic Science Service (FSS) has reviewed its records and has not identified any completed cases since 2000, in which evidence was lost or misinterpreted.

The FSS has identified two cases within this time period where timeliness of the identification of evidence could have been improved.

 We continue to follow closely the political situation in Uzbekistan.
