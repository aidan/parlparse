<a name="30318w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations he has received in opposition to the de-trunking of the A696 in Northumberland; and if he will hold a public enquiry into the proposal.  [102843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Initially 11 objections to the draft orders published on 23 August 2001 were received from Northumberland County Council, Tynedale District Council, Scottish Executive, Northumberland National Park, Freight Transport Association, five parish councils and a private individual. Tynedale District Council, Scottish Executive and Freight Transport Association subsequently withdrew their Objections.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para0">Negotiations continue with Northumberland County Council, which will be the highway authority after detrunking, over the future funding of the A696/A68 and it would therefore be premature of me to comment on whether there will be a public inquiry into the proposal before these discussions are concluded.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations he has received on restrictions on the use of flashing amber beacons on motor vehicles on the public highway; what plans he has to change the regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [103476]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Department of Transport regularly receives requests for clarification of the regulations on the use of flashing amber beacons on motor vehicles. In the past five years only one request has been made for these regulations to be extended. This was to permit amber warning beacons to be fitted to vehicles which are used for the purposes of rescuing animals injured on the roads, as they sometimes need to stop on the highway.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para1">A consultation exercise is currently being carried out on proposals to permit recovery operators to use red rear flashing lights in conjunction with amber beacons at the scene of a breakdown.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para2">The Government has no immediate plans for any further amendments to the regulations on amber beacons on road vehicles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We receive a wide range of correspondence about the use of motorised wheelchairs on the highway from disabled people themselves as well as from other pedestrians and motorists. A proportion of that correspondence is expressing concern about safety issues.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para3">In response to these concerns I will shortly be launching a review of the law which currently governs the construction of these vehicles and their use on the highway. The review will cover the full range of issues that have been raised with the Department, including the case for compulsory insurance for the users of motorised wheelchairs. We will be seeking the views of users and all other stakeholders before drawing any conclusions about possible changes to current arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para4">I will publish the results of the Review once it is complete, which I would hope to be later this year.

<P>
<a name="30318w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister of State announced on 27 July 2001 that the M42 between Junctions 3a and 7 had been chosen as a pilot site for Active Traffic Management (ATM). The pilot offers the potential to allow carefully controlled use of the hard shoulder as a running lane during congested periods. The outcome of the pilot will be assessed very thoroughly before any policy decision is taken about the more general use of the hard shoulder as a running lane. The hard shoulder is routinely used as a running lane during motorway maintenance.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para7">The Health and Safety Executive regularly provide input into the standards applied when the hard shoulder is used as a running lane during motorway maintenance. They will be consulted about its use as part of the M42 ATM Project when the Highways Agency has developed its proposals more fully.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para8">The Highways Agency has met with and discussed the proposals for the M42 ATM with the local fire service. There is a programme of ongoing liaison with the emergency services to discuss matters in more detail.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para9">The Highways Agency has arranged a number of exhibitions and local presentations and has generally received favourable feedback on the proposals to use the hard shoulder as a running lane on the M42. As part of this assessment a range of surveys will be undertaken to assess motorists' opinions on the scheme. A driver simulator has also been developed and this was displayed at the 2002 Birmingham International Motor Show. Again, a favourable response to the use of the hard shoulder was received.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para10">The controlled use of the hard shoulder in the M42 ATM Project is not expected to result in an increase in the costs to the public funds with regard to insurance, 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 620W</I><P>
medical costs, care of dependants or time off work. Extensive monitoring as part of the M42 ATM Project will be undertaken to quantify the actual impact of the scheme. The proposals are subject to an ongoing assessment and safety audits have already been undertaken as part of the design process.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para11">The proposal for use of the hard shoulder under controlled motorway conditions on the M42 is being designed with safety in mind. Hard shoulder running will only be allowed when a lower speed limit is in place and control room staff have ensured that the hard shoulder is clear. There will be emergency refuge areas, equipped with emergency roadside telephones, installed at regular intervals for motorists that breakdown or require assistance.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para12">I have asked the Highways Agency to place in the Library copies of the reports, listed as follows, that have been assessed in relation to the use of the hard shoulder as a running lane.

<a name="30318w01.html_para13">It is not envisaged that there will be an increase in the injury accident rate through the controlled use of the hard shoulder for the M42 ATM project. Extensive monitoring of the M42 project will be undertaken to quantify the actual impact of the scheme on safety. The safety of drivers and those concerned with the operation and maintenance of the road will be a major consideration.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para14">The Highways Agency is in the process of discussions with various motoring organisations about different aspects proposed for the M42 pilot. These discussions are on-going.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para15">The M42 ATM Project has received initial funding of &#163;40 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund to cover the ATM infrastructure construction costs. An initial estimate of &#163;3.2 million per annum was made for the future maintenance and operational costs for the project.
<P>

<a name="30318w01.html_para16">No meetings have yet been held with the Transport and General Workers Union or other trade unions to discuss the safety implications of hard shoulder running in general or on the M42 ATM Project. The advanced signalling and monitoring equipment being installed on the M42 will provide the ability to close lanes and provide advanced warning of incidents on the M42. This infrastructure will allow the protection of road users involved in incidents and will support existing maintenance activities which is likely to be especially beneficial in reducing risk to traffic management operatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what special measures are being taken to vet the crews of ships chartered by his Department from overseas countries where there are security considerations.  [103638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is not possible to vet the crews of commercial ships chartered from overseas countries, due to a combination of circumstances which include: non-residency in the United Kingdom, the rapid turn-over of crew members and the short notice nature of the Ministry of Defence charter requirements. Special measures are taken when there are security considerations and these can include the placing of a UK military escort party on-board chartered commercial ships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimates the Government have made regarding the number of military personnel required to provide support to the civil authorities in response to a large scale <i>(a)</i> conventional and <i>(b)</i> chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack on the UK.  [103410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The primary responsibility for handling the consequences of any attack in the United Kingdom lies with the emergency services. The nature of any request they might make for military assistance will be determined by the type, scale, impact and location of the attack and the availability of civil resources. It is therefore not possible to make a specific estimate of the level of military support that might be requested. Information on the contingency plans for specialist Armed Forces responses to terrorist attacks is classified and details are therefore being withheld under Exemption la of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<a name="30318w02.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the defence of the United Kingdom from military attack, including air defence. The lead responsibility for security within the UK, including the response to the activities of terrorist groups, rests with the Home Office and the police. However, where appropriate, the Ministry of Defence responds positively to requests for military assistance from civil authorities, drawing on available resources. Although fluctuations do occur, a significant number of military personnel are stationed in the UK at any one time and we are also establishing a capability in the Reserve Forces to undertake military assistance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the main features are of the EU/NATO arrangements for EU access to NATO capabilities for EU-led operations; how they differ from the agreement concluded between WEU and NATO; and if he will make a statement.  [102676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 At the NATO summit at Washington in 1999, the Alliance declared that it stood ready to "define and adopt the necessary arrangements for ready access by the European Union to the collective assets and capabilities of the Alliance, for operations in which the Alliance as a whole is not engaged militarily as an Alliance". The main features of the arrangements, known as "Berlin Plus", are assured EU access to NATO operational planning capabilities, and a 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 626W</I><P>
presumption of availability to the EU of pre-identified NATO capabilities and common assets for use in EU-led operations.
<P>

<a name="30318w03.html_para0">The North Atlantic Council (NAC) decided on 13 December 2002 that assured EU access to NATO's operational planning capabilities was effective immediately, and undertook to put in place the rest of the Berlin Plus arrangements swiftly. This has now been done.
<P>

<a name="30318w03.html_para1">The NATO/EU arrangements go beyond those established for the WEU in two important respects. First, because EU access to NATO operational planning is assured (i.e. continuous and guaranteed), NATO agreement is not required for any EU requests for NATO planning support; every WEU request would have required specific NAC approval. Second, there is a presumption that those NATO assets and capabilities that have been pre-identified will indeed be available to the EU. There was no such presumption under the NATO/WEU arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30318w03.html_para2">The implementation of the Berlin Plus arrangements is a manifestation of the genuine strategic partnership in crisis management which NATO and EU have decided to establish together.

[103452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 March 2003]:</i> The Ministry of Defence does not recognise "Gulf War Syndrome" as a medical condition. It accepts that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is related to their Gulf experience. A large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms have been reported by some Gulf veterans as well recognised medical conditions. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 627W</I><P>
that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or 'syndrome'. The MOD's approach must be guided by findings from the scientific and medical community. Primary health care records for the 53, 000 or so veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict are held by their doctors and are not accessible centrally for reason of patient confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="30318w03.html_para3">When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the MOD has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability arising to pay compensation we do so. The MOD has received about 2,000 notices of intention to claim from Gulf veterans, and members of their families in respect of illness allegedly arising from the Gulf conflict, but no writs or formal claims have yet been received. No compensation has therefore been paid following claims for Gulf veterans' illnesses.
<P>

<a name="30318w03.html_para4">The fact that there is, at present, no proper basis for recognising "Gulf War Syndrome" as an appropriate diagnostic label does not prevent a Gulf veteran from getting a war pension. A war pension can be paid for any disablement provided that a causal link to Service is accepted. Over 1,200 war pensions have been awarded to Gulf veterans by the Veterans Agency.

 The Ministry of Defence's approach to contracting for research is the same as that used for the other goods and services it purchases and there is no specific additional guidance on the management of defence research contracts. The MOD's general advice is freely available at http://www.dgcom.mod.uk

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many research contracts were placed by his Department with UK universities and other academic research centres in each of the last five years; and what their values were.  [102211]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w04.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence recognises the strong science and technology capability of United Kingdom universities as a source of innovation and knowledge of relevant research in the wider non-defence community. It is for this reason that MOD encourages universities to participate in the Defence Technology Centre Scheme.
<P>

<a name="30318w04.html_para2">The MOD has placed almost all of its research work over the past five years with DERA and, since July 2001, with DSTL and QinetiQ. In turn these organisations have sub-contracted with academia in a manner which ensures that the Department's needs are met in an integrated and cost effective manner. MOD does not hold centrally information about the numbers of sub-contracts placed by our contractors with either academia or industry and this could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30318w04.html_para3">Information is available, however, for contracts placed directly by the Department with academia for the past four years since the decision was made to increase the level of competition for research work. To date three universities have been awarded contracts valued at &#163;591,000. In addition 10 UK universities have received &#163;2.619 million for their role in successful consortia bidding into the research programme. A breakdown of these figures is given in the following table.

 Currently the Port Health Authorities, Local Authorities and the State Veterinary Service lead on enforcement of controls for detecting smuggled meat.

 In January 2000 the Government announced their aim for renewables to supply 10 per cent. of UK electricity in 2010, subject to the costs being acceptable to the consumer. We believe that renewable sources of energy will increasingly demonstrate that they can meet our energy needs at both an economically acceptable cost and in a carbon free way. On that basis, our aspiration is by 2020 to double renewables' share of electricity from our 2010 target and we will pursue policies to achieve this.

<a name="30318w06.html_para0">More than half the emissions reductions in our Climate Change Programme&#151;around 10 million tonnes of carbon per annum&#151;is expected to come from energy efficiency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Environment Council on 4 March 2003; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting records; and if she will make a statement.  [101747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w07.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I represented the UK at Environment Council on 4 March 2003, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. The Council reached a political agreement on one legislative measure, and also considered a number of other important issues.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para0">The Council reached a political agreement on the Forest Focus Regulation, which concerns forest monitoring, with the UK among its supporters. Italy, Spain, and Portugal would have preferred greater support for fire prevention measures, and therefore abstained. The Commission also withheld its support.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para1">We debated the Commission's proposals to revise the Bathing Water Directive, which would raise the required bathing water quality standards across the EU. There was general support for high standards where this would benefit the public, but widespread concern that the measures should be proportionate to the public health benefits sought, and flexible in their application. My right hon. Friend, the Minister for the Environment expressed concern over the soundness of the Commission's cost benefit analysis, and explained that, in the UK, illness related to bathing in sea waters is not a problem serious enough to feature in the public health surveillance system. Most bathing waters in the UK would already meet the higher standards proposed, but there would be high costs involved in ensuring compliance at all times for about 15 per cent. of beaches in England and Wales. There was a risk therefore that the proposals as currently drafted would incur disproportionate costs of compliance for comparatively little benefit. Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Germany, France and Austria all expressed similar concerns. There was wide support for more flexibility in the use of management measures to 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 643W</I><P>
implement the Directive. Most states also asked for greater clarity of definitions. There was no support for extending the scope of the Directive to waters used for other recreational purposes, and this was accepted by the Commission. The Presidency concluded that Council had given a sufficient steer for further progress to be achieved by the next Council, in June.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para2">Council also debated the proposed Environmental Liability Directive, and in particular the issues of financial security and biodiversity. I made it clear that the UK insurance industry did not support compulsory financial security. It would make little sense to make financial security compulsory if the market is unable to provide the necessary cover. There was support for this line of reasoning from Ireland, France, Italy, Netherlands, the Commission and Germany. There was also some support for a compromise proposed by the Greek Presidency, that compulsory financial security should be phased in. This was not an option I was able to support. On biodiversity, I put forward the view, also supported by France and Germany, that to be insurable and provide certainty, the scope of the Directive should be site-based. The remaining Members favoured extending the scope of the directive to cover all EU-protected biodiversity wherever it may, with an option to include nationally protected species too. The Presidency concluded that progress had been made towards reaching political agreement in June.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para3">We agreed Council Conclusions calling for a community strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment. The Commission reported on action taken in relation to the Prestige incident, and will present a full report to the European Council later this month. Council accepted a Spanish request asking the Commission to consider liability and sanctions in relation to the safety of marine transport. France and Spain also reported on the progress of clean-up operations.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para4">We also discussed the Council's contribution on Sustainable Development for the Spring European Council, and agreed a lengthy set of Conclusions, which included an emphasis on the need for implementation of the commitments made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg last September, and on the importance of encouraging the development of environmental technologies.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para5">Council also adopted Conclusions on the Fifth Pan-European Ministerial Conference "Environment for Europe", to be held in Kiev in May.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para6">The Commission gave an update on approvals of Genetically Modified Organisms, and their co-existence with conventional crops. It was announced that an option paper on co-existence by Commissioner Fischler would be released on 5 March, and a Round Table discussion would follow at the end of April.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para7">On approvals, Commissioner Walstrom noted that there are currently 19 applications in the process, which should be dealt with on a case by case basis. I supported the position of the Commission, along with Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland, that existing legislation is adequate for an orderly return to decision making. A number of other member states continued to argue against proceeding with authorisations until the 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 644W</I><P>
new traceability and labelling rules come into force. The Commissioner explained that it was unlikely that any authorisation would complete the process before the traceability and labelling rules came into force in any event. She emphasised the need to move the process forward, and that there is no justification for further delay.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para8">Denmark sought clarification from the Commission concerning its guidelines on the presence of metabolites in groundwater. The Commission confirmed that these are not legally binding, and that the expected groundwater directive will look into this issue.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para9">The Commission reported that it was on track with its long-awaited chemicals package, with an early interim consultation, followed by adoption by the Commission in early summer. It also formally presented its proposals on ozone depleting substances, a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds in paints.
<P>

<a name="30318w07.html_para10">Over lunch we discussed progress towards ratification of the Kyoto protocol.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have seen a report that the Soil Association and the Fairtrade Foundation were planning to announce an extension of the Fairtrade mark to British produce but I am unaware of any representations to government on this matter. For its part the Government are striving to rid agriculture of the constraints of price protection and production-related subsidies and to reconnect farmers with their markets. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food launched last December aims to help deliver this objective and sets out how Government, industry and others can work together to secure a more positive future for the food and farming industries. It contains a number of measures to help farmers reconnect with their customers and the rest of the food chain, to improve co-operation and performance, and to enhance training and opportunities to learn from best practice. The Government also remain determined to secure market-oriented reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy and through the WTO.

<P>
<a name="30318w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Commission has made no authoritative estimates in these areas. Indicative figures provided by the Commission last May, of the scale of decommissioning implied by their proposals for recovery plans, have been challenged by a number of member states.

<a name="30318w08.html_para0">The development of effective detection methods to distinguish the species content of meal intended for feed is a priority for Defra. The Commission has indicated that they are prepared to re-consider the current ban on fishmeal in ruminant feed once such a test has been validated. Full validation of a new test technique, however, is likely to take some time to achieve. In addition to the on-going development work, there are assessments being made both in the European context and in the UK to examine the currently available technology.

 The decision to abolish local authority social housing grant was taken in light of the increased provision for investment in existing and new affordable housing announced in "Sustainable Communities: building for the future". LASHG was a funding mechanism used by many rural authorities, among others, but they should not lose out under the new arrangements. By 2006, the money available for housing will be nearly 50 per cent. higher than this year.

 Professor Montgomery's report, entitled "The Northern Ireland Irish Hare Survey 2002", was received by my Department on 14 February 2003.
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para7">The report provides a current population estimate and compares these results with data collected in a 1997 survey. It also assesses the merits of two survey techniques and makes recommendations for future Irish hare monitoring. Professor Montgomery's team concludes that a method of survey known as 'Night Driven Transect Survey' allows a reliable estimate of hare abundance to be calculated.
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para8">The 2002 Night Driven Transect Survey produced an average density estimate of one hare per square kilometre in Northern Ireland, an estimate similar to that reported in 1997. The present report concludes that hares are widespread and are found most frequently in upland areas. Hares were more frequently recorded in County Antrim during the survey and were less frequent in County Tyrone. The survey technique is not a census and so the sample survey gives an estimate of 14,000 hares for Northern Ireland, with lower 95 per cent. confidence limit of 7,000 and an upper confidence limit of 25,200.
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para9">Professor Montgomery concludes, "That the population of Irish hares appears to be stable, albeit at a low density."
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para10">The contract also required the Queen's University Team to make recommendations for practical measures which could improve the status of the Irish Hare in the medium to long term. One of the recommendations was as follows: "Removal of the Irish Hare from the quarry list and protection given under the Wildlife Order."
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para11">In the Irish Hare Species Action Plan, published by DOE in October 2000, a number of actions are listed for consideration. Section 5 deals with Policy and Legislation and Action 5.1.3 recommends that DOE "Review, and if necessary, increase the level of protection given to the Irish Hare in the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985". My Department has appointed consultants to consider the implications of local Biodiversity Action Plan recommendations on the legal status of species, including the Irish hare, and recommend changes where appropriate. I will ensure that the consultants give very careful consideration to Professor Montgomery's recommendation to remove the Irish Hare from the quarry list. The report resulting from this contract is due in June 2003.

<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para13">The Irish hare, Lepus timidus hibernicus, is an endemic sub-species, confined to Ireland, of the mountain hare, which has a widespread distribution across northern Europe.
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para14">The best evidence available suggests a major decline in Irish hare numbers in Northern Ireland during the latter half of the 20th century. This decline has been largely attributed to a loss of suitable habitat brought about mainly by agricultural intensification and changing patterns of grassland management.
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para15">A comprehensive estimate of the population density of Irish hares throughout Northern Ireland was published in 1997. That survey reported that the Irish hare had a widespread distribution and occurred at low densities.
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para16">The Environment and Heritage Service responded to the findings of the report by publishing a Species Action Plan in 2000 that listed a number of specific measures geared "to maintain the existing range and to demonstrate a population increase by 2005; and to double the present population by 2010 over as much of the range as possible."
<P>

<a name="30318w09.html_para17">To assess achievement of the Species Action Plan targets, and to have current information on the distribution and abundance of Irish hares, requires a system of regular and effective monitoring of population density and distribution.

The additional funds provide the opportunity for the MRC to accelerate research on autism, building on existing strengths and addressing gaps, which were identified in the report. It will complement and add to the MRCs current support for research in this field.<P>

<a name="30318w10.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what funding he has allocated to social service departments to support those with autism and Asperger Syndrome and their carers in each of the last five years.  [102931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w10.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Our increased investment in personal social services in England in recent years will benefit people with autism as well as everyone else who needs them. Details are set out in the table. Amounts for specific conditions are not separately identified within allocations to social services departments. Health bodies and local authorities should ensure that the particular health and social care needs of each person with autism and Asperger's Syndrome are met with genuine choices for both clients and families, through the most appropriate community based services, in a cost-effective way.
<P>

<a name="30318w10.html_para2">In 1999&#150;2000, we introduced the new children's services grant, whose purpose is to help local authorities implement the Quality Protects programme and in particular to improve the life chances of looked after children and children in need. Disabled children, including those with autism, have been made a priority area in the programme.
<P>

<a name="30318w10.html_para3">Since the carers grant was introduced in 1999, it has provided an extra &#163;225 million over four years to increase the number of breaks for carers. In recognition of the importance placed on supporting carers, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, announced in July 2002 that the grant has been extended for a further three years to 2005&#150;06. During this time it will provide extended care and 130,000 further breaks to carers.
<P>

<a name="30318w10.html_para4">Details of the past and proposed future amounts of both grants are shown in the table.

 The national health service has made contingency plans for the deliberate use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. These plans are kept under careful and continuous review. Overall responsibility for CBRN planning rests with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary.

<a name="30318w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 During the year 2002&#150;03, 93.5 per cent, of the cost of Department of Health and Food Standards Agency (FSA) led initiatives to improve the nation's eating habits was allocated specifically to improving children's diets.
<P>

<a name="30318w11.html_para2">Funding for Department-led programmes aimed at improving children's diets totals &#163;140.98 million, including the National School Fruit Scheme, with funding from the New Opportunities Fund, Food in Schools, in conjunction with the Department for Education and Skills, Welfare Foods and support for breastfeeding. The FSA has provided funding of &#163;0.58 million as part of its nutrition action plan to support initiatives aimed at improving the diet and nutrition of children.

<a name="30318w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not had the opportunity to visit any hospice whose sole remit is the care of terminally ill children. Should an opportunity arise to undertake such a visit he would give it his full consideration.
<P>

<a name="30318w11.html_para5">Richard House Children's Hospice in East London was visited in March 2002 by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health, the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) only holds data for admitted patient care in England's National Health Service hospitals and therefore data is not available for home care. Collection of data at ward level is not mandatory and therefore is not available.

<P>

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has lead responsibility for this proposal on official feed and food controls. I am advised by the FSA that the proposal is for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council and as such, once adopted, its 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 660W</I><P>
provisions will be directly applicable in all the Member States. This includes the provisions on imports from outside the European Union of foodstuffs of non-animal origin. The FSA's understanding of these provisions is that Member States will be required to collect fees for the costs incurred by the competent authorities from the importer or his customs agent. Clarification will be needed during the negotiations, which have not yet started. The FSA commenced a full public consultation on 12 March so that the views of all stakeholders may be taken into account in assessing the implications of the provisions and in developing the United Kingdom policy position on this and other issues arising from the proposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has lead responsibility for this proposal on official feed and food controls. I am advised by the FSA that it will seek to ensure that the proposal takes account of the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In practice this means ensuring that Community action will not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty and that decisions are taken at the lowest level consistent with effective action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research has been commissioned by his Department into the costs and implications for product characteristics of the reformulation of food supplements in those cases where nutrient sources in use in the United Kingdom are not included in the lists of permitted nutrients set out in the annexes to the food supplements directive.  [103003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government have not commissioned any research into the costs and implications for product characteristics of reformulation of food supplements in those cases where nutrient sources currently used are not on the list of permitted sources. Information gathered by the Food Standards Agency in preparing the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the draft Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 provides estimates of the costs of reformulation up to &#163;3,000 per product.

<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government have not made its own assessment of the potential costs involved in the production of dossiers for submission to the European Food Safety Authority. Industry cost estimates, provided to the Food Standards Agency during consultation, suggest that they might be &#163;80,000 to &#163;250,000 per dossier where significant safety data are not already available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> individual companies, <i>(b)</i> trade organisations and <i>(c)</i> consumer bodies about nutrients which are permitted for use in food supplements in the United Kingdom, but which are omitted from the lists of permitted nutrients set out in annexes 1 and 2 of the Food Supplements Directive.  [103005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A number of individual companies, trade organisations and lobby groups have recently suggested that the Government should seek an amendment to the Food Supplements Directive to allow the continued sale in the United Kingdom of safe and appropriately labelled food supplements even if they lie outside the technical restrictions of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="30318w11.html_para6">During negotiations, the Government fought hard to secure the provisions in Article 4 of the Directive, which enable member states to allow the continued sale of products that do not comply with the compositional requirements up to 31 December 2009, provided certain criteria are met. The Government are taking advantage of these provisions and have no plans to seek a further amendment to the Directive. Negotiations were finished some time ago and it is not likely either that the Commission would be willing to reopen them now or that there would be support from a majority of other member states for such an amendment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what steps his Department and the Food Standards Agency intend to take to address technical difficulties and financial costs associated with the production of dossiers for consideration by the European Food Safety Authority in relation to nutrients which are not included in the list of permitted ingredients for use in food supplements set out in Schedules 2 and 3 of the proposed Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003;  [103007]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether his Department and the Food Standards Agency have made representations to <i>(a)</i> the European Commission and <i>(b)</i> the EU Scientific Committee for Foods in relation to the technical difficulties and financial costs associated with the production of dossiers for consideration by the European Food Safety Authority of nutrients which are not included in the list of permitted ingredients for use in food supplements set out in Annexes 1 and 2 of the Food Supplements Directive.

 The Government are not able to address the financial issues associated with the production of safety dossiers for consideration by the European Food Safety Authority. The Food Standards Agency has written to the European Commission with the aim of

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the number and value of food supplement products on the UK market which contain nutrients omitted from Annexe1 of the Food Supplements Directive and for which no nutrient sources are listed in Annexe 2 of the Directive.  [103008]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government have not made an assessment of the number of products on the United Kingdom market which contain nutrients and nutrient sources omitted from Annexes 1 and 2 of the Food Supplements Directive. In the UK, the retail market for vitamins, minerals and other supplements was valued at &#163;335 million in 2000. Industry estimates suggest that up to 5 per cent. of the market may be affected, indicating a value in the region of &#163;16.75 million.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what nutrients are on the market in the United Kingdom as ingredients in food supplements but are not listed in Schedules 2 and 3 of the proposed Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 recently published by the Food Standards Agency; how long each of them have been on sale in the UK; and whether representations are under preparation by manufacturers for submission to the European Food Safety Authority for consideration as possible additions to those annexes.  [103009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w11.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 According to information provided by industry, the nutrients boron, cobalt, nickel, silicon, tin and vanadium are used as ingredients of food supplements currently on the market in the United Kingdom and are not listed in Schedules 2 and 3 of the draft Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 issued for consultation in October 2002. The most recent information received by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) from industry indicates that manufacturers are not preparing safety dossiers for any of these nutrients. The FSA does not hold information on how long each of these nutrients has been on the UK market as ingredients of food supplements.

<a name="30318w14.html_para1">Last year's "Quality Protects" management action plans (MAPS) show that local authorities are beginning to improve the services they provide to disabled children, including the provision of more family support services, such as home-based respite care and sitting services, and better planning and delivery of services jointly with health and education. There has also been an increase in the number of families being supported. In late 2001, the children in need survey found that social services were supporting 29,700 disabled children: a 2 per cent. increase on the position in 2000. The introduction of direct payments for parents with disabled children is enabling greater choice and greater control over the way services are delivered. Next year, in 2003&#150;04, the "Quality Protects" money earmarked for disabled children will double: from &#163;15 million to &#163;30 million.

<a name="30318w14.html_para2">We are also increasing the provision of short-term breaks through the carers' grant, which was first introduced in 1999 in order to provide breaks for carers, including parents of disabled children. Last year children's social services provided 52,400 carers with short-term breaks funded by this grant: an increase of 21,400 from the previous year. The majority of those receiving a short-term break were parents of disabled children. The grant is increasing on a yearly basis. This year the grant is &#163;85 million. Next year it will rise to &#163;100 million, and by 2005&#150;06 it will have risen to &#163;185 million.
<P>

<a name="30318w14.html_para3">The Government are providing funding to Contact a Family, of &#163;500,00 per annum, to run a national information centre for parents of disabled children. The free 0808 national telephone help and advice line has been widely used. In the year ending 31 March 2002, it had received nearly 9,000 calls. By the end of 2004, it is estimated that this figure will have risen to 21,000 a year.

<a name="30318w14.html_para4">Ministers and officials hold regular discussions with groups representing parents of disabled children about the development and implementation of policy including the implementation of the "Quality Protects" programme and the development of the children's national service framework (NSF).

This includes two parents of disabled children and representatives from the Council for Disabled Children, Contact a Family, SCOPE, MENCAP and the Association of Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus.

<sup>(7)</sup> New tax credits consist of the Child Tax Credit and the Working Tax Credit, which will be introduced from April 2003.

Between Budget 2002 and the 2002 Pre-Budget Report, the estimated split of total tax credits between that scored as tax and that scored as public expenditure was revised, with the negative tax element now about &#163;2 billion a year higher from 2003&#150;04 onwards. This accounts for almost all of the change seen in Table B9. These revisions are balanced by changes in the public expenditure element of tax credits, and have no overall impact on the current balance or net borrowing. In 2003&#150;04, the tax credit line in Table B17 (&#163;11.7 billion) mainly consists of the public expenditure elements of the new tax credits (&#163;7.6 billion) and child allowances in Income Support and Jobseekers' Allowance (&#163;3.7 billion). The remaining &#163;0.4 billion consists of the tax credits accruals adjustments, charities transitional relief, stakeholder pensions and the public expenditure elements of WFTC, DPTC and LAPRAS.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w17.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 When installed during the construction of a house, water sprinkler systems benefit from the general VAT zero rate that applies to the construction of new houses. Under the long-standing formal agreements with our European partners, the UK may keep its existing zero rates but may not extend their scope or introduce new ones. There is therefore no scope to remove VAT on the installation of water sprinkler systems in existing homes.

steps have been taken to correct the miscalculations; how much it has cost to correct the miscalculations; and if he will make a statement.  [102508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w17.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The small percentage of miscalculations in assessing applications for Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) arise for a variety of reasons, most commonly problems with the accuracy of the calculation of weekly or monthly earnings in the period leading up to the application. For the new Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, which supersede WFTC, entitlement is not based on earnings for a specified period immediately before the claim. Therefore, the reason for miscalculation within WFTC should be eliminated in future.
<P>

<a name="30318w17.html_para2">For the 2001&#150;02 financial year, the latest full year for which figures are available, over 90 per cent. of all WFTC applications were correctly assessed to the nearest penny. In those cases where a miscalculation is detected, action is taken to correct all underpayments and any overpayments that exceed one pound per week. No information is available on the cost of correcting these mistakes. As confirmed by the National Audit Office, the level of errors made in assessing WFTC applications is low in proportion to the aggregate amount paid.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w17.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions is working with the Inland Revenue to ensure that there is a seamless transition to the new tax credits system and that there is good liaison between the two organisations to ensure that awards of both tax credits and social security benefits are made promptly to people in the most urgent need. We do not expect to see increased claims for Social Fund alignment payments under the new tax credits.

<P>
<a name="30318w17.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The number of coal mine methane capture and generation plants which could be developed by private companies in the next three years is a decision for industry to make in the light of market conditions, and not a decision for government.

<P>
<a name="30318w17.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government recognise and value the benefits the coal mine methane industry provides by tapping the methane emissions from disused coal mines and putting them to good use for generation of electricity. We have already demonstrated this support through our securing exemption from the Climate Change Levy for electricity generated from CMM in last year's budget, and this is currently being cleared with the European Commission. In addition, we concluded from our investigations that the environmental benefits of CMM-use can also be rewarded using the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and hence we support the study DEFRA has commissioned to determine a baseline for CMM emissions that could enable it to qualify for this Scheme.

 We recognise that smaller generators have concerns about the NETA market that operates in England and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many responses to the DTI consultation on licence boundaries were received regarding Wales; and how many expressed support for licence boundaries to include areas totally within the boundaries of the devolved Administration.  [103456]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2003]:</i> 19 responses were received to the consultation. Two of these expressed support for a licence boundary following the border of Wales &#151; those from MLL, a telecoms provider, and the Welsh Advisory Committee on Telecommunications.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w18.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what criteria were used by the Government to decide the allocation of regions for the auction of 3.4GHz wireless broadband licences; and if she will make a statement about the proposal to disregard the geographical Welsh border.  [103458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2003]:</i> The 3.4GHz licence packaging was designed to increase competition and availability of broadband services across the UK. The licence regions were drawn up following market and economic studies to be as economically viable and inclusive as possible, maximising the potential development of sustainable wireless services and the broadband market throughout the UK.
<P>

<a name="30318w18.html_para3">Dividing up spectrum at 3.4GHz along the lines of funded regions, as suggested by the Welsh National Assembly, would produce more areas of the UK with no coverage. It would also lead to a lower capacity&#151;that is, fewer broadband customers in Wales who can be supported, given the spectrum available.

<a name="30318w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2003]</i>: Consultation on the allocation of 3.4GHz public fixed wireless access (PFWA) licences began on 19 December 2000, when the Radiocommunications Agency ("RA"), 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2003 : Column 688W</I><P>
on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, published a consultative document entitled "3.4 and 10 GHz: Scenarios for Spectrum Packaging and Delivery". This consultation document presented a number of scenarios for packaging and delivering licences to establish and use stations and apparatus for wireless telegraphy in the 3.4 and 10GHz bands for the provision of Fixed Wireless Access services ("FWA").
<P>

<a name="30318w18.html_para4">Following a detailed review of the responses to the December consultation document and the completion of further technical studies in the 3.4GHz and 10GHz bands a further consultation document, "PFWA: Proposal by the RA to package and deliver licences at 3.4GHz", published in April 2002, set out the proposal to award spectrum licences for the 3.4GHz band.
<P>

<a name="30318w18.html_para5">Both consultations were carried out nationally and all Government Departments and devolved Administrations were invited, along with industry and the public, to be involved and comment on the proposals. Among the many comments received and meetings held, RA received input and held discussions with officials of the National Assembly for Wales on numerous occasions. This included a proposal from the Welsh Assembly Government for two licences to match EU objective funding areas in Wales. This proposal was included in the public consultation process alongside those of the Scottish Administration and RA.
<P>

<a name="30318w18.html_para6">Of the responses to the consultation, only one industry response expressed support for the proposals from the devolved Administrations, MLL, a telecoms provider with operations in Wales. One industry response to Government's consultation commented "creating two purely Welsh regions could result in insufficient market potential in viable geographic coverage spreads to justify serious bidding". The Welsh Advisory Committee on Telecommunications, part of the Welsh National Assembly, also expressed support.
<P>

<a name="30318w18.html_para7">Since the timetable of the award was announced there have been representations from Welsh National Assembly members about licence areas. Further consideration has been given to this issue but I believe the packaging, which has been accepted by the majority of industry, will produce the best outcome both for Wales and for the UK as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30318w18.html_para8">In particular, it will enable a larger number of users to be supported in Wales, given the spectrum available, than the alternative proposal.

 On 26 February I made the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations which will update and consolidate the regulation of security in the UK's civil nuclear industry. The regulations carry forward the main substance of the current regulatory regime, but bring the existing requirements together to provide a single, comprehensive legislative basis for regulation. They set requirements for the protection of nuclear and radiological material, whether on sites or in transit, against the risks of theft or sabotage, and for the

<P>

<a name="30318w19.html_para2">It is likely that the regulations will lead to minor additional one-off compliance costs to industry as a whole of around &#163;190,000, and annually recurring costs to industry as a whole of around &#163;115,000. There are also likely to be minor additional one-off costs to Government. The likely costs and benefits of the regulations are set out in a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Copies of this were placed in the Libraries of the House when the regulations were laid before Parliament.

 My officials are actively engaging with interested stakeholders, in particular through a planned rolling series of meetings at regional level. The first round of these meetings is focusing on explaining progress to date and identifying the issues which stakeholders wish to discuss. The second round, in the summer, will focus on how the NDA might work with stakeholders with a view to developing a draft stakeholder engagement framework which the NDA can build on once it is in place. This programme of regional events supplements existing arrangements for bilateral dialogue with stakeholders through the BNFL Stakeholder Dialogue and regular meetings with the nuclear regulators, trade unions, BNFL and UKAEA staff, Interested local authorities, environmental groups and the local liaison committees for individual sites.

<a name="30318w21.html_para37">An assessment of the likely impact of any release of radioactivity on the UK would be made immediately using all available information together with dispersion prediction modelling provided by the Meteorological Office. Using global weather information the current and forecast meteorological scenario would provide early estimates of the trajectory and the time of impact in the UK. This information when combined with environmental monitoring will allow the Government to assess projected levels of contamination and likely coverage.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what evaluation has been made of the impact of the detonation of a dirty radiological bomb in a city centre; what assessment has been made of the ways in which decontamination needed can be carried out; and what calculation has been made of the likely consequential costs of such a dirty bomb being used.  [101994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has well tried and tested contingency plans&#151;developed over many years&#151;for responding to a wide range of terrorist threats, including those which might involve the threatened or actual use of radiological materials.
<P>

<a name="30318w22.html_para0">At a national level, existing contingency plans for dealing with the aftermath of radiological emergencies arising from nuclear and other incidents have been reviewed and adapted to cater for the deliberate release of radioactivity, or 'dirty bombs' into the environment. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) takes the lead in maintaining these plans.
<P>

<a name="30318w22.html_para1">My right hon.

This is an approach which provides simple but effective decontamination for chemical, biological or radiological contaminants.

<P>

<a name="30318w22.html_para4">The terrorist threat remains real, and serious. As recent events have shown, no country is immune from attack, and it simply is not possible to guarantee against more attacks in the future. However, this Government are resolute in their determination to defeat terrorism regardless of its source.
<P>

<a name="30318w22.html_para5">The average time between application and initial decision was six months for initial decisions made in 2002. This has been calculated using all cases for which data are available, including older cases decided as part of the reduction of the backlog, as well as new cases. This compares to 20 months in 1997.

 The degree of preparedness of any voluntary organisation judged competent to work with the statutory agencies in handling the consequences of any civil emergency is a matter for assessment by the local authority and/or emergency service through which the voluntary organisation is registered and operates.

Asylum Act 1996 had not proved to be an effective deterrent in the prevention of illegal migrant working. We also outlined in our White Paper a new and comprehensive strategy for tackling the damaging consequences of illegal working which addressed the root of the problem.

<a name="30318w23.html_para6">In November 2002, I established an Illegal Working Steering Group, which includes representatives from a range of business sectors, the Trades Union's Congress and Commission for Racial Equality. The group has the potential to become a key player in the prevention of illegal working, by ensuring that there is greater awareness of the problems that this form of illegality creates. The group will also be involved in ensuring that the guidance for complying with the amended legislation will be clear, concise and practical.

<a name="30318w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The Home Department aims to meet its public service responsibilities in the most cost effective and efficient manner. To achieve this, consideration is given to Private Finance Initiatives (PFI), and Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to minimise financial risk and maximise benefit to the Public. The Home Department currently has a number of PFI Schemes in operation providing new Police Headquarters, Police Air Support Services, and Police Communications, and is negotiating a number of similar funding partnerships for public services in both the Police Service and the National Probation Service.

 In line with Prison Service Order 4950, each young offender institution has a child protection policy.

Local Child Protection arrangements are approved by the Area Child Protection Committee and complement existing procedures for safeguarding young people such as the anti-bullying strategy and the pastoral care arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of lone parents <i>(a)</i> are unable to work due to child care commitments and <i>(b)</i> have had to give up work because of a lack of available child care in the last six months.  [101048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The extent to which childcare commitments contribute directly to ability to work is a complex issue. Lone parents who work, as well as those who do not, report child care as a barrier to work. In a recent survey 52 per cent. of non-working lone parents reported a lack of child care in their area, compared to 45 per cent. of working lone parents; and 53 per cent. of non-working lone parents did not want to leave their child with anyone else, compared to 44 per cent. of working lone parents.
<P>

<a name="30318w25.html_para4">Information on the percentage of lone parents who have to give up work due to lack of available child care is not available. The most common reasons given for giving up work are health (27 per cent.), a personal decision to leave (15 per cent.) and being made redundant (12 per cent.). 6 per cent. of lone parents gave the breakdown of their child care arrangements as the reason for leaving work, but this does not mean necessarily that there was no child care available.
<P>

<a name="30318w25.html_para5">The New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) is providing specialist advice and support, including help with child care, to help lone parents make the move into work. Recent evaluation has shown that participation in NDLP more than doubles lone parents chances of moving into work. We are making work possible for lone parents by providing available affordable childcare through initiatives such as the National Childcare Strategy and our new Tax Credits are making sure that that work pays.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what organisations have been awarded the contract announced by the Department of Work and Pensions in July 2002 to narrow the 17 per cent. gap between the overall employment rate and that of ethnic minority people; and what timescale has been set for delivering the contracts.

 The Minority Ethnic Outreach initiative is part of our strategy to tackle the gap between the overall employment rate and the minority ethnic employment rate. Introduced in April 2002, the initiative aims to strengthen the support available to minority ethnic jobless people within five areas of the country with large minority ethnic populations. 45 organisations (through a total of 51 contracts) are contracted to deliver the service until the end of March 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what action he is taking to review <i>(a)</i> the starting point and <i>(b)</i> the tapered relief for set-off of occupational pension income against incapacity benefit;  [101722]

[101723]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="30318w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Incapacity benefit (IB) is intended to provide a measure of income replacement for sick and disabled people of working age. We believe it is therefore right to take some account of their occupational or personal pensions as they provide income replacements.
<P>

<a name="30318w26.html_para2">If a person claiming IB receives an occupational pension, personal pension or payments through a permanent health insurance scheme of &#163;85 per week or more, their IB is reduced by half the amount which exceeds &#163;85. These rules came into force for new claims after April 2001.

 On 10 January 2003 Lord Avebury wrote to my noble Friend Baroness Amos, informing her of his recent visit to Bahrain and his meeting with the Ruler, King Hamed. Lord Avebury handed the King a dossier compiled by Terry Mechan, about the case of his son, Richard Mechan, imprisoned for manslaughter. Lord Avebury has told us that the King agreed to review the case. In a further letter to Baroness Amos on 7 March, Lord Avebury asked if our Embassy in Bahrain could make inquiries with the King's Private Office as to what progress had been made.

 As I made clear in the House of Commons on 10 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 154, the UK does not encourage trade or investment in Burma. Companies wishing to trade or invest in Burma receive no assistance at all from the UK Government. Companies inquiring about trade or investment are told of our policy and advised of the appalling human rights situation and the economic incompetence and corruption of the Burmese regime. A combination of international opinion and the regime's economic incompetence means that there is hardly any new investment in Burma and that established companies, such as Premier Oil, have pulled out.

 We receive a regular flow of credible reports from non-governmental organisations and the United Nations&#151;including the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights&#151;that re-affirm our grave concern over the human rights situation in Burma, including abuses directed at the Shan, Karen and Karenni.

<a name="30318w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 A core aspect of UK and EU policy is action to press for an end to human rights abuses. Burmese ethnic minority groups, including the Shan, Karen and Karenni suffer the effects of this abuse disproportionately. The EU co-sponsored a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly in November 2002 that condemned the regime's human rights record. We are currently preparing a further resolution for presentation at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April.

 The number of refusals in Islamabad has increased with the resumption of interviews of family visit applicants on 2 December 2002.

 Liberian involvement in Cote d'Ivoire has contributed significantly to instability in the west of the country.

As a result, the Central Council of Magistrates' Courts' Committees and the Association of Justices' Chief Executives both sit on the steering group overseeing the development of the new organisation.
<P>

<a name="30318w29.html_para1">Local consultation is a key part of the overall consultation process. A series of one-day discussion groups across the country is being run by my Department. Court users, the local magistracy, the judiciary and court staff are represented on these groups. They are considering, amongst other things, include how the size and membership of court administration councils might vary across the country according to local circumstances, and how these members should be appointed. The results from these groups will be fed into the development of the court administration councils and will also be reported to Parliament during the parliamentary passage of the Courts Bill.

 According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), over 500,000 people have been displaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the beginning of 2002, due mainly to intensified violence in the north-eastern Ituri and eastern South Kivu regions Despite the ceasefire and withdrawal of foreign troops, over 2.5 million of about 50 million Congolese are now displaced. Main causes have been fighting between rebel groups, attacks on civilians and resource plundering. Current UN OCHA statistics as at August 2002 show the following breakdown of internally displaced people (IDPs): Equateur: 85,000 IDPs; Orientale: 250,000 IDPs; North Kivu: 760,000 IDPs; South Kivu: 435,000 IDPs; Katanga: 415,000 IDPs; Maniema: 160,000 IDPs; Eastern Kasai & Western Kasai: 130,000 IDPs; Kinshasa: 40,000 IDPs.

We are at present reviewing our strategies for post-conflict engagement in Rwanda, the DRC and Burundi in the light of recent regional developments. These documents will be made publicly available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w30.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 So far, 26 countries out of a total of 37 eligible countries have qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and will receive over US$62 billion in debt relief. Of these, seven countries (Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda) have reached Completion Point and have received irrevocable debt relief. The remaining 19 (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) are receiving interim relief on their debt repayments. We expect the bulk of these countries to reach Completion Point within the next two years when they, too, will receive full debt relief. It is difficult to predict when the other 11 countries will qualify for HIPC relief, as many are still affected by conflict and governance problems. We expect the Democratic Republic of the Congo to reach its Decision Point in the coming months, and the Central African Republic, Comoros and Cote d'lvoire

to do so later this year but, in some cases, this will depend on progress towards peace. The remaining countries (Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) are a long way from qualifying, as they are affected by conflict or have serious governance concerns.

<P>
<a name="30318w30.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is based on a set of clear and transparent rules, which countries entering the Initiative must meet. The IMF and the World bank work jointly with the governments of eligible countries on a debt sustainability analysis to determine their levels of debt. To qualify for relief, a country must have a debt sustainability ratio above one or other of the following HIPC thresholds: a debt stock of more than 150 per cent. of exports or of more than 250 per cent. of government revenue. Relief is provided to bring debt ratios down to these levels. This analysis is based on actual data on average exports over the previous three years and on central government revenues over the most recent year. Debt ratios reflect the impact of HIV/AIDS, droughts, and external shocks, such as changes in commodity prices, on a country's economy. Under the HIPC Initiative, additional relief&#151;so called 'topping up'&#151;can, when appropriate, be provided at Completion Point to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The UK is pressing for greater flexibility to ensure that this is provided wherever it is needed.

<P>
<a name="30318w30.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Zambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe have been deeply affected by a food security crisis brought about in part by an HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. This crisis has increased the number of people in poverty and deepened the poverty of those already poor. There are significant challenges in establishing and targeting households that are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, not least because of the stigma attached to the disease. There is also significant variation of need and general agreement that income support per se would therefore not be the most effective assistance.
<P>

<a name="30318w30.html_para3">Vulnerability assessments for all six countries show that HIV/AIDS affected households suffer from depletion of assets, reduced income, and increased expenditure on health and funerals, and that the presence of orphans decreases food security and other resources in already stressed households. HIV/AIDS affected households need support to counteract these impacts. This could be provided through home-based care that included community support, basic health care, sufficient food, help with income generation and assistance with access to education. DFID is working with governments in the region to reduce the vulnerability of poor households by improving rural livelihoods, strengthening community safety nets and delivering more and better basic services, taking particular account of the needs of households affected by HIV/AIDS.

<P>

<a name="30318w30.html_para5">In his report on progress towards implementation of the Declaration of Commitment presented to the 57th Session of the General Assembly in 2002, the Secretary-General noted that while political commitment had increased and additional resources were devoted to HIV/AIDS, the scale of country level activities did not yet match the epidemic.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on support for victims of domestic violence.  [102541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w31.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Tackling domestic violence, and supporting those who are victims of domestic violence, is a priority for the Government.
<P>

<a name="30318w31.html_para4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in partnership with Comic Relief, have each allocated &#163;1 million funding to set up a national freephone helpline for victims of domestic violence, underpinned by a 'refuges on line' database. This will bring together the advice services currently provided by Refuge and the Women's Aid Federation of England and will offer instant access to information on refuge accommodation and specialist services. It is anticipated that the full system will be fully operational towards the end of 2003.
<P>

<a name="30318w31.html_para5">In July 2002, the main homelessness provisions of the Homelessness Act 2002 and the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 were brought into force. These required local housing authorities to take a more strategic approach to preventing and tackling homelessness, placed stronger duties on authorities to help homeless people, and extended the groups of homeless applicants who have a priority need for accommodation, including, among others, people vulnerable as a result of fleeing their home because of violence. The Homelessness Directorate will be allocating &#163;70 million in 2003&#150;04 to local authorities to help them address homelessness. This will include some support for domestic violence schemes where local authorities have identified this as a priority.
<P>

<a name="30318w31.html_para6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also announced at the end of last year a &#163;7 million capital investment programme through the Housing Corporation to extend and renovate the national network of women's refuges in England. Initial allocations are being agreed with the Housing Corporation for 2003&#150;04 and it is hoped that further schemes will be supported in the following two years.
<P>

<a name="30318w31.html_para7">The Supporting People programme, which begins on 1 April, will put in place a new integrated policy and funding framework for housing-related support services, including those for people experiencing domestic violence. Current annual expenditure is &#163;34 million for a total of 5,000 places. Local authorities have now submitted their shadow Supporting People strategies. These are currently being analysed and will provide valuable data on the supply of refuge and support services for people experiencing domestic violence, so helping to inform and direct future action.
<P>

<a name="30318w31.html_para8">Supporting People guides have also been issued on addressing the accommodation and support needs of households experiencing domestic violence; and two dedicated co-ordinators are working with providers and local authorities to ensure that the sector is prepared for the new programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Government's preferred approach to EU regional policy is set out in the consultation paper "A modern regional policy for the United Kingdom", which was published on 6 March.
<P>

<a name="30318w32.html_para0">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the recognition given by the mayors and leaders of urban areas, in their declaration, of the importance of urban areas, not least to the delivery of the Lisbon objectives.
<P>

<a name="30318w32.html_para1">The launch of the Government's paper on 6 March marked the beginning of a period of consultation in the UK on the future of the European Structural Funds, which will conclude on 4 July. We are actively seeking the views of all stakeholders, including the mayors and leaders of urban areas, during this process.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what progress he has made in developing the role of the fire and rescue service in respect of <i>(a)</i> mass decontamination and <i>(b)</i> national search and rescue under the fire new dimension project.  [103295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The procurement of mass decontamination equipment (in England and Wales) under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's &#163;56 million New Dimension programme is nearing completion. It will deliver 80 new vehicles and 190 purpose built decontamination units each capable of decontaminating some 200 people an hour; a range of new fire service equipment for detection and monitoring of radiation and hazardous substances at incidents; and 4,000 new gas tight suits&#151;a doubling of present capacity&#151;to enable fire-fighters to operate safely. Training for this enhanced role is planned to start in April, with deployment of the equipment to follow soon thereafter.
<P>

<a name="30318w32.html_para3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also taking urgent steps to enhance the fire service's capability in urban search and rescue. We have made available &#163;3 million for the training of trainers and responders in structural collapse techniques, the purchase of technical search and rescue and heavy rescue equipment, and the provision of training rigs at the Fire Service College. We have also made available some &#163;2 million for the need of the capital. We are seeking to secure the funding for a major national investment next financial year to complete delivery of the investment.

 Part III of the Local Government Act 2000 provides for the Secretary of State to issue model codes of conduct as regards the members (section 50) and employees (section 82) of local authorities. Codes of conduct under section 50 were laid before Parliament in November 2002. These codes place obligations on members to treat others with respect and not to do anything which compromises the impartiality of those who work for the local authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w32.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the standard spending assessments and formula spending share was for each year for Torbay Unitary Authority; what the percentage change in each year from the previous year has been; and what the aggregate external finance was for each year.  [103284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Since 1 April 1998, when Torbay Unitary Authority was first created, there have been many changes in the functions and funding of services to Local Government. To enable a like-for-like comparison between years, we calculate adjusted Standard Spending Assessment's and grants. The percentage change figures have been calculated on the basis of these like-for-like comparisons.
<P>

<a name="30318w32.html_para5">Until the introduction of Central Support Protection Grant in 1999&#150;2000, there was no need to calculate grant on a like-for-like basis, and for this reason grant comparisons in the years 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are not available. There were no changes in funding and function between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 that needed reflecting in adjusted grants for 1998&#150;99 to allow a like-for-like comparison; the actual 1998&#150;99 values have therefore been used in this case.
<P>

<a name="30318w32.html_para6">In 2003&#150;04, SSAs were replaced with Formula Spending Shares (FSSs). The 2003&#150;04 total FSS figure has been compared to the FSS comparitor for 2002&#150;03 in order to give a like-for-like comparison. The FSS comparitor for 2002&#150;03 is similar to the adjusted 2002&#150;03 SSA but with the increased resource equalisation also applied.
<P>

<a name="30318w32.html_para7">The adjusted 1997&#150;98 total SSA figure for Torbay was calculated using the same formulae as for other education authorities, but assuming that the 1 April 1998 Local government reorganisations occurred a year earlier.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many responses were received by his Department to the consultation on the interest in holding a referendum on regional government in the north-east.  [103142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister asked for responses by 3 March on the level of regional interest in each English region in holding a referendum for an elected regional assembly. We have received over 4,500 responses to date, of which just over 3,000 have been logged. Of those logged so far, approximately 300 are from the north-east.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will list the Ring-Fenced grants available to local authorities in each year since 1997.  [96909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30318w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="30318w33.html_para4"><i>List of Ring-Fenced and Special Grants available in each Financial Year</i>
<P>

<a name="30318w33.html_para5">The definition of ring-fencing used was updated last year to reflect the types of grant we now have. Some grants previously classified as ring-fenced are no longer classified in this way. The key distinction we make is that ring-fenced grants restrict local authority spending. For completeness the following list includes all special grants inside Aggregate External Finance. Those marked with an asterisk are not ring-fenced. Further details of classifications are in an annex to the freedoms and flexibilities announcement of 26 November.

<a name="30318w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Independent research "The Evaluation of the Low Cost Home Ownership Programme" commissioned by the former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (now the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) and the Welsh Assembly Government was published in September 2002. Shared ownership was one of the components of the study, and the main messages from the research were that consumer satisfaction with low cost home ownership schemes was high and that schemes represented good value for money.
<P>

<a name="30318w34.html_para0">The issues will now be taken forward by the Home Ownership Task Force announced in "Sustainable communities: building for the future" on 5 February. The terms of reference for the task force will be announced shortly.

government grant to each of the shire counties in each of the last 10 years; and what the real terms changes were in each of those years.  [103116]<P>

<a name="30318w34.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The available information is in the following tables. The figures given are for formula grant, which comprises revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and Standard Service Assessment reduction grants (where appropriate).
<P>

<a name="30318w34.html_para1">There have been many changes to the functions and funding of local government services over the last ten years, and like-for-like comparisons of grants between years cannot be made for years when changes have taken place unless figures are adjusted to take account of the changes.
<P>

<a name="30318w34.html_para2">For years from 1999&#150;2000, adjusted figures for individual shire county councils exist because they were needed to allow like-for-like comparisons as part of the floors and ceilings calculations.
<P>

<a name="30318w34.html_para3">For years before 1999&#150;2000, adjusted grant figures for individual shire county councils do not exist. A like-for-like comparison between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 can, however, be made using unadjusted figures. This is because there were no changes in function or funding between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 that needed reflecting by adjusting the grant figures for 1998&#150;99.
