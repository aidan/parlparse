<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In developing the Green Paper "Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice", a large number of meetings were held with employers and their representatives, employees and their representatives and voluntary organisations. Paid parental leave was discussed at many of these meetings alongside many other matters. A list of many of those who contributed to the review was included in the Green Paper.

[146485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Ministers receive frequent representations from outside bodies interested in industrial issues, including job losses. These are taken into account in discussions in the informal ministerial meetings and groups to which I referred.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list those sections of United Kingdom manufacturing industry in which his Department expects to see <i>(a)</i> earnings growth and <i>(b)</i> job growth.  [146921]<P>

<P>
<P>

 Guidance on the Working Time Regulations, aimed at employers and workers alike, has been available since the Working Time Regulations came into force on 1 October 1998. New 'user friendly' guidance was issued on 30 March 2000, following discussions with representatives from both sides of industry on the format. The document is easier to navigate, which assists smaller businesses with limited resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he plans to publish his proposals to amend employment tribunal procedure rules.  [146054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to my written answer on 27 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 381-82W. I expect to lay the amendments to the regulations before Parliament in early March, subject to completion of statutory consultation with the Council on Tribunals.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what guidance he will issue to employment tribunals on differentiating between a weak case which has no real chance of success and a case with merit which may be unsuccessful.  [146055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The regulations will provide that an application or a defence may be struck out on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the complaint. It will be clear that this provision applies to cases which have no real prospect of success rather than an arguable case.
<P>

<a name="10122w01.html_para1">The employment tribunals are independent judicial bodies and the application of the regulations in an individual case is for them to determine.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many applications were registered by the Employment Tribunal Service in 1999-2000; how many applications were successful; in how many cases costs were awarded; in how many cases costs were awarded against the respondent; and what the average costs were in each case.  [146056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Employment Tribunals Service registered 103,935 applications in 1999-2000. During this period, a total of 83,409 cases were disposed of, of which 10,349 (12 per cent.) were successful at a hearing. Costs were awarded in 407 cases (0.48 per cent.), of which 291 were awarded against the respondent. The average cost award was &#163;1,700.09.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the reasons for excluding energy from waste from the Renewables Obligations.  [146381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 No final decision has yet been made on the renewables that will be included in the Obligation.
<P>

<a name="10122w01.html_para2">The various sources of renewable energy are at different stages of development. In our October 2000 Consultation Document on the Renewables Obligation, we took the view that large-scale hydro (i.e. exceeding 10 MW installed capacity) and energy from waste (energy recovery from municipal solid waste and from mixed streams of industrial and commercial waste) could be seen as already commercially viable, well established in the market, and able to compete with electricity from fossil fuels. This view took into account the indirect support provided to energy from waste projects by the landfill tax. The Government invited views on the proposal that these two renewable energy sources, large-scale hydro and 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 400W</I><P>
energy from waste, should be excluded from the Obligation, in order to enable resources to be concentrated on those renewables needing continued support.
<P>

<a name="10122w01.html_para3">The response to the consultation has been considerable and diverse and is being carefully analysed before decisions are made.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has had a number of discussions with the Chairman of Corus in the last two months on a range of issues. It would not be appropriate to divulge the details of commercially confidential discussions between Ministers and companies.

 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2001]:</i> The award of contracts for local delivery of Business Link services is an operational matter for the Chief Executive of the Small Business Service. I have asked him to write to my hon. Friend with his response.
<P>

<a name="10122w02.html_para0"><i>Letter from David Irwin to Mr. Kevin McNamara, dated 22 January 2001:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by Stephen Byers to respond to the four Parliamentary Questions you have tabled concerning the Small Business Service's decision to make Action for Employment (A4E) the preferred bidder to deliver the new Business Link service in Humberside.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Small Business Service (SBS) has been developing a new network of local Business Links to begin operations from 1 April 2001. A high standard for award of preferred bidder status to any organisation was set and regional panels were convened to assess paper bids and receive a presentation from each bidding team. The panel was dominated by owner/managers of small and medium enterprises who were carefully briefed to judge the bids against the criteria. In the case of Humberside, after a first round where the existing Business Link partnership failed to meet the criteria, an open competition was held. The regional panel for the open competition was unanimous in its recommendation to me that the bid from Action for Employment (A4E) met all the criteria and clearly made the best offer for SBS customers in Humberside. The issue of local support for A4E was not a contributing factor to their success at the regional panel.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The A4E bid contains statements regarding contact they had with a range of local organisations in Humberside and nationally with whom they would hope to work to provide business support to SMEs in the area, should A4E be the successful bidder.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The four local authorities (which, through the Humber Forum, all supported the unsuccessful bid from the existing Business Link partnership) complained to the SBS that they had been misrepresented in the A4E bid for Humberside. the bid indicates that each of the local authorities had been contacted by A4E but through the Humber Forum, the local authorities have denied that any such contact took place. I asked A4E for details of the contacts they had made and was given the names of the individuals to whom they had spoken in the relavent departments of the local authorities and a note of the conversations that took place. I am content that A4E have not attempted to mislead the SBS by claiming support for their bid which did not exist. I am attaching a list of the individuals with whom A4E spoke.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>More recently, when I met some of the representatives of the Humber Forum, they expressed concern about the business planning process being undertaken by A4E. The preparation of A4E's first draft business plan for Humberside has taken a little longer than they had originally hoped because of difficulties in the area, including a negative approach by some of the supporters of unsuccessful bids. Nevertheless, I understand that the process is on track with some initial planning material currently under discussion with our regional manager, and other practical steps in place including the appointment of a Chief Executive for the Humberside operation. It is not the case that the existing Business Link has been asked to write the proposed business plan although A4E have invited the Business Link and other interested organisations locally to contribute to their plan--which is a strategy the SBS would encourage in all its Business Link operators.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 402W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Humber Forum has sought to draw a parallel between the situation in Humberside and that in Somerset. The A4E bid for Somerset included some errors and overstatements about contacts with local organisations. Even though I accepted that these were not deliberate attempts to mislead, I considered that A4E's mistakes in the Somerset bid made it too difficult for the SBS to support them in their attempts to form the necessary relationships in Somerset. This is significantly different from the situation in Humberside. In particular, both the three local enterprise agencies and the Chamber of Commerce have indicated that they are quite happy to work with A4E and simply want to get on with providing a first rate service to small businesses.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The members of the Humber Forum have repeatedly asked me to undertake a review of the decision to award A4E preferred bidder status in Humberside because of their concerns about the original bid and the progress being made in business planning. I have done so and concluded that there is no evidence to warrant me overturning the recommendation made by the regional panel--especially as it was so clear about the benefits for customers that A4E would deliver in Humberside.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would be very happy to meet you to discuss this matter further and to facilitate a meeting with A4E if that would be helpful.</FONT></UL>

 The UK has consistently approved humanitarian flights to Baghdad. We place flights on hold, and then usually only on a temporary basis, where cargo or passenger details are insufficient to ensure that UN sanctions are not being breached. These holds are lifted as soon as we are satisfied with the additional information provided. We encourage organisations to provide additional humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people--and called on them to do so in SCR 1284. We assist those who wish to do this by air with their applications for Sanctions Committee approval. However the resumption of scheduled commercial flights involving financial transactions with Iraq would be a clear contravention of the sanctions resolutions.

 We share UNICEF's concern that the children of Iraq have suffered greatly at the hands of a dictator who cares nothing for their welfare. We, however, do care about them. Under SCR 1284, a UK initiative, the humanitarian programme in Iraq has grown eightfold since it began in 1997. With up to $16 billion available this year, there is no reason why Iraqi children should go short of food, medicine or other humanitarian supplies unless Saddam decides to deny them.

 We welcome recent statements by the Iraqi Oil Minister that Iraq is increasing oil production again to return to the pre-Gulf War levels reached last year. Iraq's decision to halt oil production in December 2000 denied the Iraqi people over $650 million of humanitarian relief in December alone. We remain sceptical of Iraqi claims that they are unable to maintain production because of a shortage of oil spare parts when Iraq spent only 2 per cent. of the $600 million allocated to Iraq by the UN for oil spare parts during the last six months of 2000. Oil spare parts are also included in the UN's "fast-track" system which has already processed more than $3 billion worth of goods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w03.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Under the terms of United Nations Security Council resolution 1284, contracts clearly designed for humanitarian purposes for the supply of foodstuffs, medical, agricultural, educational, water and sanitation supplies and oil spare parts no longer require Sanctions Committee approval but only need to be notified to the UN Secretariat. Under Security Council resolution 1330 these lists of "fast-track" goods are being extended to include goods in the electricity and housing sectors also. This year alone, more than $3 billion worth of humanitarian goods have been "fast tracked" in this way to Iraq.
<P>

<a name="10122w03.html_para4">The UK holds less than 2 per cent. of all other contracts, which are circulated to the UN Iraq Sanctions Committee, and only does so when there are serious concerns that the goods could be used in Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction programmes. Holds are generally placed temporarily until assurances have been received about the end-use or in-country monitoring of these goods. It is the Iraqi Government who place blocking holds on UN humanitarian supplies.

<P>
<a name="10122w03.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We have seen no recent UN reports specifically on the distribution of food and medicine in Iraq. However, we note that in his most recent report the UN Secretary-General called on Iraq to improve its contracting, ordering and distribution of the food basket and called for more effort to ensure the timely distribution of supplies to address the nutritional needs of the Iraqi people. We also note the Secretary-General's comment that the lack of a cash component--which the Iraqi regime refuses to discuss with the UN--is hampering the transportation of supplies for the targeted nutrition programme in central and southern Iraq.

 The "Oil for Food" programme has grown eightfold since 1997. Providing billions of dollars of humanitarian relief to the Iraqi people again this year, "Oil for Food" remains the largest UN aid programme ever. "Fast-track" procedures introduced by the UN last year mean that more goods, including foodstuffs, medical,

agricultural, educational, water and sanitation supplies and oil spare parts no longer require Sanctions Committee approval, thus reaching the Iraqi people more quickly. So far this year, more than $3 billion worth of goods have been processed in this way. However, despite the programme's success, we remain concerned that a lack of co-operation from the Iraqi regime continues to hamper the delivery of this aid to the Iraqi people.

 Producers who submit Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) claims early in the application period normally receive advance payments from November onwards. Advances in respect of 2000 Scheme year claims began in December.
<P>

<a name="10122w04.html_para9">The reason why payments began later than in previous years stems from the introduction of a rule allowing producers to claim premium on heifers, up to a limit of 20 per cent. of the total number of animals on the claim. The rule was introduced as part of the Agenda 2000 package of CAP reforms. Although it is relatively straightforward in itself, it necessitated a number of detailed changes to be made, including to the computer system used for making SCPS payments. These changes have taken longer to make than the usual year on year changes which are normally made to the system. As a result, the facilities were not available to RSCs to enable the advances to be paid in November.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what reasons underlay the decision to introduce a flat rate modulation scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [146151]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The decision to implement modulation at a low flat rate was made after full consultation. Given the particular challenges facing all sectors of the farming industry, we concluded that it would be inequitable for modulation to be applied to certain sectors and not others.
<P>

<a name="10122w05.html_para2">This approach offers a simple and transparent system, allowing farmers to understand readily the impact of modulation on their businesses, and one which is relatively simple to implement. It takes into account the need to avoid giving incentives to farmers to alter their businesses artificially in response to modulation, or to defer the implementation of business restructuring which would otherwise make economic sense, and it strikes a balance between the benefits of expanding rural development measures and the importance of avoiding distortion of competition with farmers in other member states which are not applying modulation.

<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 413W</I><P>
Government's Action Plan for Farming. It is particularly pleasing to announce the opening of phase two of a scheme that will make a significant amount of money available to the UK pig industry, a sector that has suffered over the past two years. While market conditions have improved recently, the scale of the debt incurred over those difficult times continues to be a major restraint on the industry's ability to prepare itself for the future. The Government's restructuring scheme will go some way towards remedying that situation.
<P>

<a name="10122w05.html_para4">The aim of Ongoers is to help pig producers reduce costs, overcome any competitive disadvantage and restore long term viability to their businesses. It will achieve this by providing an interest rate rebate on loans linked to an agreed business plan.

<a name="10122w05.html_para5">Phase one of the scheme--Ongoers--was opened on 4 December 2000 and since then over 1,500 application forms have been sent out in response to telephone and e-mail requests.

 Peer reviewed scientific data comparing the mortality of UK Gulf veterans to an era group of service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf were published for the first time in <i>The Lancet</i> on 1 July 2000. An update to these figures was provided by the Ministry of Defence to the House on 20 July 2000. The Ministry of Defence has undertaken to continue to monitor the mortality of both Gulf veterans and the era group and will publish updated figures on a regular basis.

<a name="10122w06.html_para3">Overall, in the period 1 April 1999 to 31 December 2000 the mortality of UK Gulf veterans was only slightly greater than that of the Control group. The number of Gulf veterans dying from disease related causes is rather less than for the control group, whereas the number of Gulf veterans dying of external causes is rather higher than for the control group. The Ministry of Defence will conduct a more detailed analysis of road traffic accidents, to establish whether there are any underlying trends that might help explain this excess.

<a name="10122w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The NATO Secretary General, Lord Robertson, issued a statement on depleted uranium on 10 January 2001, for further details of this statement I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) on 15 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 41-42W. The Ministry of Defence has welcomed the NATO measures which were outlined in this statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not have information about the current levels of depleted uranium (DU) in Iraq. Although we are well aware of suggestions that the use of DU-based ammunition during the Gulf conflict has caused an increase in ill-health, including 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 418W</I><P>
deformities, cancers and birth defects, in Iraq, especially around Basra, Al Zubayr and Um Qasr, we have not so far seen any peer-reviewed epidemiological research, or any other properly validated research, to support these claims. Furthermore, there is no evidence that illnesses of the type reported are uniquely associated with or indeed consistent with exposure to DU. Of course, the Government would consider carefully any reliable medical or scientific data that may emerge concerning the incidence of ill health in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para4">UK tanks, which were equipped with DU-based rounds during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, did not operate in those areas of southern Iraq in which it has been suggested that there is an increased level of ill health compared to other areas of the country.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para5">We understand the World Health Organisation (WHO) is in discussion with the Government of Iraq about three proposals to improve health in Iraq. The proposals, which are still in the outline stage, focus on the improvement of health planning, the building of training links between Iraqi health personnel and outside health institutions, and improvement of research and treatment of emerging diseases, such as cancers. We understand that the Government of Iraq have agreed the proposals. The WHO will now presumably approach donors for funding. The Department for International Development has already indicated that it will consider funding for projects aimed at improving epidemiological data on, and health care planning, in Iraq--provided that these meet their project criteria. If implemented, these projects should provide valuable information on the health needs of the Iraqi population.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many British troops and medical auxiliaries have been subject to exposure to depleted uranium from NATO and allied forces in <i>(a)</i> Iraq, <i>(b)</i> Kuwait, <i>(c)</i> Bosnia, <i>(d)</i> Kosovo and <i>(e)</i> other parts of the Balkans, arising from military conflicts in those areas in the last five years.  [145292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There is no evidence of which the Ministry of Defence is aware to suggest that any allied or NATO troops or civilians have suffered any exposure to depleted uranium that might be harmful. No specific data exist on individuals' possible exposure to depleted uranium, either in the Gulf or the Balkans. However, in recognition of the fact that recent press coverage will have caused some concerns among our people, I announced an initiative to identify an additional appropriate voluntary screening programme for our Service personnel and civilians who have served in the Balkans--9 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 877-90. We will do this 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 419W</I><P>
on the basis of the best available science. We will consult appropriate national bodies including the UK National Screening Committee of the UK Departments of Health and the Royal Society. It is our intention that this screening programme should be equally applicable to Gulf veterans.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B>

 I will assume that my hon. Friend is referring to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) on 19 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 27W.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para6">The 120 mm anti-armour round Challenger Armament 3 (CHARM 3) for Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank was in development at the beginning of this period and was the only ammunition with DU content being fired at Kirkcudbright ranges. Firing peaked in 1997 with a Biases Trial to establish weapon system accuracy. Most of the subsequent firing was part of the proofing regime for production rounds that will be complete by September 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what communication he has received from the Royal Society in respect of its current inquiry into the effects of the military use of depleted uranium on human health and the environment.  [145288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 At the Royal Society's request, two sessions of Ministry of Defence evidence were held as part of its ongoing inquiry. My Department has also received two letters from the Royal Society and of course will be in consultation with them and others about the screening programme I announced on 9 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 877-90. I understand that the Royal Society plan to publish their report in the summer of this year.

<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 On 8 September 1999, following a meeting with veterans, I announced that the Ministry of Defence was offering to re-test those veterans who had been tested in Canada for depleted uranium. In November 1999 a draft protocol under which this testing might be carried out was put before veterans associations, including the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association (NGV&FA), for discussion. Regrettably, the NGV&FA has not appeared willing to discuss this proposal for testing with us. It is our intention that the screening initiative I announced in the House on 9 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 877-90 should be equally applicable to Gulf veterans.

<UL>(2) what recent discussions he has had with his NATO counterparts about the health effects of depleted uranium on military personnel and civilians during Operation Granby in the Gulf in 1991.  [145287]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In my statement to the House on 9 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 877-90, I stressed the importance of co-ordinating our approach with allies. The Ministry of Defence, both independently and through NATO, is therefore monitoring very closely the health checks being proposed or conducted by our allies on troops who believe they may have been exposed to depleted uranium (DU). The North Atlantic Council met on 10 January 2001 to consider the possible health effects associated with the use of DU munitions. After that meeting, the Secretary General affirmed that NATO allies are committed to ensuring the health and safety of their Service personnel and to avoiding any ill-effects for the civilian population and personnel of the non- governmental organisations as a result of NATO military operations. Allies agreed that NATO should continue to co-operate fully with investigations by nations or multinational organisations on the possible effects of exposure; to produce information on the use of DU munitions during operation Deny Flight and Deliberate Force in 1994 and 1995; and to consult fully with all present and past NATO SFOR and KFOR contributing countries.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para7">On 15 January 2001, the NATO Chiefs of Medical Military Services Committee (COMEDS), the senior medical advisory committee of NATO, held a meeting to discuss the health concerns of Balkan peacekeepers. At this meeting, a common NATO medical approach was agreed. This was that each nation should analyse the mortality rates of its Service personnel; analyse the rate of illness among its Balkans veterans; compare them with control groups and national matched statistics, and correlate the collection of morbidity data with known health hazards in theatre.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para8">A NATO meeting was also held on 16 January 2001 to establish a working group to act as a clearing house for the exchange of information, between the allies and more widely, on any health risks associated with the use of DU munitions.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para9">While this activity has arisen in the context of concerns about use of depleted uranium in the Balkans, the discussions are also relevant to the suggested health effects of DU in the Gulf.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what guidelines his Department follows when deciding at which sites depleted uranium munitions may be <i>(a)</i> fired, <i>(b)</i> stored and <i>(c)</i> transported.  [144989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The land firing of Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions has been concentrated at two MOD ranges in the UK; at Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway, and Eskmeals in Cumbria. The Statutory Regulations which govern the use of DU on all ranges in the UK are the Radioactive Substance Act 1993, which controls radioactive waste discharges to the environment and the Ionising Radiation Regulations published in December 1999 which came into effect on 1 January 2000. These are part of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. The firings are conducted with the full 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 421W</I><P>
knowledge of the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. In addition, the MOD Explosive, Storage and Transport Committee lays down the policy and standards for the storage and transportation of all conventional military explosives held by the UK MOD and this includes DU munitions. These standards are then enshrined as necessary in Single Service regulations and working practices.

<a name="10122w06.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recent representations have been received from the campaign against depleted uranium.  [145295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department received a letter from the Campaign Against Depleted Uranium (CADU) dated 9 January 2001 and is in the process of replying.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_wqn17"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research is being conducted by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> DERA into alternatives to the use of depleted uranium munitions.  [145298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency has been investigating, on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, a range of materials as possible alternatives for depleted uranium (DU) which is used in ammunition for the Challenger II battle tank. The research over the past few years has focused on studying the physical characteristics of DU alloys that make them especially effective in battlefield engagement. Based on this knowledge, the suitability of alternative materials is being assessed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_wqn18"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment his Department has made of the toxic effects on the liver of the ingestion of particles of depleted uranium.  [145276]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 None. The level of chemical toxicity of depleted uranium (DU) is similar to that of other heavy metals such as lead. Much research has been done into heavy metal poisoning and its effects are well understood. If soluble particles of DU were to be ingested, this could indeed give rise to health problems. However, this is very unlikely, as the DU residues found on the battlefield are generally in the form of solid fragments or relatively insoluble oxides. Should any of these oxides be ingested, most would pass straight through the body and so the risk of any health effects arising from such exposure is negligible. Kidney damage is the chief indication of heavy metal poisoning. The incidence of kidney disease among the 3,000 or so patients who have been to the Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme is no higher than would be expected in the general population.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w06.html_wqn19"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if his Department has reviewed the evidence presented to inquiries held by the United States Congress into the potential hazards of the use of depleted uranium munitions.  [145296]<P>

 There is currently no plan to replace the depleted uranium penetrator in the CHARM 3 round used in the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank. At present this penetrator outperforms all known alternatives. The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is continuing to conduct research into the potential of alternative materials.
<P>

<a name="10122w06.html_para10">In 1990 we commenced the replacement of depleted uranium rounds for the Phalanx naval close-in weapon with tungsten rounds. In this system tungsten provides an equally effective capability at lower cost. It was possible to use tungsten in this case because the system does not rely specifically on the penetrative capabilities afforded by depleted uranium. This is not the case for the CHARM 3 round.

 Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) publish "UK Defence Statistics 2000", which contain estimates of UK regional employment directly resultant from the Ministry of Defence equipment expenditure. The method used to provide national and regional employment estimates requires the combination of two elements. First, a breakdown of MOD equipment expenditure with UK industry (using the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)) and second, a multiplier which measures sales per employee for each of the industries receiving defence spending (derived from the ONS Business Enquiry and the Labour Market Survey). Dividing the first by the second gives an estimate of those employed directly on defence contracts. The methodology does not therefore include indirect employment.

<a name="10122w08.html_para3">The national minimum wage of &#163;3.70 an hour ensures fair minimum standards of pay and has benefited between 1.2 and 1.5 million people since its introduction in April 1999. The introduction of the 10p tax rate in April 1999 halved the marginal tax rate for 1.8 million people in low-paid work. Reforms to National Insurance Contributions and in particular the abolition of the unfair entry fee, and the rise in the Lower Earnings Limit, have taken an estimated 1 million low-paid workers out of paying national insurance, while protecting their entitlement to benefits.

On average, families on WFTC are &#163;30 a week better off than under Family Credit. Combined with the minimum wage WFTC ensures a minimum income for a family with someone in full-time work of &#163;214 a week.

 The length and time for a course of radiotherapy can vary dependent on the size and classification of the type of cancer involved. A particularly virulent form of the disease may require a higher dose of a certain type of radiotherapy in a relatively short period of time, while another form may require a lower dose over a longer period of time. Therefore there is no 'standard course' of radiotherapy to treat breast cancer following a mastectomy.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> Before October 1998, there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. An estimated 40 playing fields a month were sold in this way under the previous Government. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced, with effect from 1 October 1998, to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools are now required to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of playing fields, or any part of a playing field.
<P>

<a name="10122w12.html_para0">Since October 1998, 82 applications from local authorities and governing bodies to sell areas equal to, or larger than, a sports pitch have been approved. As no national figures were collected before October 1998, these approved applications can be broken down for each year since the law was changed as follows:

 Three hundred and sixty thousand copies of the magazine are published every two months, with six issues a year.

The average cost of Update was about 27p at today's prices. "Teachers" costs 31.5p per copy (including advertising revenue) and is much more widely read by teachers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w13.html_spnew5"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Sports Institute (UKSI) is made up of a network of Institutes operated by the home country sports councils. Excellent progress is being made to establish facilities and services for the UKSI. In addition, Sports now have access to the technical, operational and programme support provided through the UKSI Central Services team.

 TV Licensing, which administers this concession for the BBC as Licensing Authority, is not able to provide geographical breakdowns of the number of free licences issued. However, estimates of the over-75 population based on the 1991 Census indicate that there were approximately 4,900 people aged 75 or over in the Battersea constituency.

 The Department was not involved in the monitoring of contracts in relation to the south portico of the British Museum as the contracts were between the museum and its supplier. The Heritage Lottery Fund also appointed monitors to oversee the approved purposes of the project as set out in their contract with the museum. Further details of the British Museum's monitoring of the contracts can be found in the PricewaterhouseCoopers Report on the South Portico, which was commissioned by the British Museum and published on 16 January 2001.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Sport has regular meetings with colleagues from the Department for Education and Employment, as do I, to discuss our objective for raising the quality and level of participation in PE and Sport in schools. Just recently, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and I announced our intention to offer an entitlement to all children to two hours per week of high-quality school sport and recreation during and after the school day. We will consult with schools, professional associations and other interested parties to identify how best to make this happen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 National Lottery distributors are working closely with my Department to help coalfield communities, along with other areas of low take-up, receive more benefit from National Lottery money. We commissioned research into the impact of the Lottery on the coalfields, and I established a Coalfields Action Group in June 2000 to take forward the report's recommendations. These include actively encouraging applications from areas of low take-up, introducing more flexible matching fund requirements, making decision- making more transparent, and better co-ordination with other organisations responsible for regenerating coalfields and other low take-up areas. Our data show that the rate of awards to coalfields areas has increased since Government Lottery reforms came into force in August 1998.

<P>
<a name="10122w13.html_spnew11"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Any proposals for changes to the transfer system are for the football authorities to make. However, the Government believe that any changes following the European Commission's present review must take full account of the interests of smaller clubs and the need to encourage the development of young players. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have made this clear in all our meetings with the football authorities.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para0">I am concerned that consumers may not be being given sufficiently clear information about what new televisions are, or are not, able to receive digital services. My Department is working with industry to develop a clear labelling system for digital televisions and is in touch with the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Food and Trading Standards (LACOTS) about the nature and extent of consumer problems in this area.
<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para1">The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 already prohibits false or misleading descriptions of products. It would therefore be an offence to describe a television set falsely, and if there are instances where traders are misdescribing analogue sets as digital, I would urge consumers to bring them to the attention of their local authority trading standards department.

 The Highways Agency is proposing to implement a Route Management Strategy Study (RMS) over the length of M5 between Junctions 4a (M5/M42 junction south west of Birmingham) and 15 (M5/M4 junction north of Bristol) which will include an evaluation of Junction 10 near Uckington, in Gloucestershire. The study is expected to be commissioned around the turn of this year and will take approximately 12 months to complete.
<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para2">The purpose of the RMS study will be to consider the route in its regional context while also focusing on local needs and considering how we can best integrate roads planning with other transport and planning decisions. The Highways Agency will take a 10-year forward look covering the maintenance, operation and improvement projects for the route to ensure that it can sustain development growth. The views of local authorities, regional planning authorities, bus and lorry operators, the police and members of the public will all be sought and taken into account as part of the study.
<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para3">As part of the study, specific consideration will be given to the merits of modifying Junction 10 of M5 to provide for all traffic movements but until the study is completed it is not possible to provide an estimate of the potential costs.

<P>
<P>

 A Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) offence is prosecuted in the area in which it is detected. It is not possible to identify the place of residence of these offenders without a special exercise being carried out to extract this information.
<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para5">A registration offence is always prosecuted in the area in which the offender lives provided the last registration document was issued on or after 24 March 1997.

<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para6">If the last registration document was issued before this date however and the offence also included a VED offence detected outside the Sidcup area, both offences would be prosecuted in the area they were detected. There are no figures available for these cases.

<P>

 The DVLA has no estimate of the percentage of vehicles in London which are not registered to the current keeper.

 During the period January-December 2000, there was a total of 69 complaints about untaxed vehicles received by DVLA Swansea. Of these, 58 were referred to the Sidcup office, seven to Stanmore and one to Wimbledon. There is no breakdown of the originating borough.

 The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has responsibility for recording vehicle keepership changes on a national basis. Regional information cannot be provided without running a prohibitively expensive scan of the vehicle database.

<a name="10122w14.html_wqn16"><B> Ms Bridget Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the impact on the effectiveness of the DVLA plan to photograph tax discs and number plates automatically from roadside cameras on tracking down drivers of untaxed vehicles of registration details being out of date.  [144975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w14.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The effectiveness of the DVLA camera scheme for the enforcement of vehicle excise duty will be measured by the number of additional evaders successfully penalised, and by the number encouraged to relicense voluntarily when faced with the increased risk of being caught.
<P>

<a name="10122w14.html_para7">Camera enforcement will still require the tracking down of those responsible for the offence where vehicle keepership details are not up to date. However, expected increase in compliance following the introduction of the cameras should improve the up-to-dateness of the DVLA record and reduce the incidence of out-of-date registration details.

 The DVLA Sidcup office currently has two members of staff employed fully on taking reports from the public by telephone or letter. All calls and letters are logged onto a computer database and referred to the Agency's Inquiry Officers for investigation. Members of the public are also advised that they can if they wish, complete witness statements themselves. The DVLA website contains information on how to report unlicensed vehicles with the facility to download and print the statement of witness form.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what areas are designated as urban and rural for determining financial allocations and other departmental purposes; and what changes have taken place in the areas so designated over the last 20 years.  [145837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID 2000), which were published last August, provide tools to identify the most deprived areas in England which may be used in determining the allocation of funding of regeneration policies. The ID 2000 provide scores and ranks in terms of how deprived they are for all areas in England regardless of whether they are urban or rural. Previous indices were published in 1981, 1994 and 1998.
<P>

<a name="10122w15.html_para1">Changes have occurred to the way the indices have been constructed over the years. This has included more direct ways of measuring deprivation rather than using proxy indicators and the move away from using census data that become quickly out of date. Also methodologies have been reviewed and changed so that they more fairly identify areas regardless of size which suffer from deprivation. Methodologies have also changed to ensure that no, or lack of, deprivation on some indicators is not completely cancelled out by high levels of deprivation on other indicators.
<P>

<a name="10122w15.html_para2">The ID 2000 have identified several deprived areas which previous indices have failed to pick up on. Many districts in the former coalfield areas, old industrial areas and rural areas are now identified as suffering widespread deprivation. They reveal patterns of deprivation for every ward and local authority district in the country. There is no one method of distinguishing which areas should be eligible for funding against those that should not. In order 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 455W</I><P>
to target resources on the most deprived areas, it is proposed that the ID 2000 are used. These have identified 88 areas which should be eligible for the new Neighbourhood Renewal Fund recently announced by the Government. Table 1 shows the areas and this has been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="10122w15.html_para3">As part of the former Urban Programme, which was the core of the former Department of the Environment's programme to tackle urban deprivation and ran in the 1980s through to the mid 1990s, 57 Urban Priority Areas were designated. Table 2 shows the areas and again the list has been placed in the Libraries of the House. These areas were targeted for their particular problems mainly in terms of economic and environmental issues but also in terms of social and housing deprivation.
<P>

<a name="10122w15.html_para4">Rural Development Areas, now known as Rural Priority Areas, were first designated in 1984. A comprehensive review was carried out by the Rural Development Commission before these areas were designated in 1994 but details of the previous areas are not held centrally. With minor exceptions, all Regional Development Agency rural development programme funding is spent in these areas. Those local authority districts containing wards which fall within Rural Priority Areas are at table 3 and has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="10122w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 In 1999 the Government commissioned the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) to conduct a broad-based study on health outcomes of people living near landfill sites. The study is designed to determine whether there is a statistical association between the location of landfill sites and the rates of certain adverse health effects in the nearby population. This report is now expected in summer 2001.
<P>

<a name="10122w16.html_para0">In addition, in September 1999 the Government announced a programme of research to investigate the possible impacts on human health of landfill sites throughout the UK. The following studies have since been commissioned: a review of the potential teratogenicity of substances emanating from landfill sites; a review of the known causes of congenital malformations; and a study of the geographical variation in overall rates of congenital abnormalities and the rates of specific abnormalities.
<P>

<a name="10122w16.html_para1">In 1998 the Government's independent expert committee, the Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) reviewed the results of the EUROHAZCON study on the risk of congenital abnormalities near hazardous waste landfill sites in Europe (Dolk <i>et al</i>, 2000, <i>The Lancet</i>, volume 352, pp 423-427) and an assessment by Fielder <i>et al</i> of the impact on health of residents living near the Nant-y-Gwyddon landfill site in South Wales (subsequently published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, 2000, volume 320, pp 19-22). The COT agreed with the author of the EUROHAZCON study that there was a need for further investigation. The full assessment can be found in the COT's Annual Report for 1998, available in the Library or on the Department of Health website at www.doh.gov.uk/coc.htm#annual.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2001]:</i> Section 155 of the Highways Act 1980 provides that if any horses, cattle, sheep, goats or swine are at any time found straying or lying on or at the side of a highway their keeper is guilty of an offence, for which the penalty is a fine of up to &#163;1,000.
<P>

<a name="10122w16.html_para2">A person found guilty is also liable to pay the expenses of any person, including a local authority, who removes an animal to a pound or returns it to the keeper and for the cost of looking after the animal until it is claimed. Enforcement is a matter for the police.

 The idea of an English Cities Fund is being developed by English Partnerships and its private sector partners. The Fund would attract long-term private finance to invest in urban regeneration schemes. It follows-up the recommendation of Lord Rogers' Urban Task Force that national public/private investment funds for regeneration should be established. Details of the Fund are currently being considered within Government and

<P><I>22 Jan 2001 : Column: 460W</I><P>
with the European Commission. The Fund will operate at a national level in England investing in schemes on a commercial basis in priority areas identified by the Regional Development Agencies. Resources from the public and private sectors would be combined and invested in eligible schemes identified by the Fund. This will determine the regional allocation of expenditure. We hope to see the Fund launched in 2001-02.

The most important of these will be in relation to by-catch regulation, where we shall seek results that build effectively on FAO and CCAMLR initiatives, but are not so onerous as to discourage wide support of the Agreement. We shall also seek to promote the precautionary principle, and to secure effective dispute settlement procedures, a right of accession to the Agreement by the European Union, and fair and satisfactory arrangements for funding the Agreement's work.

<a name="10122w17.html_para0">The Department has undertaken specific research into the incidence of drugs in road accident fatalities. This found that there was a presence of illegal drugs in some 18 per cent. of driver fatalities of which cannabis accounted for about two thirds. However, traces of cannabis remain in the body for some time after any impairing effect, and in general the presence of drugs is not evidence of impairment or accident causation. The research also showed that about a fifth of drivers killed had a blood alcohol level above the legal limit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The former Department of Transport published, in December 1992, the "Report of a Field Study of Aircraft Noise and Sleep Disturbance". This study, which was conducted by a consortium led by the CAA's Department of Safety, Environment and Engineering (now the Environment Research and Consultancy Department, ERCD), was and remains to date the largest survey of its kind in the UK. The survey sites were near Heathrow (Hounslow and Stanwell Moor), Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted airports. Sleep disturbances were detected using actimetry, the validity of which was corroborated using electro-encephalography (EEG). It was found that noise events below 90dBA SEL (equivalent to about 80dBA Lmax) were unlikely to affect average sleep disturbance rates, while events noisier than this gave a mean probability of disturbance of about one in 75, with a range of individual sensitivities around this average.
<P>

<a name="10122w17.html_para1">Based upon these results, illustrative estimates of disturbances owing to aircraft noise events between 11.30 pm and 6.00 am were included at paragraphs 1.37-1.39 of the Department's Second Stage Consultation on the night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, dated

In 1998 we announced that we would commission a trial study of sleep disturbance to help inform a decision whether to proceed with a full scale study which would examine, "inter alia", the question of sleep loss and possible after-effects. In the light of advice from a steering group and technical group established to advise on this work, we also commissioned a social survey of attitudes towards aircraft noise at night. These studies have been conducted by consortiums led respectively by Dr. Ian Flindell of the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research and Prof Ian Diamond of the Department of Social Statistics, both at the University of Southampton.

 This Department is running a &#163;6.5 million pensions education marketing campaign. This figure covers a number of elements, including the cost of researching and developing the campaign concept, producing and featuring the adverts on TV, in the cinema, national press and magazines, as well as running a campaign leaflet orderline and producing and mailing the supporting campaign information materials.
<P>

<a name="10122w18.html_para0">We are evaluating the campaign by conducting quantitative, tracking research to gauge people's awareness and understanding of the publicity. In addition, we are monitoring the numbers of orders placed for our information guides in response to the advertising campaign. We will also be consulting the pensions industry for their views.

 The information requested is not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what policies are in place within the police service to ensure that employees with HIV are protected against discrimination.  [146035]<P>

<a name="10122w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The police service is committed to treating people fairly in all circumstances. The police code of conduct provides that officers should treat colleagues with courtesy and respect, avoiding abusive or deriding attitudes or behaviour. In particular, officers must avoid all forms of harassment, victimisation or unreasonable discrimination. An officer who breaches the code is liable to a range of sanctions, the most serious of which is dismissal.

<P>
<a name="10122w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 7 per cent. of the 906,468 burglary offences recorded in England and Wales in 1999-2000 were cleared up by a charge or summons. Separate figures for charges only are not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="10122w20.html_para3">Figures on reported motoring incidents are not available, nor is information on charges resulting: however, most motoring incidents are discovered by the police with the offender present and it is likely that a charge or summons will result in a significant proportion of such cases. It follows, therefore, that direct comparisons cannot be made with recorded burglary offences, which require investigation and proof before a charge or summons can result.
<P>

<a name="10122w20.html_para4">22 per cent. of the 9.5 million motoring offences dealt with by official action in England and Wales in 1999 were dealt with by court proceedings.

 Four Government Departments--the Home Office, the Department for Education and Employment, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport--have been involved in the preparations for the Holocaust Memorial Day. Local authorities and their representative bodies, the Local Government Association and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, as well as schools, have also been involved. Non-Government Organisations, particularly those with experience and expertise in Holocaust education and remembrance, including the Anne Frank Educational Trust, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Beth Shalom Memorial Centre, the Commission for Race Equality, the Disability Rights Commission, the '45 Aid Society, the Holocaust Educational Trust, the Imperial War Museum, the Inter Faith Network, the Local Government Association, the London Borough of Barnet, the London Jewish Cultural Centre, the Pink Triangle Coalition, Southampton University, Stonewall, the Trades Union Congress, and the Wiener Library have also been involved in the

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what areas are currently designated as urban and rural for determining financial allocations and other departmental purposes; and what changes in designation have taken place, in the areas so designated over the last 20 years.  [145838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Office does not generally designate areas as urban or rural, either for the purpose of financial allocation or for other purposes. However, the relative sparsity, or otherwise, of the population of each police area is one of the factors taken into account in determining the allocation of police grant to police authorities. From 2001-02, police forces with relatively sparse populations will also be eligible for the new rural policing grant. Entitlement to this grant will be determined on the basis of population density information. Payment of &#163;30 million a year will be made in this way, &#163;15 million has been similarly made available for 2000-01.

<P>

<a name="10122w22.html_para1">The questions raised in the letter were more properly matters for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) than for the Home Office and arrangements were therefore made for the letter to be transferred to that Department for reply.

<a name="10122w22.html_para2">I regret to say that owing to a failure of our normal procedures, the transfer did not take place and the hon. Member's letter was mislaid in the Home Office.

 The decision whether to release those detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, once tariff has expired, is a matter for the independent Parole Board following a hearing of the case by a panel of three members of the Board. The timing of the hearing is for the Board to decide.
<P>

<a name="10122w22.html_para4">Before directing release, the Board must be satisfied, in accordance with section 28(6)(b) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public for the detainee to continue to be confined.

 It is not a requirement that victims are informed when placing a prisoner on Home Detention Curfew (HDC). In some cases victims will be consulted as part of the risk assessment process which all eligible prisoners have to undergo before being placed on the scheme, and in consequence may become aware of the release of a prisoner.
<P>

<a name="10122w22.html_para6">Although no formal assessment has been made, there is no reason to believe that HDC has adversely affected public confidence in the sentencing process or the wider criminal justice system. The HDC scheme received the unanimous support of the all-party Home Affairs Committee, and its report, Alternatives to Custody Cm 4174 (1998), was signed by several Opposition Members. The HDC scheme itself received the support of Parliament, including Opposition Members. The HDC scheme protects the public by providing selected short term prisoners with a monitored return to the community, helping them to re-integrate into the wider community of which they are members.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will introduce legislation to require sentencers to explain the effect on release dates of the home detention curfew scheme when passing sentence; and if he will make a statement.  [146284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10122w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that the implications of sentencing are explained in open court, but believe that this is best achieved through the issue of practice directions from the Lord Chief Justice. The then Lord Chief Justice issued a practice direction in January 1998 requiring a court imposing a custodial sentence to explain the practical effect of that sentence for the benefit of the defendant, any victim and members of the public. Although the practice direction was issued before home detention curfew became available, it specifically states that if the statutory provisions governing early release are materially amended, then the model statements annexed to the direction will require modification. Courts are therefore already expected to explain the possible effect of home detention curfew on the offender.

<a name="10122w23.html_para0">In their bids for a share of the recruitment scheme of the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF), made in January 2000, forces provided information on their projected recruitment over the following three years. The Metropolitan police service (MPS) has subsequently provided revised figures for total recruitment, but not for appointments on transfer.

<P>

<a name="10122w23.html_para3">For the hon. Member's information, however, the Court of Appeal gave judgment in the cases of Matthew Offen, Peter McGilliard, Darren McKeown, Christova Okwuegbunam and Stephen Saunders on 9 November 2000. In all the cases challenges were made to the imposition of an automatic life sentence under section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. The court upheld Offen and McKeown's appeals, substituting determinate terms of three years in place of a life sentence. Section 109 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides that if the conditions of the section are fulfilled an offender should receive a life sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances relating to either the offences or to the offender which would justify his not doing so. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal there were exceptional circumstances in both cases that made the imposition of an automatic sentence unjustified.

 In April 2000, Best Value was introduced for police authorities. Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs) have replaced all previous performance indicators for the police. For 2000-01, there are 37 BVPIs. For 2001-02, there will be 32, although three of these will not be reported on until 2002-03. The BVPIs are specified under section 4 of the Local Government Act 1999 and are published jointly by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), Home Office and Audit Commission. They are available in the Library and on the DETR website (www.detr.gov.uk). There are also two Ministerial Priorities, although there are no separate Performance Indicators attached to these. These are:

<a name="10122w23.html_para7">Under Best Value, all police authorities were required to set five-year reduction targets for domestic burglary and vehicle crime (BVPIs 126 and 128). Five metropolitan police authorities (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Metropolitan, West Midlands and West Yorkshire) were required to set five-year reduction targets for robbery (BVPI 127). We do not set milestones, although police authorities may choose to do so. They may also choose to set local indicators and targets.

 From 1 April 2001, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will begin the phased implementation of a system to ensure that victims are informed of decisions, or given explanations for decisions, for which the CPS has responsibility. The police will continue to have responsibility for informing victims about other significant developments in their case.

 The only programme to be accredited before September 2000 was the Think First General Offending Programme; since its accreditation there have been an estimated 80 completions in Devon and Teesside (both Pathfinder areas).

 It is not the Government's practice to publish information about warrants under the Intelligence Services Act 1994. The exercise of the Secretary of State's powers under the Act is overseen by the Commissioner appointed under the Act, who reports annually to the Prime Minister who has a duty under the legislation to lay the report before each House of Parliament. The last annual report, for 1999, was laid before the House in July 2000 (CM4779). The Commissioner explained, as in previous reports, that he had not disclosed the numbers of warrants issued and renewed in the course of the year because particulars of the actual numbers would assist the operation of those hostile to the state.

<P>

<a name="10122w24.html_para3">For convenience, a summary of the available figures since 1997 is as follows: the Tribunal has received and determined 20 complaints; on no occasion did the Tribunal, or Commissioner, uphold a compliant; therefore no remedies have been awarded; and of the 12 occasions that the Commissioner considered referrals under paragraphs 2 and 4 of Schedule 1 to the Act on no occasion did he find that I had acted improperly.
