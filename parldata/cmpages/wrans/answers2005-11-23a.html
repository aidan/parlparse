<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="51123w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 To ask the Prime Minister pursuant to the oral answer of 16 November 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 964, what the evidential basis is for his statement that <i>(a)</i> the administrative costs of the Child Support Agency (CSA) outweighed the money it took in 1997 and <i>(b)</i> in the majority of CSA cases the child concerned is not the product of either a married or stable relationship.  [31234]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51123w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the Child Support Agency&#039;s (CSA) Annual report and accounts for the financial years 1995&#150;96 and 1996&#150;97. Copies of this are available in the Library of the House.

<p>
<a name="51123w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The majority of the workload dealt with by the CSA is generated by the more difficult cases, in particular where there is no previous stable relationship between the parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51123w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">In addition, results from a national survey of CSA clients (Wikely N et al, 2001) (carried out in 1999 prior to the recent reforms) allow comparative analysis of the characteristics of compliant and non-compliant non-resident parents. Previously married and cohabiting non-resident parents were, respectively, five and three times more likely to comply with the CSA than those in less stable relationships.
