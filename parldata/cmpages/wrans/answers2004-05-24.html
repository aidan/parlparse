 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;has taken and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;proposes to take to allow the EU&#039;s Natura 2000 designation to be extended to include sites with ancient trees.  [173956]</p>








<p><a name="40524w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Ancient trees can and do occur in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;candidate Special Areas of Conservation, which together with Special Protection Areas for birds form the Natura 2000 network. However, they are not included specifically either as a habitat type in Annex I, or a species in Annex II, of the Habitats Directive for which sites can be selected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para0">
The purpose of Natura 2000 designation is to conserve areas containing habitats and species of Community interest of high ecological and bio-diversity value, rather than their cultural or historical value. Where ancient trees are included within sites, their cultural value as well as their contribution to the biodiversity of the area is provided for.

</p>



<p>(2) what evaluation her Department has made of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;health, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;disease and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;animal welfare grounds for restricting the import of queen bees from (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawaii and (ii) Australia; and if she will make a statement.  [174129]</p>








<p><a name="40524w01.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 New European Community legislation strengthening the animal health controls and certification requirements for the importation of bees from third countries came into effect across the Community on 27&nbsp;December 2003. Its aim, in particular, is to protect the EU bee population from exotic pests and diseases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para1">
The new import controls include the requirement that consignments of queen honey bees will only be allowed into the Community from those third countries that have demonstrated the veterinary competence to certify bees for export, and provided that the notifiable diseases of bees in the EU&#151;American foul brood, the small hive beetle and tropilaelaps mite&#151;are also confirmed as notifiable throughout the exporting country. The specified third countries are listed in Part 1 to the Annex of Council Decision 79/542 and include the USA and Australia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para2">
To date, only Australia, New Zealand and Argentina have demonstrated to us that they are able to comply with the conditions provided in the legislation, and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1288W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
imports of queens from these countries are permitted. However, in the case of Hawaii, while it is our opinion that it does have a high bee health status, and, indeed, we have until recently permitted imports of queen bees from there, it is nevertheless a territory of the USA. The EU legislation is clear in its intention, and it is our understanding that the three notifiable diseases mentioned above are not yet notifiable throughout the USA as a whole. The Commission has stated that it is not prepared to treat Hawaii as separate from the rest of the USA for this purpose. We are therefore not free to authorise the importation of queens bees from Hawaii until the USA has demonstrated equivalence with the EU.

<a name="40524w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Batteries Directive</h3>





<p><a name="40524w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what representations her Department has made to the European Commission regarding the impact on users of hearing aids of the proposed Batteries Directive;  [171353]

</p>



<p>(2) what representations she has received from <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;organisations representing the hard of hearing and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(b)</i>&nbsp;manufacturers of batteries regarding the impact on hearing aid users of the proposed Batteries Directive.  [171354]</p>








<p><a name="40524w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK Government have made no representation to the European Commission about the impact of the proposed batteries Directive on batteries used in hearing aids. This is because proposals issued by the Commission for a new batteries Directive do not contain any requirement prohibiting the sale of batteries used in hearing aids.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para3">
However, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted during their first reading of the proposal on 20&nbsp;April in favour of an amendment, setting limit values for prohibiting the sale of all batteries that contain more than 5ppm of mercury by weight. The Government understand that because hearing aid batteries may contain more than 5ppm of mercury and 40ppm of lead, by weight, in a zinc air hearing aid battery, there is now concern as to a possible ban. However, the Government have not, as yet, heard from any organisations or manufacturers that may be affected, nor have they heard the reaction of the European Commission to the amendment
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para4">
It should also be noted that the European Parliament also voted on an amendment to exclude from the controls of the new Directive, batteries and accumulators placed in medical devices; namely, those designed to maintain vital functions, where uninterrupted functioning is essential and the batteries and accumulators can be removed only by qualified personnel. If this amendment were accepted, it would not be clear whether those hearing aid batteries containing more than 5ppm of mercury and 40ppm of lead would be excluded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para5">
HMG believes that the inconsistency between these two amendments is likely to be addressed by the European Parliament in its second reading. If the threshold limits proposed remained in the Directive and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1289W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
led to the prohibition of batteries contained in hearing aids, or indeed batteries contained in other medical devices, this would be opposed by the UK and, we believe, by other member states also.

 We have received representation from the British Battery Manufacturers Association (BBMA) and the European Portable Batteries Association (EPBA) who represent all major manufacturers of portable batteries. Also, we have held discussions with Collect Nicad who represent the manufacturers of nickel cadmium batteries.

<p><a name="40524w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Government are committed to banning the practice of beak trimming by the end of 2010. A beak trimming action group has been set up to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry forward an action plan to enable Defra to introduce this ban without compromising bird welfare. However, some form of review process prior to the 2010 ban is not unreasonable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the regulations governing incinerators used for on-farm disposal of chickens, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;how often they will be inspected and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the cost to farmers of carrying out inspections.  [174203]</p>








<p><a name="40524w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 On-farm incinerators which only burn animal carcases such as chickens, must comply with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 and must also be approved in accordance with this Regulation.

<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para7">
This regulation is enforced in England by the Animal&nbsp;By-Products Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/1482) (the ABPR).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para8">
Under the ABPR, the State Veterinary Service is responsible for inspecting and approving incinerator plants in accordance with Regulation 1774/2002. Visits to non-SRM incinerators (such as those incinerating only poultry) will, in general, be carried out on a quarterly basis. However, additional inspections may be carried out should they be necessary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w01.html_para9">
At present there is no cost for either the inspection or the approval of such plants.

<p><a name="40524w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department has received a number of such representations. However, the only exceptions from the ban on the routine on-farm burial or burning of animal by-products, in the UK, would be for remote areas (parts of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the Scilly Isles and Lundy Island) and during outbreaks of notifiable disease if there were a lack of capacity at rendering plants and incinerators, or if transport of the carcases would spread disease.

<p><a name="40524w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Foresight Programme on Flood and Coastal Defence was initiated by the Office of Science and Technology to provide a shared understanding of the challenges faced by a wide range of stakeholders and to assist in the development of a long-term policy response. Stakeholders have contributed to an action plan in response to the Foresight Report which seeks to build upon this shared understanding and provide a channel through which actions across and outside Government can be co-ordinated. I have agreed that the group of key stakeholders which I chair will meet in one year to monitor progress and consider the need for other actions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w02.html_para0">
In order for this action plan to be effective, it must be responsive to change in circumstances and will require regular review.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what constitutes a moderate risk of release of leachate from a landfill site into a surrounding sea or land area.  [171526]</p>








<p><a name="40524w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Landfill Directive requires that a landfill must be situated and designed so as to meet the necessary conditions for preventing pollution of the soil, groundwater or surface water and ensuring efficient collection of leachate as and when required. In addition, the Groundwater Directive requires Member States 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1292W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
to&nbsp;prevent the introduction of certain substances and to limit the introduction of certain other substances into groundwater so as to avoid pollution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w02.html_para1">
The legislation in England that implements both these Directives is regulated by the Environment Agency and it is the Agency that would determine whether a likely release of leachate constituted an unacceptable risk, given the planned location of the landfill, using risk assessment techniques.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w02.html_para2">
For closed landfills that are controlled by a waste management licence, a risk based approach is also adopted by the Environment Agency. Monitoring of leachate, ground and surface waters is required to provide, amongst other things, that leachate controls are preventing pollution of the environment and, where unacceptable risks are identified, the need for measures to prevent, reduce or remove potential leachate pollution are assessed.

<p><a name="40524w02.html_wqn8"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she is taking to promote the minimising of packaging and the&nbsp;prevention of waste creation by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;producers, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;distributors and retailers and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;consumers; and if she will make a statement.  [174232]</p>








<p><a name="40524w02.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There are currently two sets of Regulations that cover packaging in the UK, both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore, businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they handle. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1293W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w02.html_para4">
Both Regulations have actually led to decreases in packaging used around products. For example, less material is used now to make a plastic container than was used a few years ago. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is actually produced in the first place. I have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and to let me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have recommendations for ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w02.html_para5">
Although legislation is a way of reducing packaging and increasing recycling, we would also encourage consumers to play a part. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought &#039;loose&#039; food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers would be more inclined to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.

<p><a name="40524w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency&#039;s Environmental Protection Operator and Pollution Risk Appraisal (EP OPRA) charging scheme is a risk based assessment system, which closely links regulatory effort to environmental risk. EP OPRA was approved by the Government after consultation with industry and is based on four elements: emissions, location, complexity and operator performance. The scheme allows the Agency to recover the costs of carrying out its statutory responsibilities under the Pollution Prevention and Control regime. In line with the &quot;polluter pays principle&quot;, well run companies with low potential risk to the environment are charged less than poorly run ones with a high potential to pollute. The Agency must adhere to the Treasury&#039;s Fees and Charges Guide, which describes how charges for statutory services should be calculated.

The investigating officer at the time of the incident indicates in the file note, that he was unable to substantiate the report, as he could not pin point the exact location of the suspected leachate breakout.

 A change to the standing orders of the House would not be sufficient to allow amendment of statutory instruments: an amendment of each enabling power would be needed.

<a name="40524w04.html_para3">
In its 1996 report on Delegated Legislation, the Procedure Committee considered whether statutory instruments should be made amendable and recommended against, on the grounds that it would involve excessive complication, run directly counter to the past intentions of Parliament, and would frustrate the very purpose for which delegated powers were given.

<p><a name="40524w06.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
In February 2004 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated a total of 324,000 Liberian refugees in neighbouring countries; 147,000 in Guinea, 68,000 in Sierra Leone, 67,000 in Ivory Coast, and 42,000 in Ghana. It has since been estimated that up to 17,000 refugees have returned spontaneously to Liberia from these countries. With improved conditions, services and stability inside Liberia, UNHCR expects up to 100,000 of the remaining refugees to return by the end of 2004, and the remainder in 2005. DFID has assisted with the provision of services and support to refugees and internally displaced persons by providing &#163;10.6m in humanitarian support in 2003 and 2004. DFID has committed a further &#163;6m for Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration, as an additional contribution to post-conflict recovery and the creation of conditions for a return to peace and stability.

<p><a name="40524w07.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The best way of giving young people an alternative to violence and extremism is to ensure they have a full and effective education with good prospects of future employment. DFID&#039;s support to the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA) for which planned expenditure over the next three years is about &#163;15&nbsp;million per calendar year, provides substantial support to education and emergency employment creation. Over two thirds of UNRWA&#039;s annual budget is allocated for the education needs of Palestinian children in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. DFID provides project funding for UNRWA to help improve the school management by involving the local community. Planned funding is about &#163;500,000 per year for the next two years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w07.html_para0">
DFID recently agreed a &#163;7&nbsp;million contribution to the World Bank&#039;s Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund to support the Palestinian Authority. This will have an indirect impact on supporting young people, as the money will help maintain public services including education and keep PA employees at work by paying salaries.

<p><a name="40524w07.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID has not commissioned any such research but monitors the level of disruption to education through regular contact with our Palestinian and international partners including the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Education, United Nations Relief Works Agency and Non Governmental Organisations. Many pupils and teachers now face difficulty in getting to school, which in effect reduces the number of full school days. There is also a reduction in the financial resources 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1309W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
available for education as a result of the severe downturn of the Palestinian economy. The high priority given to education by Palestinian communities means that there has been no increase in the very low dropout rate, and only a small reduction in the high rate of enrolment of pupils in schools. The disruptions and violence nevertheless have a high psychological impact on students and on student achievement.

 To ask the Secretary of State for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Development what assessment his Department has made of the statement released by South Africa&#039;s Deputy President Jacob Zuma&#039;s office on 11&nbsp;May 2004; what his Department&#039;s assessment is of the scale of the problem highlighted by Mr. Zuma; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="40524w07.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The statement by South Africa&#039;s Deputy President Zuma&#039;s office, highlighted the extent of food insecurity and vulnerability in the Southern African region. At the 15&nbsp;May Southern African Development Community Summit on Agriculture and Food Security in Dar es Salaam the South African government announced a contribution of R 100&nbsp;million (approximately &#163;8&nbsp;million) to help meet these needs. DFID welcomes this and believe that South Africa has an important role to play in improving food security in the region, including as a major food producer and grain market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w07.html_para1">
Food security is a continuing challenge in Southern Africa. At the peak of the recent humanitarian crisis, the United Nations assessed that 15.2&nbsp;million people (26&nbsp;per cent. of the population) were in need of food aid. DFID spent over &#163;88 million in 2002&#150;03 in response to the Southern African food crisis (in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho). Acute needs appear to be lessening now as a result of improved harvests in many but not all countries, However, chronic poverty appears to have increased and more communities are now likely to become destitute as a result of variable rainfall or other shocks such as illness or loss of work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w07.html_para2">
The impact of HIV/AIDS has placed a major burden on households and increased their vulnerability. Increasing food production is necessary but not sufficient, since many people do not grow their own food, and lack resources to buy food even if it is available. Increasing employment, land reform, better infrastructure and access to markets, and more private sector investment are also required.

 Full demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) of combatants will only take place in Sudan after a peace agreement has been signed between the Government of Sudan and Sudan People&#039;s Liberation Movement. However, as part of the international effort to promote successful DDR, DFID is currently supporting both the preparation and planning for full-scale demobilisation and the demobilisation of Child Soldiers.
</p>

<a name="40524w07.html_para4">
DFID has provided about &#163;505,000 of assistance to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNICEF for child soldier disarmament and demobilisation, as well as the return, reunification and reintegration of vulnerable children. We have also provided about &#163;312,000 of assistance to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for three DDR field advisers under their preparatory support for reintegration for former combatants and community based weapons reduction. In addition we are also providing a DDR adviser to act as a resource person to the Inter Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in the IGAD-led peace talks, and to the international community through the UN Resident Coordinator for Sudan.

<a name="40524w07.html_para6">
One of DFID&#039;s objectives for the programme in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudan is the development of effective public administration, security and judicial systems. To this end we are supporting policy development, for example, by helping the Sudan People&#039;s Liberation Movement (SPLM) to develop good governance principles for the new Government of South Sudan. DFID is also working on plans to support capacity building on safety, security and accessible justice; on local government; and on public financial management. In addition we have financed a consultancy report on the development of policing in Sudan, and are considering support for security sector reform.

Officials from DFID and the embassy, as well as the UN, have expressed concerns to the Zimbabwean Government. DFID and embassy officials have also discussed this issue with South African officials.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w08.html_para0">
The Government of Zimbabwe&#039;s cancellation of the mission means that there is no internationally accepted estimate of Zimbabwe&#039;s harvest, and their decision not to request international food aid means that normal advance planning processes will not take place.

The actual harvest is probably below 1.2&nbsp;million MT, compared to a requirement of about 1.8&nbsp;million MT. Given the significant shortage of foreign exchange in Zimbabwe, it will be difficult for the Government to import enough grain to fill this gap.

 The Government of Zimbabwe have decided to cancel the joint crop assessment mission with the UN which had started in late April.

 Athletics is benefiting from the Government&#039;s investment of &#163;10&nbsp;million into Club Links, which aims to increase the percentage of young people moving between School Sport Partnerships and governing body accredited clubs. This will build new, and strengthen existing, links between schools and clubs and increase participation opportunities.

<p><a name="40524w09.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 We considered carefully the views expressed to us by, and on behalf of, the circus industry when drawing up the draft Guidance to licensing authorities which was laid before Parliament on 23&nbsp;March. We have, in so far as possible, made the draft Guidance clearer in relation to circuses. We did not accept their case for exemption during the passage of the Licensing Bill, nor for amending the arrangements for temporary events. Further, it is not possible to create exemptions to the Licensing Act 2003 through the Guidance, as it cannot amend the Act.

<p><a name="40524w10.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Since the Children Act 1989 was implemented in 1991, &quot;custody&quot; of a child has ceased to be a concept in the law of England and Wales. Under Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 a court has the power to make a residence order, being

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w10.html_para0">
Section 1(5) of the Children Act provides that a court cannot make an order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all (&quot;the no order principle&quot;). It follows that, if parents are agreed on the arrangements for their child, then it may be that the matter never comes before a court, or that, if it is before a court, the court considers that it is better for the child that no order be made. In other cases, such as those where there is no agreement between the parents, it is open to the court to make a residence order, if it considers that it is in the best interests of the child to do so. Such an order might be a &quot;shared residence&quot; order (so that the child lives with both parents, at different times, usually spending around half his time with each). The following table shows the latest available judicial statistics (2002). During 2002 a total of 103,191 section&nbsp;8 orders were made in private law.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the effects on the private sector of his Department&#039;s decision to reduce the amount it will offset against Connexions partnerships&#039; VAT costs.  [172650]</p>








<p><a name="40524w10.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 We have recommended that partnerships look to improve their tax efficiency. It does not automatically follow that this will have any effect on sub-contracting to private providers. The Department is monitoring how partnerships are dealing with the reduction in VAT transitional funding and we have made it clear that we expect them to continue to involve the private sector. We know that the lead body model is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most tax efficient and an increasing number of areas are adopting this, leaving private sector careers contracts in place.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether it is his Department&#039;s policy to ensure that Connexions partnerships commit themselves to maintaining the pension benefits of private providers&#039; staff if a partnership opts to shift from a sub-contracting operational model to a system of direct delivery and to incorporate the private providers&#039; staff.  [172676]</p>








<p><a name="40524w10.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Connexions Partnerships are private companies with obligations to their individual boards. As such the Department is unable to become involved in individual decisions about pension benefits for Connexions staff. This includes where a partnership opts to shift from a sub-contracting operational model to a system of direct delivery and to incorporate the private providers&#039; staff. We would however expect Connexions partnerships to give due regard to any incoming staff and to make every effort to ensure that they are not disadvantaged in any way.

Although the RoI can offer a lower rate of corporation tax, in recent years, Invest NI has successfully secured new investment from the RoI by promoting Northern Ireland as a region where companies can reap the benefits of the greater competitiveness of the Northern Ireland economy.

Indeed, a recent report, commissioned by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, into the cost of operating business in Northern Ireland concluded that lower labour and property costs, which represent a significant component of the cost base of many firms, places Northern Ireland businesses at a competitive advantage vis-a-vis Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.

<p><a name="40524w15.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 The following table shows the percentage of financial support to business by category in each of the last five years offered by Invest NI and its predecessors. Although the question does not specifically mention the Industrial Research and Technology Unit, as this agency was responsible for providing research and development support prior to Invest NI being set up, it has also been included in the table. Information relating to training support under the Company Development Programme (CDP) as administered by the Business Support Division of DETI has also been incorporated, as this function is now included within Invest NI&#039;s remit. In all cases the figures shown relate to offers of assistance made by the organisations concerned.

It has not been possible to provide detailed information on levels of marketing support as a marketing grant is a form of revenue grant and cannot easily be separated from other revenue grants.

 The Government&#039;s Defence Industrial Policy, published in October 2002, is aimed at enhancing the competitiveness and sustainability of the UK Defence industry, while continuing to provide the armed force with high quality equipment at best value for money. There are a very small number of capabilities which for national security reasons we place a high priority on retaining within the United Kingdom industrial base. Examples exist in the fields of nuclear technology, defence against biological, chemical and radiological warfare, and some counter-terrorist capabilities.

The Government of Honduras has responded to this criticism by undertaking to provide training and rehabilitation schemes for those either in prison or wishing to leave the gangs. We have made clear to the Government of Honduras, bilaterally and in the company of our EU partners, the importance we attach to respect for human rights. I raised human rights, particularly those in respect of children, with Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez, during his recent visit to the UK.

 United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1483 of 22&nbsp;May 2003 decided that all proceeds from the export sale of Iraq&#039;s oil should be deposited into the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). The only exception to this is that 5&nbsp;per cent. of proceeds from oil should be deposited into the United Nations Compensation Fund for Kuwait established in accordance with UNSCR 687 of 1991 and subsequent relevant resolutions. As outlined in UNSCR 1483, this latter requirement will be binding on an internationally recognised sovereign government of Iraq unless that government and the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission decide otherwise. Neither the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Iraqi Government institutions, nor any other parties deduct costs from oil revenues. The CPA meets its own costs from coalition funding, and Iraqi Government Departments and agencies are funded through the Iraqi budget.

 Each primary care trust (PCT) has a duty to meet all reasonable requirements to provide or secure national health service primary medical services in its area. For their part, general practitioner practices have discretion to accept a failed asylum seeker as a registered NHS patient. However, since the NHS is intended for those living lawfully in the United Kingdom, existing guidance discourages GP practices from accepting failed asylum seekers as patients.

Under these proposals, practices would continue to be required to provide treatment, including potentially for asthma, which they regard as emergency or immediately necessary to anyone who needs it.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;This information was obtained from the prescribing analysis and cost (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by GP practices in England and dispensed in the community. Prescriptions written within a GP practice but dispensed outside the PCT will be included in the PCT in which the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data.<br>

2.&nbsp;Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>

3.&nbsp;With effect from October 2002, the prescription pricing analysis (PPA) information systems were changed to reflect Shifting the Balance of Power. Shifting the Balance of Power saw the creation 



of SHAs and PCTs, which shifted the balance of power within the national health services away from Whitehall and towards front line clinical staff and their patients. Due to Shifting the Balance of Power, from the October 2002 release of ePACT.net, PCT data reflects the organisational structures in place on 1&nbsp;October 2002. This was true for all 36 months historic data on ePACT.net, so data on ePACT.net prior to October 2002 was also amended retrospectively so that it was in line with Shifting the Balance of Power.<br>

The Department and its agencies are very heavily reliant on ICT for the conduct of their business and, while there is no formal, corporate process for validating staff competence in ICT, staff are assessed, as part of the performance appraisal process, on their ability to undertake their roles effectively.

<p>
<a name="40524w28.html_para2">
General IT skills are now an everyday element for any public service and service based organisation, including the NHS, and provision for this will form part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal continuing professional and personal development for all NHS staff within existing budgets and training plans. The European computer driving licence is helping to improve general skills across the NHS.

As we complete the more detailed plans for each geographical cluster and local service provider contract we will map out the extent of IT support for clinical practice and patient care to support the implementation of the NPfIT.

<sup>(34)</sup>&nbsp;A new system of occupation coding for NHS non-medical staff was introduced in 1995. The new codes classify staff according to what they do rather than the terms and conditions under which they are employed i.e. national pay scales. Figures based on new occupation codes are not directly comparable with those based on the old pay scale classification. Therefore figures since 1995 are not comparable with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup>&nbsp;From 1982 onwards data are taken from the Department of Health Non-Medical Workforce Census. Prior to 1982 data are taken from the Health and Personal Social Services Statistics for England (HPSSS). Data from HPSSS contains hospital-based staff only and is therefore not directly comparable with later years.<br>

Notes:<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

Removal of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe was suspended on 15&nbsp;January 2002; we did not at the time consider that it was unsafe to return them but in view of the rapidly changing circumstances it was appropriate not to enforce returns. The suspension has been maintained since that date and although we still consider it would not be unsafe to return failed asylum seekers there, enforced returns would be inappropriate in the wider context of the Government&#039;s position on Zimbabwe. An exception to the suspension policy in cases where a failed asylum seeker has a serious criminal record or their presence in the United Kingdom is not otherwise conducive to the public good was announced on 5&nbsp;February 2004. In such circumstances enforced return to Zimbabwe would be considered by Ministers on a case-by-case basis.

 There is nothing to prevent the majority of failed asylum seekers from leaving the country voluntarily and there is no need for them to become homeless or destitute. They can seek assistance with return from either the Immigration Service or the International Organisation for Migration. Those unable to leave immediately who are complying with the process for return may, on application, be provided with accommodation under section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as amended. There is no need for anyone in this group to become homeless or destitute. They can seek accommodation as soon as they receive the final decision on their asylum claim. In addition, letters sent to failed asylum seekers by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) notifying them of the termination of support now give advice on the availability of section 4 support. MASS has also now introduced a one-stage application process in order to reduce the time taken to process applications.

<p><a name="40524w33.html_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> It is the responsibility of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) to set its own criteria for grant funding under the provisions of section 44 of the Race Relations Act 1976, and then to make decisions on individual applications on the basis of how well they meet those criteria. The CRE consulted widely on its proposals to move away from its previous policy of funding posts in bodies it supports, mainly Race Equality Councils, to funding projects focused on outcomes (ie the Getting Results programme). I understand that its partners welcomed the new approach, as do the Government.

<p><a name="40524w33.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The publication of a race equality scheme is a specific duty placed on certain public bodies under the Race Relations Act 1976 (Statutory Duties) Order 2001. The responsibility for delivering these schemes lies with the bodies listed in the order. Section 44 funding has never been intended to fund the delivery of this particular aspect of the Race Equality Duty. However, the Commission for Racial Equality informs me that one of the specific priorities for Getting Results funding in 2004&#150;05 has been measuring the impact of the Race Equality Duty, and that &#163;193,200 has been awarded to organisations under this priority.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it a policy of the Government to require those convicted of crimes, who are provided with a new identity upon their release, to contribute to the costs involved where they have the means to do so.  [163151]</p>








<p><a name="40524w33.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Most of the very small number of convicted criminals who need new identities on release from prison do so because, at some point in the criminal proceedings, they have decided to turn Queen&#039;s Evidence and appear as witnesses for the prosecution against their former partners in crime. Since in doing this they have helped to convict other (often more serious) offenders, then it is cost-effective for the state to offer to pay for any necessary change to their identity, and any other associated costs. In other cases the state is required to take reasonable steps to fulfil its duty to protect the lives of those threatened by others. Only in the most exceptional circumstances would this include a formal change of identity and only where the threat to life is clearly evidenced and the change of identity considered appropriate by the police.

In addition to powers under PACE, powers under s&nbsp;41&nbsp;(1) Terrorism Act 2000 allow a constable to arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist, which is defined in s 40. In this case, powers under Schedule 8, paragraph 2 permit an authorised person to take any steps which are reasonably necessary for photographing, measuring or identifying a person detained under s 41. Again, these powers will be unaffected by the introduction of an identity card but again a power is available under the draft Identity Cards Bill that would allow a check of a biometric of a person detained under this section if it were not reasonably practical for this information to be obtained by another means.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which private sector databases will be used to check identities under proposals contained in the draft Identity Card Bill.  [172299]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1420W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40524w35.html_spnew22"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Identity Cards: the Next Steps (CM&nbsp;6020) made clear that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases to help establish that an application for a card is genuine. Data-sharing gateways established for this purpose will be used only when processing applications for cards or related purposes (e.g. when issuing a replacement) and do not confer any general power to share data for wider purposes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para20">
This approach to identity verification follows proposals included in the Cabinet Office study on Identity fraud (published in July 2002) which recommended greater use of biographical checks on applicants for passports and driving licences. The most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective way of confirming this biographical information is to check some of the information provided by applicants with information held on a range of Government and private sector databases. These checks could for example confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para21">
The databases that could be checked would include public sector bodies (such as the National Insurance or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) databases) as well as private sector organisations (such as credit reference agencies or banks) but it is at this stage too early to know precisely which databases would be checked.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para22">
Information requested would be restricted to that needed to confirm the identity of an individual who has made an application to register. Clause 11 (1) and (2) of the draft Identity Cards Bill published on 26&nbsp;April places a duty on a person to provide information to the Secretary of State or a designated documents authority for the purposes of verifying an individual&#039;s entry to the Register. Clause 11 (4) sets out that the requirement may be imposed on any person specified in an order subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This means that particular gateways could be established only with the consent of Parliament and for the limited purpose of validating information on the Register.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research he conducted on the impact of identity theft in countries where identity cards have been introduced.  [173049]</p>








<p><a name="40524w35.html_spnew24"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Home Office officials have had detailed discussions with colleagues involved in the operation of identity card schemes in Italy, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands and comprehensive information has been supplied by each of the EU member states on the operation of their card schemes. Home Office officials have also liaised with colleagues involved in the operation of card schemes in Singapore and Japan and with officials in countries such as Canada, USA and Australia that do not have card schemes on emerging crime trends.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para26">
Many card schemes were developed with specific aims and objectives such as population registration and not specifically implemented for countering identity fraud. As such, many identity cards are issued locally after checking available information, for example, birth certificates and information relating to an applicant&#039;s parents. In many countries it is not necessary to give biometric information when applying for an identity card.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para27">
&quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; (CM 6020) states that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks against other databases. These checks would confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years. This information is more difficult to forge than birth certificates or other similar documents and follows recommendations in &quot;Identity Fraud: A Study&quot; conducted by the Cabinet Office and published in 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para28">
Many card schemes in other countries were implemented some time ago and use mainly paper cards, which do not hold biometric data. With the passage of time, there is an increasing risk that fraudsters could obtain access to modern printing technology and use it to produce forged paper cards for the purpose of committing identity fraud. The absence of a central electronic identity register in many countries increases the risks because an identity card (or biometric data) cannot be checked against a centrally held record of that information. Organisations checking a card are therefore able only to make visual checks, for example, to check 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1422W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
that the photograph on an identity card looks like the person presenting the card and to check for obvious signs of tampering with the card itself.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para29">
In &quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; the Government stated that the National Identity Register will link each individual record to a biometric. This will help to prevent multiple identities from being established and allow organisations to check a card at a level appropriate for the service they are providing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w35.html_para30">
While a modern and effective card scheme would help to combat identity fraud, it does not mean that every card scheme, especially those that have been implemented some time ago, would have a similar or significant effect on countering this type of crime unless they have been regularly updated to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. It is therefore not possible to assess the effect that other card schemes have had on identity fraud.

We are currently working with the Chinese to assist with their design and drafting of regulations to increase their use of renewable energy over the coming years. In close co-operation with the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), we received a delegation of Chinese law makers in March, for a programme of meetings when they were able to discuss the issues involved with UK Government Departments and with UK industry. In May we sent a specialist who works with our Distributed Generation Working Group, and a Trade Promoter of the DTI&#039;s New and Renewable Energy Programme, to Beijing to join a working group developing the drafting of these regulations, which are expected to come into force next year.

However, these figures do not constitute an estimate of non-compliance since there are certain circumstances where the usual minimum wage rates do not apply, in which case it may be legitimate for an employer to pay below National Minimum Wage rates.

There are two main instances when individuals may legitimately earn less than the appropriate minimum wage for their age. Firstly, individuals may be on certain Government training programmes or apprenticeships, in which they are exempt for the first year up to the age of 26. Also, employees aged over 21 who receive accredited training (such as those doing NVQs) may be exempted from receiving the full adult national minimum wage for the first six months of training in a new job with a new employer. Secondly, employees may be exempted if they are receiving accommodation that is tied to their employment. Such employees do not have to be paid all of their minimum wage entitlement in cash terms because employers can legitimately reduce rates to take into account the cost of accommodation provided; from October 2003 this has amounted to a daily offset of &#163;3.50, leading to a maximum weekly offset of &#163;24.50.

In practice, the number of workers who can legitimately be paid below minimum wage rates is likely to be substantially lower than these figures. This is because a significant proportion of people receiving free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accommodation as part of the job, holding apprenticeships or taking part in Government training programmes are likely to be earning in excess of the minimum wage.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the latest position is regarding the opt-out from the 48-hour limit on the working week under the Working Time Directive; and if she will make a statement.  [174871]</p>








<p><a name="40524w43.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Working Time Regulations 1998 (WTR) which implement the provisions of the Working Time Directive in UK law came into force on 1&nbsp;October 1998. The Regulations currently include an opt-out provision to the weekly working time limit. Under the opt-out, an individual worker may agree to work more than 48 hours a week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w43.html_para0">
The opt-out was initially granted for a period of 15 years but has since been extended. A review has been carried out and the European Commission have decided to consult more widely over working time changes. The Commission published a consultation communication on 5&nbsp;January 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w43.html_para1">
The UK response to the Communication (31&nbsp;March 2004) argued strongly for the retention of the opt-out. While the Government are in favour of providing fair minimum standards of employment protection, they are 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2004 : Column 1447W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
also keen to maintain the flexibility our individual labour market requires, and, which many individual workers prefer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w43.html_para2">
The second stage consultation paper from the European Commission was recently published on 19&nbsp;May. It presented the following options:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Option 1&#151;</i>Keep the individual opt out with tighter conditions of application.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Option 2&#151;</i>Opt-out only available through collective agreement.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Option 3&#151;</i>Opt out available through collective agreement, but retain the possibility of individual opt out in the absence of such an agreement and for undertakings without worker representation.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Option 4&#151;</i>Phase out the opt out.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w43.html_para3">
Option 1 is the only one to ensure workers have real choice and ensure working hours are tailored to what individual workers want.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w43.html_para4">
The UK and the Commission agree that extending the reference period for working hours, so that these can be averaged over a period of up to 12 months without the need for a collective agreement would increase the flexibility of both employers and workers. This is of particular value in the UK because, as the Commission&#039;s Communication notes, collective or workforce agreements are not widespread here.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40524w43.html_para5">
There is now in a 6-week period of negotiation with the social partners: UNICE, the European employers&#039; federation; ETUC, the European employees organisation; and CEEP, the public sector employers organisation. If the social partners do not agree to negotiate on a workable solution during this time, the Commission will propose legislation by co-decision by the summer 2004.

<p class="tabletext">Estimates have been produced from the Office for National Statistics&#039; analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot; published on the National Statistics website on 6&nbsp;May 2004 at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,000 households in the UK and sample sizes for each region are only sufficient to give approximate estimates.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The current analysis presents data for the category &#039;Council tax and Northern Ireland rates&#039;, as opposed to the category &#039;Local taxes&#039; used in previous analyses. This is because, from this year, charges made by water authorities for water, environmental and sewerage services have been excluded. This treatment conforms to the National Accounts classification and definition of taxes where water rates and related charges are considered a charge for services rather than a tax. They have therefore been excluded from the calculation of disposable income. This reply is based on the new methodology and includes updated 2001&#150;02 figures on this basis for comparison.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The table shows, for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, the average net council tax paid for all households in each Government Office Region and for each income quintile group within each region where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discounts. The table also shows the boundaries between equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for households in each Government Office Region. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of those households are estimated to lie.</p>

 Following the announcement by the Chancellor that a duty differential of 0.5p/l in favour of sulphur free petrol will apply from 1&nbsp;September 2004, we anticipate that this will rapidly replace low sulphur petrol. The marketing of sulphur free fuels is a matter for the oil industry, however we do expect that the duty differential will be sufficient to ensure widespread availability across the UK generally. Certainly, early indications from the oil industry are that Scotland will be among the first areas to see the introduction of sulphur-free fuels.
