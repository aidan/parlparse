 The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for appointing two commissioners to the Boundary Commission for Scotland. The commission is an independent and impartial advisory body, responsible for reviews of constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament, and constituencies in Scotland for the Westminster Parliament. One of the current commissioner appointments will run until 31 December 2010, the other until 6 June 2011. The posts are part time and require around one to two days work per month during the period of a boundary review. Commissioners are paid a daily fee, currently &#163;486, for attending commission meetings and for meeting preparation. Applicants are expected to have a good understanding of the social geography of Scotland, the structure of constituencies for the Westminster and the Scottish Parliaments, and the electoral system. There are no statutory political restrictions, but it is recognised that commissioners are expected to be politically neutral. Appointments are made following Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and other relevant guidance.</p>

In practice, assistant commissioners are appointed to conduct public inquiries into the commission's provisional recommendations. In Scotland, it is customary for Sheriffs Principal who preside over the relevant areas to be appointed for this purpose given their unquestioned independence and impartiality, and their local connection to the areas under consideration. These appointments are unpaid, and made for the duration of the inquiry process, typically a few months.</p>

 Records held centrally on service personnel who have gone absent without leave (AWOL) relate to the number of incidents reported, not to the number of personnel. Therefore, individuals with multiple periods of absence are recorded more than once. For this reason the percentage of service personnel who went absent without leave in each of the last 10 years cannot be provided. The following table shows absence without leave statistics for each service by calendar year for each of the last 10 years:</p>

 Every effort is made to ensure that VIP visits to operational theatres proceed smoothly. However, on occasion, there are inevitably difficulties due to adverse weather, equipment serviceability and competing operational requirements for finite air and aviation resources. Visits are also on occasion cancelled for reasons without the control of my Department. We do not collate detailed statistics on the number of VIP visits delayed or cancelled and generating robust statistics could be achieved only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 February 2009]:</i> Taking the armed forces as a whole, retention rates are relatively stable and we have seen no unexplained peaks of personnel leaving in the last 10 years. There is real concern, however, that in some important areas exit rates are too high and appear to be increasing, if only slightly, year on year. These pinch point trades are continuously monitored and specific action is taken to improve retention and indeed recruitment. The recent Command Paper (July 2008) set out over 40 measures aimed at addressing many of the disadvantages of service life while the Government's response to the Report of Inquiry into National Recognition of our Armed Forces has now been presented to Parliament detailing how we have accepted the majority of recommendations. In addition, a wide range of measures are in place to improve retention, including career management, improvement to conditions of service and work/life balance, commitment bonuses and targeted financial retention initiatives.</p>

 As part of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), HMCS Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (HMCS HIOW) has to make efficiency savings over the next three years. The proposal to close Lyndhurst temporarily and transfer its work to Southampton, a modern purpose built magistrates court is one of a series of measures identified by local management to improve efficiency and reduce the running costs of the area during this period.</p>

 Wisbech magistrates court is a two criminal court room building in an accessible part of Wisbech. The building is co-located alongside the local police station (Cambridgeshire Constabulary) and their custody suite which is accessed by the courthouse. Cambridgeshire Constabulary are the tenants of HMCS. Many of the building services are linked to the adjacent police station. The courthouse has the use of two cells under a shared arrangement with the police and the Prisoner Escort Service (PECS). Recently Cambridgeshire Constabulary has made public its intention to move custody arrangements to a new county facility in March, Cambridgeshire from the end of March 2009 and will no longer provide this at Wisbech police station. The Wisbech police station will remain as an operational unit. HMCS have been actively involved in discussions with both the Cambridgeshire Constabulary and the PECs delivery organisation (GSL) as to how HMCS can ensure practical occupation of the cell area in order for the HMCS business to continue to operate as usual. Without the use of an available and suitable on site custody suite the use of the courthouse would be considerably reduced which is why the local HMCS area has been working proactively alongside both Cambridgeshire Constabulary and PECs to resolve this situation successfully. There are no current plans or proposals to change or reduce the use of this courthouse.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> Mortgage data includes all types of lender.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Figures for the latest year are provisional.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> The court, following a judicial hearing, may grant an order for possession immediately. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted. However, even where a warrant for possession is issued, the parties can still negotiate a compromise to prevent eviction.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Includes outright and suspended orders, the latter being where the court grants the claimant possession but suspends the operation of the order. Provided the defendant complies with the terms of suspension, which usually require the defendant to pay the current mortgage or rent instalments plus some of the accrued arrears, the possession order cannot be enforced.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> The rollout of the Possession Claim On-Line (PCOL) system in late 2006 has affected the availability of court-level data. Only those county courts who do not have direct on site access to PCOL were affected. Consequently, upward adjustment has been made to estimate the effects of missing data. The figures for these courts are adjusted at HMCS regional level.<br>

 The commander of the Turkish army in north Cyprus is Lieutenant-General Hilmi Akin Zorlu. He has served in a wide variety of assignments during his career, including as commander of the international security assistance force in Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003. In the UN Secretary-General&#146;s latest report on Cyprus, he reported that the situation in the buffer zone remained calm and stable and that the opposing forces extended in general good co-operation to the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). He also commended the cancellation by both sides of their annual military exercises. The UK welcomes such steps and would encourage further such confidence building measures.</p>

<a name="90209w0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09020935003918"><ul><p class="tabletext">Government revenue is mainly divided into taxes or service charges. Taxes are compulsory unrequited payments, where unrequited means that the payer does not receive anything directly in return. Service payments are requited in that they include the delivery of a service in exchange for a payment. In some instances the classification of these receipts can be difficult to interpret and the international statistical manuals recognise that &#147;the borderline between taxes and payments for services rendered is not always clear cut in practice&#148;. As a result ONS consider the nature of the receipts carefully before reaching a decision.</p>
</ul><a name="90209w0019.htm_brev1"><a name="09020935003919"><ul><p class="tabletext">The London congestion charge and road/bridge toll charges are payments made for vehicles to use the roads within a defined zone. The charges are judged to be requited payments in line with international guidance and are therefore classified as payments for a service.</p>
</ul><a name="90209w0019.htm_brev2"><a name="09020935003920"><ul><p class="tabletext">The LEZ and the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames emissions based parking charge are classified as taxes. The LEZ charge is a compulsory payment for specific vehicles to drive within the LEZ. Although the vehicles gain access to roads within the LEZ. the charging policy relates to vehicles polluting the air within the zone rather the use of the roads. The LEZ charge on the use of the non-compliant vehicle is judged to be unrequited and classified as a tax on pollution.</p>
</ul><a name="90209w0019.htm_brev3"><a name="09020935003921"><ul><p class="tabletext">Similarly, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames's charge for a permit to park in a Controlled Parking Zone, which was implemented on 2 April 2007, is based on the emissions of the vehicle concerned. The decision to classify the charge as a tax on pollution is similar to the LEZ: the charge relates to the vehicle emissions rather than the direct consumption of a service.</p>

 Since 2005 a report on the contributory factors, including speed, reported by police officers who attend personal injury collisions has been published as part of &#147;Road Casualties Great Britain&#148;. The DFT-funded &#147;On The Spot (OTS)&#148; study involves additional non-police investigation of road collisions to explore the characteristics of personal injury collisions in depth.

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="90209w0023.htm_para1"><a name="09020940000369">For example, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) published a review of non-UK studies in 1994 which established a link between vehicle speed and the risk of a collision. This indicated that, in broad terms, a 1 mph reduction in average speed can reduce accident risk by around 5 per cent. In 2000 TRL published a report investigating whether this general rule could be applied to different types of UK roads and to further understand the relationship between vehicle speed and accident frequency. The report concluded that the percentage reduction in accident frequency for a 1 mph reduction in average speed is between 2 per cent. and 7 per cent. depending on vehicle speeds and the nature and layout of the road.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 February 2009]: </i>The Department for Transport has not assessed the effectiveness of speed cameras in improving road safety in Southend. However, cameras operated by the Essex Safety Camera Partnership under the National Safety Camera Programme which ended on 31 March 2007 have proved to be very effective. Fatal casualties reduced by an average of 43 per cent. at fixed camera sites and killed or seriously injured casualties reduced by an average of 51 per cent. At mobile camera sites fatal casualties reduced by 42 per cent. and killed or seriously injured casualties reduced by an average of 22 per cent.</p>

 The humanitarian situation remains grave with up to 1.3 million displaced in eastern Democratic of the Congo (DRC) and many conflict affected communities in need of emergency assistance. According to the UN, almost 130,000 people in Province Orientale have been recently displaced by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) attacks and almost 300 killed in January as Joint DRC/Ugandan/South Sudan military operations are underway. There are also Joint Rwandan and DRC military operations in North Kivu to tackle the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR). Humanitarian access and protection of civilians remain key areas of concern. John Holmes, UN Under-Secretary General and Emergency Relief Co-ordinator will be visiting DRC between 6-10 February to assess the humanitarian response and protection concerns in North Kivu and Province Oriental.</p>

We have developed a development programme which responds to the needs and constraints of the country, balancing meeting short-term needs (e.g. humanitarian assistance) with helping to lay the foundation for long-term development. We have worked closely with the international community to develop a joint donor framework and donor co-ordination is slowly improving. Given the high levels of poverty DRC remains under-funded overall. However, there are currently significant operational constraints to absorbing further aid.</p>

 Since the previous question raised by the hon. Member, HM Treasury and its agencies have had no apprenticeships or advanced apprenticeships in place. Efforts are made to raise awareness of the programmes available and HM Treasury and its agencies will continue to seek to attract potential candidates to apprenticeship schemes including with our outsourced suppliers.</p>

The lack of take-up can be attributed to the highly skilled workforce that is already in place. A recent sample of HM Treasury and Office of Government Commerce colleagues found 98.6 per cent. of respondents were qualified to level 2 or above. This suggests the pool of potential applicants for apprenticeships is relatively small.</p>

1. To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits, so, for example, the decision for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on grounds of mental or behavioural disorders would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the personal capability assessment; or on the effects of any associated mental health problems. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation.<br>
2. Mental impairments are defined as organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders (F00-F09), mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19), schizophrenia, scizotypal and delusional disorders (F20-F29), mood affective disorders (F30-F39), neurotic, stress related and somatoform disorders (F40-F48), behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors (F50-F59), disorders of adult personality and behaviour (F60-F69), mental retardation (F70-F79), disorders of psychological development (F80-F89), behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90-F98) and unspecified mental disorder (F99). All other medical conditions are included in the physical impairments category.<br>
3. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3. The reference period for households below average income figures is single financial years.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; series, which uses net disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. For the households below average income series, incomes have been equivalised using OECD equalisation factors.<br>
6. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children and proportions have been rounded to the nearest per cent.<br>
7. Children have been counted as being in workless families where they are in lone parent families where the parent does not work or in couple families where both parents do not work.<br>
8. Parents have been counted as being of working age if at least one is of working age (i.e. 64 or below for men, 59 or below for women).<br>

<i> [holding answer 5 February 2009]:</i> The target audience for the Skills for Life strategy is adults in England with literacy and/or numeracy skills below Level 2 and this includes learners aged 25 years and over. The increase in the number of Skills for Life (literacy, language and numeracy) learners aged 25 years and over (and in all other age groups) in 2004-05 and 2005-06 was part of our Skills for Life strategy to improve the basic skills of 2.25 million adults between 2001 and 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="90209w0032.htm_para7"><a name="09021015000032">The strategy is based around boosting demand, ensuring capacity, raising standards and increasing learner achievement. The boosting demand element included work with employers to raise awareness of the issue and the successful 'Get On' campaign to encourage individuals to improve their skills. DIUS is refreshing its Skills for Life strategy and will soon be publishing a delivery document.</p>

 The interest rate applicable to pre-1998 student loans is governed by the Education (Student Loans) Act 1990 and the Student Loans (Regulations) 1998 which set out that for the period between 1 September and the following 31 August the interest rate is the daily rate which results in an APR equal to the RPI (retail price index). The interest rate used is the RPI for the preceding March. Setting the interest rate in this way ensures that borrowers, over time, repay in real terms only as much as they borrowed. Moreover, if a borrower's income falls below &#163;25,936 per annum, they can apply for their repayments to be deferred.</p>

 As part of the management of the &#147;single pot&#148; funding model, the regional development agencies (RDAs) and the London Development Agency (LDA) have the authority to agree &#147;loans&#148; between themselves, as a way of maximising the use of their overall budget allocation. This is often utilised to overcome issues around the timing of expenditure. Whilst there is no need to process such transactions between the RDAs generally (because they are all non voted), funds to the LDA are voted (because it is governed by the Greater London Authority) and any changes are, therefore, necessarily reflected in supplementary estimates.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 February 2009]:</i> Merger control functions in the UK are carried out by the UK's independent competition authorities. Cases are considered on grounds of their impact on competition in the relevant markets.

Under section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT may, instead of making a reference to the CC, accept appropriate undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_453"><a name="90209w0038.htm_para20"><a name="09021017000298">One recent example is the acquisition by Co-operative Group Limited (Co-op) of Somerfield Limited.

 The findings from each annual report of the Citizenship Education Longitudinal study cannot be viewed in isolation. Together they will inform policy development and enable us to improve the quality and delivery of citizenship education. The sixth annual report recognises that citizenship education, although a very helpful measure, is unlikely by itself to address the &#145;democratic deficit&#146;. It suggests that schools and citizenship education provision are likely to have an indirect influence through democracy in schools and student efficacy on student attitudes and intentions. As we set out in the Children&#146;s Plan, the Government&#146;s aim are for all young people to want and be able to participate and take responsible action. We believe that the new duty on schools to invite and consider the views of pupils on matters that affect them will help to strengthen efficacy levels among children and young people and encourage them to continue to play an active part in their community.</p>

 It is for schools to decide whether to observe days of remembrance or celebration and how that might fit with the curriculum or the wider education of the students. However, there are some elements of history that we believe are of vital importance and will continue to ensure that they are covered by all schools&#151;the study of the Holocaust is one of these. Holocaust Memorial Day aims to encourage greater awareness among young people of the relevance of the Holocaust and the need for mutual respect and understanding.

The document does not represent a set of new policy initiatives but aims to dispel some of the common myths and misunderstanding around faiths schools. In it, the Government and faith leaders of all faiths that have publicly funded schools in England reaffirmed their commitment to continue to work together and with all schools to improve the life chances of children, to build bridges to greater mutual trust and understanding, and contribute to a just and cohesive society, while nurturing children in their faith and as engaged citizens.

<i> [holding answer 2 February 2009]:</i><i> </i>It is crucial that young people have the right skills to compete in an increasingly fast changing global economy. Communication skills in other languages, combined with an understanding and appreciation of other cultures, will become increasingly important for the jobs of the future. We have made no specific assessment of this issue and have no plans to issue specific guidance to schools on intercultural competencies. However, intercultural understanding is a key concept within compulsory language learning for 11 to 14-year-olds, where pupils learn to appreciate other cultures, recognise different ways of seeing the world, develop an international look and communicate with native speakers where possible.</p>

 The Department allocated &#163;82,567,000 to local authorities in both 2007-08 and 2008-09 through the Music Standards Fund. We have asked local authorities to prioritise the provision of instrumental and vocal tuition at Key Stage 2 with this funding. We are also investing &#163;10 million per year to 2011 on Sing Up, the National Singing Programme spearheaded by Howard Goodall. With this early introduction to quality music experiences we believe that children will come to see themselves as musicians and will have a real and long-lasting enjoyment of music which will encourage them to continue their learning as they move into secondary school. The compulsory Music Curriculum at Key Stage 3 is now much more focussed on performance and hands-on music making. The curriculum builds on students&#146; own interests and skills and should, therefore, engage them  <br>

 We believe that all young people should participate in education or training until at least 18. Young people who stay on after 16 are more likely to gain higher levels of qualifications by 18 than those who do not and are less likely to commit crimes, behave antisocially or to suffer ill health. The Education and Skills Act 2008 introduced compulsory participation until 18 for all young people and this will ensure that the entire education system focuses on the needs of the all young people, including those with profound and multiple learning difficulties. It may be that the most suitable and appropriate provision for a particular young person would continue to be a special school, in which case this should be the key factor in determining where that young person receives their education.</p>

The present Special Educational Needs statutory framework provides for children and young people with statements to be taught in mainstream schools where this is what their parents want and is compatible with the efficient education of other children. It also provides for parents to seek a special school  <br>

If a young person with SEN remains at school after reaching age 16, the school and the local authority continue the SEN arrangements already in place, subject to further regular reviews. If a young person with SEN continues their education at a further education college the Learning and Skills Council has a duty to take regard of the young person's learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>

 The safety and efficacy of medicinal products is formally assessed from clinical trials submitted at the time of marketing authorisation. These data are carefully evaluated by the independent scientific advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to authorisation for evidence that the products work and are acceptably safe. The longer term safety of the use of medicines in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by the MHRA, including reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by health professionals and patients through the Yellow Card scheme, to ensure that benefit risk balance continues to be favourable.</p>

In 2000, comparative clinical trial data raised concerns over the risk of heart attacks and other thrombotic cardiovascular events in association with use of rofecoxib. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM, the predecessor to the CHM) reviewed the safety of rofecoxib on several occasions between 2000 and 2003. This led to updates to product information and prescribing advice on the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events. In 2004, the manufacturers of rofecoxib withdrew the product after clinical trial data comparing rofecoxib with placebo (a dummy pill) provided the first definitive evidence of an increased risk of heart  <br>

The safety of other selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was fully reviewed between 2004 and 2006 and the conclusion was that the benefits of the authorised NSAIDs continue to outweigh the risks in the licensed indications.</p>

The Expert Working Group conducted a comprehensive review of the safety of this entire class of drugs, examining all available evidence and reviewing all the regulatory advice issued.

The balance of risks and benefits of LABA was recently reviewed at the request of CHM, and was considered positive in the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents, provided LABA are used with inhaled corticosteroids. The outcome of the review was published in the MHRA bulletin Drug Safety Update, which is available on the MHRA website.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services contract on 1 April 2004.<br>
2. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services practices also taking part.<br>
3. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health.<br>
4. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national information technology system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br>
5. The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, PCTs and strategic health authorities objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients.<br>
6. QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.<br>
7. Figures presented here are just the number of patients on the disease register for dementia.<br>

Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.<br>
The vast majority of these prescriptions are written by general medical practitioners in England; however, prescriptions written by nurses, dentists, other non-medical prescribers and hospital doctors are also included provided they were dispensed in the community.<br>

Middlesbrough PCT remained but as a smaller PCT.  <sup>(3)</sup> Langbaurgh PCT merged with a part of Middlesbrough PCT and became Redcar and Cleveland PCT.  <sup>(4)</sup> For 2007-08 and 2006-07 the North East total is the total for North East SHA. For previous years the North East total is the sum of the constituent organisations existing at the time.  <i> Notes:</i>  The Information Centre (IC) have provided data from the national Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) to answer part (a) and data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to answer part (b). (a) The national QOF records the number of people recorded on practice disease registers. A register exists for coronary heart disease (CHD). Register counts are available for the last four financial years. The IC are unable to supply information for all the areas requested as some are not health regions. Where this occurs we have supplied information for the health areas that best fit those requested. Furthermore, some of these health areas have changed under the reconfiguration of PCTs and SHAs in 2006. (b) Figures from the HES give a count of hospital admission episodes with a primary diagnosis of &#147;coronary heart disease&#148; (CHD). This is not a count of people treated as the same person could have been admitted several times and this also excludes treatment taking place in primary care. <i> Definitions</i><i>  Table 1</i> QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services contract on 1 April 2004. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services practices also taking part. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br>
The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, PCTs and SHAs objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients. The QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. <i> CHD Register&#151;definition</i> In order to call and recall patients effectively in any disease category and in order to be able to report on indicators for coronary heart disease, practices must be able to identify their patient population with CHD. This will include all patients who have had coronary artery revascularisation procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients with Cardiac Syndrome X should generally not be included in the CHD register. Practices should record those with a past history of myocardial infarction as well as those with a history of CHD.<br>
<i> Table 2</i><i> Ungrossed data</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes (hospital admissions)</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Primary diagnosis</i> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. The ICD-10 codes used to identify CHD are as follows: 120&#151;Angina pectoris 121&#151;Acute Myocardial infarction 122&#151;Subsequent myocardial infarction 123&#151;Certain current complications following acute myocardial infarction 124&#151;Other acute ischaemic heart diseases. 125&#151;Chronic ischaemic heart disease. <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. <i> Data quality</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> PCT/SHA data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. <i> Source: </i>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

Following their acceptance of the recommendations in the report &#147;A Conscious Decision&#148; Ministers agreed that by 31 December 2001 general anaesthesia for dental treatment should be administered in a hospital setting with critical care facilities . During 2001 regulations were put in place in respect of the administration of general anaesthesia for dental treatment under arrangements to provide general dental services and in the private sector. Thus anyone doing this in the primary care setting for the last year had to be inspected and registered by their local health authority. The large numbers of general anaesthetics undertaken by general dental practitioners (GDPs) and also the Community Dental Service had to be transferred to the hospital setting. Currently a large proportion of those general anaesthetics for treatment of dental caries are provided by the Salaried Dental Services, but out of acute hospital Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery departments under a services level agreement. They are usually out-patient in nature but because general anaesthetic has been given are counted as elective procedures.<br>

 The &#147;Clean, safe care&#148; strategy was published in January 2008, and gave an overview of our strategy and initiatives, many of which were already well established, to tackle health care associated infections (HCAIs) and improve cleanliness. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>

The latest Health Protection Agency data for July to September 2008 shows a reduction in MRSA bloodstream infections of 33 per cent. compared to the same quarter in 2007. In 2008, the national health service met the nationwide target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections compared to 2003-04 levels. Latest figures also show a 62 per cent. reduction compared to the quarterly average in 2003-04, making further progress.</p>

Doctors are not supposed to record all diseases or conditions present at death, only those that contribute directly to it. It is a matter of individual professional judgment whether the doctor lists an HCAI as a contributory cause. There have been a number of initiatives to raise the profile of HCAIs and improve their acknowledgment as diagnoses in their own right. In October 2007 and July 2005 the chief medical officer reminded doctors of the importance of giving full and accurate information on the death certificate, particularly in relation to HCAIs.</p>

We are also commissioning work to understand the ways in which hospital cleanliness relates to other aspects of a good environment, and how this might have an impact on HCAIs. These studies are in their initial stages and will provide results later in 2009.</p>

 Professor Mike Richards completed his review in October 2008, and the Secretary of State made his report, &#147;Improving access to medicines for NHS patients&#148;, public on 4 November 2008. A copy of the report has already been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_610"><a name="90209w0057.htm_para0"><a name="09021036002556">In his report, Professor Richards carefully considered equity issues before making recommendations to the Secretary of State about policy on additional private care. In line with Professor Richards&#146; recommendations, the Secretary of State announced a package of measures to improve access to drugs on the national health service, including a new scheme from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to introduce greater flexibility in appraising expensive drugs for end of life conditions with small numbers of patients. These measures will mean that more drugs are available on the NHS, which will reduce the number of patients who may wish to buy additional private drugs.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what mechanism will be put in place to ensure that the possibility for patients to co-pay for a treatment does not act as a disincentive for NHS primary care trusts to fund that treatment. [254722]</p>

 It is one of the guiding principles of the national health service that a person should have access to health services based on clinical need, and not on the ability of a patient to pay. Professor Richards&#146; review, &#147;Improving access to medicines for NHS patients&#148;, was based on, and reinforces, this principle. &#147;The NHS Constitution&#148;, published on 21 January 2009, also reaffirmed this as one of the key principles underpinning all that the NHS does. Copies of both documents have already been placed in the Library. Decisions by primary care trusts on funding for individual patients are no exception to this.</p>

1. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. However, admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
3. Time waited (days): Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
4. Spinal cord injury is defined as one of the following ICD-10 codes recorded in primary diagnosis field:<br>
5140 Concussion and oedema of cervical spinal cord;<br>
5141 Other and unspecified injuries of cervical spinal cord;<br>
5142 Injury of nerve root of cervical spine;<br>
