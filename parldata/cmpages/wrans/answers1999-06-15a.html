 A consortium led by Raytheon Systems Ltd. has been chosen as the preferred bidder for the development, production and in-service support of ASTOR, the Airborne Stand-Off Radar system. The consortium includes Short Brothers, Motorola UK Ltd, GEC Marconi Avionics and Marshall SV.




<P>
<P><I>15 Jun 1999 : Column: 66</I><P>

ASTOR is a joint Army and RAF requirement for a ground-surveillance radar, expected to enter service in 2005. It will provide a substantial enhancement of military capability, using highly effective new radar systems installed on five fixed-wing aircraft to provide a high degree of resolution over a wide area of coverage. It can be used to monitor areas of interest from a stand-off position, in peace and in crisis, and could be deployed at short notice in support of United Kingdom, NATO or United Nations operations. The ASTOR Main Operating Base will be located at RAF Waddington.
<P>

<a name="90615w01.htm_para2">ASTOR will provide UK industry with valuable, high-technology work. The project management team will be located in the United Kingdom, and the prime contractor will place work representing 100 per cent. of the contract value with UK firms. The project will be managed by the Defence Procurement Agency under Smart Procurement principles, with an Integrated Project Team involving representatives from industry and the Services. The likely value of the contract is about &#163;800 million.

 Financial allocations for all areas of public expenditure were considered in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review. The acknowledgement of work to develop reconciliation and mutual understanding in the Good Friday Agreement was instrumental in maintaining the community relations budget at the present level of over &#163;9 million per annum. This was not identified in the Good Friday Agreement as a potential area for enhanced North/South co-operation and implementation, and there have been no consultations with the Irish Government consequent on the Agreement. There are existing mechanisms for funding reconciliation work on a cross-border basis under the European Union Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and International Fund for Ireland programmes.

 Under international guidelines, greenhouse gas emissions are measured in terms of their global warming potential. Conversion to a common unit of measurement (whether in tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub>  equivalent or tonnes of carbon equivalent) allows comparisons to be made between countries, between various policies and measures and between different greenhouse gases.

This is to allow London Transport to explore with Railtrack whether there is a way of linking the national rail network to the sub-surface lines in a PPP, under which Railtrack would undertake and finance the maintenance and upgrading of the subsurface lines for London Underground, under contract to London Underground, and Railtrack would build links between the Underground and the national rail network, to allow new services for passengers running into the heart of London.

 A 25 per cent. discount applies where a dwelling is the sole or main residence of one person, or where all but one resident is disregarded for the purpose of a discount. We do not have any plans to make it a criminal offence to make an invalid claim for the 25 per cent. discount. However, local authorities already have powers to impose a penalty of &#163;50, without having to go to the Courts, if a person receiving a discount fails to notify the authority that he is no longer (or never was) eligible for it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w06.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It is not proposed to change the current definition of overcrowding. For services into London and also some commuter services into other large cities, overcrowding is defined in franchise agreements in terms of passengers in excess of capacity. Trains have a nominal capacity (the number of standard class seats for journeys of more than 20 minutes; plus, for journeys of less than 20 minutes, an allowance of 0.55 sq metres of floor space per standing passenger) which should not be exceeded by more than 3 per cent. in the morning and evening peaks combined. This is the general definition of overcrowding. It is broadly comparable with that formerly used by British Rail. The current practice of systematically controlling overcrowding only on commuter services also reflects previous British Rail practice.

 Since my announcement we have been developing our proposals on two fronts, relating to the definition of new Public Safety Zone boundaries and to the preparation of guidance to local planning authorities for use in considering planning applications. Work is well in hand on the redefinition of the existing Public Safety Zones. We shall notify the local planning authorities and airports concerned of the grid co-ordinates of the new Zones during the next couple of months, and we shall follow this up by providing the data to them in map form. We shall also define Public Safety Zones for Teesside and Sheffield City airports, which were mentioned in the December 1997 consultation document.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para0">Meanwhile we are today issuing for consultation a draft of a circular to local planning authorities in Great Britain containing guidance for use in considering applications for development within Public Safety Zones.

<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para1">Subject to the progress of this consultation we hope to bring the new arrangements into effect later this year in relation to the airports which already have Public Safety Zones, and to Teesside and Sheffield City. At that stage the residual work of the Civil Aviation Authority in administering the Public Safety Zone policy will be transferred to the Department. We hope by next spring to have established Public Safety Zones at the other airports for which modelling work suggests that this would be justified.

<a name="90615w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government's policy is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 22, published in February 1993. This makes clear that in formulating the policies and proposals in their development plans, and in making decisions on applications for specific renewable energy developments, local planning authorities need to consider both the immediate impact on the local environment and the wider contribution to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. They need to take account of the Government's policy for renewable energy sources along with policies for Green Belts, conservation areas and industrial and commercial development, for example.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para2">In October 1998, the Department published a good practice guide on "Planning for Sustainable Development" and sent copies to all local planning authorities. The guide includes advice on renewable energy. It underlines the importance of renewable energy, developing a strategy at regional and local levels for the provision of renewable energy development and having clear policies and criteria in plans to help decide individual applications. The Department has held a series of seminars for local planning authorities and others to disseminate the messages of the guide.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para3">On 30 March 1999, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Industry published a consultation document, "New and Renewable Energy: Prospects for the 21 Century". This confirmed that the Government are working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10 per cent. of UK electricity supplies as soon as possible and that they hope to achieve this by 2010. It also underlined the important role of renewables in enabling the UK to meet its legally binding target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. (compared to 1990) by 2008-12 and its goal of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent. by 2010.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para4">The consultation document indicated that the Government are reviewing the contribution which the planning system has to make to delivering their target for renewable energy and noted that widespread adoption of renewable of energy will not be possible unless the public is prepared to accept projects in their locality. The consultation document also acknowledged that concerns have sometimes been expressed that the current Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) scheme does not address, e.g. environmental aspects, sufficiently effectively and that future support mechanisms or obligations will need to deliver good quality schemes.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para5">The planning system has an important role in helping to deliver the Government's targets and goals for renewable energy and climate change. It is clear that we need a positive strategic approach to planning for renewable energy from regional level downwards, with appropriate provision made for development in authorities' plans. There needs to be an open and constructive dialogue between prospective operators, local planning authorities and local people about identifying suitable sites with sensitivity and care. We shall build on these themes in considering what further practical steps may be needed to ensure that the planning system enables renewable energy provision to contribute to the UK's sustainable energy needs while continuing to protect the countryside.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 BBC Worldwide and BBC Resources are audited under the BBC's group internal audit plan. Both companies are required to have an external audit because they are limited companies that exceed the threshold size for audits.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para6">BBC Worldwide has a loan agreement with the BBC which allows maximum borrowings of &#163;150 million, subject to the constraints of three financial covenants: net assets, free cash flow and interest cover. BBC Resources has a &#163;70 million term loan facility and a &#163;30 million revolving loan facility which reduce to zero by August 2005. As with BBC Worldwide, borrowing is restricted by various financial and non-financial covenants within a loan agreement with the BBC. The covenants in both cases ensure, among other things, that licence fee money is not placed at risk.
<P>

<a name="90615w07.htm_para7">Only the BBC's external borrowings form part of the public sector borrowing requirement, so the borrowing limits for BBC Worldwide and BBC Resources would only impact on the public sector borrowing requirement if they were to lead to an increase in the BBC's own borrowing from the market.

On the Culture 2000 programme, I indicated the UK's desire to agree a Common Position at the formal Culture/Audiovisual Council on 28 June. That Council will also consider draft conclusions on convergence and self-regulation in the media. I drew attention to a number of features which are common to both, noting in particular that self-regulation can be expected to make an important and complementary contribution to state regulation in the light of future digital media developments. The discussion on European identity and history focused on a presentation from the Spanish writer and former Minister of Culture, Jorge Semprun.

 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Her Majesty's Fire Services Inspectorate have carried out independent assessments of the millennium readiness of all police forces and fire brigades in England and Wales, using the colour coding method defined by Action 2000. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary assessment also covers the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Under this method, 'red' means there is a severe risk of material disruption, 'amber' means there is some risk of material disruption but an agreed rectification plan exists, and 'blue' means there are no identified risks of material disruption. The status of all forces and brigades, assessed according to this method, will be made public at the National Infrastructure Forum on 13 July.

 Asylum applications are received from persons arriving at ports, persons who seek to enter, or who have entered, clandestinely and those who have entered lawfully for other purposes. It is not always possible to establish the means of arrival of asylum seekers. The Department does not collate specific records of the routings used by those granted refugee status or indefinite leave to remain. Measures in the Immigration and Asylum Bill contain powers designed to reduce the number of clandestine entrants and inadequately documented persons arriving in the United Kingdom. It is not the object of these measures to keep out genuine refugees. We remain firmly committed to dealing with asylum seekers in a way that complies with the United Kingdom's international obligations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w09.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Passport Agency gives priority to passport applications by the applicant's declared date of travel. This applies to all applications, whether they are received via the Agency's partners or directly in the mail, or made in person. As partnership applications have been pre-checked for accuracy and completedness, and the fee has been collected, these applications can normally be processed more speedily than direct postal applications.

 The service provided by the Passport Agency's high street partners since 1996 has helped the Agency to deal effectively and efficiently with high levels of demand by reducing processing times for passport applications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w09.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There is no relaxation of security, but to facilitate the more efficient processing of new passport applications the Passport Agency has issued guidance to its examiners to ensure they do not unnecessarily delay issuing passports by exercising discretion to approve applications where the examiner has no significant doubt about the identity of the applicant. The guidance has been agreed with the Agency trade unions as not compromising effective checks.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para4">The Agency is often criticised for taking too narrow a view of whether a counter-signatory "is a person of similar standing" to a professionally qualified person. Passport examiners have been encouraged to give a reasonable interpretation to this requirement. In the context of the whole application and supporting documentary evidence, sensible use of discretion can ensure both quicker and proper processing of applications.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para5">In order to clear quickly straightforward renewal applications made in person, certain existing passports are being extended for two years provided certain criteria are fulfilled. Passports valid or expired within the last five years are being exceptionally extended provided the holder's identity can be confirmed, for example, by comparing the photograph with the photograph in the old passport, or with the person who is applying in person, and provided certain other checks are satisfactorily completed.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para6">These extended passports are properly issued passports valid for travel. Immigration authorities abroad have been made aware of this position.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Passport Agency currently has 487,658 passport applications outstanding, which represents, at current output levels, about one month's work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w09.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is difficult to provide an estimate of the position in one month's time as the Passport Agency is prioritising applications to meet applicants declared travel dates. With high seasonal demand for passports, this means there are delays in processing non-urgent applications. Much depends on intake, the Agency's output, and the impact of the measures the Agency is taking to reduce current delays.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para10">The Agency is meeting travel dates in 99.99 per cent. of cases and will continue to do so throughout the summer. The Agency's aim is to reduce turnaround times to 10 days by September.

<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am aware from the weekly reports that I have been receiving from the Passport Agency's Chief Executive on the Agency's current operational difficulties of the teething problems that the Newport Passport Office have encountered in piloting new computerised passport issuing arrangements. Productivity has been below expectations and arrears of work have developed. In addition, along with the Agency's other five offices, Newport has been dealing with high seasonal demand for passports.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para11">The Passport Agency is taking a number of measures to improve the position at Newport. Applications are being prioritised by customers declared travel dates, and Newport is meeting those dates for 99.99 per cent. of passports issued. Additional staff are being deployed, examination processes are being streamlined, and Newport is working extended hours.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para12">Current delays will reduce as a result of the action being taken and the seasonal nature of the Agency's work. The aim is to reduce turnround times to 10 days by September.
<P>

<a name="90615w09.htm_para13">Because of its arrears of work, the Newport Office has been swamped with telephone and written inquiries. Despite its best endeavours, and with its focus on the customers declared travel dates, the Newport Office has not in many cases been able to provide a satisfactory response. The Passport Agency very much regrets the present situation and is taking action to improve matters. It is looking urgently at alternative telephone answering arrangements.

 Among the factors magistrates are currently required to have regard to under section 19 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 is whether the punishment which they would have the power to inflict if the defendant is convicted would be adequate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to change <i>(a)</i> Prison Service and <i>(b)</i> Parole Board procedures to ensure that prisoners with short tariffs are not unnecessarily held beyond expiry of the tariff.  [86375]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w11.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 None. Short tariff life sentence prisoners are, with rare exceptions, those whose tariffs (relevant parts) have been set by the courts. Such prisoners are statutorily entitled to an oral hearing of their case by the Parole Board once the relevant part of the sentence has expired. The Board may direct the prisoner's release following such hearings if they are satisfied that the level of risk is acceptable. No change is, therefore, necessary to Parole Board procedures.
<P>

<a name="90615w11.htm_para0">The Prison Service has set up an 86-bed main centre at Brixton prison to provide fast-track arrangements for life sentence prisoners with short tariffs. The aim is to provide expedited reports on such prisoners so that they may be allocated at an early stage to other prisons which can offer any necessary course work on offending behaviour. This should enable such work to be completed in time for the outcome to be reported to the Parole Board for the oral hearing on tariff expiry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w11.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 June 1999]:</i> Wayne Burns and Andy May appealed to me against decisions by the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall in January 1998 to find them guilty of disciplinary offences and dismiss them from the force. I appointed an independent tribunal to consider the appeal and to make recommendations to me. The tribunal reheard the evidence and unanimously recommended that the appeals should be allowed.
<P>

<a name="90615w11.htm_para2">I considered all the facts of the case, the points raised in the grounds of appeal and the Chief Constable's response, together with the report of the tribunal. I decided to accept the tribunal's reasons and their recommendation to allow the appeals. The reason for my decision was that I was not satisfied that the charges had been proved to the criminal standard of proof which was the standard required at the relevant time. The standard of proof required in police discipline proceedings has now been lowered from the criminal standard to the civil standard but only in respect of alleged police misconduct occurring after 1 April 1999.

 Deaths in police custody units are included in the statistics for deaths in police custody or otherwise in the hands of the police. During the period from 1991-92 to 1994-95, such deaths were tabulated on a financial year basis for the Metropolitan Police and a calendar year basis for the rest of England and Wales, with the result that no national annual totals are available for that period.

<P>
<a name="90615w11.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government's aim, in common with that of our European Union partners, has been to ensure that the great majority of refugees are looked after in the region so that they are able to return to their homes when it is safe to do so. We have also responded to the request for help from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to evacuate the most vulnerable people from the area. We accordingly accepted around 4,000 refugees into the United Kingdom. The stage now reached in the military action against the Milosevic regime and the fact that the first steps have been taken to allow the refugees to return mean that significant evacuations under the Humanitarian Evacuation Programmes are no longer necessary.
<P>

<a name="90615w11.htm_para4">We have, therefore, decided to reduce significantly the number of flights into the United Kingdom. After today, we expect to receive a further flight this week and one next week. We will, then, keep the situation under review. We will focus on people who cannot be cared for in the region and on the spouses and dependants of people who are already in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90615w11.htm_para5">Those refugees arriving under the Programme who have been granted 12 months leave to enter will not have their stay curtailed. We will, however, actively be establishing arrangements to facilitate the return of those who want to go back to Kosovo before then.

propose for the time being to grant 12 months leave to enter or remain to Kosovan Albanians on an exceptional basis. This will provide for the same status and access to benefits as between those FRY citizens who have arrived as part of the UNHCR's Humanitarian Evacuation Programme and those who have arrived independently once their cases are decided.
<P>

<a name="90615w11.htm_para7">Although the evacuation flights from Macedonia to the United Kingdom are coming to an end, we will continue to apply family reunion criteria under our normal immigration policy for those in the United Kingdom who have refugee status, and we propose to continue to operate family reunion for those who have come to the United Kingdom under the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Anyone granted such a visa for travel to the United Kingdom will, however, be required to make their own travel and accommodation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="90615w11.htm_para8">I would like to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the hard work which local authorities and the voluntary sector have done in preparing for and receiving evacuees from Kosovo. Even those areas which have not actually received flights or accommodated evacuees have responded with generosity and enthusiasm to the need to plan for arrivals.

Following a thorough consideration of all the evidence about her current needs, an AO decided on 10 March 1999 that Mrs Oakham no longer satisfied the conditions for entitlement to either component of DLA from 15 February 1999.

 "Europe Under a Single Roof" was the title of a book commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Council of Europe (CoE). The Council Secretariat had full responsibility for editorial control and publication.

<P>
<a name="90615w15.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I assume the hon. Member is referring to budget line A-302 "Grants to organisations advancing the idea of Europe", which has as its particular aim to cover expenditure on the activities and operation of organisations actively working toward European integration. The European Commission's guidelines for operating this budget line set out the objective this budget line contributes to, the eligibility criteria for organisations seeking funding from it, details of the selection criteria, financial conditions and the procedure to be followed when applying for a grant. A copy has been sent to the hon. Member directly, and a copy placed in the House Library. The Government support activities which help increase public awareness of the EU.

 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are the lead organisation on the pilot weapons collection project in Gramsh. The EU has allocated 500,000 euros to extend the successful project to other regions.
<P>

<a name="90615w15.htm_para2">The Department for International Development (DFID) has funded one ammunition technical officer as part of the project and have agreed in principle to fund another. They have also agreed to fund a feasibility study on destruction of the weapons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w15.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No comprehensive list exists of internal histories held by the FCO on an ad hoc basis for many years. Those over 30 years old, such as a 1962 study by the Historical Adviser of British Policy in the Relinquishment of Abadan in 1951, have been routinely released to the Public Record Office (FO 370/2694). As part of an open government initiative, the FCO began in 1998 to identify internal histories scattered across the FCO archive and assess them for publication and accelerated release. The first practical result of this initiative will be the publication and release early next year of the report written in 1972 by Sir Con O'Neill on the negotiations for entry into the EEC.
<P>

<a name="90615w15.htm_para4">Titles of other internal histories remain classified until proper consideration has been given to their suitability for accelerated release or publication.

<P>

<a name="90615w16.htm_para0">Notable results in the first year included: a course in China run together with Save the Children Fund, designed to fight child trafficking; direct human rights training for the Russian military; a workshop on conscientious objection in Novograd; and a women and children protection course in the Philippines.
<P>

<a name="90615w16.htm_para1">The transition to new objectives made a good start in the financial year 1998-99 with 84 per cent. of spending being compatible with the new ASSIST criteria. For the next financial year, as pre-existing commitments reduce we shall be increasing this percentage and further refining the ASSIST criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w16.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The impact of the climate change levy on any one industry, firm or plant will depend on the tax rates set for different sectors. Final rates for the climate change levy will not be set until the Finance Bill 2000, so it is not possible to produce definitive figures at this stage. The Government will consider the issue of competitiveness when setting the final rates for the climate change levy.

These will be discussed further at future meetings of ECOFIN.

 One strain of Bacillus thuringiensis, a naturally occurring bacterium, is specified as the active ingredient in a number of insecticide products approved for use on ornamental plants, vegetables, fruit crops and fruit trees in the UK. No products containing Bacillus thuringiensis have approval for use in forestry in this country.

Their representations are awaited and will be promptly evaluated.
<P>

Detailed scientific information supplied by applicant companies is evaluated by the Government and their independent advisers; only if a pesticide can be used without unacceptable risk to people and the environment will Ministers approve it.

 In relation to its role in considering whether to recommend release to the environment and/or marketing consent for genetically modified organisms, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) assess and advise on aspects of use in animal feed. The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) addresses any impact of the animal feed use of genetically modified plants on food for the human consumer. The Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, due to be set up very shortly, will also have an important role, liaising as necessary with other committees.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the basis of his policy on measures set out in 1999/305/EC (OJ L118/63, of 6.5.99), on repealing restrictions on the marketing of seeds; and if he will make a statement.  [86718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w17.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Article 15 of Council Directive 70/457, on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species, provides for member states to be granted derogations to prohibit in their territory the marketing of seed and propagating material of varieties which they consider not to be distinct, stable or sufficiently uniform (DUS).
<P>

<a name="90615w17.htm_para0">Commission Decision 1999/305/EC repealed various such derogations which had been granted to the United Kingdom. In most cases the varieties themselves, or similar ones which had raised concerns regarding DUS, no longer appeared on the common catalogue while, for the remaining varieties, no certified seed had been produced in the UK in the previous twelve years. The UK therefore saw no reason to maintain the derogations and was content with their repeal. No genetically modified varieties are involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90615w17.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 EU meat hygiene rules lay down specific requirements about the level and frequency of supervision of licensed meat plants. Such functions are assigned to "official veterinarians", defined in those rules as

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"the veterinarian designated by the central competent authority of the Member State".
Although the EU meat hygiene rules do not define "veterinarian", the EU Directives on the mutual recognition of veterinary qualifications and on veterinary training (78/1026/EEC and 78/1027/EEC) clearly define veterinarians in terms of named qualifications for each member state (which other member 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>15 Jun 1999 : Column: 123</I><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90615w17.htm_para1">Given the aim of the EU meat hygiene rules (namely, to prescribe minimum standards of health inspections in licensed meat plants) and the functions allocated to official veterinarians under those rules, my Department takes the view that references in those rules to "official veterinarian" must be construed consistently with the EU rules on veterinary qualifications. In short, an "official veterinarian" for meat hygiene purposes must be a veterinarian whose veterinary qualifications meet the terms of the relevant Directives. As such, environmental health officers and meat inspectors would be eligible to supervise meat hygiene inspections only if they were also fully qualified veterinarians.

 The projected numbers of test sites to be sown per year for each variety from autumn 1999 to spring 2003 are listed in the table. Different varieties of a species entered in the same year are normally tested at the same sites, although the entry of genetically modified varieties may result in separate trial sites being sown. Test site requirements are subject to review and while no major changes to the numbers given are anticipated it is not possible to forecast the outcome of such reviews.

 There are no figures at this time which relate to drug use specifically among the under-25 age group.

If the contribution scales were to be recalculated on the basis of increased income thresholds then there would be further knock-on costs, depending on how the policy is implemented, on the proportion of tuition fees paid by those not fully exempt and on other assessed elements of student support, and so the financial impact would be significantly higher.

 Under the Department's Specialist Schools programme, Sports Colleges provide specialist support to local schools to help raise the standards of teaching and learning in physical education and sport. This can be in the form of in-service training for teachers or the sharing of specialist sports equipment, facilities and other resources. Sports Colleges also act as local centres of sports development and are able to disseminate good practice in their geographical area.

Over 11,000 teachers have received training through this scheme.

 The DfEE's drug education good practice guidance, published in November last year, brings together the findings of Ofsted, and the experience of health professionals and others, and outlines already published research on the effectiveness of drug education in schools. In addition, the Department has published two booklets summarising a number of innovative drug education projects supported through the Department's Grants for Education Support and Training (GEST) programme in 1995-96 and 1996-97 respectively. They offer information on the findings of a range of different drug education projects set up by local education authorities during those two years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what action he has taken to ensure that sporting provision is set out in schools' annual reports and prospectuses.  [86687]<P>

 Sport is an essential part of young people's education, playing a key role in their physical and social development. Department for Education and Employment guidance makes it clear that prospectuses and annual reports should include references to sporting aims and provisions, so as to ensure that parents receive a complete picture of the school.
