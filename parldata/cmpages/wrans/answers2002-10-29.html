 The Transport, Local Government and the Regions Select Committee recommended that a threshold of two thirds of the number of businesses eligible to vote should vote in favour before a Business Improvement District proposal proceeds. A number of other proposals were also made during the consultation on the draft Local Government Bill. We have considered all the proposals that have been made and will announce our conclusions shortly.

<a name="21029w01.html_para0">At the time responsibility for a road passes to a local authority (or very shortly after) it receives revenue funding for routine maintenance in the form of Special Grant under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and support for capital maintenance in the form of supplementary credit approvals. The value of this support is determined by a generalised engineering assessment, with allowance made for local factors such as type of road, level of traffic and the cost of winter maintenance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Heath: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what information he has <i>(a)</i> received and <i>(b)</i> requested from <i>(i)</i> chief fire officers and (ii) the Chief Inspector of Fire Brigades on their assessments of the adequacy of fire cover in fire authority areas during a firefighters' strike.  [77110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The provision of MOD emergency fire cover has been planned centrally in consultation with the Chief Inspector of the Fire Service and locally in consultation with Chief Fire Officers to maximise the effectiveness of call-outs and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities. The emergency cover would not replicate the firefighting capabilities of the Fire Service, but would aim to minimise the danger to human life. The command and operational structure for emergency cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, and there will be a continuous dialogue between the emergency services and Chief Fire Officers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Heath: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what level of cross-border co-operation he anticipates between neighbouring fire authorities during a firefighters' strike.  [77112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In the event of a firefighters' strike, the command and operational structure for emergency fire cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, whether from within a county or from assets deployed nearby in neighbouring counties. The fire crews will use a number of temporary stations across counties but the deployment of fire fighters will be based on the assessment by the military in consultation with others such as the police of how best to respond to an emergency in the quickest time possible. The extent to which retained firefighters continue to work will also be taken into account in determining how best to deploy military fire crews.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Our policy is to restrict ring-fencing to cases which are high priorities for Government and where we cannot achieve our policy goal by specifying output or outcome targets; any new ring-fenced grant schemes will also be time-limited. We will announce the results of the review of local government revenue grant distribution in early December. There may also be changes to waste management funding arrangements following detailed consideration of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit's report on the subject.

 This information is set out in the regional governance White Paper XYour Region, Your Choice" (Cm 5511) as part of the rationale for the Government's proposals to give each English region the opportunity to choose whether to have an elected assembly. Elected regional assemblies will have real power and funding to improve the quality of life of people in their region&#151;particularly by improving regional economic performance.
<P>

<a name="21029w02.html_para0">Assemblies will have powers to make a difference in key areas such as jobs, transport, housing, culture and environment. And their block grant will give them much greater freedom to allocate spending according to regional priorities. This offers the prospect of tailored regional solutions to regional problems. It strikes a balance between those issues that are best dealt with at a regional level and those that are best dealt with at a national or a local level. Our proposals for elected assemblies in the English regions will bring decision-making closer to the people and make government more efficient, more effective and more accountable.

<P>

 It is too early to assess the impact of the levy.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para0">No estimate has been made of the total weight of aggregate brought across the border from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland without payment of aggregates levy since April. Aggregates levy is due at the point of first commercial exploitation in the UK and not at the point of import. Where it cannot be demonstrated that aggregate is from a levy-paid source, Customs will use their powers to recover the revenue due and impose penalties, where appropriate. The resources allocated to administering the levy in Northern Ireland take account of issues associated with the land boundary, and this resourcing will be subject to regular review.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para1">The revenue forecast for the aggregates levy is made for the UK as a whole, and is not available by devolved region; therefore, data on the aggregates levy revenue raised in Northern Ireland are not available. In total, the levy is forecast to raise #0.2 billion during 2002&#150;03.

<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para3">The Government believe that credit unions have an important role to play to encourage the accumulation of savings and help tackle financial exclusion. We continue to liaise with the movement and develop proposals to support its development. The establishment of a central services organisation is a project for the credit union movement to take forward. We understand that the Association of British Credit Unions Limited (ABCUL) is developing new plans to deliver some of the services that could have been provided through a central services organisation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what action is being taken to tackle cross-channel smuggling; and if he will make a statement.  [78321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w03.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Tobacco smuggling grew very rapidly in the late 1990s until, by 2000&#150;01, over 20 per cent. of the cigarette market was illicit. The cost of that tobacco smuggling to UK taxpayers was #3.5 billion. A further 6 per cent. of the market was legally non-tax paid product bought abroad and brought back for own use.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para4">The great majority of cigarette smuggling is undertaken by serious and organised criminals who conceal large volumes of cigarettes in excess of 1 million at a time in freight consignments. In 2000 a smaller proportion was smuggled by cross-channel passengers. However in that year the total cost of such passenger excise smuggling was still #1.7 billion.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para5">Had no action been taken over the past two years Customs and Excise estimate that the illicit share of the cigarette market would have reached 31 per cent. by the end of March 2002.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para6">Since the launch of the Tackling Tobacco Strategy in March 2000, Customs and Excise have been successful in containing growth in the illicit cigarette market, disrupted over 100 organised crime gangs responsible for the vast majority of the smuggling, and have had dramatic success in cutting losses from cross-channel passenger smuggling by almost three-quarters. Figures for 2001&#150;02, the second year of this strategy, will be published at the time of the pre-Budget report and I anticipate they will show that the strategy remains on track. In the same period consumer expenditure on legitimate cross-border shopping for alcohol and tobacco has grown by 10 per cent.




<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2002 : Column 695W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para7">In 2000&#150;01 Customs seized 2.8 billion cigarettes. Of these, 0.9 billion were seized overseas through the work of the Customs Overseas Liaison Officer network, a further 1.2 billion were seized in freight consignments, 400 million were seized inland and 55 million were seized at the ports from cross-channel passenger smugglers.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para8">The sole focus of Customs excise enforcement activity in respect of cross-channel passenger traffic is to tackle those who smuggle tobacco or alcohol, having received or intending to receive money or money's worth for those goods. The Government have consistently made clear that people are entitled to bring into the UK without liability to tax as much EU tax-paid tobacco or alcohol as they wish for their own use. Customs literature also makes this clear.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para9">Just one-tenth of 1 per cent. of those who have crossed the channel in the past two years have had tobacco or alcohol seized by Customs. Since the start of the strategy, the average quantity seized by Customs from cross-channel passenger smugglers was approximately 4,900 cigarettes and 15 kilos of hand rolling tobacco (equivalent to at least 18,000 cigarettes).
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para10">Of the 0.1 per cent. of cross-channel passengers who had tobacco or alcohol seized in the years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 over 75 per cent. chose not to make any sort of appeal against that seizure. Of those that did appeal, magistrates courts overwhelmingly backed the judgments made by Customs, and found against Customs in less than 0.1 per cent. of cases, and only 1 per cent. of cases were either overturned or restored by a Customs review officer or by an independent tribunal.
<P>

<a name="21029w03.html_para11">Building on the success of the Budget 2000 anti-smuggling measures, I am today announcing the next stage of the Tackling Tobacco Strategy. Despite cross-channel tobacco smuggling having been cut by around three-quarters in the past two years, smugglers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their attempts to blend in with honest shoppers. So the measures I am announcing today will help make the distinction between smugglers and honest shoppers even clearer. The measures make clear that Customs activity is legal and fair but tough upon those who attempt to smuggle. It comprises the following components:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations will be laid before Parliament today to abolish the 1992 Personal Reliefs Order and replace it with new provisions that:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>effectively define shopping and smuggling, specify the factors Customs will take into account in distinguishing one from the other and place the onus for that decision upon Customs;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reaffirm that all Customs stops are lawful and those for excise specific purposes based on reasonable grounds for suspicion;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>increase the Indicative Levels for tobacco from 800 to 3,200 cigarettes and from 1 to 3kgs of hand rolling tobacco, representing around six-months supply for an average smoker. Those bringing back larger quantities of tobacco must expect, if asked, to explain how it is that such goods are for their own use. Customs will continue to seize quantities below these levels as well as above them where they are satisfied that those goods are intended for resale or other exchange for money or money's worth.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, the announcements I am making today will confirm that:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Vehicles used to smuggle tobacco or alcohol will continue to be liable to seizure but for small first offences Customs will offer restoration of the vehicle for the value of the attempted revenue 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>29 Oct 2002 : Column 696W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>evasion. Those who use vehicles to smuggle on a large scale or a repeat basis will not be offered such an opportunity and must expect to lose their vehicles.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A new clearer guide to appealing/complaining is being published by Customs today and will be given to all those who have goods seized or wish to complain about Customs behaviour towards them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have asked Customs to undertake, in conjunction with the Lord Chancellor's Department, a review of the present appeals structure and to present proposals for streamlining and simplifying these arrangements to me by the end of January 2003. The Terms of Reference will be available today in the Library of the House and on the Customs website (), together with details for submitting contributions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Having brought cross-channel passenger smuggling under control the Government is determined that it should remain so. To this end, Customs expect to conduct an increased number of prosecutions against large scale and serial cross-channel passenger smugglers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Violence against Customs officers in the course of carrying out their duties will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Customs will toughen their policy and prosecute anyone who perpetrates serious assaults on staff.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This set of measures provides the public with a clear guide to their right to shop for alcohol or tobacco for their own use within the EU and to the consequences for those who attempt to evade tax in bringing in such goods having received or intending to receive money or money's worth for some or all of them. It will also enable Customs to continue to prevent the smuggling of tobacco or alcohol and the disorder which accompanies such smuggling from ruining the enjoyment of honest cross-border shoppers. It will also enable Customs to prevent the smugglers from undermining the UK economy in alcohol or tobacco products and from depriving our public services of essential tax revenues. Customs will act fairly and in accordance with the law but they will also act firmly and with the full weight of sanctions against those who break the law.</FONT></UL>

We are already committed to investment in a range of sensor capabilities such as Nimrod MRA4, ASTOR and RAPTOR and communications systems such as SKYNET 5, BOWMAN, FALCON and tactical datalinks&#151;part of the backbone of our network infrastructure. We are also investing in information processing applications that will enhance our capability to collate, analyse and control the distribution of information within the network.

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> The ex-Republic of South Africa Air Puma helicopters were procured to supplement the existing Ministry of Defence Puma fleet. Because the aircraft had not flown for over five years, and their previous usage spectrum was unknown, it was essential to ensure that the airworthiness and structural integrity of the aircraft could be adequately assured. Options for effecting the refurbishment of the aircraft to the same standard as the existing fleet were evaluated. It was assessed that Eurocopter, the design authority for the Puma, was the only company with the necessary knowledge of, and competences in, the structural load paths of the Puma to be able to act as a prime contractor. As a result, an entry was placed in the MOD Contracts Bulletin notifying that the work would be placed with Eurocopter, while encouraging Eurocopter to maximise sub-contractor opportunities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many children aged between four and 18 years are in schools in local education authorities; if she will list the funding allocated to each school under her Department's proposed options; and if she will publish the deprivation allocation from additional educational needs under the Government's options <i>(a)</i> with and <i>(b)</i> without any ethnicity-weighting factor.

 There were 7,438,964 pupils between 4 and 18 in maintained schools in local education authorities recorded in the most recent annual schools census. It is not possible to identify the funding allocated to each school under the options set out in the consultation paper on Local Government Finance issued on 8 July: that would depend on decisions to be taken by LEAs on their formulae for distributing funding to their schools. The amounts of funding distributed for additional educational needs, and within that for ethnicity and English as an additional language (EAL), under each of the four consultation options is set out in the table below:

 We have made it clear that universities and higher education colleges will not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of changes to student numbers due to A level regrading. It is, however, too early to determine how much funding individual institutions might need, but the costs are not likely to be high given the relatively small number of students affected.
<P>

<a name="21029w07.html_para3">The A level claims Fund has been established to meet the legitimate costs of students who are able to transfer and students have until 31 January 2003 to apply. The Fund can meet accommodation, books, travel and where necessary tuition fees. We expect the costs falling to the Fund to be small.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Renewal of beacon status is dependent on a school being able to show that it has had an impact as a beacon and that it has maintained or improved its own performance in its three years as a beacon . Schools are advised to provide evidence of any factors that may have an effect on the school's performance, such as the number of pupils with statements of special education needs, so that these can be taken into account at the time of the assessment.

 There are three main types of panel or tribunal relating to educational provision for children: SEN and Disability Tribunals (SENDIST), Admission Appeal Panels, and Exclusion Appeal Panels.
<P>

<a name="21029w08.html_para0">SENDIST consider disputes between parents and LEAs about statementing of children with Special Educational Needs. They also consider complaints of disability discrimination made by parents against individual schools or LEAs.




<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2002 : Column 712W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21029w08.html_para1">At the end of June the Special Educational Needs Tribunal had 51 legal chairmen and 97 specialist members. The Secretary of State appointed 39 new specialist members in July. The Lord Chancellor has appointed 11 new chairmen.
<P>

<a name="21029w08.html_para2">By the end of June, 21 SEN Tribunal chairmen and 40 specialist members had received one and a half day's training on disability discrimination legislation. The training included theoretical and practical sessions that covered all the relevant provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act, including the implications for school exclusions. The President of the Tribunal arranged training for tribunal members at three conferences, in June, July and September. The SEN Tribunal became SENDIST from September. Tribunal panels are likely to hear the first claims under the new legislation in the new year.
<P>

<a name="21029w08.html_para3">Independent Admission Appeal Panels consider parents' appeals against refusal of admission of their children to particular schools. Responsibility for setting up a panel, and recruitment and training of panel members lies with the school's Xadmission authority" (in the case of voluntary aided and foundation schools this is the school's governing body, for community and controlled schools it is the local education authority). Although admission authorities themselves are responsible for the training of panel members, Information for School and College Governors (ISCG), who are one of a number of organisations delivering practitioner training, produced a training pack which is available free of charge to schools and LEAs. The revised Admission Appeals Code (to be laid before Parliament soon) contains guidance on the Disability Discrimination Act, and refers readers to other appropriate sources of help.
<P>

<a name="21029w08.html_para4">Exclusion Appeal Panels consider appeals made by parents whose children have been excluded from a school, and the exclusion upheld by the school governing body. The panels are set up by LEAs, who are responsible for appointing and training members. The Department is currently revising its guidance in the XExclusion Appeal Panels Training Pack", with regard to the Disabilities Discrimination Act. This revised guidance will be issued shortly.
<P>

<a name="21029w08.html_para5">The Department does not collect data on admission or exclusion appeal panel members or information on the training they receive.

<a name="21029w08.html_para6">The Council of Tribunals (which operates under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992) advises and supervises the procedures and working of tribunals. The Council, and the Judicial Studies Board, has a significant interest in the training of panel members. The Council of Tribunals publication XMaking Tribunals Accessible to Disabled People: Guidance on Applying the Disability Discrimination Act" is available to both panel members and those responsible for their training.

 Schools are encouraged, as part of the National Healthy School Standard, to present consistent messages about healthy eating. Food on offer in vending machines, tuck shops and school meals, for example, should complement the information about healthy eating covered in the taught curriculum.

 Following this year's Key Stage 2 results the Department asked all LEAs to draw up specific plans to identify and provide targeted support to those schools which are underperforming&#151;both low attaining schools and those which are not helping their children make as much progress as other similar schools. Over the next couple of months the Department is meeting with all LEAs individually to discuss these plans and the further support they need to meet the challenging targets for 2004. The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies will continue to help LEAs improve their results, in particular by focusing low attaining and underperforming schools, improving leadership and intervention programmes for pupils who are not achieving their potential. We are allocating an additional #11 million this year to support schools make improvements in 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2002]:</i> For the state sector, the estimated average recurrent expenditure funded by central and local government in 2001&#150;02 was #3,600 per pupil. Independent Schools Council figures suggest a private school recurrent spending figure of #5,400 per annum. Some caution is needed in making detailed comparisons between the sectors as it is not easy to calculate per pupil funding exactly on a like-for-like basis.

<a name="21029w10.html_para3">As was announced during the passage of the Education Bill through Parliament, we intend to make an order which will protect the school meal entitlement of around 100,000 children whose families will cease to receive income support and income based jobseekers allowance. It will also extend free school meals to an additional 89,000 children.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2002]:</i> Since Ofsted began its statutory inspection of local education authorities in 1998, 42 authorities have been found to be unsatisfactory. These are listed. Of the 27 LEAs that have been re-inspected at least once so far, and the findings published, Ofsted found that 26 had improved, and of these 21 were satisfactory.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list, by local education authority, the percentage of children receiving extra funding from <i>(a)</i> area cost adjustment, <i>(b)</i> other deprivation, <i>(c)</i> ethnicity, <i>(d)</i> income support and <i>(e)</i> sparsity funding.  [77016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In the current education standard spending assessment system, additional funding for deprivation, area costs, and sparsity is allocated to each LEA according to indicators derived from an analysis of past spending patterns. It is not therefore possible to identify percentages of children receiving extra support for each of these characteristics.

 Higher education institutions themselves decide how to deploy the resources made available to them from the public purse. I understand some institutions have chosen to devote some of their share of the #1 billion science research investment fund to support new medical schools. Alongside this, the Department of Health has provided #4.25 million non-recurrent funding for NHS facilities to support research in the new medical schools in 2001&#150;02, and is making arrangements to provide a further #9.25 million in 2002&#150;03. From 2002&#150;03 it is providing over #1 million in recurrent funding to mobilise NHS support for research at the schools. In addition, researchers at all medical schools and faculties of medicine are eligible to

<P>
<a name="21029w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: We </B> 
 are committed to raising standards significantly in secondary schools. That is why we have set challenging targets for raising pupil attainment at 14 and 16. The GCE results for Wandsworth are currently not available, though we know nationally that over 51 per cent of 16-year olds-have achieved five or more GCSEs or GNVQ equivalent. This is an increase of 4.9 percentage point from when targets were first introduced in 1997/98.
<P>

<a name="21029w11.html_para1">In the case of 14-year-olds, there has been an improvement nationally of 1 percentage point in English and mathematics, while in science the large gains made last year have been consolidated. Provisional data for Wandsworth suggest that the number of 14 year olds achieving the standard expected at the end of Key Stage 3 has risen by 4 percentage points in English, and 2 percentage points in maths and science. This is good news, and suggests that our Key Stage 3 strategy has made an early impact on raising pupil standards in the early years of secondary education.

In the majority of cases the original decision has been maintained because the European regulations governing the scheme do not allow for discretion to be applied where the conditions for claiming aid have not been met.

<i>[holding answer 23 October 2002]:</i> The Department has been in close touch with the USDA since the submission last year of an application for a determination that UKROFS' standards meet the requirements of the NOP. The USDA has now written to UKROFS to confirm that it accepts the UKROFS control system as sufficient to secure conformity with the NOP. This means that the UK organic inspection bodies are able to certify product for the purposes of the NOP but it does not affect the standards required to be met by products sold as organic in the UK. The Department has also been in close touch with organic certifiers in the US to ensure that the introduction of the NOP does not invalidate authorisations previously issued to import US organic produce into the UK. Discussions are also taking place between the European Commission and the USDA to ensure that disruption to trade between the Community and the US is kept to a minimum. We have received a number of representations about the introduction of the NOP from the UK organic inspection bodies and from companies concerned about the effect of the NOP on their ability to export to the US.

 The national service framework (NSF) for older people provides local National Health Service bodies and councils with a template for raising the standards of health and social care and reducing inconsistency in access and service provision for all older people. The NSF and the ongoing project, <i>Developing services for minority ethnic older people,</i> provides specific guidance on how the needs of minority ethnic older people, including older Chinese people, can be effectively assessed and met.

 We have established a broad programme of work specifically to address the important issue of patient safety and reduce unintended harm to patients.

<a name="21029w15.html_para0">The National Patient Safety Agency, established in July 2001, is a key part of this patient safety programme. The NPSA is already beginning to have an impact on the safety of national health service patient care. The agency will establish and run a new national reporting system to record adverse events and near misses in hospitals and primary care. It will promote a culture of reporting and learning so that lessons learnt in one part of the NHS are properly shared with the whole of the health service.
<P>

<a name="21029w15.html_para1">We are also targeting areas of known risk to patients. Work is under way on reducing medication errors, obstetrics errors and maladministered spinal injections. We have also commissioned a programme of research into aspects of patient safety which is under way at the University of Birmingham.

<a name="21029w16.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Following initial advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines in December 2001 as to public health risk associated with medicines containing Kava-kava, a voluntary agreement between the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the herbal sector to withdraw from sale medicinal products containing Kava-kava took effect at the beginning of 2002. In July the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) gave further advice, that there was evidence that in rare cases Kava-kava was associated with hepatotoxicity, which may be serious in nature. The CSM made the provisional recommendation that use of the plant should be prohibited in unlicensed medicines. The Government considered that advice and asked the Medicines Control Agency to consult on proposals to prohibit the sale, supply or importation of unlicensed 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2002 : Column 743W</I><P>
medicinal products consisting of, or containing, Kava-kava except those for external use only. The proposals were set out in consultation letter MIX 286.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para3">The consultation period has now ended and the Government have requested further advice on this issue, taking account of the responses to consultation, from the independent advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines. In addition, in accordance with the statutory procedure under section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968, the consultation responses have been referred to the Medicines Commission, who will report their findings and conclusions to Ministers. The Government will make an announcement once it has considered this advice and the Commission's report.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para4">During the consultation period around 50 responses were received, with a majority of those commenting supporting the proposal. A number of the responses from the herbal sector advocated alternative options, in particular the continued availability of Kava-kava with voluntary inclusion of warning information for the purchaser or the continued availability of Kava but subject to restrictions, for example as to strength.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para5">Over 20 representative organisations in the herbal sector or individual companies have at various stages notified the MCA of their participation in the voluntary agreement. In the period preceding the CSM's further advice in July, the MCA was aware that one company had withdrawn from the agreement on the basis of its view that there was insufficient evidence of risk to the public from Kava-kava to justify the withdrawal of the product, although it subsequently resumed participation. The current position is that the MCA is not aware of any relevant representative groups or organisations that have advised their members not to participate in the agreement. However, the national association of health stores notified the MCA at the end of July of their position that it was a matter for individual shops to check with their insurance companies to establish whether cover would remain in force.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para6">The MCA has received a wide range of oral or written representations and views from the herbal sector relating to the voluntary agreement. The main points made by various parties have included: support for the agreement pending a decision on the future regulatory status of Kava-kava; disagreement or doubt that the strength of evidence of risk justified the agreement or its continuation; requests for an early decision about any regulatory action in order to resolve the position; and concerns over whether all parties were implementing or abiding by the agreement.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para7">As herbal remedies may be supplied under section 12 of the Medicines Act 1968 without a marketing authorisation or any other form of notification to the MCA, a comprehensive record of Kava-kava products on the United Kingdom's market is not available. The MCA therefore requested information from the herbal sector about unlicensed remedies containing Kava-kava which had been on the market prior to the voluntary agreement. The information provided was insufficiently comprehensive to enable a detailed comparison with products on the German market. However, products listed by the herbal sector included ones similar to those 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2002 : Column 744W</I><P>
sold in Germany, such as standardised extracts providing a daily dose of between 120 and 210 mg of kavalactones.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para8">In relation to the position on food, since December 2001 the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been advising against consumption of foods containing Kava-kava and encouraging industry to voluntarily withdraw these products from the market. In July 2002, acting on the advice of the chairman of the committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COT), the FSA initiated a consultation on proposals which would prohibit the use and import of Kava-kava in foods. The consultation period has now ended and the FSA is considering the responses. Around 30 written responses have been received from a range of interested parties with roughly equal numbers supporting and opposing the proposals.
<P>

<a name="21029w16.html_para9">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has had no discussions with the FSA on this matter. The FSA has no additional information to that outlined above on compliance with the voluntary withdrawal. The FSA does not hold information on the range of food products containing Kava-kava available on the German market.

<P>
<a name="21029w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The goal for ambulance service national health service trusts of reaching 75 per cent. of category A calls within eight minutes is more challenging for some than for others, but the Government remain determined that they all should meet it. While there is more to be done, the ambulance service nationally has made significant progress in recent years&#151;in 1996 only one trust performed at the level indicated by current targets.
<P>

<a name="21029w17.html_para0">Strategic health authorities are responsible for managing the performance of ambulance trusts. Any trust not meeting its response time targets is required to produce a recovery plan in conjunction with their strategic health authority.

<P>

 If a care home is de-registered, councils should re-assess the needs of the home's supported residents for whom they are responsible to determine the best course of action, which may involve moving residents to another registered care home. In similar circumstances, self-funding residents may turn to councils for information and advice. Where self-funding residents cannot make their own arrangements, councils may make alternative arrangements for them under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948. When care homes are de-registered, there should be prior consultation with all relevant parties, including the residents and their families.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w18.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK arms trade with Israel is tiny. All relevant export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other relevant announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for internal repression or external aggression. The outbreak of the intifada, continued Israeli incursions in the occupied territories and the Israeli breach of its assurance that UK originated equipment would not be used in the occupied territories have all been factored in to the Government's current export licensing policy.

He has also taken steps against militancy in Pakistan and banned five terrorist groups. Pakistan continues to be a staunch ally in the continuing campaign against al-Qaeda. We will continue to encourage Pakistan to sustain these efforts. It is too early to assess the impact the religious parties will have on Pakistan's policies.

<i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> Torture is inflicted on men, women and children in almost half the countries of the world. The UK believes that torture has no place in the 21st century and is therefore committed to combating torture everywhere. In October 1998 the UK launched an initiative to tackle torture throughout the world. Phase 3 of this initiative was launched in June this year. Over the four years of the anti-torture initiative the UK has established the reputation of having one of the strongest anti-torture stances in Europe. As part of the initiative the UK has been lobbying countries worldwide to ratify the UN Convention against Torture. Since our campaign was launched, 20 new states have ratified, bringing the total to 130. However, the Convention against Torture still remains the least ratified of all the UN human rights treaties.

For example, in the British Crime Survey, for England and Wales as a whole, the number of common assaults showed a statistically significant decrease of 24 per cent. between 1999 and interviews during 2001/02, whereas common assaults recorded by the police in England and Wales increased by 15 per cent. over the same period.

 The ruling does not impact on our general policy regarding third country transfers under the Dublin Convention. Nor does it affect the operation of Section 11 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The case impacts on the Secretary of State's power to certify human rights claims as manifestly unfounded where certain types of medical evidence are in issue. We are disappointed that the High Court took the view it did on the particular facts of this case. An appeal against the decision has been lodged with the Court of Appeal. The family's separate appeal to the Independent Appellate Authority has been listed for hearing.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21029w21.html_para0">Clause 35(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill provides that a child who is a resident of an accommodation centre may not be admitted to a maintained school or a maintained nursery. However, clause 36 enables an LEA to disapply that provision and to arrange for the education of a child residing in an accommodation centre. In such circumstances the LEA may require the admission of a child to a maintained school, after consulting the school's governing body. However, the LEA cannot require the governing body of a school to admit a child if the child's admission will result in special measures to ensure compliance with the Secretary of State's limits on infant class sizes.

<a name="21029w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 There is currently no criminal offence of trafficking. Criminal statistics which might give an indication of how many children have been trafficked into the UK in each of the past five years, and from where they came, are not therefore available. The Nationality and Immigration and Asylum Bill currently before the House will introduce a new offence of trafficking for the purposes of controlling an individual in prostitution.
<P>

<a name="21029w21.html_para5">Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic given the reluctance of the victims of trafficking to report to the police. There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the UK or the European Union.
<P>

<a name="21029w21.html_para6">A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000) indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.

Eligible prisoners serving between eight months and under four years who pass a risk assessment will be released on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) to spend the latter part of their sentence at home for a period of up to 90 days depending on sentence length. There will

be no change in the maximum curfew length for prisoners serving between three months and under eight months. They will continue to serve between 15 and up to 60 days on curfew.

<a name="21029w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 None. Since 1999, no sums have been realised by any of the criminal justice agencies from confiscation orders relating to corruption in developing countries. The Assets Recovery Agency, the body established under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to investigate and recover unlawfully held assets, will not commence operations until early in the new year.
<P>

<a name="21029w22.html_para1">I should add that the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 also brings forward the point at which assets may be restrained to the start of a criminal investigation. At present, restraint is only possible when proceedings have or are about to be instituted which may be too late to prevent assets from being dissipated. The international co-operation provisions of Part 11 of the Act will also enable co-operation to be provided without
<P>

<a name="21029w22.html_para2">the need to designate overseas authorities for assistance, enabling assistance to be given much more readily when cases arise.
<P>

<a name="21029w22.html_para3">In this context I should also note two new provisions which should assist in combating corruption in developing countries. Section 108 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 ensures that foreign agents are covered by the law on bribery and corruption. Section 109 extends UK jurisdiction in respect of acts committed abroad by UK nationals and bodies incorporated under UK law which would amount to corruption offences if committed here. These provisions were brought into force on 14 February 2002. The confiscation provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act will apply to these offences, following conviction of an offender where the offender has benefited from his conduct.
<P>

<a name="21029w22.html_para4">Arrangements exist for the UK to share sums realised on behalf of another jurisdiction following enforcement of an overseas confiscation order. As a general rule the maximum amount which can be shared with a requesting country is 50 per cent. of the sum realised once enforcement costs have been deducted. However, the UK is prepared in principle to return 100 per cent. (following deduction of recovery costs) of any assets that are the proceeds of corruption, and have been the subject of a confiscation order enforced in the UK courts.
<P>

<a name="21029w22.html_para5">In May 2002 a Department for International Development (DFID) conference was held to advise developing countries as to how they could seek assistance from the UK in investigating, freezing and confiscating assets of criminal origin which are believed to be located in the UK.

<a name="21029w23.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Court Service report, Modernising the Civil and Family Courts, published on 23 May 2002 set out a vision of a new business model for the civil and family courts. The aim is to increase the choices for people who need to use the courts; reduce social exclusion in the system of justice; and improve the use of technology in the courts to enhance service. Under the proposals Cheltenham County Court would become a part-time local hearing venue on the basis that, on average, it currently has hearings on fewer than three days per week.
<P>

<a name="21029w23.html_para0">We will be consulting on our proposals for the court network next year. During this period, the views of all those with an interest in the future status of Cheltenham County will be canvassed. The consultation will include Members of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Doorstep sales are used in a number of markets, including gas and electricity supply. Since the introduction of domestic gas and electricity supply competition, such sales have been a useful way of bringing the benefits of competition, particularly access to lower prices, to the attention of customers. Consumers are protected under the Doorstep Selling Regulations, which were enhanced in 1998, and are enforced by local Trading Standards departments. At present, the Government have no plans to introduce further regulation. Gas and electricity consumers are further protected by specific regulations in supply licences, which are the responsibility of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM). Where appropriate, OFGEM takes investigative and enforcement action against suppliers that breach these conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many schemes are in place on motorways in the UK where use is allowed of the hard shoulder during rush hours; and what plans he has to increase this number.  [76522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21029w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There are at present no instances of the hard shoulder being used during rush hours in England. A forthcoming project on the M42 (the Active Traffic Management (ATM) Project) will trial the use of hard shoulder running at peak periods and at other times to help reduce congestion. The trial between Junction 3A (the M40) and Junction 7 (the M6) and will be subject to rigorous safety requirements. For the devolved Administrations, this is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

 Bereavement Allowance and Widowed Parents Allowance are available to both men and women of working age who are widowed. The predecessor benefits, Widow's Pension and Widowed Mother's Allowance, were available to women only up to a maximum age of 65. Entitlement to these benefits ends if a widow or widower remarries. This is because they are intended to provide financial support in widowhood and are designed to help the widowed spouse maintain him or herself and any dependant children in the absence of the deceased spouse's income.
<P>

<a name="21029w28.html_para10">If a widow or widower remarries they are treated, for benefit purposes, in the same way as members of any other married couple. Other social security benefits or tax credits may be available to help support the new family depending on their circumstances.
