To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if Harrier GR7 and GR9 will be equipped with ASRAAM.  [56195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 ASRAAM will not be fitted to Harrier GR7, nor do we intend to integrate the missile on to the aircraft during the programme to upgrade GR7 to GR9 standard.

<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on progress on the Meteor missile programme.  [56196]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A finalised draft contract for the Meteor missile was sent to our partner nations at the end of April. Once approval is obtained from each nation we will be in a position to award the Meteor contract to MBDA. This is currently planned for early July.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what capability will be available in 2006 to replace the withdrawn Sea Harriers; and if he will make a statement.  [56684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Royal Navy Task Groups will retain a significant air defence capability after the Sea Harrier is withdrawn from service in 2006, including against sea-skimming missiles, against which Sea Harrier has little capability. This air defence capability will include type 42 anti-air warfare destroyers armed with updated Sea Dart anti-aircraft missiles, type 22 and 23 frigates armed with point defence missile systems (including the enhanced Sea Wolf missile system) and close-in weapon systems. From later this year, the first upgraded airborne early warning Sea King flight will go to sea providing an improved detection capability over land and sea. All task group warships and some support shipping are also equipped with decoy systems against air and surface launched anti-ship missiles. Additionally, the Harrier GR aircraft possess a point defence capability through the sidewinder short range air-to-air missile.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what basis the decision on the timing of the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier was made; and if he will make a statement.  [56686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Sea Harrier FA2 is being withdrawn by 2006 as to retain it as a viable weapon system beyond the middle of this decade would require significant investment and would also involve significant technical risk.
<P>

<a name="20521w01.html_para0">As the Sea Harrier FA2 is essentially a modified Harrier GR3, an all-metal aircraft that was withdrawn from RAF service in the late 1980s, investment will instead be concentrated on the more modern Harrier GR7

that will be upgraded to GR9 standard to provide an enhanced expeditionary capability for land attack operations from both land and aircraft carriers.

<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment has been made of the benefits of integrating the Sea Harrier's specific capabilities on to the remaining GR Harriers; and if he will make a statement.  [56683]
<P><P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Laws:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what assessment he has made of upgrading the Harrier GR7 to include an advanced air defence radar capable of using AMRAAM; what the cost is estimated to be; and if he will make a statement.  [56535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The role of the Harrier GR7 is in support of force projection. Its air-to-air capability is optimised for its own defence. To integrate the Sea Harrier's specific air defence capabilities on to the GR Harrier would entail the fitting of the Blue Vixen radar and Advance Medium Range Air to Air Missiles (AMRAAM) missiles. While it would, in theory, be possible to do this we currently have no requirement to do so. Therefore no detailed work has been undertaken by the Department into the practicality and cost effectiveness of such a modification.
<P>

<a name="20521w01.html_para1">Such a programme would be at least as complex, lengthy and costly as the Sea Harrier Blue Vixen/ AMRAAM update in the mid-90s. Given the considerable cost, time scale and technical risk involved, and the planned entry into service of the Future Joint Combat Aircraft in 2012, the benefits of integrating the Sea Harrier specific capabilities onto the GR Harrier would be of limited duration and utility.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> In determining the future strategy for Joint Force Harrier ahead of the introduction of the Future Joint Combat Aircraft in around 2012 a variety of investment strategies were considered for both Harrier GR7 and Sea Harrier FA2. Our recent operational experience, and consideration of likely future threats, led us to conclude that the priority is for carrier-borne aircraft that can fulfil the ground attack role. The Sea Harrier FA2 has an extremely limited ground attack capability and without a new engine, a high risk technical challenge, has major performance limitations. Further, a number of the FA2's avionic and defensive systems are becoming increasingly obsolescent and by the middle of the decade will have significant operational deficiencies. The cost of recovering this obsolescence would be around &#163;250 million. Such a significant investment was deemed incoherent without a more powerful engine that could deliver world-wide year-round embarked capability and when it would only restore elements of the air defence capability. It would do nothing to equip the aircraft to carry current and near term smart offensive weapons, our key future need. This would have required a full replacement of the avionic system which was judged to be unachievable.

<a name="20521w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> We have no plans to upgrade the existing air to air capability of the Harrier GR7.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> We currently plan to upgrade all Harrier GR7 aircraft to GR9 standard, up to 68 aircraft in total. The GR7 upgrade programme is due to begin in late 2003 and be completed during 2008.

<P>

<a name="20521w01.html_para3">The integration of the Pegasus Mk 107 engine into 11 Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft was the subject of a feasibility study in 2000. The cost of integration was estimated to be approximately &#163;230 million. The study concluded that there would be significant technical difficulties and that overall the programme did not represent good value for money.

<P>
<a name="20521w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The estimate of &#163;600 million, which was announced in January 2001, will optimise the aircraft's capability for the United Kingdom environment. It represents the costs of providing and integrating certain UK weapons systems, to be selected in due course, securing the Joint Strike Fighter's compatibility with UK Command and Control arrangements and ensuring compliance with our safety and environmental requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of a lack of BVRAAM on the Eurofighter's operational ability; and if he will make a statement.  [56685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Eurofighter's primary role is air superiority. Without a BVRAAM, it would be wholly reliant on short-range missiles in this role and would be disadvantaged in medium and beyond visual range engagements. We have therefore assessed that Eurofighter will require a BVRAAM capability. From the outset, it is planned that the aircraft will be cleared to carry and fire the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). This capability will be enhanced by the acquisition of Meteor. Meteor's planned In-Service Date is 2012.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> HMS Ocean has experienced some minor technical difficulties during her current deployment. These were associated with the propulsion system, air conditioning and chilled water plant, the side ramp and some other equipments and systems. Such difficulties are consistent with a deployment of this duration and nature. The majority have already been resolved and none has adversely affected HMS Ocean's ability to undertake her operational tasks at any stage of her deployment.

 We have always valued strategic stability between the United States and Russia, a stability to which the anti-ballistic missile treaty made a major contribution throughout the cold war. But it is important to recognise that the strategic context is changing and that it is stability we value rather than one particular means for achieving it. To this end we welcome the progress that the United States and Russia have made towards a new strategic framework, in particular their recent agreement on major reductions in nuclear weapons.

(Deaths on Military Premises)
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w02.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what factors are taken into account when determining which organisations investigate the circumstances of a death or serious injury of a member of Her Majesty's armed forces on his Department's property.  [56696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Jurisdiction for the investigation of incidents resulting in death or serious injury will vary depending upon the nature of the incident and whether it occurs in the United Kingdom, overseas or, in the case of the Royal Navy, on board ship. The rules governing jurisdiction are detailed in the Queen's Regulations for each service. In the case of a death in the United Kingdom, primacy for any investigation lies with the local civilian police force, who would usually be supported by the appropriate service police authority or Ministry of Defence police, and other agencies as required. For example, where a death is suspected to have been caused by an accident, an investigation could also be carried out by a service accident investigation team. Cause of death can only be concluded by Her Majesty's Coroner. A service Board of Inquiry would normally be carried out following the conclusion of any associated police investigations.
<P>

<a name="20521w02.html_para5">In cases of serious injury, factors such as the cause of injury, level of severity and any suspicion of criminality would determine whether the civilian police, Ministry of Defence police or service police authorities would investigate. Again, where serious injury is suspected to have been caused by an accident, the relevant service accident investigation team could also be involved.

 The Ministry of Defence is currently undertaking the planning process for the voluntary remediation of five dump sites at RAF Portreath.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what basis the decision was made to reject the BAE proposal to build all 12 type 45 warships; and if he will make a statement.  [57348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The BAE Systems unsolicited proposal was very carefully considered. However, it was decided not to take it further because of the serious implications it would have for competition downstream for future United Kingdom warships and the very substantial forward commitment it sought on a variety of shipbuilding programmes. The revised type 45 procurement strategy, announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 10 July 2001, should offer better value for money in the longer run, if it enables competition to be pursued on other warship programmes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is assumed that the question refers to potential sites for the assembly of the United Kingdom's future aircraft carrier. The competing primes on the carrier programme&#151;BAE Systems and Thales&#151;are assessing the capability of a number of sites within the United Kingdom that have the potential to participate in the build (the construction and outfitting of modules or blocks of the vessel) and assembly (the joining together of the blocks into a whole ship in a dry dock of sufficient size). No final decisions have been made on the mix of sites that will be utilised in the ship build programme. A number of potential facilities for assembly have been identified to date, including Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Inch Green on the Clyde, and Swan Hunter on Tyneside. Other potential assembly sites continue to be assessed and much will depend on the design and dimensions of the carrier that is eventually taken forward and the method of construction. The two prime contractors are due to submit proposals on ship procurement towards the end of this year. This will include preferred assembly sites together with an assessment of any required modifications.

 Pursuant to my reply to the hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> The River class offshore patrol vessel contract is an operating lease arrangement rather than a pure PFI deal. It has a duration of five years with the option to extend. The ro-ro contract is still being negotiated but the intention is that it will be a service-based PFI running until 2024.
<P>

<a name="20521w03.html_para2">The optimal length of any PFI type contract varies according to the circumstances of the particular deal. In practice this means taking account of the duration and scope of the requirement, the potential asset life and residual value at the end of the deal, and optimising capital financing charges. These key criteria are considered together with the scope for risk transfer to determine the length of contract that is expected to deliver the optimal value for money solution for the project.

 Nepal is a long-standing friend of the United Kingdom and our armies have always had close links.

 At the Nordic Defence Ministers' meeting in Alesund, I signed a Letter of Intent that provides the basis for the United Kingdom's co-operation with NORDCAPS (the Nordic Co-ordinated Arrangement for Peace Support). This builds on the co-operative arrangements that we already enjoy with our Nordic partners in the Balkans. Our involvement is on a case-by-case basis.

Officials from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) attend on behalf of the UK. This committee meets on an ad hoc basis. There have been no meetings in the last year, and no meetings are timetabled for the immediate future. Considerable effort has already taken place in developing the technical information underpinning this Directive. The secretariat to the committee would be provided by the European Commission, which provides interpreting services etc. The European Commission would also pay the travel expenses of the UK representatives. Any potential costs to UK public funds would therefore consist largely of the accommodation costs for the staff attending meetings and their salary costs.

<P>
<a name="20521w07.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> The draft Animal By-Products Regulation has yet to be adopted and it is not clear when it will come into force. However, we expect it to apply in member states in the first half of 2003. We have commissioned a risk assessment on the risks to public, animal and plant health from the land spreading of composted catering waste and animal by-products. In the light of that assessment we will review our current legislation and consider whether this should be amended in advance of the EU Regulation coming into force.

<a name="20521w07.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> When an establishment chooses to apply to the Environment Agency for a composting site license the agency has a series of application and working plan guidance notes to assist in understanding the licensing process. The agency has also issued guidance and risk assessment procedures to help those operating smaller establishments who wish to register exemptions. In addition, the agency recently issued a standard waste management licence pack to those applicants with a low risk impact green waste composting proposal. This allows the use of a simplified application process that results in a speedier processing of the licence application. Finally, the agency has consulted on technical guidance for composting that will be published later this year.

 In England and Wales the Environment Agency's general quality assessment (GQA) scheme is used to classify water quality in rivers and canals. Figures showing changes in quality against a baseline of 1990 are published each year by the Environment Agency. Results for Scotland are collected by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and in Northern Ireland by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20521w07.html_para1">Chemical quality is assessed on the basis of biochemical oxygen demand and concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ammonia. Stretches of rivers and canals are classed as good, fair, poor or bad based on different degrees of chemical quality.

<a name="20521w07.html_para2">Phosphates and nitrates are measured to determine the average concentrations of nutrients in rivers. Each monitored river stretch is assigned one of six grades from 1 (very low) to 6 (excessively high for phosphate, very high for nitrate).

 An assessment of the costs and benefits of implementing the directive was set out in the first consultation paper issued jointly by the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the National Assembly for Wales in March 2001. This partial regulatory impact assessment estimated total costs for England and Wales in the range of &#163;2 billion to &#163;9.2 billion: benefits in the range of &#163;1.6 billion to &#163;6.2 billion. A copy of the paper is in the House Library.

<P>
<a name="20521w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In England and Wales the Environment Agency's General Quality Assessment (GQA) scheme is used to classify water quality in rivers and canals. Figures showing changes in quality against a baseline of 1990 are published each year by the Environment Agency. Results for Scotland are collected by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and in Northern Ireland by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20521w07.html_para16">The GQA also reports on the aesthetic quality of rivers. This includes: litter on the banks and in the river; sewage derived waste such as sanitary towels and cotton buds; the colour and smell of the water; oil, scum, foam, sewage fungus and ochreous deposits; and dog fouling.
<P>

<a name="20521w07.html_para17">Biological quality is assessed by comparing the populations of macroinvertebrates found in samples taken twice a year at each sampling site, with the population that would normally be found in unpolluted waters with the same physical characteristics. Stretches of rivers and canals are classed as very good, good, fairly good, fair, poor or bad.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Nitrates Directive and Water Framework Directive both relate in part to levels of nitrate in groundwater.
<P>

<a name="20521w07.html_para18">The Nitrates Directive aims to protect waters from nitrate pollution from agricultural land. It requires identification of groundwaters that contain, or could contain if preventative action is not taken, more than 50mg/l nitrates. In 1996, England designated 59 Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) specifically for the protection 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2002 : Column 197W</I><P>
of groundwaters. Since 1998, farmers within NVZs have been required to apply Action Programme measures to limit organic manure and inorganic nitrogen fertiliser use.
<P>

<a name="20521w07.html_para19">A European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgment in 2000 held that the UK had failed to designate sufficient NVZs for the protection of all waters. A recent consultation outlined two options for implementing the Nitrates Directive, both of which would extend the protection of groundwater in England. We are currently carefully considering the responses made to this consultation and will announce a decision in due course.
<P>

<a name="20521w07.html_para20">In the future, the Water Framework Directive will add further force to this protection because it requires that member states aim to achieve good groundwater status for all bodies of groundwater within 15 years of the Directive coming into force. The Commission is currently developing specific measures to prevent and control groundwater pollution, which will complement the provisions of existing Directives.

[56561]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under section 52 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 waste disposal authorities are required to pay waste collection authorities recycling credits for all waste which the latter recycle. The value of the recycling credit should be equal to the saving the disposal authority makes through not having to dispose of the recycled material.
<P>

<a name="20521w08.html_para0">Local authorities have the option (but not a duty) to pay recycling credits to third parties (businesses, charities and community groups) collecting waste for recycling. Practice among local authorities varies, but I am aware that a number have a policy of not paying recycling credits to businesses.
<P>

<a name="20521w08.html_para1">I have had no specific representations from, or discussions with, the groups mentioned on the issue of recycling credits, nor has my Department carried out an assessment of their impact on them. However, "Waste Strategy 2000" recognised that the current scheme in England and Wales might in some cases work against the closer working relationships between collection and disposal authorities and other interested parties which the national strategy advocates. The Government are committed to reviewing the recycling credits scheme to see whether incentives for the promotion of recycling can be improved. In so doing we will consult fully with relevant parties, including those listed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many days of sick leave were taken by employees in her Department in the last year for which records are available; what proportion of those were due to work-related illness or injury; and what the cost was to the Department.

<P>
<a name="20521w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> In 2000, the latest year for which records are available, an average of nine days per staff year were taken by employees in what was then the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, including its agencies. These figures are published in the Cabinet Office annual report "Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service", copies of which are placed in House Libraries.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> Records are not maintained by the Department which enable ill health retirements to be separately identified as work-related. The number of staff retired with a medical retirement certificate issued by the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) medical adviser for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001, was 20. Benefits provided on medical retirement are as set out in the rules of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme and laid before Parliament, and provide for an immediate payment of an enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill-health retirement expenditure is met centrally from the Civil Superannuation Vote. For the year ending March 2002, provisional expenditure from the vote was &#163;310 million in respect of all civil service cases for which an ill-health pension has been awarded. These cases number approximately 67,000 and include those who have formerly been ill-health retired but who have now reached and exceeded the normal retirement age.

 Pursuant to the answer given to my hon. Friend on 4 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 749W, the information provided should be properly clarified. Local authorities are not able to use their powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 as previous case law has deemed that public sewers and sewage treatment works cannot be considered "premises" within the context of that Act. My officials are exploring the available legislation and existing controls as a possible means to deal with odour nuisance from sewage treatment works in the future.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), representing the House of Commons Commission, how many specialist advisers have been employed since 1997 by each select committee; what was the duration of their contract and scale of remuneration; in each case, whether the post was openly advertised; what the total cost of special advisers was, broken down by committee; and if he will break down the numbers of special advisers by <i>(a)</i> sex and <i>(b)</i> ethnic origin.

<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 Lists of specialist advisers appointed by each select committee in the last Parliament and their cost are contained in the Sessional Returns ordered to be printed by the House on 25 January 1999 (HC142), 16 December 1999 (HC1), 5 February 2001 (HC100) and 20 July 2001 (HC1). The equivalent information so far in the current Session is being assembled and will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20521w09.html_para6">The arrangements for the selection of candidates are the responsibility of individual select committees, not of the House of Commons Commission. Committees normally appoint specialist advisers for a particular subject or a particular inquiry. Typically, an appointment remains valid until the end of a Parliament in case a committee returns to a subject. Specialist advisers are not House employees but are paid as contractors. Details of duration of their appointment and scale of remuneration are collated by each committee separately. Daily rates, which are currently under review, range up to &#163;150. As specialist advisers are not employees of the House, we have no separate record by gender and ethnic origin.

 My officials in Lilongwe are in regular contact with the two other member states represented in Malawi (Denmark and Germany) as well as the EC delegation. The Danes are withdrawing from Malawi and have not therefore been active in helping to provide food. Neither have the Germans (who argue that their contribution is through the EC).

<a name="20521w09.html_para7">The EC have now agreed to purchase 40,000 tonnes of maize from the local market to replenish National Food Reserve Agency stocks. This will be held until the lean season (starting October) and then released for distribution to those in need. A further 10,000 tonnes will be purchased internationally. The EC are preparing a proposal seeking financial contributions from all member states to finance another 30,000 tonnes of maize to be procured internationally.

 As I explained to the hon. Member at our meeting on 1 May, our ten-year plan reflects our commitment to light rail in major cities. Whether light rail offers the most appropriate and cost-effective response to transport needs in other circumstances is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authorities concerned to consider in formulating and reviewing their local transport plans. Thereafter, any light rail scheme or other major transport project would need to undergo rigorous appraisal and examination under any relevant statutory procedures before funding approval could be considered.

This estimate, which is in April 2002 prices, is consistent with the preferred bids for the PPP contracts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w15.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 On 1 May 2001, my right hon. Friend the then Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Hilary Armstrong), announced the signing of a local public service agreement with Newcastle city council, <i>Official Report,</i> column 594.
<P>

<a name="20521w15.html_para5">One of the Government commitments made in that local PSA, in return for a commitment from the council to increase the level of regeneration, was to have discussions 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2002 : Column 224W</I><P>
about alterations to the arrangements for clawback of regeneration grants on change of use or disposal of an asset.
<P>

<a name="20521w15.html_para6">The council have argued that for some older regeneration schemes, where any clawback which might apply would be small, that the costs of delay&#151;administratively and in terms of starting valuable projects&#151;would be disproportionate to the sums that might be recovered. The Government have concluded that for regeneration schemes that are now closed, in respect of transactions where receipts are relatively low (and thus the maximum potential level of clawback is also low), and where Government can have confidence that any receipt which might have been due to the Government is recycled into further regeneration consistent with the Government's regeneration objectives, it can offer value for money to offer a waiver of clawback.
<P>

<a name="20521w15.html_para7">In view of the council's undertaking to achieve the enhanced regeneration objectives set out in the local PSA, the Government undertook to consider what scope there is to assist and encourage the council to achieve its targets by waiving the council's contingent liability to repay grant under certain discontinued grant regimes.
<P>

<a name="20521w15.html_para8">The council was seeking a waiver of my Department's right to clawback in both situations where a liability to repay grant can arise, namely (1) where there is a change of use of an asset constructed or acquired wholly or partly out of funds paid under a relevant grant scheme; and (2) where there is a disposal of such an asset. It was the Council's intention to use any proceeds that might have arisen from the waiver to further its regeneration objectives in the East End and West End Going for Growth areas of Newcastle.
<P>

<a name="20521w15.html_para9">After careful consideration, I have concluded that my Department can waive its entitlement to claw back grant under the terms of the former Urban Programme and City Challenge grant schemes:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in order to assist and encourage the council to deliver its regeneration targets under the local PSA;
<P>
<BR>
in relation to assets constructed or acquired using grant given for regeneration activities in the East End and West End Going for Growth areas of Newcastle, as defined in the respective regeneration plans published by the council in July 2001;
<P>
<BR>
so far as liability to repay grant can arise from a disposal of an asset, including land, only where the potential for grant clawback derived from a disposal is &#163;100,000 or less;
<P>
<BR>
so far as liability to repay grant can arise from a change of use of an asset, including land, only where a new use of an asset continues to further the objectives of the grant scheme or wider Government regeneration objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 published in the DTLR Business Plan 2001; and
<P>
<BR>
for disposals agreed or changes of use effected on or after the date that the Council accepts the terms of the waiver and before 31 March 2004 (the date on which the local PSA expires), unless the waiver is withdrawn before that date on the grounds that it is not being applied properly.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20521w15.html_para10">Accordingly, my Department has written to the council today.
<P>

<a name="20521w15.html_para11">For transactions in which potential clawback could exceed &#163;100,000, a full analysis of whether any clawback is due will continue to be required from the council, together with a calculation of the amount due, and waivers will be considered on a case by case basis.

This committee has not met for several years because directive 76/117/EEC is being superseded by directive 94/9/EC and will be repealed on 1 July 2003 when directive 94/9/EC comes fully into force.

 The Committee on Defence against Obstacle to Trade is established under Council regulation (EC) No. 3286/94, for the purposes of consultations between member states and the Commission on complaints by Community enterprises, industries or individual member states of alleged breach of international trade rules by a third country resulting in adverse trade effects. As appropriate, the committee also considers the results of investigations which the Commission may undertake in relation to such complaints and any follow-up action it may propose to take with the country concerned. As provided for in the regulation, details of both the opening of any such investigations and of any commercial policy measures that may eventually be taken are published in the Community's Official Journal.

 The European Union's Institute of Security Studies' main responsibility is to conduct academic research and analysis on issues related to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Specifically, it produces and commissions research papers and arranges seminars.

In some countries, a second class of hotel is used for officials with no representational duties. During conferences the host nation may well limit delegations to particular hotels for security, protocol and logistical purposes.

These mainly related to the failure to monitor expenditure in 2000, leading to a deficit; failure to explain financial problems arising in 2001; and presentation of unrealistically high budgetary bids.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on what occasions the UK ambassador to the Hague made representations to Jos&#233; Bustani that were critical of <i>(a)</i> his stewardship and <i>(b)</i> the direction of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons prior to the latter's dismissal.

 The then British ambassador (Dame Rosemary Spencer) joined other major financial contributors in a call on Mr. Bustani, on 23 February 2001, to express our concern at his decision to apply major cuts to the verification programme. On 6 April 2001, the UK representative to the OPCW Executive Council took part in a similar call, urging a more co-operative approach, pressing for assurances that financial controls had been put in place to correct evident shortcomings, and requesting revision of Mr. Bustani's 2002 budget proposals. The UK representative on the Executive Council had made similar points in a private meeting with Mr. Bustani on 5 April 2001. The current British ambassador (Colin Budd) met with Mr. Bustani on 15 March 2002 to inform him that the UK believed that it would be in the best interests of the OPCW and the chemical weapons convention if he were to resign.

 Officials in London and our embassy in Tel Aviv have regular, almost daily, contact with their Israeli counterparts. These cover a number of issues, but the Israeli-Palestinian crisis predominates. Contact with the Israelis is a key part of the international effort to secure progress in the peace process.

 An "open" umbrella registered body is an organisation in the public, private or voluntary sector that is prepared to countersign applications for higher level disclosures at the request of others outside their own circle or sector. A "closed" umbrella registered body is one that provides the countersignatory service to those within its circle or sector only.

<a name="20521w21.html_para2">Information is not kept as to the charging of fees by umbrella bodies, and there are no plans to collect such information. In guidance for umbrella bodies, the Criminal Records Bureau urges that any such charges are kept to a minimum. Those wishing to use the services of an umbrella body would be well advised to ask whether charges are made and, if so, compare charges.

<a name="20521w21.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many Prison Service pay queries have been outstanding at the end of each month since July 2001;  [55729]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many Prison Service personnel have been <i>(a)</i> incorrectly paid and <i>(b)</i> unpaid following the implementation of Payfact.  [55728]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w21.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> Payment of Prison Service personnel is handled by the Home Office Pay and Pensions Service. This service operates 28 payrolls for 69,000 employees. Of these over 40,000 are in the Prison Service. Up until now, the Pay Service has not kept figures for the number of Prison Service pay queries outstanding at the end of each month. However, ways of measuring the number of pay queries on a month by month basis are currently being developed and therefore this information will be available in the future.
<P>

<a name="20521w21.html_para5">Pay Service's priority must be to concentrate on paying personnel correctly, accounting for the disbursement of funds from the payroll and providing financial management information. Pay Service does not retain statistics specifically related to the number of people paid incorrectly or unpaid each month. However, the feasibility of doing so is currently being examined. It does retain statistics for the number of payments made outside payday, both for manually calculated payments and those made through the Payfact system. The figures provide a good indicator of where there are problems. The figures include the numbers of advances of overtime requested by individuals and advances of salary for new entrants; as

prescribe one method across all homes because of variations in size, ratio of welfare to criminal justice placements, and age groups. However, through its contracting arrangements the YJB requires homes providing criminal justice placements to use the control and restraint methods approved and specified by the Department of Health for use in that particular home.
<P>

<a name="20521w22.html_para2">The board does not plan to extend the physical control and care methods used in secure training centres (STCs) to the rest of the juvenile secure estate for essentially similar reasons.

<a name="20521w22.html_para3">The YJB began a building programme in March 2001 to provide 400 new independent sector secure training centre (STC) places by 2005. These places will result from the expansion of two of the existing STCs, Rainsbrook and Medway, and the creation of five new STCs in areas of shortfall across England and Wales. The new STCs will be operated by private providers under private finance initiative contracts managed by the YJB in the same way as the existing centres. In addition, all STCs are governed by the secure training centre rules 1998.
<P>

<a name="20521w22.html_para4">The majority of young people detained in STCs are those sentenced to a detention and training order.

<a name="20521w22.html_para5">The aim is to provide a safe and secure environment where young people have structured, individually tailored training plans. These include 25 hours a week of education; one hour a day to tackle offending behaviour; regular practical tuition in social and life skills; and the opportunity through award schemes and constructive leisure time to develop new interests both in custody and upon transfer to the community. Regular contact with family and friends is encouraged and weekly family visits are funded by the YJB.

further 56 per cent. with serious needs. In addition to screening tests we will be introducing a diagnostic assessment for basic skills, and will fund purpose built or modified accommodation in local prisons to support assessment. We will then expect prisons to ensure that identified needs are addressed in an appropriate way, including support for prisoners with learning difficulties. Our basic skills strategy, which includes the widening of education targets at national and establishment level, is ensuring that we can address needs at all levels. New funding for classrooms adjacent to workshops will help to integrate basic skills into other prison activities. And we will ensure that teachers and trainers in prisons have the same access to training as their mainstream colleagues including in the new curriculum standards for English for Speakers of Other Languages.

One of the aims of the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy, which was published for consultation in July 2001, is to improve access to contraception and to advise on sexual health. In addition, we have also provided funding to 14 areas to enable them to develop schemes for the free NHS supply of emergency contraception in pharmacies using a patient group direction.
<P>

<a name="20521w23.html_para3">The Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy recognises the importance of helping young people resist peer pressure to have early sex, while seeking to ensure that those who are sexually active have easy access to high quality contraceptive advice. A series of guidance notes have been issued to local teenage pregnancy co-ordinators on improving contraceptive and advice services for young people. Local co-ordinators have audited youth contraceptive services in clinics and general practice against these criteria for effective services in order to identify gaps in service provision and to plan improvements. We are also working closely with the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Nursing to improve young people's access to contraceptive advice within general practice.

Over &#163;60 million has been invested across Government during the first three years of implementation.

 The Pupil Retention Grant (PRG) is part of the Social Inclusion: Pupil Support (SIPS) grant which is available to tackle disaffection in schools and to provide education outside school. It is available only to secondary pupils.
<P>

<a name="20521w24.html_para8">PRG has given secondary schools significant additional resources to tackle poor behaviour, while at the same time ensuring that when pupils are excluded LEAs have the resources they need to provide alternative education. In 2001&#150;02, we increased the PRG to &#163;122 million from &#163;100 million in 2000&#150;01. LEAs must allocate the PRG direct to schools.
<P>

<a name="20521w24.html_para9">Where permanent exclusion has taken place, a child will still need to be educated. In these cases the exclusion will trigger the transfer of at least some of the PRG from the school to the LEA as a contribution to the education of that child. The LEA has flexibility about the amount it will seek to transfer back from the school that it negotiates with head teachers. On average, between &#163;3,000&#151;&#163;6,000 will be deducted from the excluded school's budget allocation per excludee.
<P>

<a name="20521w24.html_para10">The LEA can then use the PRG to provide education outside of school and/or support a reintegration package at a new school, helping to ensure that full-time education really does become a reality for excluded children and young people. Schools accepting pupils previously excluded from other schools should therefore benefit from

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills where an academy is created involving <i>(a)</i> the Church Schools Company and <i>(b)</i> any other faith-based organisation, whether the school will be allowed to select and dismiss teachers in accordance with sections 58 to 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.  [58106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Employment law allows any school with a religious character&#151;whether maintained or independent&#151;to take into account in appointing or promoting teaching staff, their ability to promote the religious character of the school. Where an academy has a religious character, we would consider proposals to include provisions in the funding agreement analogous to the provisions of sections 58 to 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act as these apply to aided schools with a religious character. This would include the parts of sections 58&#150;60 which allow governing bodies of maintained schools to dismiss teachers appointed to give religious education in accordance with the character of the school, where they fail to do so efficiently and suitably.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many days of sick leave were taken in her Department last year; how many related to employees suffering <i>(a)</i> stress and <i>(b)</i> other mental health problems; and what the cost was to her Department.  [56477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w27.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The most recently published annual report "Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service" records the number of working days lost through sickness absence in the Lord Chancellor's Department as 10 working days per staff year for the calendar year 2000.
<P>

<a name="20521w27.html_para0">A recent analysis of sick absence by type indicates that around 23 per cent. of all sick absence in the Department is due to stress, depression or anxiety-related illnesses. We are unable accurately to cost this figure.
<P>

<a name="20521w27.html_para1">The Department is committed to managing sickness absence effectively. A great deal of work has been undertaken to raise awareness of our Service Delivery Agreement targets, of the need to manage attendance in accordance with best practice policies, and to reduce absence due to work related injuries and illness in line with the Government's Revitalising Health and Safety initiative.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 None. Charges for access to the register of local land charges are prescribed by the Local Land Charges Rules 1977 (SI 1977 No. 985). These charges were last revised in 1998 (SI 1998 No. 1190). Records open to public inspection and held by local authorities may be inspected free of charge. These records include the planning register and the register of enforcement notices, stop notices and breach of condition notices 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2002 : Column 287W</I><P>
(Town and Country Planning Act 1990, ss 69 and 188). Other records open to public inspection relating to land include maps of public sewers, publicly adopted highways, and public rights of way (Water Industry Act 1991, ss 199 and 200; Highways Act 1980 s 36(7); and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, s 57(5) respectively). A local authority must behave reasonably in fulfilling its duty to allow access to public records. If reasonable access is denied the matter may be referred to the courts or the local government ombudsman. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 will improve the rights of individuals to have access to information, and provide a right to complain to the Information Commissioner if access is prevented. The Act is expected to come into force in relation to information held by local government on 1 January 2005.

<P>
<a name="20521w27.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the statutory requirement is for provision of public access to local authority information as found on the forms <i>(a)</i> CON 29, Inquiries of Local Authorities and <i>(b)</i> LLC1, Requisition and Certificate of Search.  [57706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Some of the information contained in answers to questions in CON 29 is available from public records that are held by local authorities. Local authorities are under a statutory duty to allow public inspection, free of charge, to these records. In the case of the planning register, for example, sections 69, 188 and 214 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 require local authorities to make the register available for inspection by the public "at all reasonable hours". The statutory requirement for the provisions of public access to the register of local land charges is set out in the Local Land Charges Act 1975 and the Local Land Charges Rules 1977 (SI 1977 No. 985).
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Local Authorities (Charges for Land Searches) Regulations 1994 (SI 1994 No. 1885) give local authorities the power to charge for CON 29 inquiries. The regulations provide that these charges are at the local authority's discretion "but should have regard to its costs in dealing with inquiries". Fees for searches of a local charges register are prescribed by the Local Land Charges Rules 1977 (SI 1977 No. 985).
<P>

[57707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 CON 29 is not a statutory form. The Local Government Association and The Law Society have recently revised CON 29. The new version will be brought into use on 1 July 2002. I have lodged a copy of the draft of the revised form in the Library of the House of Commons.

<P>
<a name="20521w28.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]:</i> A preferred bidder stage was used to cover seven of the nine PPP deals managed by this Department and let in the last four years. Of these seven PPP deals, five are also PFIs. Details of the use of the preferred bidder stage in letting these deals are provided below.
<P>

<a name="20521w28.html_para12">Five PPP deals for IS/IT support, of which three are also PFIs, have been let to date under the ACCORD Project. For evaluation purposes, ACCORD used the preferred bidder stage for the initial selection of partners against a set of typical service package scenarios. Ultimate business allocations, such as Child Support Reform support, which make up the five deals, were always likely to be packaged differently and this proved to be the case. There is therefore no simple correlation between prices offered at preferred bidder stage and final prices for individual business allocations. The ACCORD framework provides for internal competition to select suppliers for individual business allocations and secure value for money. Further to such internal competition ongoing value for money is established by means of independent benchmarking of suppliers prices.
<P>

<a name="20521w28.html_para13">The procurement leading to the PRIME PPP/PFI deal covering ex-DSS estate ownership and management and let in April 1998 selected Partnership Property Management (now Land Securities Trillium) as preferred bidder. At the selection of preferred bidder stage the price offered was &#163;1.93 billion. In subsequent negotiation it was agreed to re-measure the estate and as a result the scope of the deal increased, other service improvements were also secured. These changes resulted in the price increasing by &#163;78 million. The PRIME procurement was examined by the NAO in 1999 and the resulting deal was considered to represent value for money.
<P>

<a name="20521w28.html_para14">The Employment Service procurement leading to the PPP/PFI contract for human resources services, including payroll and personnel administration, selected the joint proposal from Rebus Resources Services and Norwich Systems Accounting as the preferred bid.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what progress has been made with his project on modernisation of disability living allowance.  [54645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w29.html_spnew1"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 We are delivering our commitment to modernise disability living allowance (DLA) by introducing a system of active case management which ensures that entitlements are right at the outset and remain right.
<P>

<a name="20521w29.html_para3">We are ensuring that the period for which disability living allowance is awarded more appropriately reflects the effects of the customer's disability. As a result the majority of DLA awards are now for a fixed period, and therefore subject to later renewal and review. In addition, in June 1999, we introduced a system of periodic inquiry to ensure that longer term awards remained correct. In April 2002 we introduced refinements to the periodic inquiry process to focus more effort on those cases with the greatest likelihood of incorrectness.
<P>

<a name="20521w29.html_para4">Extensive work has already been done to shorten and simplify the claiming process for disability living allowance. A shorter claim pack, reduced by 10 pages, was introduced in April 2001 and tests of a new attendance allowance claim pack for people aged 75 and over, which is currently taking place, shows that further significant shortening of the claim pack used for extra cost disability benefits is possible. From September 2002 it is 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2002 : Column 294W</I><P>
planned to test a significantly shortened disability living allowance claim pack tailored to the needs of individual customers, as part of a new streamlined claim process.
<P>

<a name="20521w29.html_para5">New report forms to enable general practitioners and Examining Medical Officers to provide clinical rather than subjective medical information about customers are being introduced. These are currently being developed and tested and subject to the satisfactory evaluation of live testing will be rolled out nationally commencing with the general practitioner form in June 2002.
<P>

<a name="20521w29.html_para6">Staff involved in the DLA decision making process are receiving specialist training on disability awareness and the initial training programme is due to be completed by the end of December. Two additional modules to the programme are now being developed and delivery to staff is due to commence later this year.
<P>

<a name="20521w29.html_para7">We are continuing to examine the feasibility of making greater use of health care professionals in the decision making process.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if the Government will introduce legislation to prevent genetic discrimination by employers, with specific reference to the refusal of employment on the grounds of adverse genetic test results.  [55634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w30.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 We have no plans to introduce such legislation. The Human Genetics Commission is drawing up a report to Health and Science Ministers on the storage, protection and use of personal genetic information. This will include advice on the use of genetic testing in employment. We will carefully consider the commission's advice when it is received.

 From 8 April 2002 all new customers (and all former preserved rights customers) in independent residential care, nursing homes and local authorities accommodation are entitled to the standard income support, personal allowance. Customers already in receipt of the residential allowance or part III accommodation rate on 8 April 2002 continue to receive it for as long as they satisfy the conditions for entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20521w30.html_para0">From October 2003 we intend to simplify the rules governing those customers in residential care by removing the residential allowance and part III accommodation rate for all customers. Introducing the same rules for people in care as for those supported in their own homes will simplify the system, making it more transparent and easier for customers to understand.

[56201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The number of people claiming incapacity benefit is taken from a quarterly 5 per cent. scan of the benefit computer system. The process of calculating the number of incapacity benefit claimants was not altered for August 2001.
<P>

<a name="20521w30.html_para3">Individuals are assigned to local authorities and other areas by matching postcodes against the relevant Office for National Statistics (ONS) postcode directory. The ONS postcode directory used in the original allocation of August 2001 incapacity benefit data was later revised by ONS using an improved methodology.

 The majority of eligible people will again receive their winter fuel payments automatically for winter 2002&#150;3.

Claims from people who did not claim within the time limits for winters 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 cannot now be paid for those winters. However, failure to submit a claim for one winter does not preclude a person from claiming for the next winter, subject to the time limits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w30.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proportion of pensions are underfunded on an MFR basis in the <i>(a)</i> public and <i>(b)</i> private sector; and if he will make a statement on trends in each sector.  [57308]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Private sector defined benefit pension schemes are generally subject to the Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR). Many public sector pension schemes are either unfunded (such as the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme) or covered by alternative legislation (such as the Local Government Pension Scheme) and are therefore not subject to the MFR. There are, however, a number of funded public sector schemes to which the MFR applies, such as those covering employees of some non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="20521w30.html_para4">Information on the MFR funding levels of private sector defined benefit schemes is available from the Employers' Pension Provision (EPP) Survey. Information is not available for public sector pension schemes which are subject to the MFR.
<P>

<a name="20521w30.html_para5">The latest EPP survey, carried out in 2000, indicated that around one in eight (13 per cent.) private sector defined benefit schemes were less than 100 per cent. funded on the MFR basis. Six per cent. of schemes were funded at less than 90 per cent. and 7 per cent. were funded at least at 90 per cent. but at less than 100 per cent. Almost all schemes surveyed that were underfunded had taken action to rectify this situation. These actions included increasing the employers' contributions (78 per cent.), increasing the members' contributions (29 per cent.) and making a cash injection to the fund (19 per cent).
<P>

<a name="20521w30.html_para6">It is not possible at present to identify funding trends from the data available, because only one full cycle of triennial scheme valuations has been carried out since the MFR was introduced in 1997. However, in February 2002, for the purposes of the regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the regulations recently introduced to make interim changes to the MFR, around one in six private sector defined benefit pension schemes were estimated to be underfunded on the MFR basis. This estimate was based on information collected by the actuarial profession from consulting actuaries and insurance companies between 1997 and 2000, and has been adjusted by the Government Actuary's Department broadly to take account of the likely effects on scheme funding levels of subsequent changes in conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what assessment he has made of the impact of housing benefit regulation 5 on the receipt of housing benefit for a period of notice required by a landlord of a hospitalised claimant who is too unwell to return to their normal dwelling; and if he will make a statement;  [57148]
<P>
<UL>(2) if housing benefit regulation 5 requires the benefits service of a local authority to treat a hospitalised claimant as no longer occupying their normal home and ineligible for benefit if the local social services believe that the claimant is not well enough to return to their normal dwelling.  [57149]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20521w31.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The housing benefit scheme is designed to help people on low incomes meet the costs of the accommodation which they rent and occupy as their normal home. We recognise that there are circumstances in which people will reasonably be absent from their normal home for temporary periods and it is right that benefit should remain in payment in these cases.
<P>

<a name="20521w31.html_para0">People in hospital can continue to receive housing benefit in respect of their normal home for up to 52 weeks, or until the local authority decides that their absence is likely to be substantially more than 52 weeks or become permanent. At this point housing benefit is withdrawn. In reaching a decision on the likely length of a person's absence from their normal home, the local authority takes account of all available evidence including, where appropriate, the views of the local social services.

 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2002]:</i> Under the national health service general practitioners (GPs) are required to provide free of charge for their patients all necessary and appropriate medical services of the type usually provided by GPs. This may include immunisation against hepatitis B, if in the GP's clinical opinion, such a procedure is medically necessary. In determining medical necessity GPs may make reference to "Immunisation against Infectious Diseases"&#151;the "Green Book".

with Mental Illness. In March 2001, the National Confidential Inquiry team published its five-year report, "Safety First", building on the earlier report "Safer Services". It was based on a detailed study of 5,582 suicides and 186 homicides by psychiatric patients in the United Kingdom between 1996 and 2000. It found that there were 131 suicides among homeless people, 3 per cent. of the inquiry sample.

<a name="20521w32.html_para2">The Department is in the process of developing, under the direction of the National Director for Mental Health, Professor Louis Appleby, a coherent national suicide prevention strategy to ensure that we are doing all we can to prevent suicides. This strategy was launched for public consultation on 26 April 2002. Copies of the strategy are available in the Library.

<a name="20521w32.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Management of asthma mainly takes place in primary care. The chronic disease management programme (CDMP), introduced in July 1993, provides arrangements for health promotion under the GMS national contract for GPs. Participating GPs (93 per cent.) receive a fixed annual payment for running organised programmes of care for patients with asthma (and for those with diabetes).
<P>

<a name="20521w32.html_para3">People with asthma will benefit from the emerging Expert Patients Programme which will&#151;via the national health service&#151;provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase has recently begun in selected primary care trust sites, with activity to take place both on a generic and a disease-specific basis.
<P>

<a name="20521w32.html_para4">The Medical Research Council always welcomes high quality applications from the scientific community for support into any aspect of biomedical research and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. The Department of Health spend on directly commissioned research projects on asthma since 1997 is an estimated &#163;7.24 million.

 The committee of senior officials on public health (CSOPH) was established in 1975 by European Council Decision 75/365/EEC, as a result of the adoption of the directives relating to medical training. Its mandate is set down in Article 2, which states that the task of the Committee shall be:

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
to identify and analyse any difficulties which might arise from the implementation of Directives 75/362/EEC and 75/363/EEC (now Directive 93/16/EC);
<BR>
to collect all relevant information on the conditions under which general and specialist medical care is given by doctors in the Member States;
<BR>
to deliver opinions which could guide the Commission's work with a view to amendment of the above mentioned Directives.

<P>

Dentists.

<a name="20521w33.html_para3">The Committee is made up of senior officials with responsibility for national health care systems. Each member state is entitled to nominate one representative and one alternate. The UK representative and his alternate represent the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20521w33.html_para4">CSOPH meets twice each year, in July and December. Meetings last one day. Costs to public funds are minimal. The Commission pays the travel costs of the nominated representative but member states meet the costs if it is necessary for the alternate to attend as well.
<P>

<a name="20521w33.html_para5">In carrying out its duties, CSOPH is advised by a group of training advisory committees (TACs) made up of representatives from the relevant professional bodies.

 If self-funding residents of care homes have insufficient income to pay their own fees they may approach their local authority for advice and possible financial assistance.

 Our long-term care policy has led to more constructive partnerships between social services and the independent health and social care sectors. This is already bringing about better outcomes for patients and service users by delivering speedier and more flexible services to individuals, positively using the plurality of providers within our system. This is true for short-term services such as intermediate care as well as residential and nursing care. We are supporting these changes in many ways, including a substantial increase in the funding for personal social services and additional money and assistance through the change agents team-working with individual councils.

 We acknowledge that there are regional variations in national health service chiropody/podiatry services.

 The Department has made no assessment of the use of art therapy and counselling either alone or in comparison with other treatments or services. However, creative arts therapy is increasingly recognised as a valuable treatment for people with a range of problems, including mental health problems. It offers an opportunity for expression and communication and can be particularly helpful to those individuals who find it hard to express their feelings verbally. The art therapist may work as part of a team in both primary and specialised health and social care settings. Equally, counselling, like psychotherapy, is offered within the national health service by a large number of both medical and non-medical staff in primary and specialised care settings and has been shown in a number of independent trials to make an important contribution to the treatment of common mental disorders.

<sup>(38)</sup> On 3 May 2002 the Department of Health issued a press release about malpractice in the management of waiting lists at the Royal United Hospitals Bath (reference 2002&#150;0211). This malpractice is now known to have affected the accuracy of the figures for long waiters reported by the trust for end March 2002.<P>

<P>

We have sampled records for patients that could have been long waiters and have been able to confirm 25 over 15 month waiters. Based on this we estimate that there would be 180 such cases in total, but allowing for uncertainty the 95 per cent. confidence interval suggests this could be as high as 280.<P>

 The NHS Cancer Plan sets out new goals to reduce waiting times for cancer patients including a target of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer by December 2001. Central monitoring of performance against this standard began on 1 January 2002 and figures will be published quarterly, with the first data due in June 2002. The Cancer Plan also sets the target that by 2005 no one should wait longer than one month from diagnosis to first treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the answer of 18 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1179&#150;80W, what complex issues in the health care aspects of the protection of vulnerable adults scheme have caused the delay in implementation.  [57090]<P>

<a name="20521w35.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Care Standards Act 2000, which sets out the legal basis for the protection of vulnerable adults scheme, defines 'vulnerable adult' in terms of the 'services' received. These services are to be prescribed in regulations and it has been important to ensure that as many vulnerable adults as possible are protected within the legal framework of the Care Standards Act.

 For the purpose of reply, it is assumed that the Social Care Council referred to is the General Social Care Council (GSCC), established under the Care Standards Act 2000 and with the objective to register, regulate and raise standards in the social care work force in England.

<a name="20521w36.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 During the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 through Parliament, Ministers gave a commitment to review the need for a mandatory property disregard in situations where former carers, not already covered under the current Assessment of Resources Regulations 1992, continue to live in properties of individuals permanently admitted to residential care. Ministers emphasised that progress could only be made should resources become available.

<P>

<a name="20521w36.html_para3">For the time being the Government are aware that many properties of care home residents are disregarded by statute from the financial assessment for residential accommodation because they continue to be the main home of spouses and other family members listed in the regulations. In many instances these individuals will have cared for the residents prior to admission. Additionally many councils use their discretion to disregard the value of residents' property from the financial assessment when it continues to be the home of carers not covered by the regulations.
