 Business transformation, including efficiency gains, has always been part of the local e-Government strategy.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on e-delivery of government services in rural North Yorkshire.  [198646]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41117w01.html_spnew2"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 All local authorities in North Yorkshire are required to e-enable their services by December 2005. The ability to access services by phone or over the web will bring considerable benefits to users of local services, especially in rural areas served by councils in North Yorkshire. The North Yorkshire ICT Partnership was set up to e-enable services on behalf of councils in the area, but now comprises only two of the original nine councils which could delay planned improvements to local services. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently working with all councils involved to identify possible remedial action.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41117w05.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government have not made a formal assessment, but we are concerned that the poaching and illegal trade in Asian big cats is a serious problem. Since the 1990s the evidence suggested that use for traditional medicine was the major factor behind much of the poaching that was taking place but more recently the demand for big cat skins has re-emerged as a key issue. The impact of this illegal trade is difficult to assess because there is so little information on the scale of the trade and the population data for some of the species concerned is scarce and unreliable.

<a name="stpa_20">The CITES Secretariat did some research into this illegal trade as part of their enforcement missions to Bhutan and China (including Tibet) that were carried out in the summer of 2003 with funding from the UK. The Government are aware that large seizures that have been made by the authorities in China, India and Nepal and have provided the CITES Secretariat with some &#163;15,000 to help fund a meeting of the Tiger Enforcement Task Force to look into this trade. This is planned to take place in the spring of 2005 and aims to help the countries concerned set up appropriate mechanisms for the exchange of relevant intelligence that will enable them to work together to crack down on this illegal trade.

<a name="stpa_21">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) have advised that it is not possible to determine the percentage of deer carcases in the United Kingdom which have been subject to inspection by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) in Great Britain and Department for Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in Northern Ireland. This is because only meat from wild deer destined for the export market is required to be processed in licensed premises and inspected by the MHS or DARD. However, operators of licensed wild game processing facilities producing wild deer intended for the domestic market can choose to have their wild deer inspected and health-marked for commercial reasons.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the cod by-catch from hauls using <i>(a)</i> 80 mm and <i>(b)</i> 110 mm mesh in cod ends deployed by the Fleetwood over 10 metre fishing fleet in the Eastern Irish Sea were in the last 10 years for which figures are available.  [192947]</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41117w06.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Information is only available on the proportion that cod made up of total landings of fish caught in the Irish Sea, as opposed to total catches of fish, and this is given in the following table. This excludes any fish that may have been caught and then discarded before landing. There are several different types of fishing gear that have been used with the mesh sizes quoted, depending on the species of fish being targeted. Only those involving otter trawl in any form have been included. In addition, the 110 mm mesh size was not used significantly in the Irish Sea by the over 10 metre vessels based in Fleetwood until 2003, when it made up a sixth of the trips carried out. Prior to that year, 100 mm and 80 mm gear represented the most frequently used mesh sizes. The figures represent averages, and there is considerable variability seen between individual vessels and individual months of the year.

However ministers have not yet approved the programme of events, conferences and seminars that will be held next year.

 Opium poppy cultivation is s a growing and complex problem in Afghanistan. It is widely expected that the United Nations Office of Drug Control and Crime (UNODC) 2004 poppy survey will show a substantial increase in poppy cultivation and opium production from the previous year. Many Afghan farmers are locked into growing opium poppy as the only means of repaying debts, accessing land, earning cash income and providing security for themselves and their families. To promote the availability of alternative livelihoods and rural development in Afghanistan, DFID is supporting a number of initiatives through individual funded projects and support for Afghan Government and United Nations programmes.

<a name="stpa_85">An example of the key role DFID is playing is the way we are working with the Afghan Government and International donor community to help communities develop their own livelihoods through the Afghan National Solidarity Programme. To date, the programme has provided US$36 million to 3,775 village development projects. In the Yakdharu village in the Badakhshan province, for example, democratically elected development councils agreed to spend the grant provided through the National Solidarity Programme on establishing micro-hydro electric power from the village stream. As a result the villagers now have an asset that provides sustainable electricity to the whole community and a surplus to supply surrounding villages, generating an additional income for the community. The success of this project has encouraged the community to invest their own money into other infrastructure projects and a seed bank using the community development council mechanism. DFID has committed &#163;13 million to the National Solidarity Programme, which is planned to cover all 20,000 villages in Afghanistan by 2007.

 A child protection register is a central register which is maintained for each area covered by a social services department. The register should list all the children resident in the area (including those who have been placed there by another local authority or agency) who are considered to be at continuing risk of significant harm, and for whom there is a child protection plan.

<a name="qnpa_21">Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999) sets out that the principal purpose of the register is to make agencies and professionals aware of those children who are judged to be at continuing risk of significant harm and in need of active safeguarding.

It is essential, therefore, that both police and health professionals have access to the register through the custodian of the register both in and outside office hours.

<a name="qnpa_23">The Government explained, in Keeping Children Safe (2003), its response to the Victoria Climbi&#233; report that we will phase out the child protection register as the ICS is introduced. The ICS will hold all the necessary information about the child, including whether any child protection inquires under section 47 of the Children Act 1989 have ever been undertaken about the child, whether they are considered to be in ongoing need of protection, and whether they have a child protection plan.

Notes:<br>

1. The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

2. 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted line. In 2002&#150;03 the combined LEA and school based expenditure is calculated by Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE) plus line 60 NCE (with adjustments to income to take account of School Standards Grant and Standards Fund scored here) plus lines 61 to 74 NCE. For 2001&#150;02 and earlier years 



the expenditure is calculated as line 27 NCE after recharges for columns (b) to (f) and (h) plus line 15 from the remaining continuing education columns (g, i and j). This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br>

3. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included for 1999&#150;2000 onwards. Other LEA maintained pupils are also included in the pupil count and this includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the Authority for whom the Authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the Authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

4. Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of moneys from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99. The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

5. In 2002&#150;03 the combined LEA and school based unit cost for England showed a cash terms increase of 5 per cent. compared with a 10 per cent. increase in 2001&#150;02. This is in part due to known misreporting of funding by some LEAs which had the estimated effect of reducing the 2002&#150;03 England unit cost by around 50 per pupil (in cash terms). Manchester was one of the LEAs who had suspected funding in their income column and consequently it is likely that the true figure for 2002&#150;03 will be higher than the &#163;3,820 quoted here.<br>

6. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

7. Data are a reported in cash terms as submitted by the LEA on their section 52 statement.<br>

 In 1998 we commissioned KPMG to construct a business case showing whether a move from legal aid to Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) in a range of personal injury cases could result over a 10 year period in financial viability. The work suggested all law firms could maintain their business using CFAs subject to their management skills and that firms might do well if they specialised. Since then we have focused our research on the outcome for consumers of using CFAs as a form of litigation funding and a new report by Professor Fenn, Dr. Gray and Dr. Rickman is due in early 2005.

 The domestic violence provisions were first introduced as a concession in 1999 and were reviewed after they had been in force for two years.

 The domestic violence provision in the Immigration Rules is there to protect victims of violence who have been admitted or given leave to remain in this country as a spouse and who would otherwise have a legitimate expectation of settlement at the end of their probationary period.

 The movement of skilled foreign workers into the UK is not a new phenomenon and has always been essential to our economy. For the UK to continue to be able to compete effectively in a global economy it is vital that employers are able to recruit workers with the skills they need to remain competitive, where those cannot be met from within the UK and wider EU workforce.

 Until the recent introduction of legislation specifically criminalising trafficking, prosecutions for trafficking have been for a variety of associated offences. These include amongst others facilitation of illegal entry, kidnap, false imprisonment and living off immoral earnings. The UK keeps detailed statistics on all court proceedings in a national database and publishes these on an annual basis. While information on convictions for all these offences is available, it is not possible to determine which of the prosecutions for associated offences related to cases of trafficking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w37.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_250">We have recently introduced legislation to criminalise trafficking comprehensively. We introduced an offence of trafficking for prostitution in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This was replaced by more wide-ranging offences of trafficking for sexual exploitation in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. A new offence, of &quot;trafficking for exploitation&quot;, which includes, for example, trafficking for forced labour and the removal of organs, has also been included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. All these offences carry a tough 14 year maximum sentence. We are starting to see charges brought for the offences in the 2002 Act and 2003 Act but are not yet aware of any successful prosecutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w37.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_251">We are committed to supporting effective enforcement action against trafficking. Reflex, a multi-agency taskforce, was set up in 2000 to deal with organised immigration crime, including trafficking.

<a name="41117w37.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_252">We are seeing successful disruptions and prosecutions of cases of human trafficking including cases which have involved women trafficked from Moldova. In February 2004 three people were convicted of offences relating to the trafficking of women from Moldova and Lithuania to work in the London vice trade. The principal defendant was convicted of controlling prostitutes and false imprisonment and sentenced to six years imprisonment.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_253">Another example is the case of Luan Plakici. Plakici was involved in the trafficking of women from Romania and Moldova into prostitution.

<p><a name="st_339"><a name="41117w37.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The UK recognises that illegal migration, trafficking and smuggling of human beings and other cross-border problems are international issues which require international solutions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w37.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_254">The Government are fully engaged with key EU and international partners in tackling illegal migration. Work in this field includes bilateral negotiations with key source countries for asylum applications and illegal immigrants as part of continued action to reduce illegal flows and tackling the criminals involved. There is also much work under way on illegal migration within the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w37.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_255">Within the current EU agenda this includes: the incorporation of biometrics into visas and EU nationals&#039; passports; an EU Border Agency to co-ordinate member states joint action at the EU external borders; development of the Immigration Liaison Officers network and new databases to facilitate sharing of information. These different work strands will enable the EU to adopt a more intelligence-led, outcome-focussed policy towards illegal immigration. The Government supports the direction, which this work is taking, as set out in the new five-year work programme on Justice and Home Affairs (the &quot;Hague Programme&quot;).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w37.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_256">The Government continues to emphasise the importance of working with third countries to improve the management of migratory flows, addressing the factors that force people to leave their countries and preventing illegal immigration, including people smuggling and trafficking. This requires a coherent and comprehensive approach, working with source and transit countries and EU and bilateral action.

From April 2003 -March 2004 there were 38 disruptions of criminal networks, and 38 convictions of smugglers and traffickers involved in organised immigration crime at level 3. This Financial year there have been 18 disruptions.

<a name="stpa_264">We have already introduced legislation comprehensively to criminalise trafficking. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 made trafficking for the purposes of prostitution a specific offence for the first time. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced new more wide-ranging offences covering trafficking into, out of or within the UK for any form of sexual offence. We have now also introduced offences covering other forms of exploitation, for example, trafficking for forced labour and the removal of organs, in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. All these trafficking offences have a tough maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.

Between April 2003 and April 2004 Reflex resulted in 38 disruptions and 38 convictions for organised immigration crime, this figure includes those involved in human trafficking as well as people smuggling and related activities.

<a name="stpa_265">We also recognise the importance of providing protection for the victims of trafficking in order to encourage them to co-operate with the authorities. The Government are therefore also working with the voluntary sector and law enforcement agencies to secure support for adult victims of trafficking. In March 2003, in conjunction with the voluntary sector, we launched a Home Office funded pilot scheme to provide safe accommodation and support for adult female victims of trafficking for the purposes of prostitution. Pending full evaluation of the pilot, the Home Office has agreed to continue funding the scheme during 2004&#150;05. We will use the period up to April 2005 to consider in detail the evaluation evidence and to take decisions as to the type and extent of support needed in the future.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the reasons for the recently recorded increase in violent crime; and what steps he will take to reverse the trend.  [194863]</p>








<p><a name="st_390"><a name="41117w42.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 With regard to violent crime, the British Crime Survey (BCS), which is considered to be a more reliable indicator of trends in violence than recorded crime, showed there were six per cent. fewer violent crimes in the 12 months to June 2004 compared with the previous year. Over the longer term, the BCS shows that violent crime has fallen by 26 per cent. between 1997 and 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w42.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_308">It is true that the recorded crime figures recently published showed an increase of 11 per cent. in April-June compared with the equivalent quarter a year earlier. However, it is important to remember that recorded crime data are affected by changes in reporting and recording. With regard to reporting, the BCS estimates that the proportion of violent crimes reported to the police has increased each year since 1999, from 35 per cent. in 1999 to 42 per cent. in 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w42.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_309">The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 led to an increase in the number of violent offences recorded by the police. An analysis of the impact of NCRS, both nationally and for individual forces, was published in two companion volumes to &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2002&#150;03&quot;. Both volumes are available on the Home Office website. The volume covering the national picture is available at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/rdsolr3103.pdf and the volume covering individual forces is available at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/rdsolr3203.pdf

<a name="stpa_310">The reports said that the impact for offences of violence against the person was 23 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 but also said that there was evidence that the effect was continuing and that there would be a further increase irrespective of any real changes in the level of violent crime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41117w42.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_311">Data from individual police forces suggests that the data audits following the introduction of the NCRS has encouraged increased recording, particularly for minor violence.

There were nearly 140,000 as at August 2004&#151;an increase of 12,570 since March 1997. There were also 4,094 police community support officers in August 2004. On 31 March 2004 there were 67,597 police (support) staff and 10,988 special constables.

<a name="stpa_313">Low level thuggery is being tackled by measures to reduce alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour. Almost half of violent crime is alcohol-related. The Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy sets out how we intend to address the problems associated with alcohol, building on the good practice already developed by the police, local authorities and the drinks industry. This summer some 80 local areas have taken part in a campaign focusing on those who sell alcohol to under 18s, bars and clubs who promote irresponsible and rowdy behaviour, and drunken yobs who cause violence on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_314">We are following this up with a programme which will help local areas reduce violent crime and improve partnership working at the local level. In the first instance the programme will take place in six police force areas who are already delivering solutions to violent crime; it will begin in November and further areas will join the programme later. We are focusing in the first instance on those areas with the largest proportion of more serious violence.

<a name="stpa_315">Domestic violence and sexual offences, including those against children, are also being tackled. The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill is currently going through Parliament and contains a number of measures which will improve protection offered to victims and sits at the heart of a wide-ranging programme of work.

 The School Improvement Programme, launched in 1998, includes a wide range of measures aimed at supporting all schools in making the improvements they themselves have identified. In curricular terms, the programme has focused on improving literacy and numeracy through a comprehensive in-service training and support programme for all schools delivered by bespoke curriculum support staff employed by the education and library boards. However, it also includes a specific initiative (the School Support Programme) aimed at tackling low and underachievement, particularly in areas of social need such as inner city areas. This involves financial and professional support for targeted schools, normally addressing areas such as the quality of teaching and learning, school leadership, and school development planning and target-setting. The schools themselves are closely involved in determining their own priority areas for development, and they often choose to address organisational areas for improvement through focusing more intensively on raising standards of literacy and numeracy.

Between 3rd March 2003 and 19th September 2004, EDS were paid &#163;62.08 million in service charges.

The pension credit application line (freephone 0800 991234), which is the main method of applying, is working well and at the end of September had taken around 4.66 million calls since it became operational on 7 April 2003. The pension service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances. We have made minor improvements to the application process in the light of experience and will continue to do so, although there are no current plans for a fundamental review.

 Reclustering was a series of boundary changes to facilitate the delivery of a more efficient service to our customers. The principal rationale behind reclustering was the need for local service to become better aligned with its key local authority partners, and to streamline its management structures to ensure that as many local service resources as possible are focused on front line service delivery. This process involved some local service clusters merging with others but none were withdrawn. As a percentage of the overall staffing for The Pension Service, the numbers for local service will proportionately make up a larger percentage of the overall organisation.

 The full range of operations of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have been reviewed regularly, including an assessment of its independence. For example, a value-for-money audit was conducted by the National Audit Office (NAO). Its findings were presented in January 2003. Among other things, the NAO examined the measures in place to manage potential conflicts of members of the advisory committees.

In its response to the Committee, the Government agreed with the analysis that the research evidence on costs of care is weak and the data complex.
