 The overall Council Agenda for 2004&#150;06 is set out in the Multi-Annual Strategic Programme and the UK-Luxembourg Annual Operating Programme (AOP) for 2005, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. The agenda for the UK Presidency will be determined, to a large extent, by the agenda we inherit from the Luxembourg Presidency and their progress on the dossiers identified in the Multi-Annual Strategic Programme and the Annual Operating Programme.

<p>
<a name="50125w01.html_para0">
Consistent with the Government&#039;s priorities of promoting better regulation, sustainable development and economic reform in the EU, the key priorities in the agriculture sector in 2005 will be: to contribute to progress of the WTO development round, particularly through reform of the sugar sector; and make progress on the Rural Development regulation and the regulation on CAP financing, if these have not been concluded beforehand.

<p><a name="50125w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 While the projections published by DTI in November 2004 confirmed that, on the basis of existing policy measures, we were on track to go well beyond our Kyoto Protocol commitment, they also showed that we were only likely to achieve a 14 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w01.html_para5">
The shortfall is because projected emissions were higher than previous estimates due mainly to lower nuclear generation, higher electricity demand and higher coal generation and because the measures to reduce emissions were in aggregate expected to deliver less than originally anticipated. The current review of the UK&#039;s Climate Change Programme will consider what additional measures are needed to close the gap.

<p><a name="50125w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the state of the UK&#039;s coral reefs; and what future changes she expects to see due to climate change.  [209279]</p>




<p><a name="50125w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 January 2005]:</i> The UK has a small number of known cold-water coral reefs. The best studied of these is the Darwin Mounds some 150 km off the north-west coast of Scotland. When last surveyed in 2000, there was evidence of damage from bottom trawling. The UK sought, and was granted in 2003, emergency European Commission measures to restrict this type of fishing and so avoid further damage to the reef. The emergency measures were made permanent in 2004. It is hoped that surveys in 2005 will enable the condition of other possible reefs to be checked.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w01.html_para10">
It is not certain what the full effects of global warming will be on the seas of the UK although it seems unlikely that warming of the seas will be great enough to affect cold-water corals in the short to medium future. Deep-water reefs are less likely to be affected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w01.html_para11">
The rise in CO <sub>2</sub>  in the atmosphere is likely to cause a rise in acidity of surface waters, and affect the amount of calcium carbonate used by coral reefs for growth in shallow waters. How these predicted effects in shallower waters will affect deeper waters is not known, but any decreases in amounts of available calcium carbonate will not be beneficial to coral reefs.

<a name="50125w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Cormorants</h3>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to what level the <i>(a)</i> UK and <i>(b)</i> English population of the cormorant would need to fall (i) in the breeding season and (ii) in winter for the Government to decide that it was no longer meeting its obligations for this species under the EU Birds Directive.  [209811]</p>




<p><a name="50125w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s obligation under the Birds Directive is to ensure that measures taken under the directive do not worsen the initial status of the species protected. The directive was made in 1979 and although no accurate figures for wintering or breeding cormorant numbers are available for this date, it is 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Jan 2005 : Column 210W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
generally accepted from monitoring of trends that wintering numbers in Britain have increased around four-fold since that date. These are our legal obligations. However, we have no intention of allowing the cormorant population to be reduced to anything approaching this level and the current policy, which aims to resolve cormorant/fishery conflicts at problem sites, will balance the interests of fisheries with the sustainable conservation status of the cormorant.

<p><a name="50125w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Importers and suppliers of food and feed have the responsibility for ensuring that only GM material approved under relevant EU legislation are imported into the EU and supplied through the food and feed chain.

<p><a name="50125w02.html_spnew6"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Government are not in a position to impose mandatory environmental standards specific to housing in the Milton Keynes South Midlands sub-region as the boundaries of the growth areas do not have any legal status.

 UK companies that operate overseas are subject to the laws applicable in those countries which will take account of the particular circumstances and practices of each host country. We encourage companies to apply high standards of corporate behaviour by addressing their environmental and social impacts wherever they operate, including adhering to relevant internationally agreed norms and initiatives. In line with this, we promote the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which recommend standards of responsible business conduct for businesses operating in or from the 37 adhering countries and will be writing to the FTSE 100 companies to raise awareness of these expectations. We have also set out our approach to encouraging environmentally and socially responsible practice internationally in our draft international strategic framework on Corporate Social Responsibility.

<p><a name="50125w07.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The report &quot;The Influence of the School in the decision to participate in learning post-16&quot; indicated a number of reasons why the provision of a sixth form within a school might be an important influence on the decision of young people to participate in post-16 education and training:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(i) &quot;Schools with sixth forms have a ready made post-16 route and pupils are more channelled in their choices and decisions.&quot; Such schools often actively promoting post-16 academic routes, compared to other forms of post-16 participation which were much less clearly promoted. In schools with no sixth form there was a greater element of choice and decisions were aimed more generally at providing students with opportunities that more adequately addressed their needs.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(ii) &quot;Careers advice in schools with sixth forms was found to be qualitatively different from that in 11 to 16 schools.&quot; Pupils attending 11 to 16 schools were more positive about the careers education they had received and often exposed to a rich network of information, guidance and advice from diverse sources. Pupils in schools with sixth forms felt their advice and guidance to be less impartial than those in schools with no sixth form. Schools with sixth forms tended to have a strong academic tradition and a focus on university entrance, and an expectation that students would continue in full-time education post-16 which may not be the right decision for the young people concerned.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(iii) &quot;There was a greater tendency in schools with a sixth form to provide post-16 advice and guidance which is more closely related to academic sixth form provision.&quot; Knowledge about post-16 provision in schools and colleges tended to be strongest among pupils in schools with sixth forms and weakest in schools with no sixth forms. The opposite was true about knowledge of post-16 training and labour markets.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w07.html_para3">
Other important influential issues of the school &quot;in the decision of young people to participate in learning post-16&quot; were the socio-economic environment of the school, and the schools&#039; culture, ethos and leadership.

The UNODC figures for 1999, 2000 and 2001 were recorded under the Taliban regime. The low level of cultivation and low production figure in 2001 reflect the Taliban ban on opium cultivation; the ban did not however address the underlying causes of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, which was enforced with a mix of threat and bribery and drove up the price of opium, benefiting those with opium stockpiles.

It would further need to be shown that the resulting emissions reductions were &quot;additional&quot; (i.e. going beyond what would have happened in the absence of the project) and calculated in accordance with an approved CDM methodology. To date, the Department for International Development (DFID) has not received any requests from developing countries to provide assistance to extinguish coal mine fires. We would encourage any country seeking international support to consider using the CDM.

 The Government of Iraq has said that it is committed over the medium term, to enhancing the effectiveness of social safety nets in Iraq by moving from a food ration system, which handed out virtually free food to the entire population of Iraq, to a cash distribution system targeted at the poor and unemployed. The aim will be to help domestic agriculture, encourage private trade and remove price distortions, at the same time as ensuring that families in need are properly safeguarded. The details have yet to be determined, and are expected to be followed up by the Iraqi Transitional Government after the forthcoming elections. DFID supports the reform in principle. DFID staff and advisers will continue to maintain contact with the Iraqi authorities, and with interested international organisations including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World Food Programme, to ensure that the interests of poor and vulnerable families in Iraq are protected.

 Mauritania is poor and often short of its food staples. A high proportion of the population relies on agricultural production to satisfy its food and income needs. During prolonged drought, communities may go hungry through poor yields or lack of recourse to alternative sources of income. In 2004 Mauritania 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Jan 2005 : Column 253W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
was badly affected by the worst invasion of locusts in West Africa for 15 years. Millet and legumes suffered serious damage; sorghum and rice were less affected. Access to food is already posing problems for many households, both rural and urban, which are directly or indirectly affected by the crisis. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that 2004 production will only amount to 64 per cent. of the 5-year average. More food imports, including food aid, may be required. DFID stands ready to contribute to urgent humanitarian needs in Mauritania, and other countries in West Africa.

DFID provided &#163;1.5 million to the FAO&#039;s emergency international appeal for locust control and eradication operations in West Africa in 2004.

The European Commission is providing &#8364;23.5 million (&#163;16.33 million, UK share about &#163;3 million) to assist those countries worst affected. The FAO operations may need to be continued in northern Mauritania to counter remaining immature swarms gathered there, and also in the Mahgreb countries until the spring, to reduce the scale of potential re-infestation of the Sahel in summer 2005.

 The UN World Food Programme (WFP) appeal for US$30.8 million for Mauritania issued on 17 January aims to provide food aid to 400,000 people in 33 of the most vulnerable communities until 2007. About 60 per cent. of the proposal is for creation of productive assets through food for work activities, the construction of small dams, and improving village water supplies. These activities may be useful, but DFID believes that the sustained developmental impact of food aid is limited.

DFID does not have a bilateral development partnership with Mauritania, but does provide a significant amount through multilateral channels, mainly the EC programme, of which the UK share amounted to some &#163;6 million in 2003.

 In response to the tsunami disaster which followed the earthquake in South East Asia, the Department for International Development has committed &#163;75 million towards the immediate and medium term needs. This assistance is being channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement, non-governmental organisations and by DFID direct action. Of this, &#163;40 million has been pledged as the UK contribution to the UN flash appeal. Requests for support from non-governmental organisations are still being received and we are continuing our direct action in support of priority needs. We estimate that the combined value of these will be about &#163;25 million. The balance is being provided through the Red Cross, local initiatives being considered by DFID country offices, and the Ministry of Defence to cover the marginal costs of their operation.

<p><a name="50125w19.html_wqn0"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what consultation he has had with beggars in drawing up measures to tackle the problem of begging;  [206583]
</p>



<p>(2) how the Department measures the effectiveness of the use of powers to deal with begging;  [206588]
</p>



<p>(3) if he will make a statement on the measures which are in place to deal with the problem of begging;  [206591]
</p>



<p>(4) if he will make a statement on the alternatives to using the criminal justice system to tackle the problem of begging.  [206592]</p>




<p><a name="50125w19.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 We need to ensure that we address the underlying causes of those who beg. If we help those who beg because of drug use to get access to effective treatment we help them, help communities and help those intimidated by begging. Better use of enforcement powers and alternative giving schemes will help to address the underlying and immediate problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para0">
Begging is already a criminal offence, by making the offence of begging recordable the offender&#039;s details will be entered on the police national computer and there are powers to enable the offender to be finger-printed. This enables the police to identify repeat offenders and the courts will be able to issue community sentences, rather than fines, for those convicted a fourth time for an offence. This may include drug treatment. Since the end of July this year, begging has been included as a trigger offence under the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme. This will mean that those charged with begging will be drug tested and will enhance their opportunities for the underlying causes of their behaviour to be addressed and to route out repeat offending by offering treatment.

<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para1">
Members of the public often find begging intimidating. A MORI survey carried out in August 2003 for the Antisocial Behaviour Unit at the Home Office found that two thirds of respondents resent being approached by those who beg and over half will not use a cash point if someone is begging near it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para2">
The Antisocial Behaviour Unit at the Home Office are working with five areas around the country: Brighton, Bristol, Camden, Westminster and Leeds to tackle begging.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para3">
The approach developed in these areas involves a &#039;twin track&#039; approach of enforcement and support; addressing the underlying causes of begging such as drugs as well as taking enforcement action when people don&#039;t heed advice or offers of support.
</p>


<p>

Initial findings from the trailblazing areas indicate a reduction in begging and positive outcomes for former beggars. More detailed findings from these areas will emerge in March 2006.

<p><a name="50125w19.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Home Office currently publishes annual total crime statistics recorded by the police in England and Wales for the following offences specifically relating to business crime; robbery of business property, theft by an employee, theft from shops and theft of an automatic machine or meter. The most recent figures are available in Statistical Bulletin 10/04 &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2003&#150;04&quot; at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/crimeew0304.html.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para5">
However, we recognise that these figures provide a limited picture of the true nature of crimes experienced by the business sector. We are also aware that businesses do not report every incidence of crime for a variety of reasons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para6">
Bearing this in mind, on 26 November, the Home Office also published the initial findings of the 2002 Commercial Victimisation Survey. This provided further information on the actual levels of business crime as well as an indication of the proportion of businesses which report the crimes that they suffer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w19.html_para7">
The Home Office Business Crime Team is also looking at how current information on business crime, including retail crime, can be enhanced, in particular, whether it is feasible to identify crimes against businesses in police recorded crime statistics through a pilot with South Wales.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his Department has conducted a risk assessment of <i>(a)</i> the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, <i>(b)</i> the timing of the introduction of the National Offender Management Service and <i>(c)</i> the reorganisation of the courts.  [209650]</p>




<p><a name="50125w20.html_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Risk assessments have been carried out on implementation of Criminal Justice Act 2003 (CJA) and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Change Programme. They considered the risks to the programme posed by a variety of factors, including timing and considered the likelihood and consequences of any such risks materialising. The resulting risk registers also detail the actions required to ensure that the consequences of any risk is minimised. These actions are being taken forward by the appropriate Directors. Risk management is supported by the NOMS Programme Office and overseen by the NOMS Programme and Executive Board. These feed into wider Home Office risk management procedures.

A Risk Assessment on the re-organisation of the courts has been carried out by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). The DCA established the Unified Courts Administration Programme (UCAP) to implement the re-organisation of the courts and to manage associated risks at area and regional levels.

 Erkin Guney was investigated and convicted on 23 July 1996 for possession of heroin with intent to supply and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. He received a 14 year prison sentence.

The MPS referred the complaint to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) who agreed to supervise an MPS investigation into that complaint. The IPCC took over the supervision of the case on 1 April 2004 from the PCA.

 Contestability is the principle that best quality and best value for money in the supervision, punishment and care of offenders will be achieved through ensuring that all appropriate services are opened up to competition with other providers. We want the most effective and efficient services for offenders both in prison and in the community whether these are provided by the public, private, voluntary or &quot;not for profit&quot; sectors.

<p><a name="50125w22.html_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Custodial penalties are enforced and administered within the private and public sector prisons system. Community penalties are enforced and administered largely under arrangements made by local probation boards and with electronic monitoring contractors. Provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will introduce tougher requirements for the courts when dealing with breaches of community orders. The Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill, currently before Parliament, includes provisions further to develop offender management within the National Offender Management Service. Measures include extended powers to direct the contracting out of

Financial penalties are enforced by the magistrates courts. The Department for Constitutional Affairs&#039; Enforcement Programme is delivering a wide programme of change aimed at improving the enforcement and administration of financial penalties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w22.html_para3">
Most fixed penalty notices are enforced by prosecution or by the registration of a fine against a recipient who fails to pay the penalty or request a court hearing within the specified time. Registered fines are then enforced by the magistrates court in the same way as any other fine. For road traffic offences, consideration for prosecution follows when the endorsement of the statutory penalty points would result in disqualification. There are no plans to change this process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w22.html_para4">
Fixed penalty notices for road traffic offences and disorder are administered through a computer system which operates in both police forces and magistrates courts. There are no plans to change this arrangement, although the computer systems will need upgrading in the medium term. Certain changes to the fixed penalty system are proposed in the Road Safety Bill currently before Parliament. These are designed essentially to enable road traffic fixed penalty notices to be given to those who do not hold a GB driving licence and counterpart and to enable more effective enforcement against those who cannot prove an address in the UK.

 The Police Standards Unit (PSD) has been working with Northamptonshire Police since the spring of 2004.

The PSU is part-funding consultants who are working with the force to ensure that the NPM is implemented with minimum disruption, and that the focus on performance is vigorously maintained.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers there were in Hertfordshire in <i>(a)</i> 1995 and <i>(b)</i> 2004; and if he will make a statement on the percentage change in funding of the police service during that period.  [207569]</p>




<p><a name="50125w23.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 On 31 March 1995 there were 1,703 police officers in the Hertfordshire Constabulary. The latest figure, for 31 August 2004, is 2,124 officers, an increase of 421, or 24.7 per cent. officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w23.html_para0">
The increase in officer numbers and funding for Hertfordshire Police Authority was affected by changes to the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) on 1 April 2000, when parts of the Metropolitan Police District were transferred to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. The effects of the boundary changes were incorporated into the police funding formula and the overall transfer was in terms of financial resources, not officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w23.html_para1">
However, 183 MPS officers were seconded to Hertfordshire on 1 April 2000 for up to two years to assist with policing while Hertfordshire Constabulary arranged to recruit its own officers for the expanded force area.

In addition to general Government grants, Hertfordshire Police Authority has also benefited from specific grants for targeted programmes, first introduced in 2000&#150;01, such as the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF), to increase and maintain the number of police officers. Hertfordshire has had CFF funding to support the recruitment of 113 additional police officers.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the work that the Police Standards Unit has undertaken with Nottinghamshire police; and what estimate he has made of the cost of such work.  [207341]</p>




<p><a name="50125w24.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 January 2005]:</i> The Police Standards Unit (PSU) has been working with Nottinghamshire police since the spring of 2003. Developed in close liaison with Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary, there is now a mature and comprehensive programme of work in place aimed at supporting the force to reduce and better investigate crime through delivering performance improvements in operational and organisational areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w24.html_para0">
The key areas of PSU work with the force are on improving capacity for forensics, intelligence-led policing (with a particular focus on drugs and major crime), performance management, and on tackling persistent offenders. PSD is also working with the force on management of serious crime, sanction detections, and tackling violent crime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w24.html_para1">
In addition to the investment of time from PSU staff, the total cost of PSU&#039;s work with Nottinghamshire police to date has been &#163;2.4million. This funding has been divided between provision of staff (including extra Scenes of Crime Officers and a drugs manager), infrastructure (e.g. provision of hardware) and consultancy support (e.g. on the force&#039;s performance management framework).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w24.html_para2">
Nottinghamshire police have achieved significant reductions in crime during the time that PSU have been working with them. For example, according to the latest figures from the force, over the last 12 months the number of domestic burglaries has fallen by 23 per cent., robberies by 26 pre cent. and vehicle crimes by 15 per cent., when compared to the previous 12 months.

Her Majesty&#039;s Prison Service introduced a mandatory annual fitness test for all new Prison Officers joining the service after 2 April 2001.

The reason for the multistage fitness test change was based on advice taken from Loughborough University who said that the minimum level of VO2m for a Prison Officer was 34.7, which equated to level 6.5 on a 20-metre bleep test.

The grip test was reduced due to the Prison Service changing its testing equipment with the original dyno-meter being was much more user friendly and suited a smaller hand. The change to the dyno-meters was made due to the high cost of repair (they had to be sent to America) as they worked on a hydraulic system that continually leaked.

Note:<br>

Contracted-out rebates for appropriate personal pensions are set at a level intended to reflect the value of the SERPS/State Second Pension benefit given up. SERPS was introduced in 1978 and so affected employed earners born in 1962 or later(i.e. those aged 40 in 2002&#150;03. So, for those born before 1962, successively younger people have a lower SERPS/state second pension accrual rate. As a result, although the rebate for any one individual increases year on year until the cap bites, someone aged 46 in 2003&#150;04 would have received a lower rebate rate in that year than someone aged 46 received in the preceding tax year.<br>

 A recent amendment of European Union Directive 2000/13/EC on ingredient listing will require the declaration of all ingredients including allergens on pre-packed food from November 2005. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) consulted on the new requirements and the representations received indicated wide support for the new rules from allergy support groups and food manufacturers. In addition, a number of respondents identified the need for better control of the use of &quot;may contain&quot; allergen labelling, and the need for the provision of more allergen information for foods sold loose and in catering establishments. The FSA is actively considering with key stakeholders how best to encourage the provision of clearer, more helpful allergen information in these cases.

 Prior to 27 September 2004, ethylmercury was present in the combined diphtheria, tetanus and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTwP) in the form of the preservative thiomersal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125w34.html_para2">
This change was made because the low risk of importation of polio in the United Kingdom provided the opportunity to move from the use of a live polio vaccine to an inactivated polio vaccine as well as the availability of an acellular pertussis vaccine which was as effective as the previous whole-cell pertussis. Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine does not contain (and never has contained) thiomersal.

There is no credible scientific evidence that demonstrates a mechanism through which thiomersal in DTP could interact with MMR.
