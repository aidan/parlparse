 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> No formal assessment has been made of the number of farm businesses in receipt of compensation during the foot and mouth epidemic which have since <i>(a)</i> been sold and <i>(b)</i> ceased to trade. However, an informal survey conducted by the Department in February 2002 suggested that 6 per cent. of farmers whose animals had been infected with foot and mouth disease intend to move out of farming.

<a name="20611w01.html_wqn1"><B> Angus Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the mandate of the EU Committee for the adaptation to scientific and technical progress and implementation of the directives on waste is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; when it is next due to meet; what the UK representation on it is; whether any experts nominated by the Scottish Executive <i>(a)</i> have been and <i>(b)</i> are members of it; and if she will make a statement.  [60390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Committee's mandate is determined by Articles 17 and 18 of the Waste Framework Directive, Article 9 of the Hazardous Waste Directive and Article 11 of the End-Of-Life Vehicles Directive. In summary, its mandate is to assist the European Commission to adapt aspects of those Directives in the light of scientific and technical progress.
<P>

<a name="20611w01.html_para0">The Committee met on 6 July 2001, 30 January 2002 and 22 May 2002. The UK's representation is determined by the agenda for each meeting but the basic representation is usually two officials.
<P>

<a name="20611w01.html_para1">The Scottish Executive have not nominated any experts to attend the Committee's meetings. However, my officials work closely with the Scottish Executive on waste management issues, including those dealt with by the Committee.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> The EU Landfill Directive bans the landfilling of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Liquid waste.
<P>
<BR>
Waste which in the conditions of landfill is explosive, oxidising, corrosive, flammable or highly flammable.
<P>
<BR>
Chemical substances from R&D or teaching, e.g. unidentified or new laboratory residues whose effects on man or the environment are not known.
<P>
<BR>
Hospital and other clinical wastes arising from medical or veterinary establishments which are infectious.
<P>
<BR>
Whole used tyres from 2003 and shredded used tyres from 2006.
<P>
<BR>
Any waste that does not fulfil the waste acceptance criteria.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20611w01.html_para2">Some of the wastes banned from landfill are not generally landfilled at present. For those that are, research for the Department concluded that there were sufficient alternative disposal systems (in use or planned) to cope with the large volume of organic process waste streams requiring diversion from landfill. Examples given included:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pyrolysis and gasification&#151;commissioned in some major industrial sites already.
<P>
<BR>
Merchant treatment plants for organic wastes offering pre-treatment, such as air stripping or pH balancing.
<P>
<BR>
Existing landfill leachate plant could treat a range of aqueous organic waste streams, further developments could provide a wider range of outlets for organic wastes.
<P>
<BR>
Some water companies are encouraging greater use of their spare capacity in aerobic and anaerobic treatment systems
<P>
<BR>
Solvent recovery plants have some spare capacity and are planning investment to recover useful materials from aqueous feedstock.
<P>
<BR>
High temperature incineration.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20611w01.html_para3">The report suggested additional facilities might be required for oily wastes, contaminated soils, and inorganic chemical wastes.
<P>

<a name="20611w01.html_para4">The Government are also working in partnership with the tyre industry through the Used Tyre Working Group (UTWG) investigating alternative disposal, recycling and recovery options for those tyres displaced from landfill with the aim of ensuring that sufficient capacity is available to handle those tyres displaced from landfill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to rationalise the main funding schemes in the uplands to provide a simplified system of support for farmers in these areas.  [59705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food recommended that the long-term aim for less favoured area support should be an integrated tiered payment scheme reflecting environmental and social benefits, actual cost of landscape, wildlife and access maintenance and the economic difficulties of traditional hill farming. The Government will take full account of this recommendation in reviewing the hill farm allowance and the current agri-environment schemes. In addition, plans are being drawn up for a small farmers scheme which will provide a simplified claims procedure for small farmers in the uplands and lowlands.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> Accurate estimates of the value of jobs in the inshore fishing industry are not available. Vessels under 10 metres in length comprise most of the UK inshore fleet, and Table 1 shows the value of landings made by these vessels for 1997 to 2001. The available data on jobs in the fishing industry cover only numbers of fishermen working on vessels. The information is given in Table 2; information for vessels under 10 metres is available only for England and Wales.

<P>
<a name="20611w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was created in June 2001 from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and parts of the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="20611w01.html_para5">In relation to MAFF in 1997 there were nine regional service centres carrying out work for the Ministry. There were also three regional areas for the State Veterinary Service, and offices in Scotland and Wales. The counties for each of these offices are laid out in the table. The unitary authorities are not included in this table due to the disproportionate cost of providing such information in the requested form.
<P>

<a name="20611w01.html_para6">On 1 April 2001 the regional service centres were dissolved and the Rural Development Service was established with eight regional offices to take forward the England Rural Development Programme. Since the creation of DEFRA in June 2001, the Government offices have also carried out work for my Department.
<P>

<a name="20611w01.html_para7">The details of the counties and unitary authorities for the regional offices of the Rural Development Service, the State Veterinary Service and the Government offices in 2002 are set out in the second table.

 <i>[holding answer 21 March 2002]:</i> The European Union Final Energy Demand by sector and by fuel in 1997 (Mtoe) indicated that 40.7 per cent. of final energy demand would come from buildings <sup>1</sup> . A further review by the European Union <sup>2</sup>  reviewed existing energy efficiency measures and identified buildings as a priority action area for the short and medium term. An action plan <sup>3</sup>  outlined ways to limit carbon dioxide emissions from buildings and to improve their energy efficiency.

<a name="20611w02.html_para0">In the UK, the residential and tertiary building sectors have been shown to be the largest overall end users of energy, mainly for heating, lighting, appliances and equipment. The energy consumed in buildings in the UK amounts to 46 per cent. of the national total (27 per cent. from the domestic sector and 19 per cent. from the

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The cost of sandbag deployment is highly variable and is not recorded separately from other costs of dealing with flooding emergencies. For example, in emergency situations, bags can be supplied full or empty. They may be filled manually on site or by bagging machines, if access to the problem area is easy. Alternatively, they may be filled at a central depot and transported by road or air, as for example occurred in the north-east during autumn 2000.

 There are no links between our humanitarian aid, which is managed outside of Government channels, and land reform. The UN already has a large presence in Zimbabwe implementing emergency programmes. This includes the presence of food programme monitors in 19 districts. Our aid for Zimbabwe is confined to humanitarian assistance, and the prevention and mitigation of HIV/AIDS.

<a name="20611w02.html_para4">Promotion of human rights is at the heart of our foreign policy. The Commission on Human Rights is the UN's main human rights forum. The UK is committed to playing a major role at CHR, and has been one of its most active and committed members since its inception in 1946. The recent session adopted over 100 resolutions on human rights issues. The UK actively supported over 70 of these. Particular achievements were resolutions on a draft optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture, the death penalty, rights of people with disabilities and rights of the child, and the Commission's condemnation of human rights violations in Burma, Iraq, Sudan, Cuba and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We were, however, disappointed by the lack of progress in some areas, including racism, and the reluctance of the Commission to condemn human rights violations in some parts of the world, including Zimbabwe, Iran and Chechnya. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addressed the plenary of this year's Commission on 18 April. A copy of his speech can be found on the FCO website.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> In implementing the working time directive in the maritime sector the UK, like several of its EU partners, has elected to apply the option within the directive of specifying the minimum hours of daily and weekly rest which must be provided to seafarers. The maximum number of hours which may be worked each day and each week can be calculated by reference to these minima.

 Traffic examiners (TEs) carry out weighings and check compliance with drivers' hours legislation as part of their duties. The vehicle inspectorate (VI) employed 175 TEs in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01. The number of TEs increased to 209 at the end of 2001&#150;02 in response to additional funding from the Road Haulage Forum. In addition to VI's network of permanent weighbridge sites, a number of mobile weighpads were introduced in 2000&#150;01 which have improved VI's ability to target its checks. Work will be done in 2002&#150;03 to test electronic tachograph analysis equipment which will improve the examiner's ability to detect drivers' hours and other offences.

<a name="20611w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Some months ago the Department undertook a review of the vehicle registration system in partnership with the insurance industry. Research was undertaken by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, University College London (JDI). The review examined ways of enhancing the accuracy of databases, improving enforcement arrangements and providing more reliable services to benefit all motorists. The JDI report made 11 recommendations. The first of these, the introduction of continuous registration, has already been accepted and enabling provisions have been included in the Finance Bill. The details of those provisions and the other recommendations will be discussed in detail with stakeholders prior to implementation. I have made available copies of the JDI report in the Library of the House.

 I refer the hon. Member to the regulatory impact assessment produced in support of the Railways (Interoperability) (High-Speed) Regulations 2002 implementing the high-speed interoperability directive, a copy of which was placed in the Libraries of the House on 25 April 2002.

<P>
<a name="20611w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the percentage of the possible costs for implementing the EU directives on interoperability on the high speed network, that will be borne by <i>(a)</i> the Government, <i>(b)</i> the successor to Railtrack, <i>(c)</i> the SRA, <i>(d)</i> freight rail companies and <i>(e)</i> passenger rail companies.  [60412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the potential allocation of costs arising from implementation of the high speed interoperability directive which does not, in itself, require projects to be initiated. However, new high speed projects will have to comply with the directive and, to the extent that this results in costs being incurred by network or train operators (which will vary from project to project), those costs will be taken into account in the railway funding and charging regime in the usual way.

 The Government have introduced a range of measures to encourage environmentally friendly buses.

<P>
<a name="20611w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government do not have any plans to change the rules about, or to prevent firms from taking, contribution holidays from their defined benefit pension schemes. Under Inland Revenue rules, pension funds that are funded in excess of 105 per cent. of their liabilities must take action to reduce that surplus. That action might take the form of improved benefits for members, contribution holidays for members or sponsoring employers, or a taxable return to the employer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> There is no target proportion of pupil days to be lost through absence for England. In the past local education authorities have only set targets for unauthorised absence through their Education Development plans. Local education authorities were asked to set new targets for the proportion of pupil days lost in their Education Development Plans this year, these targets will apply to the academic years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. Education Development Plans are published by local education authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Earlier this year we consulted publicly on a draft revised version of the guidance on the use of exclusion in our Circular 10&#150;99 'Social Inclusion: Pupil Support'. This made clear that the Secretary of State would normally regard it as inappropriate to reinstate a pupil permanently excluded for (among other things) persistent and defiant behaviour&#151;which would encompass bullying including racist bullying. All forms of bullying need to be dealt with firmly by schools. We cannot direct appeal panels to take particular decisions in particular cases, but we have made clear that they should also consider the impact that a reinstatement might have on other members of the school community.

To ask the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister what council tax and non-domestic rates collection rates were achieved by English billing authorities in 2001&#150;02.  [61296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am publishing today figures showing that English councils have collected an extra &#163;40 million in council taxes this year by simply improving on council tax collection rates. The figures show the good start of a joint initiative launched last year by us and the Local Government Association (LGA), to help poorly performing councils improve their collection rates.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para1">English councils had collected &#163;12.84 billion in council taxes for 2001&#150;02 by the end of March 2002. The figures represent 96.1 per cent. of the &#163;13.36 billion collectable. This is an increase of 0.3 per cent. on the previous year.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para2">We recognise that council tax collection has therefore improved slightly, and that many councils are making a great effort. However, half a billion pounds was still uncollected last year. We recognise that this is money that could have been spent on local services and we believe there is still room for improvement. The Council Tax Collection Help Team which we set up with the LGA last year will continue its work to identify and tackle barriers to better performance and encourage good practice.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para3">We also recognise that the in-year collection rate does not provide the full picture of the work authorities put in to collecting council tax. We will also be collecting and publishing authorities' levels of arrears and performance in collecting them.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para4">The councils showing the best improvements in their performance include Hackney Council, which improved its collection rate from 67.8 per cent. during 2000&#150;2001 to 74.0 per cent. this year, an increase of 6.2 percentage points; Lambeth Council, which improved its collection rate from 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 2002 : Column 1149W</I><P>
82.0 per cent. during 2000&#150;2001 to 86.5 per cent. this year, an increase of 4.5 percentage points; and Southwark Council, which improved its collection rate from 87.1 per cent. during 2000&#150;2001 to 90.2 per cent. this year, an increase of 3.1 percentage points.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para5">Other improving councils include North Hertfordshire, an increase of 2.8 percentage points, Waltham Forest, an increase of 2.6 percentage points, Castle Point, an increase of 2.5 percentage points, South Gloucestershire UA, an increase of 2.5 percentage points, and Oxford City, an increase of 2.4 percentage points.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para6">In addition, figures show that &#163;14.42 billion in non- domestic rates for 2001&#150;2002 had been collected by the end of March. This represents 97.9 per cent. of the &#163;14.74 billion collectable, an improvement of 0.5 percentage points on last year.

To ask the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister what plans his Department has to include in the Indices of Deprivation statistics on access to local services and public transport for those over 65 and 75 years in the most deprived wards; and whether indicators on age-related issues will be included in the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit's review of how the Indices of Deprivation may be developed.  [60623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Indices of Deprivation (ID 2000) has been developed to provide a measure of how deprived a particular area (ward or local authority district) is relative to the rest of the country.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para8">The current 'Access to Services' domain measures the extent to which people have poor geographical access to certain key services. Three of the indicators included in the domain (access to post offices, large food shops and doctors surgeries) measure geographical access to services for people on low incomes (ie claimants of means-tested benefits). As such, this will include pensioners who are eligible for income support payments.
<P>

<a name="20611w07.html_para9">The ID 2000 has been designed to reflect deprivation as experienced by all age groups, including the elderly. The forthcoming review on the further development of the indices will continue to maintain this objective.

<a name="20611w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not made an estimate of the cost of improving sound insulation for the existing housing stock. However, in a House of Lords ruling on two Appeal Court cases determined in 1999, it was estimated that the average cost of installing sound installation in the flats in question was &#163;8,000 per flat. The cost in any particular case would depend on the nature and extent of the work required.

<a name="20611w09.html_para0">The latest e-business strategies were submitted to the e-envoy during summer 2001. An analysis of the strategies revealed several common issues.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is a need for staff to gain necessary skills. Departments are tackling this in a number of ways with support from the centre. For example the office of the e-envoy has developed a skills map for e-government which identifies all the skills that might need to be considered when implementing e-services. In addition, the Centre for Management and Policy Studies ran a series of events where the leadership dimensions of successful e-government projects was addressed.
<P>
<BR>
Additional resources are required to support IT-enabled change programmes&#151;this is being addressed in part under the current spending review. In addition Departments may bid for funding from the Capital Modernisation Fund and Invest to Save Budget.
<P>
<BR>
Departments need to update existing, or legacy, IT systems. This is a matter for Departments to address. Centrally, the Government Gateway infrastructure allows joined-up government services to be delivered electronically.
<P>
<BR>
In order to more reliably assess the costs and benefits from e-government, the office of the e-envoy are considering with HM Treasury the case for developing additional guidance addressing the appraisal of risks involved in realising the benefits from e-delivery projects.
<P>
<BR>
Internet-enabled 'intermediaries'&#151;acting on behalf of their customers&#151;can provide better access to e-government services for those without other means to benefit from online access. The office of the e-envoy has worked with intermediaries, including the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (NACAB) which has received funding to assist its advisers in 1,400 centres to deliver e-government services and advice to individuals who may not have direct internet access themselves.

 The number of Standard Individual Licences (SIELs) covering items on the military and dual-use lists issued to end users in Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan and Yemen in each month since September 2001 is set out in the tables that I have placed in the Libraries of the House today. Individual licences might cover a range of items with various ratings. Where this is so, the licence is included in the tables in the total for all of the relevant ratings.
<P>

<a name="20611w09.html_para4">The summary description of the items covered by these ratings will be published in the Government's Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls, copies of which will be available in the Libraries of the House. In addition some of the countries are permitted destinations on certain Open General Export Licences, copies of which are also placed in the Libraries of the House. All relevant export licence applications are considered very carefully on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. The criteria include a specific reference to the behaviour of the buyer country with regard to the international community, as regards in particular to its attitude to terrorism, the nature of its alliances and respect for international law.

 As I made clear to my hon.

However, capacity constraints, including the number of the Parliamentary draftsmen, mean that it may take some years to achieve this. The appropriate form of scrutiny will vary from Bill to Bill. Many draft Bills will fall naturally to pre-existing Select Committees, some may be scrutinised by Joint Committees and others by ad hoc Committees of either House. The detailed method of scrutiny is a matter for the Committee examining a particular Bill.

 Until 1997, when the Armed Forces and Administration Agency (AFPAA) was formed as a partnership between Ministry of Defence and Electronic Data Services (EDS), administration for the armed forces pension scheme was undertaken in-house by the three single services. From 1997, AFPAA has undertaken the administration, ie the calculation and award, of pensions on behalf of Navy and RAF personnel, with administration for the Army remaining with that service until 1 October 2001, when it too became part of AFPAA.
<P>

<a name="20611w11.html_para1">The actual payment of pensions to retired forces personnel has since been made on MOD's behalf in respect of Navy and RAF personnel and Army officers, by the 1830s Paymaster (formerly Paymaster General). Payments of pensions for other ranks in the Army were retained in house until 1 October 2001, when these payments were also transferred to Paymaster.

 The Ministry of Defence has every confidence in the independent studies carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund that showed veterans' participation in the nuclear test programme has not had a detectable effect on their expectation of life, or on their risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases. Consequently grounds do not exist for compensation to be paid to British nuclear test veterans or their surviving spouses and families. There are no plans to review this position.

 The armed forces are seeking an approach that recognises and values diversity, without in any way compromising their commitment to comply with equality legislation and eradicate any form of harassment, intimidation or unlawful discrimination. The new diversity policy has been embodied in a revised Armed Forces Personnel Strategy Guideline, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House; this sets out the armed forces' diversity goal, and the principles which underpin it, and seeks to define diversity in a military context, demonstrating its importance for the achievement of operational effectiveness while recognising the unique circumstances of the armed forces.

<a name="20611w12.html_para2">The armed forces are determined to become more representative of the ethnically diverse society they serve. Targets remain an important means of achieving this. For the future, I have agreed that this year's target should be for each service to increase recruitment of ethnic minorities by a further 1 per cent. of all recruits, subject to an overall target of 6 per cent. This marks the continuation of the major drive by the armed forces over the past four years to attain a proper share of talent available in the ethnic communities. Future goals for ethnic minority representation and recruitment will be set in the coming year, taking account of the results of the ethnic origin resurvey of armed forces personnel currently under way, ethnic minority recruiting achievement and evidence on ethnic minority numbers likely to emerge from the 2001 national census.

We want the EU to agree a set of priority objectives, with related targets and actions. These should include improving coherence between its internal and external policies and addressing developing country concerns such as market access.

The embassy closely monitors the human rights situation in the country and is in regular contact with the leaders of independent human rights organisations and international NGOs based there. The FCO also receives information direct from human rights organisations. For example, in January, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Department outlining concerns about human rights in Uzbekistan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 The levy came into effect on 1 April 2002. It has been introduced to address the environmental impacts of the extraction and transportation of aggregates, including noise, dust, vibration, visual intrusion, loss of biodiversity and amenity. The levy will result in prices for primary aggregates which better reflect these environmental costs, and so encourage both the use of recycled aggregates as an alternative and more efficient use of aggregates.
<P>

<a name="20611w18.html_para0">Part of the revenue from the aggregates levy will be used to establish the new Sustainability Fund, which will promote environmentally beneficial practices such as the use of recycled aggregate. Scotland stands to benefit from some &#163;3 million from the fund.

 As the hon. Member may know, my noble and learned Friend recently discovered that 22 people have been appointed as magistrates contrary to the nationality requirements of the Act of Settlement 1701. This Act requires people seeking a place of trust under the Crown to hold citizenship of Britain, Eire or a Commonwealth country. We are considering ways to allow the 22 people to return to sitting at the earliest opportunity.

 Magistrates courts committees (MCCs) are taking account of the need of rural users in the delivery of their services, by taking forward the rural proofing initiative, as set out in the rural White Paper. The Countryside Agency's rural proofing checklist was sent to all 42 MCCs in May 2001, to encourage MCCs to take into account the interests of rural communities when developing or implementing existing or new policy.

 The Government's policy is to provide adequate protection for witnesses on court premises to allow them to give their best evidence.
<P>

<a name="20611w18.html_para5">The Court Service recognises that while witnesses are on court premises we have a responsibility to do what we can to prevent intimidation. For example, in all 67 designated street crime courts witnesses use a separate entrance or are segregated immediately on arrival. Provision for segregated waiting arrangements are made, as well as for separate catering and toilets to be used.

 There are two separate committees, one relating to the regulation on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents and the other relating to the regulation on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters. The former has met once in the last year to provide information to bring the regulation into force. No further meetings have been scheduled. The UK was represented by an official from the Lord Chancellor's Department and another from the Scottish Executive. The cost of attendance at this meeting was approximately &#163;400. The latter will not meet until after the Regulation applies from 1 January 2004. It will meet only when it is necessary to review the standard forms in the annexe to the regulation. As both committees are responsible only for the implementation of regulations that have already been subject to parliamentary scrutiny there are no plans to change the accountability or transparency of either.

<a name="20611w21.html_para0"><i>Statutory instrument&#151;The Financial Investigations (Northern Ireland) 2001</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Purpose</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This amends Part IV of the Proceeds of Crime (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (NI9) ("the 1996 Order").</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Order provides additional investigation powers to cover investigations into the extent or whereabouts or property held or transferred within the previous six years by or to a person who has benefited from conduct of a criminal nature. The Order also allows senior customs officers to apply for a financial investigator to be appointed and other powers to assist in the recovery of the proceeds of crime. The Order also extends a power to require information regarding money laundering and a power to require a solicitor to provide information as to whether a specified person was a client of his in respect of certain matters and about the nature of any transaction relating to them. The Order also extends the time limit for bringing summary proceedings for offences.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Costs</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There will be a neutral impact on any public expenditure incurred on implementing the proposals, as they will be met within existing resources. It is anticipated that these proposals will result in additional revenue from the confiscation of the proceeds of crime. There will be a small impact on businesses, particularly solicitors. It is anticipated that no more than eight man hours would be required to meet an individual request from a financial investigator at &#163;15 to &#163;20 per hour, this suggests a maximum of &#163;160 per request. As to the number of requests that are likely to be made on solicitors for information in a similar regime which already exists regarding banks 20 such requests have been made since 1998. There will be no financial impact on individuals.</FONT></UL>

 The Belfast agreement 1998 makes specific reference to the importance of acknowledging and addressing the suffering of victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation, and recognises the need to provide services that are supportive and sensitive to their individual needs.

<a name="20611w22.html_para1">Following publication of his report "We Will Remember Them" in April 1998, the Government appointed Adam Ingram as Minister for Victims and the Victims Liaison Unit was established to take forward the implementation of the report. Since then Government have committed more than &#163;18.25 million to support victims of the Troubles, funding a number of initiatives including:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;700k for a family trauma centre in Belfast which provides therapeutic service addressing the psychological needs of families and young people.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;4 million to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund with a commitment of a further &#163;1 million for 2003&#150;04. The fund has put in place a number of schemes including:</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;1.5 million over the next two years to the Devolved Administration's Strategy Implementation Fund to help NI Departments fulfil their commitment to addressing victims' needs.</FONT></UL>
It is now four years since the Bloomfield report was published and I replaced Adam Ingram as Victims Minister last June. I am currently reviewing the Government's strategic approach to the needs of victims in the context of the ongoing political process.

<P>

<a name="20611w22.html_para2">Also, as part of the Belfast Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was given the responsibility of advising the Secretary of State on the scope for defining, in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the ECHR which, taken together with the ECHR, could constitute a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. The agreement also says that the Bill should reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20611w22.html_para3">The Commission consultation document "Making a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland" indicated that the rights of victims, both those arising from the conflict and more generally, should be included in a Bill of Rights. The Government have drawn no policy conclusions from the consultation document but will give careful consideration to the formal recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which we expect to receive in 2003.

 The police ombudsman advises that the targets for dealing with complaints are contained in the police ombudsman's corporate statement and annual business plan 2001&#150;02. The targets are reproduced in the table and include the current levels of achievement. In a number of categories the process for measuring the level of achievement against target is currently at the development stage and therefore these figures are not yet available.

<a name="20611w23.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Currently 98 per cent. of general practitioners' practices are computerised and linked to a national electronic network to support email communications and web browsing. Most of them operate clinical systems as part of their practice computerisation and an electronic patient record (EPR) will be part of the system. The level of detail and functionality varies significantly from practice to practice. In the majority of cases at present it will cover the electronic storage of basic patient and administrative details, medication and recent consultations with the GP.
<P>

<a name="20611w23.html_para0">At present six trusts have complete hospital wide EPR systems that meet the functionality described under level 3. However many more have some applications in place, for example results reporting and order communications. In addition some trusts have chosen to implement elements of EPR beyond level 3 with functionality around decision support and knowledge management or picture archiving and communications systems to support improved patient care.

[55369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The standing committee on medicinal products for human use is a regulatory committee which assists the European Commission (EC) in exercising its powers of implementation and facilitates the adoption of draft measures in the field of medicinal products for human use. It also adopts decisions on centralised marketing authorisation applications and other regulatory actions referred to it by the European medicines evaluation agency (EMEA). It operates mainly by written procedures as set out in legislation. It meets only exceptionally, either on the chairman's initiative or at the reasoned request of the representative of a member state. The committee last met on 23 March 2000. The UK is represented by the chief executive of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) or his deputy and, as MCA is a trading fund of the Department, no cost to public funds is generally incurred in supporting the committee's work.

During 2001 the committee met on 5 April, 5 July and 16 November, and in 2002 it met on 14 May. The pharmaceutical committee network on bioterrorism was an ad hoc group which met twice, on 23 January 2002 and 20 February 2002. No further meetings of the network are planned.

<a name="20611w23.html_para7">The UK is represented jointly by two senior public health officials from the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Department. The EC reimburses travel and subsistence costs for one delegate from each member state. The annual cost of the committee's work to public funds varies according to the number of meetings held and make-up of the UK representation. The MCA provides the main Government support for the work of the committee and usually represents the UK. As the MCA is a trading fund of the Department, this incurs no cost to public funds. If a Department official attends with the MCA delegation, his/her expenses will be borne out of public funds. This has happened twice in the last 12 months and the amount of travel and subsistence involved was in the region of &#163;860.00.

<a name="20611w24.html_para10">There are possible risks in all surgical procedures. Therefore, before each operation, the clinician should explain the risks involved and any alternative treatment, to allow the patient or their family to give informed consent to the surgery. Tonsil and adenoid surgery is a relatively low risk operation, but where adverse incidents occur they are treated on a case by case basis by the NHS trust where the operation took place. Patients who have had their tonsils removed with single use instruments should not be concerned of any long-term effects following the surgery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w27.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2002]:</i> The food supplements directive must be transposed into UK law by the last day of the month, one year after the date of entry into force of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="20611w27.html_para0">The Directive will not immediately outlaw any products already on the UK market. Lists of permitted vitamin and mineral sources remain open, pending safety assessments for additional substances. The Government welcomes the amendment to Article 4(6)(b) which was recently adopted by the European Parliament and which extends the time for dossier submission from 18 to 36 months after the Directive comes into force. The Directive gives Member States the opportunity to allow continued sale of products containing vitamin and mineral sources not yet on the permitted list for up to seven years after the Directive comes into force, pending safety assessment of these sources. When implementing the Directive, the Government intends to take full advantage of this flexibility.
<P>

<a name="20611w27.html_para1">Incorporation into United Kingdom law of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products will be subject to the outcome of European negotiations. On the basis of the formal proposals published in January 2002 by the European Commission, we anticipate that consumers will have continuing access to a wide range of traditional herbal remedies sold over the counter.
<P>

<a name="20611w27.html_para2">Features of the proposed Directive which might, in principle, inhibit availability are the requirements relating to safety and quality and the definition of traditional use. However, our assessment is that the introduction of the proposed safety and quality standards is necessary for effective public health protection and the maintenance of public confidence in the sector. This in turn will ultimately affect the strength of public demand for herbal remedies. The proposed standards are ones which are already successfully met by many manufacturers in UK and elsewhere of traditional herbal remedies.
<P>

<a name="20611w27.html_para3">As to the definition of traditional use, we take the view that a large number of unlicensed herbal remedies currently on the market, and sold legally under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, 1968, have a strong basis in tradition and so should be able to satisfy the requirement to demonstrate traditional usage. This assessment is based, for example, on the extensive herbal literature covering various herbal traditions, on the activities of herbalists over many decades in supplying herbal medicinal products to individual patients following consultation, and on the existence of large numbers of long-standing licensed herbal remedies in the UK and elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20611w27.html_para4">It will not be possible to predict for some time to come the full extent to which herbal remedies will be sold under this Directive. One important issue is that there are likely to be significant numbers of products with a clear basis in tradition and containing herbal ingredients which, depending on the presentation of the company's specific product, may legally be sold either as medicines or in another regulatory product category such as food, cosmetic or general consumer product. There may

 I have today revoked the authorisation signed by my hon. friend the member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) on 23 April 2001 which permits immigration officers to discriminate in the examination of passengers from certain specified ethnic or national groups. We have kept this authorisation under close review in the light of intelligence assessments from the Immigration Service. After a year's experience of operating the authorisations, the Immigration Service has found it sufficient to rely on the authorisation made on 27 March 2001 which permits it to prioritise certain passengers for additional examination on the basis of their nationality. We will keep under review the possible need for further authorisations permitting discrimination on grounds of ethnic or national origin where necessary in respect of specific targeted operations.

 The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned, convicted, or found not guilty by reason of insanity in respect of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act to provide certain details to the police.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what consideration is given to ease of access for family visits in placing prisoners.  [58843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w31.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 All prison establishments are required to consider a number of factors when placing a prisoner, one of which is the home area of prisoners and their visitors.
<P>

<a name="20611w31.html_para4">The Prison Service places great importance on prisoners having regular and productive visits in order to maintain close and meaningful ties with their families as part of their effective rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="20611w31.html_para5">However, high population levels throughout the prison estate can lead to prisoners being transferred from their home area to prison establishments with a greater number of vacancies to create capacity for remand prisoners within those prisons that serve the courts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20611w31.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 On reception into prison all prisoners are asked about their marital status. They cannot be required to provide this information. As of 24 May, 10,786 male prisoners and 571 female prisoners described themselves as married or cohabiting. This amounts to 16 per cent. of the prison population. The information is not available by individual establishment. Information about prisoners with children is not collated. However, surveys suggest that about 60 per cent. of prisoners have children of whom about half have dependent children.

 Prisoners with mental health problems can be cared for in the health care centre at Wolds prison, which provides for up to 16 in-patients. A number of the nurses caring for these patients are specifically qualified to work with mentally ill prisoners. A psychiatrist visits the prison on a weekly basis to provide psychological and counsellor support to those within the health care centre and on normal location. Wolds prison also works very closely with agencies to provide secure hospital accommodation and mental health community support for those prisoners being discharged.

 The review has so far involved a number of regional visits to coroners and meetings with the public, as well as with the Department for Health, the Retained Organs Commission, the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Judicial Studies Board and other relevant organisations. Time has also been spent in Northern Ireland, and review team members have attended Home Office-run coroner training events. The review team hope to issue a consultation on document shortly.

 The Commission for Race Equality's (CRE) "Ethnic Monitoring&#151;A Guide for Public Authorities" recommends adopting the ethnic categories used in the 2001 Census and this incorporates the use of an Irish category. All civil service Departments were required by the Cabinet Office to undertake an ethnicity re-classification exercise. The format for the classifications was provided to reflect the latest census classification. The Prison Service are in the process of adopting the Census 2001 categories.
<P>

<a name="20611w32.html_para1">An ethnicity re-classification exercise of all Prison Service staff was undertaken in October 2001. Every member of staff was asked to complete a questionnaire which allowed their ethnic origin to be recorded in a category as provided for in the 2001 Census. Arrangements are also being made to update.

<a name="20611w32.html_para2">Sample surveys of magistrates court cases show that the proportion of defendants whose cases were adjourned in these courts fell from 50 per cent. in 1997 to 44 per cent. in 2001. In the magistrates courts a joint monitoring scheme with the Crown Prosecution Service and other criminal justice agencies began on 1 April 2002, to collect data for all adjourned trials, including the number of previous adjournments. The first quarterly figures will be published in July 2002. The Crown court also has a national monitoring scheme for adjourned trials. Data from both sources will inform a research project, planned to start later this year, into the effect of trial adjournments.
