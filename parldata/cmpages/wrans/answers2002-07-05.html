<i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> Work is now underway to consider the impact of the Massey Ferguson reduction on its supplier chain. This will be conducted under the management of the XMassey Ferguson Regional Support Team", which was set up on Friday 28 June 2002. It will be chaired by Councillor Nick Nolan, Leader of Coventry City Council and members include AGCO managers, Advantage West Midlands (the Regional Development Agency), the Local Authorities, Coventry and Warwickshire Chamber or Commerce, Warwick Manufacturing Centre, Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire Partnership, Jobcentre Plus (formerly the Employment Service), Trade Unions represented at the plant, local Members of Parliament, and the DTI through the Government Office for the West Midlands.
<P>

<a name="20705w01.html_para2">The Government have a number of measures to support and help new businesses&#151;including new manufacturing companies&#151;such as Regional Selective Assistance Enterprise Grants and SMART Grants which are administered by Advantage West Midlands or the Small Business Service. In addition, the XAccelerate" scheme has helped numerous manufacturers in the motor vehicle sector, and the recommendations of the Rover Task Force has enabled funding from the UK Government and European Structural Funds to be focussed on the diversification and modernisation of West Midlands manufacturing companies.
<P>

<a name="20705w01.html_para3">Manufacturing matters to the Government. A National Manufacturing Summit took place in Birmingham on 5 December 2001, with a specific West Midlands follow-up event on 7 March 2002.

Negotiations have recently concluded on the 13th Relenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional finance arm of the World Bank. 18&#150;21 per cent. of overall IDA-13 resources, projected to be around $23 billion, will be provided in the form of grants. During the last IDA replenishment (IDA-12), less than 5 per cent. of resources were available as grants.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of waste produced in her Department was <i>(a)</i> recycled, <i>(b)</i> composted and <i>(c)</i> re-used, broken down into (i) paper, (ii) plastics, (iii) aluminium cans and (iv) other, in each year since 1997; what plans there are to increase the proportions; and if she will make a statement. [65695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20705w02.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
Figures prior to 2000 are not available, as precise volumes were not being measured. Some measuring systems were initiated in 2000 but were not sufficiently comprehensive to enable proportions to be quoted in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="20705w02.html_para0">In April 2000, recording of paper sent for recycling commenced at our main London office and averaged 300kg/wk in the initial months. This increased by 30 per cent following an office awareness-raising campaign in September 2000. Other recycling streams initiated during 2000 included plastic cups, aluminium cans, glass, newspaper, toner cartridges and used fluorescent tubes. Since December 2001, our main London office has been using a Government-approved waste contractor (John W Hannay) who collect all mixed office waste daily and sort it on receipt into 12 recycling streams. They state that they recycle over 90 per cent and send under ten per cent to landfill. This system also obviates the need for time-consuming sorting and recording of individual waste streams at source. We are currently exploring the possibility of extending this system to our other main office in East Kilbride, and will also be conducting environmental audits of our overseas offices with a view to expanding recycling, composting and re-use where local circumstances permit.
<P>

<a name="20705w02.html_para1">When we relocated to a new London office towards the end of 2001; eight giant walk-in skips were filled with waste paper for recycling. Obsolete computer equipment was sent to the charity Computer Aid for reuse (including in developing countries) and surplus obsolete office furniture was donated to local schools and other charities. For the final office clearance we used a Government-approved company (Azcom, via a call-down contract with the Disposal Sales Agency) who reuse and recycle as much cleared material as possible as an alternative to landfill.
<P>

<a name="20705w02.html_para2">DFID is wholly committed to the Green agenda and targets, and is in the process of finalising an Environmental Management System covering all aspects of operational activities.

system. Given that the contract with BAE Systems is legally binding, President Mkapa is inviting ICAO and BAE Systems to visit Tanzania to help advise his government on the best and most effective way of using the system. President Mkapa also made clear that there would be no second phase of the project. The President and Finance Minister outlined measures the government had put in place to ensure proper scrutiny and transparency of contracts to avoid any similar problems in the future. Improved systems and legislation, which DFID has helped to support, are now in place for public expenditure management and procurement.
<P>

<a name="20705w02.html_para3">In view of these assurances and the measures taken by the government of Tanzania, and given the impressive achievements Tanzania has made in economic growth and social reform, I agreed to establish a six year partnership based on mutual commitments to drive forward Tanzania's poverty reduction and economic reform efforts. The Memorandum of Understanding will provide a commitment to at least #45 million per annum of support to the Tanzanian budget, the first year of which will be disbursed between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2003. In the current financial year we expect to spend a total of #80 million through our bilateral development programme.

<a name="20705w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg:  </B> 
Keeping pets in schools and encountering farming activities can be useful educational experiences for pupils. The Department has issued guidelines on health and safety in science education, and also endorsed guidance from educational organisations, covering good keeping and handling of living organisms in schools. The Growing Schools initiative, launched last September, and supported by #500,000 funding, includes the development of school grounds for growing, for example, food Xcrops", and may also support farm units which contain animals.

<i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> There have been guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry to follow on the use of certain animal materials in the production of vaccines and other medicines since 1989. The latest version of the guidelines was drawn up by the European scientific committee, the committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP), and adopted 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2002 : Column 620W</I><P>
in May 2001. The latest version of the guidelines became legally binding from 1 July 2000 for new applications for a licence for a medicinal product and from 1 March 2001 for products that were already licensed.
<P>

<a name="20705w02.html_para4">The scope of guidance at any one time, and its implications for pharmaceutical companies, have often been unclear. Following a thorough review of the information supplied to Parliament on bovine spongiform encephalopathy-related issues in vaccines, the Government have established that, regrettably, incorrect and misleading information was given to Ministers by the medicines control agency and thus has been given in response to a number of Parliamentary Questions. An account of the questions incorrectly answered and the correct information has now been placed in the Library and letters sent to right hon. and hon. Members who asked those questions.

<a name="20705w03.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith:  </B> 
A number of initiatives have begun and legislative changes taken place since 1997 that benefit people with visual impairments as well as other disabled people. Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, deals with discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities. Since 1999, for example, service providers have had to take reasonable steps to change practices, policies or procedures, which make it impossible, or unreasonably difficult for disabled people including those with visual impairments to use a service.
<P>

<a name="20705w03.html_para1">The community equipment services strategy, which was published in March 2001, calls for increases in the number of people benefiting from equipment. It highlights the importance of equipment and adaptations for visually impaired people. XDoubly Disabled", published in 1999, provided essential background and guidance for senior National Health Service managers with specific responsibility for advising on access for blind and other disabled persons to services and employment. Last month the Department issued fair access to care services, which provides guidance to councils with social services responsibilities on how they may achieve fair access to care services through reviewing and revising their eligibility criteria for all adult service users. Additionally, we have recently awarded the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) and the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association (GDBA) jointly a project grant to develop visual care standards.

In 1999, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) introduced an adverse outcome analysis system. This provided CPS areas with a consistent means to identify reasons for adverse outcomes and also to allocate responsibility of any failure. This information is collated centrally.
<P>

<a name="20705w04.html_para3">For the last seven years, many areas of the CPS have had in place, with the police, a system of joint performance management that involves an appraisal of Crown Court acquittals, including those ordered and directed by the judge. This process has provided areas with information showing particular trends and a means by which improvements can be made.

<P><I>5 Jul 2002 : Column 626W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20705w04.html_para4">The Crown Prosecution Service produces quarterly summaries of unsuccessful case outcomes from information drawn from its various case tracking systems. This year the CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcome analysis which builds on these two processes and will focus on avoidable case failure. Under this system, the reasons for judge-ordered and judge-directed acquittals in individual cases will be jointly assessed for individual training needs and other joint strategies for performance improvement.
<P>

<a name="20705w04.html_para5">The process will be supported by more sophisticated management information following the introduction of the CPS' Compass Case Management System due to roll out between April and December 2003.

Over the same period judge-ordered acquittals rose from 9,616 to 11,825, an increase of 23 per cent. Much of this increase can be attributed to recent changes in procedures. Since January 2001, the prosecution, unlike before, have been able to discontinue cases in the Crown Court. Although this is a prosecution decision, the current system records these as judge-ordered acquittals.

Rape cases are acknowledged to be among the most difficult to prosecute to conviction, and the expertise of prosecutors and prosecuting counsel is especially important.

But it made a number of recommendations to spread best practice across the CPS, including the need for specialist prosecutors. The CPS is currently working out how best to implement these recommendations to improve the chances that those guilty of rape will be convicted.
<P>

<a name="20705w04.html_para11">An inter-departmental working group expects to respond to the recommendations in the Report as a whole later this month.

<i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The Social Exclusion Unit's 1998 Report identified that between one quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the Armed Forces at some stage, predominantly some years before as National Servicemen. Since then, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has been working in partnership with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Homelessness Directorate, (previously known as the Rough Sleepers Unit) and the charitable sector to improve care and support for acute cases of homelessness, and notably those already sleeping rough on the streets or at high risk of doing so.
<P>

<a name="20705w05.html_para1">The MOD has put in place new preventive mechanisms at pre-discharge, point of discharge and post-discharge to help vulnerable leavers make a more successful transition to civilian life. These and other measures taken by the Government and its partners have reduced levels of rough sleeping by some two-thirds, in line with the Prime Minister's target. Furthermore, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed that an interim analysis of rough sleeping data gathered in November 2001 shows that the percentage of rough sleepers with an Armed Forced background has decreased markedly since the 1998 SEU Report.
<P>

<a name="20705w05.html_para2">Medical care of ex-Service personnel with substantial emotional problems is the responsibility of the National Health Service (NHS) and the full range of treatments and psychiatric services is available. Those requiring psychiatric treatment may be treated as NHS patients at the Duchess of Kent's Psychiatric Hospital, subject to the nature of their medical condition and capacity though, if they reside outside the catchment area, their local Health Authority would have to meet the cost of treatment in accordance with NHS budgetary procedures.
<P>

<a name="20705w05.html_para3">The MOD has recently placed a research contract with Kings College London to help advise policy decisions to improve the delivery of cross-departmental support to veterans and to identify any areas of unmet need.

There are welcome reports that infiltration across the Line of Control has reduced in recent weeks. This has helped to reduce tensions in the region. But the situation still remains fragile.

<i>[holding answer 2 July 2002]: </i>Expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is made in accordance with the EU regulations. Actual CAP expenditure may be higher or lower than forecast at the beginning of each budgetary year, due to the market situation, exchange rate fluctuations, or exceptional items. Surplus from one year's EC Budget is returned to Member States in the following year's Budget by means of a reduction of the amount to be financed from own resources. This has the effect of reducing the amount each Member State is required to pay from the GNP-based resource. The budget process requires the Commission to estimate the level of expenditure necessary in a particular year. It would be misleading to describe a difference between the estimate and outturn expenditure as an Xunderspend". Information on the implementation of the budget is available from the House of Commons Library in the Annual Reports of the Court of Auditors.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Holdings in the census have been classified as main and minor. Main holdings are included for selection in the annual census (since 1995 this has been on a sample basis). Minor holdings are only surveyed once every five years following which a review of the classification between main and minor takes place. New holdings are counted as main holdings until the next reclassification exercise.<P>

2. Additional holdings from a significant register updating exercise were identified in 2000 and first included in 2001.<P>

3. The figures for June 2002 Census are still being processed. From this year the distinction between main and minor is being dropped.<P>

4. Holdings may not relate to individual farms. A single business may consist of several holdings.<P>

Part E of the Building Regulations sets standards for the sound insulation between new homes. I propose to publish amendments to part E of the Regulations and the supporting documents in the autumn of this year. There will be a requirement in the regulations for testing the sound insulation of a sample of new homes on each site.
<P>

<a name="20705w09.html_para4">The requirement for sound insulation testing will apply to houses, flats, hostel and hotel accommodation, whether purpose built or formed by conversion of other types of building. For new hostel and hotel types of accommodation, and houses, flats, hostel and hotel accommodation formed by conversion of other types of building, I anticipate that the requirement will come into force on 1 July 2003. For new houses and flats only, I anticipate that it will come into force on 1 January 2004.
<P>

<a name="20705w09.html_para5">The reason for this later date is that I have asked the House Builders Federation to develop Robust Standard Details for the sound insulation of separating walls and floors for use in new houses and flats.

<a name="20705w09.html_para6">Officials and the Building Regulations Advisory Committee will assess whether the House Builders Federation has achieved this objective. If satisfied that this scheme might work successfully, then I will put the proposals out to public consultation. If this does not raise any unforeseen issues, I would intend to amend the Regulations to allow Robust Standard Details to be used as an alternative to testing. Otherwise, I anticipate that testing will be introduced on 1 January 2004.

A full description of the ongoing work of the Northern Ireland Office is given in the Department Report, published on 14 June (CM 5432).

The Northern Ireland Office has introduced one Statutory Instrument since January 2001; the Criminal Injuries Compensation (NI) Order was introduced on 1 May 2002.
<P>

<a name="20705w10.html_para4">The approximate spend to March 2002 is #1,700,000, the forecast cost is expected to be around #1,900,000. This figure includes approximately #900,000 for the computer system for Compensation Agency to support the Tariff scheme. It must be note that a part of this system was to be introduced in the Compensation Agency anyway.
<P>

<a name="20705w10.html_para5">As the Order has only recently been introduced, it is too early to provide any figure relating to savings on the compensation budget.

The Northern Ireland Office's Public Service Agreement (PSA) was first published in October 2000 to cover the three-year period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04. As the PSA targets effectively embrace virtually all of our departmental activities the cost of seeking to meet our PSA objectives is essentially the same as our total departmental expenditure. For 2001&#150;02 (the first year of our PSA) this is currently estimated at #1,052 billion.
<P>

<a name="20705w11.html_para0">The efficiency elements within our current PSA are already reflected in the profiling of the budget set for the Department whereby anticipated reductions in spending in one area are redirected to offset emerging pressures in other areas.
