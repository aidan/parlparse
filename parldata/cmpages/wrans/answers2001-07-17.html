To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what additional funding for marketing she expects to provide to the British Tourist Authority in response to the foot and mouth disease crisis.  [189]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew1"><B> Tessa Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> As in other sectors of the economy, businesses themselves take the lead in marketing their services to overseas markets. We as a Government back those efforts only where they need special co-ordination. In this case the Government have pledged additional funding of &#163;14.2 million, supplemented by &#163;2.1 million re-deployed by the British Tourist Authority from existing plans. This provides in full what was sought by the British Tourist Authority, after full consultation with the industry, for the whole of 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions she has had with the European Investment Bank regarding assistance for tourism businesses affected by foot and mouth disease.  [135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew2"><B> Tessa Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> I have had no discussions with the European Investment Bank. However, Government Ministers have discussed the problems of business affected by the outbreak with the British Bankers Association. The association has undertaken to help businesses by providing extra lending, deferring repayments, waiving arrangement fees and providing information and advice.
<P>

<a name="10717w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when she was first informed about deduction of VAT from the money paid to the British Tourist Authority as part of the tourism recovery plan; and if she will make a statement.  [3852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew3"><B> Tessa Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> The British Tourist Authority brought to my Department's attention on 24 May that, under their long-standing agreement with Customs and Excise, VAT would need to be payable for goods and services paid for with the additional funds allocated for the authority's recovery plan. We are assessing the implications of this with BTA, and the recovery plan is going ahead as planned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> Building on "Tomorrow's Tourism", the sound strategy for tourism that we developed in our previous term of office, we will also consider giving greater emphasis to three areas: (a) changing the perception of the industry as an employer through further Government-industry partnerships; (b) continuing to drive for better and less regulation so that the industry can concentrate on growth and increasing our international competitiveness; and (c) examining whether the marketing of Britain as a tourism destination could be more efficiently co-ordinated.
<P>

<a name="10717w01.html_para0">The recent foot and mouth disease outbreak has highlighted the importance of tourism to the domestic economy and we will do what we can to ensure a speedy and sustained recovery. In addition to taking forward strategy, experience so far has shown that we clearly need better and more up-to-date statistics and economic data for the sector and we will need to work with the industry to that end.

<a name="10717w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport who represented her Department at the meeting of the first international drug testing seminar on Wednesday 4 July; and if she will make a statement.  [3733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Only 4 July, the Medicines Control Agency held a public seminar on the issue of sports supplements. The Director of the Anti-Doping Unit at UK Sport, and the Chair of the Nandrolone Review Group, which was set up by UK Sport, both attended that seminar. UK Sport is the non-departmental public body funded by the Department for Culture Media and Sport with responsibility for the drug testing programme in the UK.
<P>

<a name="10717w01.html_para1">The Nandrolone Review committee reported in January 2000 and gave a strong warning to sport about the potential dangers of using supplements which may be incorrectly or inadequately labelled. Since then, considerable research has been undertaken on supplements, both in the UK and abroad, to see whether they can be responsible for producing adverse findings among athletes. Doping remains a strict liability offence in sport in order to protect athletes from those who do seek to cheat by misusing drugs. This means that athletes must be confident that what they are putting into their bodies will not lead to an adverse finding. The Nandrolone Review Group will be considering research findings in further depth and are due to produce a follow up report shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many full-time equivalent staff have been employed to test for drug usage per sport in Britain in each of the last five years.  [3732]




<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2001 : Column: 78W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Drug testing arrangements are organised on a UK rather than British basis to provide a consistent standard across all UK sportsmen and women subject to this type of testing. UK Sport is currently the agency with responsibility for the drug testing policy and programme and they employ 12 staff to oversee the testing operation, policy, education, information, research and international advocacy roles. UK Sport also contracts a team of 85 independent sampling officers to carry out sampling. This figure will rise and fall depending on need. For example, it will increase when international competitions are held in the UK, as next year when we host the Commonwealth Games.
<P>

<a name="10717w01.html_para2">Prior to the reorganisation of the GB Sports Council in UK Sport in 1997, five full-time officers, and a considerable number of part-time independent sampling officers were employed in the fight against doping in sport. It is also the case that a number of governing bodies of sport employ staff, on a full, or part-time or voluntary basis in the anti-doping field. To calculate the number of staff on a per sport basis would be extremely difficult as there are currently no centrally held statistics which would accurately reflect the individual arrangements of all governing bodies. Also, calculation on a per sport basis would not provide an accurate reflection of the complexity of anti-doping procedures in the UK.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many drugs tests were conducted per sport <i>(a)</i> in Britain and <i>(b)</i> outside Britain on British sportspeople in each of the last five years.  [3731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Drug testing arrangements are organised on a UK rather than British basis to provide a consistent standard across all UK sportsmen and women subject to this type of testing. UK Sport is currently the agency with responsibility for the drug testing policy and programme. The complexities of the drug testing programme are such that it is not possible to break down figures in the way which my hon. Friend has requested. For example, footballers playing in the football league in England and Wales might not be British but may be subject to testing as they are participating in a domestic competition. Also, UK Sport does not have records of all UK athletes tested overseas unless they have commissioned the testing themselves. Where UK athletes are tested overseas at the request of the International Federation or as part of the host nation's testing programme, this information is relayed to individual governing bodies, not to the national anti-doping organisation of the athlete.
<P>

<a name="10717w01.html_para3">A summary of the UK drugs testing programme for each of the last five years is as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w02.html_spnew5"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 I am today laying copies of the report before Parliament. It is being published as a Command Paper, and the full text will be available on my Department's website (www.culture.gov.uk).
<P>

<a name="10717w02.html_para3">I am very grateful to Sir Alan Budd and his fellow members of the Review Body for their work. They have done a fine job. They were given a wide and challenging remit: to modernise the regulation of gambling in Great Britain, taking account of all relevant factors, including its social impact. Their report, based on extensive evidence and research, provides a thorough analysis of the issues and a coherent package of proposals. We are all in their debt.
<P>

<a name="10717w02.html_para4">All around the world legislators have grappled with the problem of how best to regulate gambling. There is no single solution which is right for all times and for all places. Gambling itself is continually evolving. Our present gambling laws were, for example, enacted before the internet was created and they make no provision for its use as a gambling medium. Regulation equally needs to take account of changing social circumstances and public expectations. There is no doubt that our current 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2001 : Column: 81W</I><P>
laws, as well as being too complex and out of date, fail to reflect the extent to which gambling has become an everyday part of the way in which millions of people choose to spend their leisure.
<P>

<a name="10717w02.html_para5">The Gambling Review Body has identified a number of proposals which would lift regulatory constraints which may no longer be justified. At the same time there are proposals which would provide additional safeguards which the Review Body sees as needed to achieve the overall policy aims of protecting children and the vulnerable, ensuring fairness to the punter and keeping crime out of gambling. The report accordingly recommends a new balance of regulation in the public interest. It is also clear from the report that we are looking at the scope for improving a system with many strengths: through its own and its regulators' efforts British gambling is among the world leaders.
<P>

<a name="10717w02.html_para6">We now plan to discuss with interested bodies the issues which implementation of the Review Body's recommendations would raise. We shall also welcome comments from members of the public and all sources: these should be sent to my Department by the end of October. I shall want to take these consultation and comments into account before reaching final decisions on the way ahead. I shall also want to consider carefully the potential impact of the Review Body's proposals on the National Lottery before deciding how to proceed.
<P>

<a name="10717w02.html_para7">In the meantime there is no reason to halt all work on changes which are consistent with the Review Body's conclusions and which can be taken forward without cutting across future legislation. We shall, for example, continue to work on plans to sell the Tote to racing and to end the horserace betting levy; and there are also regulatory reform proposals which are already subject to public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny. We need to consider them again in the light of the Review Body's work, but where progress can sensibly be made which will bring early benefits to the public and the industry alike, it should be made.

<a name="10717w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Transport Act 2000 gave the Government powers to make regulations which would enable the Vehicle Inspectorate to detain the vehicles of unlicensed goods vehicle operators. I intend to lay these regulations before this House shortly. Subject to the approval of the House, we aim to bring the regulations into effect in October 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he intends to introduce HGV lanes on strategic routes; and at what locations he has trialed such schemes. [R]  [3548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have not yet identified any locations on the strategic network where designated lanes would improve the flow of traffic for HGVs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what mechanism will be used to allocate the 5 per cent. stake in NATS to staff under the Government's proposals for the part-privatisation of the National Air Traffic Service.  [3698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government, in conjunction with the Airline Group and NATS staff representatives are working together on the precise detail of the employee share scheme. In broad terms, the shares will be allocated via an Employee Share Ownership Plan, to be approved by the Inland Revenue, which will be administered by a new subsidiary of NATS called NATS Employee Sharetrust Limited. The directors of this new company will be appointed by the Government, the Airline Group and the NATS trade unions. A fundamental principle of the scheme will be that all employees, regardless of grade or length of service will have the same entitlement to shares from this scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what meetings <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials have held in the last month with representatives of the airline consortium which is purchasing NATS.  [3696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Ministers held a number of meetings with bidders for the National Air Traffic Services public-private partnership, including the Airline Group, as part of the bidding process. No meetings between Ministers and the Airline Group have taken place since the preferred bidder was selected.
<P>

<P>

<a name="10717w03.html_para3">Mr. Kiley was appointed chairman of London Regional Transport on 8 May to lead negotiations on contracts for the modernisation of London Underground. On 29 June, he wrote to the Prime Minister reporting that he had been unable to reach agreement with the bidders which met his objectives and the key criteria for modernising the Tube. In the light of Mr. Kiley's inability to reach an agreement with the bidders, the Government asked London Underground to proceed with their plans for improving and updating the Tube's infrastructure within parameters acceptable to them and the bidders.
<P>

<a name="10717w03.html_para4">When the Government decided on 5 July that London Underground should be invited to press ahead with their plans for investment in a publicly-run, privately-built Tube, we hoped that Mr. Kiley would continue to be able to play a fully co-operative role. This has not been the case. Mr. Kiley has tried to use his board position to block negotiations with the bidders. He has, without authority from the board, issued instructions to senior management to halt those negotiations.
<P>

<a name="10717w03.html_para5">I have today received a letter signed on behalf of a majority of the London Transport Board saying they cannot work with Mr. Kiley and thus it is impossible for the London Transport Board to function effectively. I have therefore decided to end Mr. Kiley's appointment as chairman and as a board member and to re-appoint Sir Malcolm Bates as chairman of the London Transport Board.

 Over 3 per cent. of the network received a lower noise surface during the last year.

A detailed 10 year programme is not available, but approximately 6 per cent. of the network is expected to be treated annually. On this basis 10 per cent. would be achieved by 2002, 25 per cent. by 2005, 50 per cent. by 2009 and 60 per cent. by 2011.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to the Railtrack chairman last month expressing concern about the continued enforcement of speed restrictions on the national rail network and pressing for a firm timetable for reducing further the number outstanding, without in any way compromising safety. Railtrack will respond substantively once it has reached agreement with the train operating companies on the best balance between early removal of the restrictions and additional disruption to services that the necessary engineering work might cause.

<a name="10717w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive consider overcrowding on trains to be a matter of comfort rather than one of safety. Accordingly there are no statutory safety limits on the number of passengers that can travel on trains. For commuter routes into London and Edinburgh train operators are required to keep overcrowding within specified thresholds. All trains in use have a nominal capacity, and operators must plan their services to ensure that the aggregated number of Passenger's In Excess of Capacity is kept to 3 per cent. over the morning and evening peaks or 4.5 per cent. for either peak in isolation. Train operators conduct annual passenger counts to demonstrate compliance. If the thresholds are breached the company is required to produce an action plan to remedy the problem.

 "Coming in from the Cold", the Government's strategy on tackling rough sleeping, has delivered a raft of policies and services that are preventing vulnerable people coming on to the streets and rebuilding the lives of former rough sleepers.
<P>

<a name="10717w06.html_para0">The RSU has introduced a range of services in London to help vulnerable rough sleepers off the streets. A recent analysis of rough sleeper ages recorded by London Contact and Assessment Teams from 1 December 2000 to 31 March 2001 showed that around 40 per cent. of rough sleepers were aged between 26 and 35, with roughly 20 per cent. aged between 16 and 25, and 36 and 45. Around 10 per cent. were aged between 46 and 55 and roughly 10 per cent. were aged over 56 years of age, of which a very small percentage were between 66 and 75 and over 75. Contact and Assessment Teams found no rough sleepers under 16 during the period.

 This is an operational matter for London Underground who inform me the standard they used to measure "without interruption" is that there are no service delays of 15 minutes or more. They have provided the following information for this financial year to date (1 April 2001 until 23 June 2001): the Jubilee line has run for 24 days out of 56 without interruption. The 24 days

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the outcome was of the Government's consultation on the proposed fund for regional chambers.  [4971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We have had a very positive response to the consultation on strengthening the regions which my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor launched earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="10717w07.html_para0">I am therefore announcing today the go-ahead for the new &#163;15 million fund for regional chambers&#151;&#163;5 million this year, and in each of the next two years. This will help them to enhance their role in providing regional input to, and scrutinising, the plans and work of the Regional Development Agencies, and to develop their position as the strategic focal point for the regions. The aim is to provide a stronger framework for representing the regions' views, not to impose burdensome new procedures on the RDAs or others.
<P>

<a name="10717w07.html_para1">In 2001&#150;02, &#163;500,000 is available for each chamber to develop its scrutiny role, with a further &#163;1 million set aside for initiatives, supported by the chambers collectively, on setting up the new regime. While we envisage that bids would normally be for the first year only, we have not ruled out the possibility of bids for two, or even three, years' worth of funding where that is what the chambers want. The deadline for receiving bids has been extended to 29 July.
<P>

<a name="10717w07.html_para2">Detailed arrangements for allocating the funding in the following two years will be settled in the light of further discussions with the chambers. The future of the funding beyond the current three-year period will be a matter for the next spending review.

<a name="10717w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified in the case of North Hertfordshire district council, given the exceptional nature of flooding. A scheme will, therefore be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant will be paid to cover 100 per cent. of the eligible costs above a threshold, which the authority has incurred in dealing with the flooding.

The estimated value of the contract over its life was &#163;15 million. Since 1998 &#163;4.8 million has been paid to IBM. In September 2000 a variation to the contract was agreed under which IBM continued to provide internal IT systems for a further three years.

 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has the lead in driving forward UK sustainable development policy.

In that way we can ensure that sustainable development is integrated into decision making across Government, including in my office.

 The information requested by my right hon. Friend which is readily available from central records is listed in the table. In several cases contracts are still running and a final cost figure cannot yet be provided. Expenditure within some contracts cannot be precisely estimated, because it is affected by volume of business or because the contracts concerned allow the development of solutions to changing business requirements not originally foreseeable. In no contracts were consultants retained (or are there plans to retain consultants) beyond completion of their assigned tasks.

 Sections 7 to 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 make provision for strengthening patient and public consultation and involvement in the operation of the national health service. Local authority overview and scrutiny committees will scrutinise the NHS including decisions on local NHS reorganisations and service change. NHS bodies will have a statutory duty to make arrangements with a view to securing that the public are involved in and consulted on the planning of NHS services and decisions affecting the operation of those services. We intend to build on these foundations to make sure patients and the public are at the heart of shaping and developing NHS services in the future.

<a name="10717w09.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has on-line access to the World Health Organisation (WHO) data on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and routinely evaluates these data.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his assessment is of the therapeutic value of antidepressants compared with placebos.  [2377]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w09.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> There is a large scientific literature that indicates that antidepressant medication is superior in efficacy to placebo. This is particularly the case where depression is more severe. Placebos have been noted to be of some benefit and there is a range of so-called non-specific factors (care, interest and attention from the clinician) which are relevant.
<P>

<a name="10717w09.html_para6">An example is the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Research Program in the United States reported in the mid 1990s. They compared two forms of psychotherapy, antidepressant medication (imipramine) and placebo. The latter two treatments also involved "clinical management" which included a weekly meeting with the clinician to discuss symptoms, side effects and progress. For mild depression no significant differences were found between the treatment groups. However for the more severely affected patients the antidepressant treatment was the most effective.
<P>

<a name="10717w09.html_para7">Early studies with tricyclic antidepressant drugs showed that 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. of patients with depression will respond to antidepressant drug treatment as compared with 15 per cent. to 30 per cent. of those treated with placebo. The response to antidepressant medication will take at least two weeks but in some cases up to four weeks or more. The newer antidepressant drugs have been shown to have similar, but not greater, efficacy to the older style medications. The advantage of the newer drugs lies in lower toxicity and different side effects.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2001]:</i> Details of the appraisal process are a matter for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. NICE has recently published details of the process, including a full description of the selection of experts. Experts are now nominated by stakeholder bodies, and the selection is made by the chairman of the appraisal committee using published criteria.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> Prior to 5 April 1999, National Health Service trusts had responsibility for collecting charges for hospital treatment following road traffic accidents under the provisions of sections 157 and 158 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The system changed with the introduction of the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999, which came into effect on 5 April 1999 and there is now a new centralised recovery system, which is undertaken by the Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU). The table gives income collected for the last three years during which the system for recovery changed.

 Losses to fraud in the National Health Service have fallen since the creation of the NHS Counter Fraud Service (CFS) in 1998 and will continue to fall. The NHS CFS have achieved a reduction of &#163;48 million in losses to patient fraud within pharmaceutical services and have recovered over &#163;5 million within cases of fraud by pharmaceutical contractors.

We will continue to work closely with all the associations representing those that deliver or use NHS services.

 We have today issued draft guidance and directions on implementing free nursing care in England and copies have been placed in the Library.

 The UK is working within the middle east peace process to support the building of the Palestinian nation's ability to generate economic and social development that benefits the poor. DFID's support includes technical assistance to increase Palestinian capacity to negotiate with the Israelis on economic and other issues to build institutions and to improve health, education and water and sanitation services. DFID has recently approved a contribution of &#163;1.5 million to the World bank's emergency employment generation programme to the West bank and Gaza Strip, aimed at protecting vulnerable groups from falling further into poverty.

A report by the Office of the United Nations Special Co-ordinator for the period 28 September to 26 November 2000, estimated that confrontations, mobility restrictions, and border closures are costing the Palestinian economy at least US$8 million per day.

 We have serious concerns with the Israeli policy of closures on political, legal and humanitarian grounds.

They cannot, therefore, achieve their stated purpose. We continue to urge Israel to lift the closures, bilaterally, in ministerial and official level meetings, and collectively with our EU partners in statements and in the political dialogue established by the EU-Israel Association Agreement.

<a name="10717w12.html_para5">Lifting the closures also forms part of the Mitchell Committee recommendations. It is vital that the parties move ahead with full and early implementation of those recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w14.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 No specific arrangements are currently in place systematically to follow up asylum seekers who fail to comply with procedures without providing a reasonable explanation to ascertain reasons underlying their failure to comply. We are, however, always open to looking at our procedures to ensure that any genuine difficulties applicants have in complying with them are minimised.
<P>

<a name="10717w14.html_para0">The main reasons for non-compliance refusals are failure, without reasonable explanation, to attend on time an interview connected with the asylum claim or to complete and return a statement of evidence form (SEF) within 10 working days. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) does take account of events outside the asylum seeker's control, for example the serious disruption to rail travel experienced as a result of flooding earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="10717w14.html_para1">We have made some changes in recent months; for example, a PO box number was introduced to act as a single point for the return of all SEFs to IND, and the explanatory note accompanying the SEF has been translated into 33 of the main languages used by asylum seekers. We are monitoring the effect of these changes closely.

<a name="10717w15.html_para0">The information is held on the Home Office's Homicide Index database. This records drug involvement when (i) either the suspect is reported to be under the influence of drugs at the time of the offence or (ii) the homicide is motivated by the need to obtain drugs, or money to buy drugs or is drug related in some other way, such as rivalry between dealers etc. Data have only been collected since 1995 for each police force area in England and Wales, and include information recorded as at 11 September 2000 when recording was closed for publication purposes. The data do not include homicide where there is no suspect and relate only to those homicides where a suspect is convicted of murder. Cases in the latest year may not have been dealt with by the courts and would not be included.
<P>

<a name="10717w15.html_para1">These data may contain some error due to the largely subjective interpretation of 'drugs related' and the amount of information available to the police on the motive for a particular homicide, varying from case to case. A current review of the Homicide Index is aiming to increase the accuracy of data on homicide.

 Our corruption legislation applies to both the public and the private sector and makes it an offence for a person in this country to bribe someone who is an agent for another person. The term "agent" is defined to include someone who is employed by, or acts for, another irrespective of their nationality. Thus it is unlawful in this country to bribe a foreign agent. The definition of the term "agent" also includes a person serving under the Crown or any local or public authority. The planned legislation on corruption will make it clear that the offence extends to a person acting on behalf of a foreign Government.

The methodology used has been validated by HM Inspector of Fire Services in order to ensure consistency across the area and with other fire authorities.

Parents can fulfil this duty either by their child attending school regularly or otherwise. Some parents elect to educate their children at home. Local education authorities have a duty to monitor the suitability of the education being received by a home educated child by virtue of section 437 (1) of the 1996 Act and can issue a School Attendance Order if they are not satisfied that a child is receiving suitable education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the pattern of military low-flying activity in the United Kingdom during the training year 2000&#150;01.  [4977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w17.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The ability to fly fast and low continues to be an essential skill in our armoury of tactics. Training for aircrew to achieve and maintain these skills is vital.
<P>

<a name="10717w17.html_para1">The amount of low-flying training carried out in the UK Low Flying System during the training year April 2000 to March 2001 was the minimum necessary for aircrew to reach and maintain these skills. Hours booked for low-flying training during this period amounted to a small decrease (of 66 hours, or less than 1 per cent.) compared to the previous training year. Since detailed records of hours booked began in 1995, the total overall has reduced by over 36 per cent. (24,360 hours) with fixed wing activity showing the greatest reduction.
<P>

<a name="10717w17.html_para2">The distribution of low-flying training across the UK has not changed significantly. We continue to try and spread it as widely as practicable, but for a variety of operational, geographical and climatic constraints some parts of the country will see more than others.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w18.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Vis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on progress with the police investigation into the destruction of rifles pertinent to the Bloody Sunday inquiry.  [4979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The police investigation into the unauthorised destruction of possible Bloody Sunday rifles announced in my answer of 17 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 648W, was completed in April 2001. The Bloody Sunday inquiry has been fully informed of the progress of the investigation and asked, at the outset, that the scope of the investigation be widened to establish the histories and whereabouts of the 29 weapons originally examined by the Widgery inquiry in 1972.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para0">The police investigation revealed, for the first time, that the partial serial numbers provided by the Bloody Sunday inquiry generate 60 possible permutations for the 29 weapons originally sought by the inquiry. The report therefore reveals that the information on which my answer of 17 February 2000 was based, although provided in good faith, was inaccurate and incomplete.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para1">By establishing detailed audit trails for all 60 weapons, the police have been able to recover 14 weapons and confirmed that 29 have been destroyed. The police were unable to confirm the existence or whereabouts of the remaining 17 weapons, some of which have been sold, complete or in parts. Others may have either been destroyed prior to the creation of the computer record or manufactured and delivered to customers overseas.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para2">The self-loading rifle (SLR) was declared obsolete in November 1997. A routine disposal programme involving the sale and destruction of the weapons was in progress from January 1998, although some surplus rifles were disposed of prior to this date. At the time of the inquiry's request the disposal programme was reducing stock by 4,000 weapons a month with the aim of completing disposal by April 2000. By the end of January 2000 approximately 116,000 SLRs had been disposed of out of a total of 144,000.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para3">The dates on which weapons that "match" the partial serial numbers provided by the Bloody Sunday inquiry were destroyed are as follows:

<a name="10717w18.html_para6">By September 1999, when the inquiry made a formal request for weapons and provided partial serial numbers, the Ministry of Defence held six weapons but was able to identify only five as Bloody Sunday "possible". Two of these weapons identified as Bloody Sunday weapons, together with a third weapon that had not been identified, were destroyed in a routine disposal programme on 26 and 27 January 2000. The destruction only came to light after the event when the computer database was updated. My answer of 17 February 2000 incorrectly stated the dates at which the computer record was updated, rather than the actual dates of destruction.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para7">The police report concluded that the weapons were destroyed as a result of a combination of factors including inaccurate computer records, duplicated serial numbers and mistakes resulting from human error rather than an overt criminal act. Based on the police report, I am satisfied that there was no conspiracy to destroy evidence sought by the inquiry. The matter has now been referred to the chain of command to implement management improvements designed to prevent a recurrence and to determine whether any internal disciplinary action needs to be taken.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para8">The evidence contained in the report suggests that the destroyed rifles would have been of little value to the inquiry due to duplicated serial numbers and the lack of certainty that any individual weapon was fired on Bloody Sunday. However, the police report indicates a strong possibility that a L42A1 7.62mm sniper rifle conversion can be matched to a Bloody Sunday weapon. The whereabouts of this weapon were unknown when the report was produced, but it has now been recovered by the MDP. The police investigation also confirmed that it is not possible to determine whether any rifles have retained their original barrels as large numbers of rifles were re-barrelled during the 30 or so years that the weapons remained in operational service. Detailed records were not kept to record whether a rifle had been re-barelled, or how many times this may have occurred.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para9">The Bloody Sunday inquiry will reach its own view as to the potential forensic value of the weapons.

<P>
<a name="10717w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We have a good record on the safety and security of our nuclear weapons and continue to place the highest importance on work in this area. I have today placed in the Library of both Houses a table which sets 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2001 : Column: 141W</I><P>
out the circumstances of each of the seven accidents concerned. The information it contains is drawn from records spanning a period of 40 years and confirms that:
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There has never been a weapons accident resulting in the release of radioactive material;
<P>

there has never been damage to a weapon which risked a radioactive leak or an explosion;
<P>
<BR>
there has never been a nuclear weapon lost.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10717w18.html_para11">In addition to the three road traffic accidents referred to in the table, our research has identified one other, similar, event which took place in 1960 in Lincolnshire. There is no damage to the weapon involved. Since this event pre-dates current reporting system it is unclear whether, in today's terms, it would be categorised as an accident.
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para12">The Government remain committed to greater openness on nuclear issues wherever possible. A key responsibility, however, must be to protect the safety and operational security of our nuclear forces and the people who support them. The practice of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons at any particular place and at any particular time will therefore continue to be a cornerstone of the Government's policy on nuclear weapons issues.

<P>
<a name="10717w18.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 On 21 June, the Ministry of Defence published a detailed paper entitled: 'Report of a Reconnaissance Visit to Develop an Enhanced Environmental Monitoring Programme in the UK Sector in Kosovo', which discusses the findings of a MOD reconnaissance team visit to Kosovo from 19&#150;23 January to plan work, conduct field measurements and take preliminary samples. The field measurements supported the view that the risks from DU to our troops, and the population, are low. Analysis of some soil samples was delayed, as a result of potential asbestos contamination, however the information will be available for publication in the next few weeks. A copy of the team's report is available on the MOD internet website: www.mod.uk/ index.php3?page=2739 and a copy will be placed in the Library of the House.

 A rigorous and extensive research, survey and clearance operation was initially undertaken between 1993 and 1997 to confirm, as far as reasonably practicable, the removal of explosives from the Bull Point land area and adjacent River Tamar. Subsequently, further survey and clearance operations were conducted, using experts in the field and state of the art technology, in order to establish safe working conditions as a prerequisite to the dredging for the Remote Ammunitioning Facility Tamar (RAFT).
<P>

<a name="10717w18.html_para14">The explosive items have remained submerged and incident free for in excess of 50 years. All the clearance operations conducted to date have been completed without incident, including riverbed blasting in support of RAFT.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2001]:</i> As part of the Future Aircraft Carrier Assessment phase, contractors have visited several naval bases and port facilities to analyse their suitability for berthing and basing of the vessels. One of the issues addressed has been access and the requirement, if any, for dredging. Discussions to date have only been of an informal nature and no decisions have yet been made on berthing or basing options for the carriers and any potential dredging requirements. Further studies, involving environmental impact assessments, will take place during the next stage of assessment. The relevant authorities will be consulted on the results, as required.

 This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Ministry of Defence employs over 13,000 locally engaged civilian staff around the world. Their conditions of service, including pay levels, are set in accordance with the terms of the discretionary authority conferred by the Treasury on Departments. This ensures that pay levels are established by reference to local best practice. Periodic pay reviews must be informed by local surveys of comparable employers thus ensuring that MOD remuneration remains competitive. Locally engaged staff play a vital role in support of the British armed forces overseas and it is in the MOD's interests to ensure that it is able to recruit and retain adequate numbers of the right calibre.

<a name="10717w21.html_para4">I am convinced that there is an advantage for Scotland to be sold along with the rest of the UK. This is particularly true from long haul markets where a visit to Scotland will almost certainly be part of a tour of Britain, where Scotland could easily be left out if it is not clearly visible among the other choices.

 I have regular discussions with Scottish Executive Ministers and Government colleagues on a wide range of issues. The Government have set a target for the UK of 10 per cent. for the proportion of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2010. Electricity generation in Scotland already exceeds this level and the Scottish Renewable Obligations will bring the figure to 13 per cent. by 2003. The target will then be to increase use of renewable energy in Scotland by a further 5 per cent. to 18 per cent. by 2010.

 The Lord Chancellor has not issued any guidance as the decision on whether defendants should wear handcuffs in court is a matter for the judiciary. The Court of Appeal has ruled that no prisoner shall be handcuffed in court unless there are reasonable grounds for believing he will be violent or try to escape. It is open to the prosecution to make an application for handcuffs if they believe a defendant will be violent or try to escape, but the final decision lies with the judge or magistrates.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment she has made of the benefits of introducing contingency fees as a method of payment for lawyers in personal injury cases.  [2619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w23.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 None. Contingency fees are used legitimately in many tribunals and for non-contentious business and have their supporters and detractors. The Law Society and the Bar Council are working together to consider how, if properly regulated, contingency fees might be used more widely to benefit clients and extend access to justice. The Government have no plans to extend the use of contingency fees.

 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor is keen that the social composition of the magistracy reflects the community it serves, subject to all magistrates fulfilling the merit criteria for appointment. Advisory committees are required to ensure that benches reflect the community in terms of gender, ethnic origin, geographical spread, occupation and political affiliation. My noble Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster requires his advisory committees to do the same. Work is under way to develop a national strategy for the recruitment of lay magistrates and to find a viable alternative to the use of political affiliation as a measure of social balance.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will place a list of the reasons for the increase in the value of the Libra project in the Library; if liquidated damages clauses are included in the contract for the Libra project; and if he will place a copy of the contract in the Library.  [3818]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The increase in the cost of the Libra project is based on delivery of an additional four years of the full Libra service to all magistrates' courts and an earlier delivery of the first part of the Libra service&#151;office automation. A liquidated damages clause is included in the contract. As the contract contains commercially confidential information, it would not be appropriate to make it available in the Library.

 The new Northern Ireland Police Fund, based on the recommendations in the Patten report, and the subsequent report carried out by Mr. John Steele, will provide assistance to police officers (who have been murdered or injured as a direct result of terrorism in Northern Ireland), their families and dependants. Indeed, lump sum payments of over &#163;4 million have already been paid to a group of RUC widows widowed before 25 November 1982. Detailed work on the legal status of the fund, as well as on its funding, is continuing and the Government hope to announce the names of trustees shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the cause of disturbances in Ardoyne, Belfast from 20 June; how many civilians and police were injured on each night of the disturbances; how many plastic bullets were fired; what tactics were employed by the police to defuse tensions; what public statements were made by the RUC concerning the protection of children; how many arrests have been made and what the perceived community origin and ages were of those arrested; and how many <i>(a)</i> alleged rioters and <i>(b)</i> police officers were involved in the disturbances.

<P>
<a name="10717w25.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The serious public disorder in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast arose from a series of sectarian incidents that were themselves the result of the continuing sectarian tensions in this part of the city.
<P>

<a name="10717w25.html_para0">During the period 20&#150;25 June 2001, 62 police officers and 11 civilians were injured. Eight plastic baton rounds were fired.
<P>

<a name="10717w25.html_para1">The Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable, the Assistant Chief Constable for Belfast, the local police commander and other officers made almost daily statements through the media with the emphasis being on the safety of the whole community including children. These sought to make absolutely clear the damage being done to the entire community, by a minority on each side, and to urge local leaders and people of influence to try to calm the disorder. Police spoke with political representatives and community activists on both sides of the community in an effort to defuse the situation and to encourage them to use whatever influence they had to resolve the differences. The Army was deployed at interface areas and the level of police patrolling was increased to (a) provide reassurance to both sections of the community and (b) to prevent clashes between both sections of the community.

 Mr. Stokes died on 3 November 1997. The Coroner's inquest has not yet been completed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> I recognise that there have been delays in the payment of compensation to farmers whose animals have been compulsorily slaughtered because of foot and mouth disease, and that when the disease was at its peak during April and May these delays could be extensive. However, the time taken to pay compensation claims has been reduced and we are now in a position to pay claims within three weeks of receiving complete documentation.
<P>

<a name="10717w25.html_para4">Information on average payment times for compensation for anything, including fodder, seized by the Department for the purpose of preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease, and payment times for the costs of cleansing and disinfecting affected farm premises where farmers have chosen to do this work themselves under the Department's supervision could be obtained only at disproportionate cost because of the number of payments involved and the fact that the records are not held centrally.

<P>
<P>

 No carcases are stored pending rendering. Most carcases are rendered on the day that they are delivered to the plant. Sometimes for operational reasons carcases may be held overnight at plants before being rendered on the following day or held overnight at carcase collection centres before being delivered to rendering plants. However, most carcases will be rendered within 24 hours of delivery to the plant.

<P>
<a name="10717w25.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Ash will only be removed from pyre sites in cases where it is not possible to bury it on site. We estimate that there are at least 45 pyre sites in Cumbria that fall into this category.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w25.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 For compensation purposes, the Animal Health Act 1981 stipulates the value of an animal as being its value immediately before it became affected with foot and mouth disease or, if not so affected, its value immediately before it was slaughtered. Standard valuations were set out in regulations in order to speed up the slaughter process, but farmers retained the right to request an individual valuation of their stock.

<P>
<a name="10717w25.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2001]:</i> Complaints about the conduct of the military are likely to have been addressed to a number of different points within DEFRA and also the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w25.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's top priority has always been to eradicate the disease.

At every opportunity we have emphasised the need for everyone consistently to take stringent precautions to avoid further spread.
<P>

<a name="10717w25.html_para9">However for those who have had no contact with animals or affected premises for at least seven days, the risk is considerably lower. The advice to walkers is consistent with the biosecurity message and includes: observe closed signs; use disinfectant troughs where provided; keep your dog on a lead where there are

<a name="10717w26.html_wqn4"><B> Tom Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place to <i>(a)</i> stop wild birds of prey being illegally sold in the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> detect and prosecute those responsible for the illegal sale of wild birds of prey; and what further action is planned.  [4167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> Legislation is already in place prohibiting the sale of most birds of prey species, unless a licence has been issued by my Department or one of the devolved Administrations. People found guilty of sales offences could face an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years.
<P>

<a name="10717w26.html_para0">Responsibility for enforcing the controls rests primarily with the police service. Most forces now have at least one part-time Wildlife Liaison Officer who would normally investigate these offences. The Department actively supports investigating officers, by providing information about the licences and permits it has issued, and from its bird registration system. It also manages a panel of Wildlife Inspectors, who check compliance with certain wildlife controls.
<P>

<a name="10717w26.html_para1">The Department also co-chairs the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime, comprising all the main Government and voluntary organisations committed to combating crimes against wildlife. The Partnership is taking forward a range of initiatives to raise awareness of wildlife crime and to support the work of police officers. One of its main priorities is to take forward work to establish a dedicated unit to tackle wildlife crime at national level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will instruct the Environment Agency to commence work immediately on the flood defence schemes for Northbridge street and Rutley close, Robertsbridge.  [3858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10717w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> The Department has policy responsibility for flood and coastal defence and provides grant aid for capital works that meet certain criteria. However operational responsibility, including decisions on which projects to promote and their timing, rests with local operating authorities, such as the Environment Agency. I understand that the Agency is building on the findings of the pre-feasibility study of flooding problems in Robertsbridge, by commissioning a feasibility study to develop the outline design for suitable flood defences. The study will include consideration of flood defences for Northbridge street and Rutley close. Depending on the results of the study, I understand that the Environment Agency plans to commence works at Robertsbridge in summer 2002.

 The Government received advice on the implications of cloning for farm animals in a report by the Farm Animal Welfare Council (published December 1998). Since then, the Government have established the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC). Its remit includes providing strategic advice on the ethical and social aspects of developments in biotechnology, and on their public acceptability. An AEBC sub-group is currently exploring the subject of animals and biotechnology with the aim of providing a report to Government early next year. This may include consideration of the issue of the welfare of cloned animals. More generally, the Office of Science and Technology commissioned a consultation exercise on public attitudes to biotechnology in 1998&#150;99, which included questions on the public perception of animal cloning.

 The number of veterinary surgeons (full-time equivalents) employed by the State Veterinary Service (SVS) since January 1995 are shown in the table (figures for May are not readily accessible, other than those for 2001 which are given). The Veterinary Investigation Service became part of the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) on 1 October 1995 and is not included in these figures from that date. In 2000, there were 99 veterinarians employed by the VLA. Much of the information presented here previously appeared on 27 February 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 323&#150;24W.
<P>

<a name="10717w27.html_para0">Of the 286 full-time equivalent veterinarians employed by the State Veterinary Service in 2001 as a whole, 220 veterinarians are employed as field veterinary officers. The work of these officers is supplemented by about 100 Temporary Veterinary Inspectors (TVIs) from the private sector in normal times.

 Following consultation with the industry my Department carried out the June Census on 1 June 2001 as originally planned. The decision to proceed was carefully considered. There is a need to be sensitive to the pressures the farming community is facing as a result of the Foot and Mouth outbreak, yet gather good information to help underpin policies for recovery.
<P>

<a name="10717w27.html_para1">Regarding alteration of the questions, the need for continuity of the statistical series and our legal obligations to collect certain details meant there were no changes to the census form. Consideration is currently being given to the collection of supplementary information relating to the wider impact of the outbreak upon farmers and the short, medium and longer term effects.

<sup>(25)</sup> The accrual rates shown are based on a 49-year working life, expressed in current terms. Unlike SERPS, which has an accrual rate of 20 per cent, the accrual rate for state second pension varies depending on income. State second pension concentrates the most help on the lowest paid. For example, a person earning &#163;6,000 a year through their working life would get &#163;59 a week from state second pension, &#163;46 more than they would have received from SERPS. <P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> The cost of saving a tonne of carbon from the promotion of biodiesel varies considerably depending on the type of feedstock used for biodiesel production and its additional production cost relative to mineral diesel.

<a name="10717w29.html_para2">Between 1996 and 2000 the UK average street price for cocaine varied between &#163;65 and &#163;77 per gram, while the average price for heroin varied between &#163;65 and &#163;74. There is no direct correlation between variations in street price and the value of seizures.

<a name="10717w29.html_para3">Street prices can vary for a number of reasons. While law enforcement activity can have an impact, factors such as variances in the yield of drug crops, consumption trends, drug purity levels and stockpiling by distributors can also affect the price of drugs on the street.

 The Government intend to bring forward legislation on community investment tax credits in the Finance Bill 2002.

The consultation period closed on July 2 and generated a largely positive response. The Government will announce decisions on the outcome of the consultation in due course. There will be robust processes for monitoring the effectiveness of any scheme.
