<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn0"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what the policy of the United Kingdom Government is on requesting extradition of individuals accused of torturing British nationals abroad, in the absence of a pending prosecution in the country where the accused is located.  [137834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The courts of England and Wales may have jurisdiction in respect of an offence committed abroad if the offender, or the victim, is a British national. Once such jurisdiction is established then the procedures for investigating and prosecuting the case are the same as for any case prosecuted in the courts of England and Wales. The police are responsible for investigating allegations of criminal offences and for obtaining admissible evidence to prove the alleged offence. The CPS is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations. The police ask the advice of the CPS before charging any person with a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="31117w01.html_para0">In complex and serious cases such as potential offences involving torture, the police will invariably consult with the CPS for advice on the sufficiency of the evidence before a person is charged. The CPS will consider each case that is passed to it by the police. Each case is carefully considered to assess whether it meets the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Once the CPS has decided to start a prosecution, if the alleged offender is located abroad the CPS will refer an application for extradition to the Secretary of State for the Home Department who will forward the request through the appropriate diplomatic channels.

<a name="31117w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Compensation Orders</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many compensation orders were awarded at <i>(a)</i> magistrates' courts and <i>(b)</i> Crown courts in each year since 2000; what the rate of default was in (i) each year and (ii) each court; and if he will make a statement.  [138451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Information on compensation orders in Magistrates' Courts has not been historically collected by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. However, the Home Office Criminal Statistics Publication (Table SI, 6(A)) shows that in 2000, 97,073 offenders were ordered to pay compensation (excluding summary motoring offences) and in 2001, 97,134 offenders were ordered to pay compensation (excluding summary 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 468W</I><P>
motoring offences). Information on the rate of default is not currently collected as compensation orders are measured with confiscation orders and other fines and not isolated. Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates' courts and the Crown Court. Debt collected includes compensation but also fees, fines, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not yet possible to separate out only compensation orders from the total. There are plans, however, to isolate compensation orders in debt analysis under the Libra Project from around Autumn 2004 onwards. This will involve the use of the Libra Application which is the new IT system being developed for the Magistrates' Courts.
<P>

<a name="31117w01.html_para1">Figures concerning the number of compensation orders made in the Crown Court for the years 2000&#150;02 are as follows. This information relates to defendants, not cases:

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many people were interviewed for the position of chair of the House of Lords Appointments Commission when it was first established.  [138519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 My Department is not responsible for the present House of Lords Appointments Commission, which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Cabinet Office. However, I understand that three people were interviewed for the post of chair when the Commission was first established.

<a name="31117w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Bailiffs</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn3"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many complaints have been made in each year since 1997 concerning the conduct of bailiffs; how many complaints have been investigated; how many complaints have resulted in a prosecution; how many convictions there were concerning the conduct of bailiffs; and if he will publish a list of banned bailiffs.  [136800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> My Department is responsible for county court bailiffs only. Any complaint involving a county court bailiff, unless of a serious nature, is dealt with by the county court that s/he is assigned to. There is no database kept on complaints against individual bailiffs.
<P>

<a name="31117w01.html_para3">There are Certificated Bailiffs who act in a private capacity. They are given their authority to do so for a period of two years, by their local county court judge, in accordance with the Distress for Rent Rules 1988. A complaint against a Certificated Bailiff is considered by a judge of the county court that granted the certificate. 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 469W</I><P>
If the certificate is revoked the Department will be informed. The information will be recorded on the Register of Certificated Bailiffs that is kept centrally. The Register is open to public search through a central point of contact. No data is retained longer than three years. In 2001 two certificates were cancelled, in 2002, 13 were cancelled, and in 2003 to date 17 have been cancelled. Any prosecution would be taken by the member of the public affected by the action of a certificated bailiff. There is no data kept by the county court or the Department centrally.

<a name="31117w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Bechtel</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn4"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will list the contracts for consultancy and other work carried out by Bechtel in each year since 1997 for the Lord Chancellor's Department, stating in each case <i>(a)</i> the nature of the work, <i>(b)</i> the value of the contract and <i>(c)</i> the duration of the contract; and if he will make a statement.  [137738]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 According to our records, since 1997 the Lord Chancellor's Department has not entered into a contract with Bechtel for consultancy or other work.

<a name="31117w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Departmental Costs</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the cost was to his Department and its predecessor of use for official business of <i>(a)</i> ministerial cars and drivers, <i>(b)</i> taxis, <i>(c)</i> train travel, <i>(d)</i> the use of helicopters, <i>(e)</i> airline tickets and <i>(f)</i> chartered aeroplanes in each year since 1997.  [123086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to the answer of the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office (Mr. Alexander) of 13 November 2003, 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 470W</I><P>
<i>Official Report</i>, column 397W, which deals with part <i>(a)</i> and <i>(f)</i> on behalf of my Department.
<P>

<a name="31117w01.html_para4">It is not possible to identify the Department's other travel costs without incurring disproportionate cost. The Department has published rules for official travel in its staff handbook and ministerial travel is governed by the Ministerial Code and Travel by Ministers.

<a name="31117w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Divorced Parents</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_wqn6"><B> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs pursuant to his answer of 22 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 631, on divorced parents, if he will collect separate figures for the numbers of <i>(a)</i> fathers and <i>(b)</i> mothers granted leave to remove their children from the United Kingdom.  [136098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There are no plans to collect the data requested. No children statistics distinguish between orders in favour of mothers and fathers and to collect figures in this area would incur disproportionate cost. Figures are kept of the total number of orders made under section 13 of the Children Act 1989 for removal from the jurisdiction since 2000 (when figures were first collected). Separate figures are not held for mothers and fathers, though 333 such orders were made in 2002.

<a name="31117w02.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a very complex disorder with both genetic and environmental components to its aetiology. There is established evidence that medication is an effective mainstay of management and should be used within an overall package of care and support. This package should include advice around management of behaviour for parents, carers and teachers. Considerable local expertise is available through the child and adolescent mental health teams. If specific non-drug behavioural therapies are used this would be at the discretion of the clinicians.

 Although there is evidence of some genetic component to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the majority of cases are associated with smoking, exposure to air pollution, including that caused by environmental tobacco smoke, and lung damage arising from respiratory infections.
<P>

<a name="31117w03.html_para2">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety published a five year Tobacco Action Plan in July 2003. The Plan addresses a number of key issues, including prevention, helping smokers to quit and protecting the public from tobacco smoke.

[138726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w03.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There are 14 countries and territories currently designated for the purposes of exchangeable licences in Northern Ireland, namely Australia, Austria, Barbados, the Republic of Cyprus, Finland, Gibraltar, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and Zimbabwe, and the territories of Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands.
<P>

<a name="31117w03.html_para3">In determining the suitability of a country for exchange purposes, the driver testing and licensing systems are assessed, to ensure that the drivers meet standards that are comparable to those in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<a name="31117w03.html_para4">With regard to the Republic of South Africa (RSA), it is accepted that the nature of the driving test and the general driving standards are comparable to those in Northern Ireland.

indicate whether it has been issued in exchange for a licence from a third country. This is important since the standards in that third country may not have been assessed against Northern Ireland standards.
<P>

<a name="31117w03.html_para5">The Department of the Environment is continuing to assess the suitability of licences from RSA for exchange. The Department is also developing proposals to amend the relevant legislation to enable selective recognition of licences from other countries so that, for example, licences which had been issued in exchange for a licence from a third country, which does not meet Northern Ireland standards, could be excluded from the exchange arrangements. This will bring exchange arrangements in Northern Ireland into line with those in Great Britain. Depending on the availability of legislative opportunities, it is hoped to have the amendment in place before the end of 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w03.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the impact of illegal coursing on the population of the Irish hare in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="31117w03.html_para6">The Irish Hare Species Action Plan, published by the Department of the Environment in 2000, identifies the need to carry out regular surveys of the Irish hare population in Northern Ireland. The purpose of these surveys is to estimate the size of the population and make deductions about the causes of any movement in the estimated numbers. A baseline survey was completed in 1997; this was followed by "The Northern Ireland Irish Hare Survey 2002", carried out by Professor Montgomery's research team at The Queen's University of Belfast. The Department will carry out regular, similar research into surveys of the Irish hare population to measure progress against the Species Action Plan targets "to maintain the existing range and to demonstrate a population increase by 2005; and to double the present population by 2010 over as much of the range as possible". The next of the surveys will be commissioned in spring 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 The setting, measuring and monitoring of Wales Office's performance targets is an integral part of the job of all managers. It is not possible to disaggregate the cost. The Wales Office Management Board regularly reviews targets. It consists of the eight most senior people in the Department. Their grades are 3 (one person), 6 (four people) and 7 (three people).

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many cases of work-related stress have been reported in his Department in each of the last three years; how much compensation has been paid to employees; how many work days have been lost due to work-related stress, and at what cost, what procedures have been put in place to reduce work-related stress, and at what cost; and if he will make a statement.  [136852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 Detailed sick absence statistics are derived from medical and self-certificates, which are completed by staff or their GPs. While certain illnesses, such as "depression", "anxiety", "general debility" and even "stress" may be indicated on certificates, it is not possible to determine levels of "work-related stress". Consequently, we have no details on the number of working days lost due to work-related stress or the cost to the Department.
<P>

<a name="31117w04.html_para1">The Wales Office staff have available to them the resources of the National Assembly, and since June 2003, of the Department for Constitutional Affairs in tackling stress. These include a range of stress management courses for both line managers and employees, Health, Safety and Welfare intranet site, a stress handbook for line managers, and a fully trained in-house Welfare service.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what measures are in place to protect the <i>(a)</i> values and <i>(b)</i> benefits of pension fund schemes created by the former publicly owned industries.  [138651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w04.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Responsibility for the pension fund schemes created by the former publicly owned industries is a matter for the relevant sponsor Departments, or their successors, and the successor companies themselves. More generally, however, we have proposed a range of protection measures which will apply to the pension funds created by the former publicly owned industries in the same way as they will to those of any other privately owned company.
<P>

<a name="31117w04.html_para4">Through the introduction of the new Pension Protection Fund, we are taking action to make sure that members of defined benefit schemes will still have the secure retirement they were expecting. The Government has also published and consulted on draft regulations

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will introduce legislation to prevent employers from taking contribution holidays from their employees' pension fund schemes.  [137921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w04.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 No.
<P>

<a name="31117w04.html_para5">Since pension provision by employers is voluntary, the levels of contributions are a matter for agreement between pension scheme trustees and sponsoring employers.
<P>

<a name="31117w04.html_para6">Under the new scheme-specific funding regime which will replace the Minimum Funding Requirement, trustees and sponsoring employers will be required to develop and agree, with the scheme actuary's advice, the funding principles for their scheme&#151;including a determination of whether the level of contributions is sufficient to meet a scheme's long-term pension commitments.
<P>

<a name="31117w04.html_para7">The new simplified tax regime for approved pension schemes (set out in the document "Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice and flexibility for all" (December 2002)) would abolish the rules requiring approved occupational pension schemes to run off their surplus funds (for example by agreeing contributions holidays) or lose their full tax exempt status. In addition, the document "Action on Occupational Pensions" announced that pension funds will no longer be able to make payments of surplus to employers from an actuarial surplus only where the scheme was funded above a level sufficient to secure full buy-out of scheme liabilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w04.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We want every pensioner to take up their entitlement. At the heart of our marketing campaign is a direct mail pack to all pensioner households who have not been converted to pension credit automatically. We will have written to all pensioner households by June 2004. To support this process we are running an advertising campaign on TV, radio and in the press to encourage pensioners to apply.
<P>

<a name="31117w04.html_para8">The Pension Service Local Service are also playing a key role in take-up of pension credit, particularly in encouraging pensioners who traditionally do not take up their entitlement to apply. Working closely with key partners such as Citizens Advice, Age Concern and local authorities and with local voluntary organisations the local service reach these pensioners at locations that suit their needs. Activities being undertaken include awareness sessions, information surgeries and take-up campaigns. Over this month the Local Service has held or plans to hold over 1,300 events which are expected to reach around 117,000 people.

 Pension credit is making a real difference to the lives of millions of pensioners. As the Secretary of State reported on 11 November, at the end of October there were already 1.97 million pensioner households, around 2.3 million individuals, receiving pension credit. And 1.2 million households, around 1.4 million individuals, are now receiving more money than they did before, with the average award being &#163;47.10 per week, <i>Official Report</i>, 11 November 2003, column 18WS.

<a name="31117w06.html_para4">The latest projections of the full cost of pension credit (guarantee credit and savings credit) to 2050 are published on page 148, Annex 3 of the Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' (cm 5677). Based on a number of assumptions about the future, as set out in Annex 3, this shows that pension credit expenditure could rise to around one and a half per cent. of GDP by 2050.
<P>

<a name="31117w06.html_para5">One of the assumptions used was that on average, income brought to account in the pension credit would increase in line with average earnings.
<P>

<a name="31117w06.html_para6">The Pensioners' Incomes Series 2001&#150;02, based on Family Resources Survey and Family Expenditure Survey data, shows that average pensioner incomes between 1979 and 1996&#150;97 rose by 64 per cent. in real terms, compared to average earnings growth in the whole economy of 36 per cent. in real terms. More recent growth estimates are subject to uncertainty, but the growth in average pensioner incomes between 1994&#150;95 and 2001&#150;02 was around 23 per cent. in real terms, higher than average earnings (up 12 per cent. over the same period).
<P>

<a name="31117w06.html_para7">Robust projections of future spending on pension credit, housing benefit for pensioners and council tax benefit for pensioners, based on alternative assumptions, and in different years, are not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However Table 2 provides a broad indication, of the likely relative costs in 2050 under alternative scenarios of pension credit uprating and pensioner income growth.

<a name="31117w06.html_para10">The long-term cost of pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit will also depend greatly on the decisions made by future governments in annual uprating statements.

Following the introduction of pension credit, the Government will be spending an additional &#163;9.2 billion on pensioners in 2004&#150;05 as a result of measures introduced since 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many students awarded service scholarships, undergraduate bursaries and cadetships, who were due to enter military colleges in the past five years, have withdrawn from the scheme; how many of those who have withdrawn repaid in full funds advanced to them prior to their withdrawal; whether the armed forces continue to pursue those who have not repaid sums received; and how much has been written off in each of the past five years.

<P>
<P>

 Those awarded university cadetships or bursaries are required, as a condition of the offer, to agree to refund the costs of the cadetship or bursary should they fail to complete five years (cadetships) or three years (bursaries) productive service (six years for Medical Cadetships and the RAF Flying Branch). Each case is considered on its merits, but it is the Department's normal practice to seek to recover its appropriate outlay when the specified return of service is not given, through a decision to leave the Service attributable to the individual. Salary payments are not recovered in respect of cadetships. Allowance is not made for time served except in respect of uniform costs. Recovery is not sought from those individuals whose service, or bursary, is terminated through no fault of their own (e.g. on medical grounds) and may be waived in whole or part on compassionate grounds or in other exceptional circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment his Department has made of the <i>(a)</i> quantity, <i>(b)</i> spread and <i>(c)</i> location of (i) mines, (ii) unexploded cluster bomb submunitions and (iii) unexploded conventional munitions in Iraq; what efforts are (A) planned and (B) underway to locate, defuse and remove these munitions; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="31117w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The provision of a safe, secure and risk free environment for the Iraqi people is a key aspect of restoration activity for all members of the International Coalition in Iraq. The United Kingdom takes seriously its obligations as a member of that coalition to deal with unexploded ordnance. Unexploded ordnance in Iraq includes munitions from the Iran-Iraq war, mines laid by Iraqi forces, stores of ammunition and other ordnance left by Iraqi military and paramilitary forces as well as ordnance fired or dropped by both sides during recent hostilities.
<P>

<a name="31117w10.html_para0">Since the end of major combat operations UK and other Coalition forces have been engaged in clearing sites containing unexploded ordnance. In the UK's area of responsibility an average of about 45 new sites have been discovered each week. Whenever a site is discovered UK forces mark the site and inform those in the vicinity. The munitions are then recovered or destroyed as soon as resources permit. To date around 1,600 sites have been cleared, containing about 619,000 munitions. We do not record individual types of munitions cleared.

[133320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Responsibility for the assessment and clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Afghanistan rests with that nation's ruling authorities. The majority of the assessment and the clearance of UXO is conducted by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) and commercial demining companies, in many cases working under the auspices of the United Nations. At the end of 2002, independent assessment showed that some 263 square kilometres of land had been cleared of UXO.
<P>

<a name="31117w10.html_para2">The Ministry of Defence carries out assessments of the quantity, spread and location of mines and UXO to ensure the force protection of our Service personnel or to counter any immediate threat to civilian life in Afghanistan.

 Companies in the UK are operating in an increasingly competitive, global marketplace. It is a commercial matter for companies to decide where to locate their operations.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The overall compliance costs to business are controlled within limits agreed by Treasury Ministers and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Each year ONS produces a Compliance Plan to help monitor and control the load on businesses of its statistical surveys. It also includes information on initiatives to minimise the form-filling load, such as the use of efficient and fair sampling procedures.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Between 1994 and 1997 compliance costs showed a progressive decrease. However from 1998 onwards compliance costs have risen steadily, as a result of the need for high quality statistics to capture changes in the economy, such as the development of E-commerce and the increasingly important service sector.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The latest compliance plan has calculated the compliance cost to business of ONS surveys in 2002 at &#163;28.9 million at 2002 prices, which was within the agreed limit. The figure is the same as 1995 in real terms.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Comparable statistics on cancer survival in the UK and most other EU countries have been produced in three studies funded by the European Commission (the EUROCARE studies).

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The results indicated that survival was generally highest in Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland, and lowest in Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Survival in the UK and Denmark was lower than in other western European countries for common tumours such as those of lung, breast, stomach, large bowel, prostate and kidney. However, international differences in survival were not large for tumours amenable to cytotoxic therapy, such as testicular cancer and Hodgkin's disease.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government plans for funding cancer research were published in the NHS Cancer Plan in September 2000; copies of which are available in the Library. The Plan acknowledged that "survival rates for many of the major cancers lag behind the rest of Europe".</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates for council taxes are based on the analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&#150;02" produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003.

It includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,500 households in the UK and sample sizes for pensioner households are only sufficient to give approximate estimates. The Family Resources Survey would have been an alternative source with a larger sample size, but the taxes and benefits analysis has been used for consistency with answers to other recent parliamentary questions.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will publish the Treasury's strategy for improving the level of financial literacy.  [136757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Raising standards of financial literacy is an important part of the Government's wider strategy to reduce social and financial exclusion, and promote appropriate participation in the financial services industry, while tackling overindebtedness, and promote saving. Financially literate, confident, and independent consumers also spur firms to offer high quality, value for money products and services, and promotes effective competition.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para0">A number of departments and agencies are active in achieving our ambitions. For example, we are the first Government to introduce a framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) that provides for personal finance education to be taught throughout Key Stages 1 to 4 of the school curriculum.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para1">We also work closely with the Financial Services Authority.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para2">In his 2002 Review of Medium and Long Term Saving Ron Sandier suggested that the FSA should lead and coordinate further work in this area. Partly in response to those proposals, the FSA announced on 20 October 2003 the membership of their Financial Capability Steering Group. This group will bring together government, consumer representatives, the industry, the media, and the regulator to develop and implement a national strategy for financial capability.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para3">The FSA has already delivered a great deal to help consumers and has fostered initiatives on financial literacy, working closely, for example, with the Personal Finance Education Group, which has undertaken valuable work on good practice I delivering personal finance teaching in schools. But the steering group announcement recognised that more needs to be done, to engage with and learn from the widest range of organisation.

 Mortgage based equity release schemes will be regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) with effect from 31 October 2004. On 11 November 2003, I published a consultation document seeking views on whether home reversion plans should come within the scope of FSA regulation.

<a name="31117w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The 2001 Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review recommended that the Government should consider the application of economic instruments as part of alternative funding streams for flood defence. We agree with the review's analysis and have therefore asked Defra to work up proposals as part of their Spending Review 2002 commitments. They have since consulted on a range of options, including a Floodplain Development Connection Charge to be levied on new developments in the floodplain. The work on this is still at a very early stage, and will be taken forward as part of Defra's new flood management strategy.

<P>
<a name="31117w15.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The UK Government believe that International Monetary Fund (IMF) support to low-income countries should work within its areas of competence to help these countries achieve the macroeconomic stability and supporting policy measures crucial to poverty reduction and delivery of the Millennium Development Goals. The IMF's chief form of support to low-income countries is through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which was created in 1999. This facility is designed to support country-led poverty reduction strategies, and the UK has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure that the IMF's work is based on these strategies.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para5">Discussions were held at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Dubai in September where my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer chaired the International Monetary and Finance Committee meetings. The Committee noted that faster growth will be needed in low-income countries in order to reduce poverty, and that this would require stronger policies and institutions, better governance and increased and more effective aid.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para6">The Committee observed that the IMF should remain engaged with these countries in the long-term, encouraging it to undertake further initiatives to support higher sustained growth and poverty reduction, improved governance, and reduced vulnerability to shocks. The IMF will prepare a number of Board papers on these issues, and the Committee looks forward to a review of progress at its next meeting.
<P>

<a name="31117w15.html_para7">The Committee also noted the need for increased and more effective aid, and for enhanced market access. The Committee urged the IMF to work with the World Bank on aid effectiveness, aid absorption, results-based measurement systems and financing mechanisms, including the International Finance Facility. Developing and emerging market countries are being consulted on this, and France will host an international conference in spring next year.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what role credit unions play in alleviating poverty in communities; and what role they <i>(a)</i> have and <i>(b)</i> will have in the future as part of New Deal for Communities.  [136289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w17.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Credit unions have an important role to play in tackling financial exclusion. By bridging the gap between mainstream financial services and those of limited means, credit unions make a real difference to the individuals and communities they serve.
<P>

<a name="31117w17.html_para9">New Deal for Communities (NDC) Partnerships have a broad remit to tackle issues of crime, worklessness, education, health and housing in the physical environment in some of our most deprived neighbourhoods. A number of NDC Partnerships have already done work to develop credit unions or are covered by credit unions that already exist in their area&#151;such as East Manchester NDC and Knowsley NDC&#151;and Partnerships will continue to do this in future where it is relevant to the needs of the neighbourhood. For example, in the Brent area there are currently on-going discussions between Camden Credit Union and South Kilburn NDC on the subject of Camden Credit Union extending their common bond to the NDC area.

 Local authorities are required by statute to respond to a completed application for disabled facilities grant within six months. The Government do not collect information on the average waiting times for these grants.
<P>

<a name="31117w17.html_para10">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, jointly with the Department of Health, has issued draft guidance to local authorities setting out best practice in delivering a first class housing adaptations service for disabled people. This includes target times for the complete delivery process including needs assessment, processing of the application and the completion of building works. These target times will depend on the complexity of, and priority attached to, individual cases but the guidance suggests that the maximum target time for the entire process should in any event be no more than 260 working days and only 80 working days in high priority cases. We are currently considering responses to this consultation and hope to issue final guidance to local housing and social service authorities early next year.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of whether the proposed referendums on elected regional assemblies give people living in the regions affected an opportunity for their regions to have similar powers to those of <i>(a)</i> the Scottish Parliament and <i>(b)</i> the Welsh Assembly.  [139126]<P>

<P>
<a name="31117w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Elected assemblies will be given powers over key regional issues, such as jobs, planning, housing, transport, culture and economic development. The Regional Governance White Paper, "Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions", sets out the Government's proposals and takes into account the functions that are best dealt with at a national, regional or local level. As the proposals relate to the English regions, the powers of the Greater London Authority are also a relevant consideration.
<P>

<a name="31117w18.html_para0">There are no plans to revisit the package as a matter of course, but there may be changes in the way some central Government functions are delivered. In developing policies, the Government will consider the opportunities offered by the creation of elected assemblies. For example, the Fire White Paper, "Our Fire and Rescue Service", announced that regional fire and rescue authorities will be established in those regions that choose to have elected assemblies.

 A variety of investment streams contribute to tackling and resolving homelessness but these have wider housing and social objectives too, and it is not possible to identify specific homelessness elements within all of them.
<P>

<a name="31117w18.html_para2">In March 2002, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published "More than a Roof", a report into tackling homelessness, which identified the problems and the steps that were needed in order to tackle homelessness in England. The Homelessness Directorate was established in the previous Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) in March 2002 and brought together the Rough Sleepers Unit, the Bed and Breakfast Unit and a new team to ensure effective implementation of new homelessness legislation and to assist local authorities (and voluntary agencies working with them) in the development of their strategies to tackle homelessness.

 The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 prohibits publication of any material relating to a referendum during the 28 days prior to the poll by any Minister of the Crown, Government Department or local authority. Therefore, the postal ballot for the proposed English regional assemblies will not include any such material. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has launched an information campaign to ensure that relevant information about the role and composition of Elected Regional Assemblies is made easily available in each of the three northern regions where referendums may be held. This includes an estimate of the costs of running elected assemblies and the savings to other public bodies whose staff transfer to the assembly.

 The Government's approach to the issue of child contact is based on the principle in the Children Act 1989, that in all decisions and arrangements about child contact, the child's best interests must be paramount. Figures from recent studies and surveys indicate as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>60 per cent. of non-resident parents agreed contact with the resident parent.
<P>
<BR>
77 per cent. of non-resident parents saw their children every day, or at least once a week, or at least once a month. (Office for National Statistics survey).
<P>
<BR>
47 per cent. of all non-resident fathers were having at least weekly contact, 68 per cent. at least monthly contact and only 3 per cent. had no contact at all, with their children. (Bradshaw, Stimson, Skinner and Williams&#151;"Absent Fathers?" 1999).
<P>
<BR>
69 per cent. of formerly married parents reported on-going contact. Only 5 per cent. reported that there had never been any contact and 27 per cent. said contact had been interrupted or had ended. (McLean and Eekelaar&#151;"The Parental Obligation: a study of parenthood across households" 1997).
<P>

<a name="31117w19.html_para3">The Government believe that children generally benefit from the continued involvement of both parents in their lives following divorce or separation, with the interests of the child always being paramount. I am currently considering our response to the Report of the Children Act Sub-committee of the Advisory Board on Family Law "Making Contact Work" to see what further practical steps we can take to facilitate and support contact between children and their parents.
<P>

<a name="31117w19.html_para4">Meanwhile, the Government have already taken the following initiatives:have published the Parenting Plan, designed to help parents make practical arrangements for their children following divorce or separation, and age-related information leaflets for children concerned;are supporting a publicity campaign to emphasise the benefits of safe contact for children and to encourage parents to resolve disputes constructively;

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to increase support for the non-abusive parent in cases of domestic violence where children are involved.  [134909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w20.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Government have proposed a number of measures which will improve the support and protection available to the children and non-abusive partner of a violent parent. These were set out in our consultation paper "Safety and Justice: The Government's Proposals on Domestic Violence" and include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>making sure that child contact arrangements in domestic violence cases guarantee the safety of all parties. We will be expanding the provision of supervised child contact centres and services. Where domestic violence (or other safety issues) features in contact cases it is vital that the families are referred to services that are able to meet their needs, especially on safety. Baroness Ashton of Upholland and I plan to announce successful applicants for funding from a joint Children's Fund/



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 543W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Sure Start Investment Stream of &#163;2.9 million for new supervised contact services. We expect new services to commence from the New Year;
<P>
<BR>
improving the support available to children and young people affected by domestic violence, both for the benefit of the children and young people themselves and to relieve pressures on their parents;
<P>
<BR>
providing help for victims of domestic violence as early as possible, and making sure that the civil and criminal law offer the maximum protection to all victims, children and adults, to prevent the violence recurring;
<P>
<BR>
providing advice and information to victims on how to get access to support services and legal protection;
<P>
<BR>
ensuring an effective police response when victims report domestic violence and ensuring that victims are not deterred by the way they will be treated at any stage of the judicial process;
<P>
<BR>
improving the sharing of information so that child and adult victims are better protected and supported;
<P>
<BR>
increasing the full range of accommodation options, including supporting people to stay in their own home. Children can particularly suffer by moving away from their friends, school, pets and other familiar surroundings;
<P>
<BR>
helping victims who have ended or left a violent relationship to rebuild their lives; and
<P>
<BR>
raising awareness about domestic violence among the general public and key professionals;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31117w20.html_para9">The Government are currently considering the responses to these proposals.Our Green Paper Every Child Matters recognises that supporting parents and carers is a significant factor in our general strategy to improve children's lives. It sets out the Government's vision of better integrated services for all children that are focused around the needs of the child, to ensure no child falls through the net and all children get the support they need to fulfil their potential:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>integrating services for children and families within Children's Trusts. This will particularly benefit the families in which children are affected by domestic violence as they may have a range of physical, emotional and psychological needs and may often be in temporary accommodation or moving around;
<P>
<BR>
providing access to specialist services. Being a victim of, or witnessing, domestic violence can have a long-term negative impact on children's behaviour, health and educational outcomes. The Green Paper sets out how the Government will seek to ensure specialist provision is available so that all children achieve and are in good physical and mental health;
<P>
<BR>
strengthening child protection arrangements. The Green Paper sets out proposals for changes to arrangements for safeguarding children, which we hope will lead to a better response to the needs of vulnerable children including those affected by domestic violence;
<P>
<BR>
improving information sharing will ensure that difficulties are picked up earlier and acted upon in a coherent way. We are consulting on the best way to use information about families and parents in such cases to build a complete picture of the risks to the child;
<P>
<BR>
improving both universal and targeted support for parents. Such support will be appropriate and non-stigmatising. It will help parents in supporting their children and the universal support in particular will be a gateway to more specialist services, for example, support for families affected by domestic violence; and
<P>
<BR>
improving maternity services. 30 per cent. of domestic violence cases start during pregnancy and existing violence often escalates during it. Through the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services the Government are piloting routine antenatal questioning for domestic violence by midwives.

 The Government are committed to encouraging responsible trade and encourages all organisations to consider whether their purchasing policies can be adjusted to benefit the poor in developing countries. Through the Department for International Development, the Government have provided &#163;0.5million to support UK development awareness and education campaigns centred around Fairtrade over the past two years. Higher education institutions are however independent, autonomous bodies, entirely responsible for their own trading arrangements, and we cannot directly influence their trading choices.

 The majority of dedicated funding for gifted and talented education is made available through Excellence in Cities, including Excellence Clusters and Aim Higher. These programmes are targeted at areas of greatest deprivation which are concentrated in urban areas although not exclusively so. Each area receives only a notional allocation for work on gifted and talented education. It is for the local partnership or cluster to decide how much to spend on this, relative to other dimensions of their programme.
<P>

<a name="31117w21.html_para1">Local education authorities and schools can also use funding from other sources for gifted and talented education, and choose whether or not to take up a range of national resources available to them. These decisions are influenced by a variety of local priorities and needs.

 The support arrangements under the mandatory awards scheme for eligible undergraduate students domiciled in England and Wales on courses which began before 1 September 1998 consisted of payment, usually in full, of their tuition fees, a grant towards their maintenance, depending on income, and a non-income assessed loan. New students in academic year 1998/99, with a few exceptions, were expected to contribute up to &#163;1,000 a year towards the cost of their tuition depending on family income. In 1998/99, 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 547W</I><P>
income-assessed grants on average only formed about a quarter of the support available and all students were entitled to a non income-assessed loan which comprised the remaining three-quarters of support available and which will be repayable on an income contingent basis. New entrants to higher education from 1999/2000, together with those who started in 1998/99, received support for living costs solely through loans which are partly income-assessed. Grants for living costs are no longer available except for some limited allowances, e.g. for students with dependants; students who require assistance with travel, books and equipment; lone parent students; students leaving care; students with dependant children who are eligible for school meals grants; and disabled students.

The analysis will be based on provisional data for 2003 results at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4, and therefore subject to slight revision.

For example, in September 2004, a limit of 38 hours will be introduced on the amount of cover an individual teacher can be required to undertake. Although the majority of teachers will not be affected by this initial limit, it provides an opportunity for schools to examine the use of supply teachers for providing short-term cover, and developing the use of cover supervision by trained support staff.

 The support arrangements under the mandatory awards scheme for eligible undergraduate students domiciled in England and Wales on courses which began before 1 September 1998 consisted of payment, usually in full, of their tuition fees, a grant towards their maintenance, depending on income, and a non-income assessed loan. New students in academic year 1998/99, with a few exceptions, were expected to contribute up to &#163;1,000 a year towards the cost of their tuition depending on family income. In 1998/99, income-assessed grants on average only formed about a quarter of the support available and all students were entitled to a non income-assessed loan which comprised the remaining three quarters of support available and which will be repayable on an income contingent basis. New entrants to higher education from 1999/2000, together with those who started in 1998/99, received support for living costs solely through loans which are partly income-assessed. Grants for living costs are no longer available except for some limited allowances, e.g. for students with dependants; students who require assistance with travel, books and equipment; lone parent students; students leaving care; students with dependant children who are eligible for school meals grants; and disabled students.

The Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES), which collects this information is undertaken every three to four years.

 The Department for Education and Skills has direct responsibility for one of Government's key sustainable development priorities, and influences seven others, set out in the UK Strategy for Sustainable Development. I launched the Sustainable Development Action Plan for Education and Skills on 23 September 2003. This plan commits this department to work with our partner organisations and other Government departments to ensure that sustainable development is an integral part of education and skills development of this country and its economy. We are working with HM Treasury in the context of the 2004 Spending Review to ensure that sustainable development remains at the heart of the development and renewal of the strategic priorities for this department.

 Many of the Government's policies in education and other areas have contributed to the 25,000 more teachers employed in England since 1997 and the record numbers of trainees now beginning courses of initial teacher training.
<P>

<a name="31117w24.html_para1">Most dedicated programmes intended to increase the numbers of new recruits to teaching in England are administered on the Government's behalf by the Teacher Training Agency.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of the number of additional <i>(a)</i> mathematics, <i>(b)</i> science and <i>(c)</i> English teachers that would need to be recruited if all lessons at Key Stage III and Key Stage IV were to be taught by teachers with a formal qualification in the appropriate subject.  [138538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has made no such estimate. However, the financial incentives and new routes to Qualified Teacher Status that the Government has created are bringing specialists in these subjects into teaching in record numbers. Figures published by the Teacher Training Agency on 10 November showed that, in the last five years, the number of recruits to conventional undergraduate and postgraduate courses of initial teacher training and the employment-based Graduate Teacher Programme has risen in mathematics by 91 per cent, in English by 33 per cent, and in science by 40 per cent. In these subjects alone, there have been almost 2,700 more recruits to training so far this year than in 1998&#150;99.
<P>

<a name="31117w24.html_para2">In addition to these huge gains, the widely welcomed remodelling of the school workforce that the Government and its partners are tak'ng forward will enable all subject specialists to use their knowledge to the maximum benefit of learners in the classroom.

In 1993&#150;94, the control centre received 368,800 emergency calls. In 2002&#150;03, the figure was 468,700.

It is the responsibility of local statutory authorities to determine the pattern of services in their area in the light of their knowledge of local needs and priorities. People with Asperger's syndrome have the same right of access to health services as everyone else.

<P>
<a name="31117w27.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Asperger's syndrome is a developmental disorder on the autistic spectrum and as such comes under the definition of mental disorder in the Mental Health Act 1983. Although the Mental Health (Patients in the Community) Act 1995 amended the 1983 Act, it did not change the definition of mental disorder. Guidance on the operation of the Mental Health Act 1983 (the Code of Practice ISBN 0&#150;11&#150;322111&#150;8) was produced by my Department and the then Welsh Office and published by the Stationery Office in 1999.

Within this programme, there will be an opportunity for some non-audiology graduates to undertake a fast track two year education and training route leading to a graduate diploma.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w28.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The national minimum standards for care homes for adults 18 to 65 and those for care homes for older people were introduced in April 2002. It is not possible to estimate the cost for individual care homes of meeting the standards as this will vary from home to home depending on the individual circumstances of the home, including the type of resident cared for and the extent to which it already meets the necessary standards. It is for the National Care Standards Commission to inspect care homes to ensure they meet the assessed needs of their residents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w28.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The decision to close Holehird is an operational one for the Leonard Cheshire Foundation. It is not generally appropriate for central government to intervene when a home closes.
<P>

<a name="31117w28.html_para3">We appreciate how traumatic it can be for vulnerable people who have to be moved from residential care homes which have become their true homes. It is, therefore, important that any decision to close a home is taken as sensitively and appropriately as possible.
<P>

<a name="31117w28.html_para4">Local councils have a responsibility for making satisfactory alternative arrangements for anyone that they place in a home which subsequently closes. There should be adequate time for the safe and satisfactory transfer of all residents to other suitable homes. This should be done in a way that takes into account the views of residents and their relatives and creates the minimum possible discomfort to all concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w29.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 We do not collect this information centrally. Health improvement programmes have now been replaced by local delivery plans (LDPs). Each national health service trust is now responsible for creating its own business plan, which shows how it will deploy its resources to deliver on both national and local priorities and fit within the plans of its primary care trust (PCT) commissioners. These local plans will not be analysed centrally.
<P>

<a name="31117w29.html_para0">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) will bring together those PCT plans into a comprehensive LDP for their area. In general, the SHA-level local delivery plan will be the only plan the Department will formally sign-off. The LDP that is submitted to the Department addresses the Priorities in the Planning and Performance Framework (Improvement, expansion and reform: The next three years' priorities and planning framework, 2003&#150;06). Formal monitoring only covers those priorities and will not provide detail of individual service provision like continence services.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2003]:</i> The Government are committed to ensure that national health service dentistry is available to all those who need and seek it. Those wishing to see a NHS dentist can do so by contacting NHS Direct for information on dentists offering NHS dental services in their areas. It is recognised that not all dentists on general dental service lists of primary care trusts (PCTs) are accepting new NHS registrations. We have set up a 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 580W</I><P>
NHS Support Team to work with PCTs on dental access. We have also announced new funds totalling &#163;44 million for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 to support dental access, choice and quality.
<P>

<a name="31117w29.html_para2">Subject to Parliament, the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill will give new duties for PCTs to secure primary dental services. With these new responsibilities will go the &#163;1.2 billion financial resources currently held centrally.
<P>

<a name="31117w29.html_para3">On 1 August 2003, as part of the new arrangements for NHS dentistry, we set up the new special health authority in shadow form to support PCTs. A team from the special health authority and the NHS dentistry support team met with NHS officials for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight at the end of October to discuss the development of a dentistry action plan and the support team will be working closely with the NHS locally to take this forward.
<P>

<a name="31117w29.html_para4">In the meantime, the Fareham and Gosport primary care trust is putting in place a range of measures to improve access to dental services in the area. This includes a dental access centre in Fareham designed to provide unregistered patients with access to NHS dentistry. This is supported by an incentive scheme which offers additional access to NHS dental care based in existing dental surgeries.

<i>[holding answer 12 November 2003]:</i> National health service trusts are free to employ staff under such terms as they see fit (section 16, NHS and Community Care Act 1990). Trusts are also responsible for the establishment of their own local disciplinary procedures for medical and dental staff. In the 1990s, many trusts developed new procedures often based on the procedures set out in circulars HC(90)9 and HSG(94)49.
<P>

<a name="31117w29.html_para9">The Department has been working closely with the British Medical Association to develop a new national framework. Trusts will be required to ensure that their local procedures adhere to the principles and procedures set out in the framework.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 12 November 2003]:</i> All disciplinary issues are a matter for the employing national health service trust, which must ensure that their procedures comply with employment law.

Serious cases should be referred to the General Medical Council or the General Dental Council.

 Subject to Parliament, the legislation on national health service foundation trusts will allow a NHS foundation trust's constitution to make further provision as to the circumstances in which a person may not become or continue as a member of the Board of Governors.

 The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) has commissioned an assessment of the existing evidence on screening for Group B Streptococcus in pregnancy against criteria used to assess potential screening programmes to ensure they do more good than harm. This assessment will include consideration of the costs that would be involved in introducing a screening programme. The NSC is expected to consider policy options at its meeting in December 2003.

 The new contract for general medical services (QMS), accepted by general practitioners on 20 June 2003, will significantly benefit patients by improving the quality of care, including the management of high blood pressure, and widening the range of services available at GP surgeries.
<P>

<a name="31117w33.html_para2">Two thirds of the additional investment linked to the GMS contract has been earmarked to reward practices for better services. This funding will be allocated through a new Quality and Outcomes Framework, which sets out a range of indicators relating to the detection, recording and management of patients with high blood pressure. Practices will gain a certain number of points according to their performance against these indicators. A typical practice with average list size achieving all the hypertension points might expect to earn &#163;12,975.

2. Insulins are those defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) paragraph 6.1.1, "Insulins". Insulin drugs have been grouped into highly purified animal and human sequence (GM) insulin in line with the British National Formulary (BNF).<P>

3. Doctors write prescriptions on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item. The net ingredient cost refers to the cost (which the dispenser is reimbursed) of the drug before discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what evidence he has received on adverse reactions to synthetic insulin among diabetics which were not experienced when animal insulin was used; and if he will make a statement;  [137593]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w33.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its Sub-Committee on Pharmacovigilance (SCOP) have kept the safety of synthetic (human) insulins under close review and have considered the available data on a number of occasions. Most recently in 2002, the SCOP considered the findings of an independent review of controlled clinical trial data by the Cochrane Collaboration. The conclusions of the Cochrane review were that there is no difference in the incidence of adverse events between patients on synthetic insulin compared with patients on animal insulins. The SCOP confirmed its previous advice that there is no clear evidence of safety problem specific to human insulin. However, the issue will be reviewed again should further information become available.
<P>

<a name="31117w33.html_para6">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) receives reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) via the Yellow Card scheme. The most commonly reported suspected ADRs with both synthetic (human) and animal insulins are disorders of metabolism and nutrition such as hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia unawareness, followed by skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder such as injection site reaction. However the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug caused the problem.
<P>

<a name="31117w33.html_para7">A higher number of suspected ADR reports have been received in association with synthetic insulin through the Yellow Card Scheme, however this may reflect the fact that 80 per cent. of patients with Type 1 Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus are estimated to be receiving synthetic insulin in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="31117w33.html_para8">Full guidance on prescribing and use of synthetic insulins, including possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribes and patients. This includes warnings about the risk of hypoglycaemia unawareness particularly upon transfer from animal insulins to synthetic insulins. Key prescribing information is also included in the British National Formulary, which is sent by the Department to doctors and pharmacists.
<P>

<a name="31117w33.html_para9">Both human and animal derived insulins are currently available and the MHRA is not aware of any specific plans for the discontinuation of production of animal derived insulins. However, decisions as to the most suitable type of insulin for particular patients are clinical matters and must be made by individual doctors.

 Over &#163;3 billion a year is spent on health and social care provision for people with learning disabilities. The White Paper, "Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" (Cm 5086), published in March 2001, which set out our proposals for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers, announced two new funds to support its proposals: the implementation support fund (ISF) from April 2001 and the learning disability development fund (LDDF) from April 2002. Funding has been allocated to support priorities set out in "Valuing People".

<a name="31117w34.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The combined balance sheets of all London national health service trusts at the end of 2002&#150;03 show a net cumulative deficit on the income and expenditure reserve account of &#163;47.7 million. This figure does not necessarily represent liabilities which will need to be settled nor is it an indication of poor financial performance. Changes in accounting policy and the periodic re-valuation of assets over recent years have distorted the apparent financial position of NHS trusts.
<P>

<a name="31117w34.html_para5">The latest annual accounts for 2002&#150;03 show London NHS trusts made an overall surplus of &#163;4.3 million. All have balanced financial plans for 2003&#150;04.

 Past under-funding of the national health service led to the inadequate provision of essential diagnostic equipment, unevenly distributed across the country. The Government are committed to putting right this under-investment and is providing unprecedented levels of central funding to expand capacity and replace ageing equipment.
<P>

<a name="31117w35.html_para1">There are currently 207 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners installed in the NHS in England, compared with 110 machines in 1997, representing an 88 per cent. increase in total numbers. By December 2004, this will increase further to approximately 276 MRI scanners, a 150 per cent. increase on 1997.
<P>

<a name="31117w35.html_para2">There are approximately 60 MRI scanners in private hospitals in England. The private sector is only able to provide a small amount of additional capacity for the NHS. The utilisation of any radiology equipment is dependent on the availability of skilled staff. Both the NHS and private sector use staff from the same work force pool.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the maximum period is which he requires should elapse before NICE guidance is reflected in <i>(a)</i> the advice given by NHS Direct and <i>(b)</i> the content of NHS Direct Online.  [133369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w35.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 When content of National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance requires amendment to National Health Service Clinical Assessment System (CAS) clinical content, the change would normally be made in the next clinical release. Main releases are currently made twice yearly. When the need for change is identified as more urgent than the timetable for the next main release, guidance regarding the change is issued first to all staff by a message system which is part of NHS CAS and this is followed by an interim version release of the clinical content between the main releases. Depending on the timing of release of NICE guidance in relation to the next planned main clinical release, it could otherwise be up to six months before the clinical content was revised. Advice on the urgency of implementing changes is given by the NHS Direct national medical adviser in consultation with the NHS Direct CAS clinical panel. NHS Direct is working with the system supplier to be able to amend clinical content more frequently.
<P>

<a name="31117w35.html_para3">If someone required information only on a treatment, the situation is as follows. The NICE website is on the recommended list for all NHS Direct call centres. Also, a monthly current awareness bulletin is produced and posted on 'indirect' (NHS Direct's Intranet site) as well as being e-mailed to site information staff (they are encouraged to publicise at sites). This would feature any new NICE guidelines.
<P>

<a name="31117w35.html_para4">If NICE guidance requires a change to the content of NHS Direct Online, it would usually be updated in their content within 48 hours, although this process can be shortened to within the hour for urgent cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w35.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Currently, all NHS Direct members of staff are employed by their host organisation trust. NHS Direct employs approximately 3,000 (whole time equivalent) members of staff nationally. Of these, around 1,063 are nurses and 543 call handlers. The remaining staff consists of health information advisors, managers, trainers, nurse supervisors and administration staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) pursuant to his answer of 27 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 99W, on stroke, how the stroke units that do not have rehabilitation stroke beds seek to rehabilitate their patients;  [138930]
<P>
<UL>(2) pursuant to his answers of 27 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 99W and 23 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 736W, on strokes, whether he intends that specialist stroke units should have separate acute care and rehabilitation units; and whether a combined unit is sufficient to meet the stroke service target.  [139011]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w39.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The stroke service model in the national service framework for older people states that an integrated stroke service will involve specialist stroke services providing acute care and rehabilitation. Decisions on how that rehabilitation will be provided are best taken at a local level. Different models of care may emerge, but we anticipate that most trusts will establish a rehabilitation stroke unit.
<P>

<a name="31117w39.html_para0">The target of all general hospitals that care for people with stroke to have a specialised stroke service by April 2004, as described in the stroke service model, is well on its way to being met. 94 per cent. of the hospitals that provide stroke care now have a specialised stroke service.

 The Working Time Directive (WTD) came into force for all staff in the national health service, with the exception of junior doctors in training, in 1998 and has already been effectively implemented. From August 2004, doctors in training will be subject to a limit of 58 hours a week under the WTD. A substantial programme of work is currently under way to support implementation within the NHS in the context of providing safe and effective services.

 In 2002/03 we spent &#163;14 million on TB testing to bring the backlog of 27,000 overdue tests built up during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) under control. We expect to spend in the region of &#163;10.3 million on the testing programme in this financial year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she is taking to support dairy farmers in <i>(a)</i> Lancashire and <i>(b)</i> the UK.  [136036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Dairy farmers in Lancashire, in common with the rest of the UK, benefit from expenditure on the dairy CAP worth nearly 2 billion euros across the EU15. This expenditure will increase with the introduction of direct payments to dairy farmers from 2004.
<P>

<a name="31117w41.html_para0">We believe that in the long term the future of the dairy sector is best secured through pursuing the objectives of our Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. We have made a grant of nearly &#163;0.5 million to the Food Chain and we have supported the establishment of English Food and Farming Partnerships, a new industry led body that has been set up specifically to support and encourage collaborative activity across all agricultural sectors. Furthermore my noble friend Lord Whitty has been chairing meetings of a Dairy Supply Chain Forum made up of senior figures from across the diary sector. This Forum and its sub-groups have been examining ways in which collaborative action can promote supply chain efficiency, and how levels of innovation and new

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many dairy firms went out of business in the last year; and what assessment she has made of the causes.  [137285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in 2002, 50 enterprises classified as manufacturers of dairy products were de-registered for VAT. This compares to 525 enterprises under this classification registered for VAT at the end of 2002. Although these figures may be indicative of the number of firms which went out of business, the Government have made no assessment of the reasons for these de-registrations, and it should be noted that de-registration can occur for reasons other than an enterprise ceasing to trade, such as its turnover falling below the VAT threshold.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what arrangements she has put in place to evaluate the effect of the farm gate price of raw milk on average net <i>(a)</i> income and <i>(b)</i> profit of dairy farms in the United Kingdom;  [137893]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate she has made of the threshold of the farm gate price of raw milk that would enable dairy farming to be economically viable.  [137894]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Department monitors incomes on dairy farms through the annual Farm Business Survey and also, from time to time, via special studies into the economics of milk production. Incomes for the years ended February 2002 and February 2003 on a range of farm types, including dairy farms, will be published by the Department at the end of this month. Forecast incomes for the year ending February 2004 will be published in January 2004. In regard to economic viability, there are a number of factors that influence economic performance, including milk yield, milk price and efficiency of input use and these all vary from farm to farm. The wide range in economic performance across dairy farms is reflected in the wide range in the break even ex-farm milk price.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the likely effect of the current proposals for Common Agricultural Policy reform on the farm gate price of milk.  [137895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 When fully implemented, the reforms agreed in June in Luxembourg will reduce the support price for butter by 10 per cent. more than the 15 per cent. reduction originally agreed for both butter and skimmed milk powder under Agenda 2000 (i.e. a 25 per cent. cut in the support price for butter). If farm gate prices were to fall to the same extent, the price per litre might be reduced by a further 0.95p beyond the impact of Agenda 2000. However, we share the European Commission's assessment that farm gate prices are unlikely to settle at this level: indeed, the overall package of compensation agreed reflects this. (Producers will be compensated through an increase in 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2003 : Column 626W</I><P>
the level of direct payments of a further 0.74ppl over and above the compensation originally agreed in Agenda 2000.) The figures quoted above are based on an exchange rate of 70p/euro.
<P>

<a name="31117w41.html_para1">Our economic assessment indicates that decoupling of direct payments from production will have a beneficial effect on farm incomes; we would expect the main dairy-specific price impact to be in relation to the value of milk quota.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_wqn4"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the competitive position of the dairy processing industry in each EU member state.  [137246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 KPMG, in its report on "Prices and Profitability in the British Dairy Chain", which was commissioned by the Milk Development Council and published earlier this year, found that in 1997 (the most recent year for which UK data was available), apparent labour productivity in the UK dairy processing sector was somewhat below the EU average and significantly lower than in the Netherlands, Ireland, Austria and France. However, there has been significant investment in larger, more efficient, dairy plant in the UK since 1997 and this gap may well have closed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> supermarkets and <i>(b)</i> dairy farmers regarding the price of milk.  [136035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 While the Government share producers' concerns over the low farmgate price of milk, price negotiations between producers and processors, or processors and supermarkets, are a private commercial matter in which the Government cannot and should not get involved, as long as competition rules are respected.
<P>

<a name="31117w41.html_para2">The Secretary of State has had no formal meetings with representatives of the dairy industry or retailers to discuss milk prices. However, Ministers frequently meet with representatives from all parts of the dairy supply chain and are therefore aware of the issues. Matters affecting the whole dairy supply chain are regularly discussed at the forum chaired by my noble friend Lord Whitty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the growth of the United Kingdom milk and milk products industry over the next <i>(a)</i> five, <i>(b)</i> 10 and <i>(c)</i> 15 years.  [137292]<P>

 A study commission by Defra, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland by the Centre for Agriculture, Food and Resource Economics at the University of Manchester, which was published in April 2002, concluded that on balance the elimination of dairy market support and milk quotas, together with compensating decoupled direct payments would not result in a significant change in UK milk production. It also concluded that such a reform of the dairy CAP would result in dynamic benefits to the processing sector as it moved from the production of commodity products to value-added products. Nevertheless, this study could not predict and could therefore not consider the actual

outcome of the agreement reached on CAP reform in June. Under the umbrella of the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, which is chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty, Defra is co-funding with the Milk Development Council and the Dairy Industry Association, supported by the National Farmers Union, a study on the impacts of the agreement on Dairy CAP reform and some of the options available to the UK. Preliminary results for this work should be available in December, with a final report published in January. Once this is complete, we intend to work with the industry through the Forum to consider the long-term implications and the adjustments the sector will need to make to the new environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what procedures she has put in place to assess the effect of tariff reductions on egg imports on the UK's egg industry.  [138034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is still a considerable way to go in the WTO negotiations on tariff reductions before consideration can be given to the level of reduction applying to individual products. But we are well aware of the egg industry's concerns and we will do all we can to ensure the most favourable outcome possible for UK producers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hayes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what direct subsidies are available to egg producers in <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom, <i>(b)</i> France and <i>(c)</i> Germany.  [138035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Given that the CAP regime for eggs is a very light one, it does not provide direct subsidies for EU egg producers. Some limited financial assistance is available to the UK egg industry under the England Rural Development Programme and Regional Selective Assistance. We do not hold information on the extent to which other member states make similar assistance available to their egg producers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what conditions producers are required to meet to be licensed to receive export refunds for egg and poultry products; how many licences have been issued to UK farmers; and what level of export refunds are available to licence holders.  [138036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In order to receive export refunds for egg and poultry products the applicant must be registered with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). Export licences are required where quantities to be exported exceed certain amounts. Applicants for export licences must be natural or legal persons who, at the time applications are made, are able to prove to the satisfaction of the RPA that they have engaged in trade in the egg, or poultry, sector for at least 12 months.
<P>

<a name="31117w41.html_para3">Within the period of 1 November 2002 and 1 November 2003, 162 egg licences and 395 poultry licences were issued to UK farmers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w41.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government will consider this report along with other economic assessments in preparation for the review of the Welfare of Laying Hens Directive 99/74/EC in 2005.

<a name="31117w41.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Subsidies to compete in the EU market would be incompatible with the principles of the Single Market. The EU egg regime provides for some limited export refunds in respect of egg exports to third countries.

 The objective of the 2003 decommissioning schemes in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland is to remove 15&#150;20 per cent. of the 2001 effort on cod in the North Sea and west of Scotland fisheries (Northern Ireland have also targeted vessels catching cod in the Irish Sea). We are therefore focusing the schemes on those vessels which spend most time fishing for cod. The age of the vessels is not relevant in that context.
<P>

<a name="31117w42.html_para0">Other member states will decide for themselves whether a decommissioning scheme is appropriate to their particular circumstances. However the effort control measures that are in place under the Community's 2003 Days at Sea scheme apply to the fleets of all European Union countries fishing in the North Sea and west of Scotland&#151;not simply the UK.
<P>

<a name="31117w42.html_para1">While the Government are keen to reduce overcapacity within the European fleet, we have set no targets for the future size of the UK fleet.

<P>

<a name="31117w42.html_para7">If there is an outbreak of disease or if any other phenomenon occurs which is likely to present a risk to human or animal health, Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of products from all, or parts, of the country concerned.

<a name="31117w42.html_para8">Any consignment of animal products imported from third countries are subject to veterinary inspection on entering the EU to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and to ensure that they have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport.

For other meats, and for processed veal and beef, country of origin need not be given unless failure to do so might mislead a purchaser as to its true origin. Where origin information is given voluntarily it must not be false or misleading.
<P>

<a name="31117w42.html_para11">The Food Standards Agency has issued guidance notes for industry and enforcement authorities, which emphasise the need to ensure that origin labels are clearly worded to avoid misleading consumers, for example by applying 'British' labelling to products like ham or bacon prepared from imported meat.

The findings provided a snapshot of what had been achieved in the first year of the MTI, particularly in four key areas: establishing partnerships; community involvement; getting the best out of the health check, vision and action plan; and project successes. This research note can be found at: http://www.countryside.gov.uk/Publications/articles/crn 60.asp. No specific analysis of any town, district or county was undertaken. However, this year the Countryside Agency is working in partnership with Defra to carry out a more intensive analysis of the problems and achievements arising in the 200+ towns of the Market Towns Initiative.

 The Government do not provide any specific support for either of these sectors. The Government readily acknowledges that both industries have excellent track records of innovation and market orientation. From their perspective, the principal need is for Government to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens or obstacles, while ensuring that environmental and animal health and welfare standards, among others, meet public requirements.

 The England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), which is funded by Government and the European Union, provides support for rural areas, by encouraging sustainable rural businesses and thriving communities. It helps farmers and foresters respond better to consumer requirements and become more competitive, diverse, flexible and environmentally responsible. It also provides help to rural businesses and communities which need to adapt and develop. The Programme covers 10 separate schemes which provide new opportunities for farmers and others to protect and improve the countryside, to develop sustainable rural enterprises and to help rural communities to thrive. It is estimated that the Programme will provide &#163;1.6 billion in support between 2000 and 2006. Defra believes the best way to encourage enterprise in rural areas is to provide the right economic framework and, where necessary, to target support measures e.g. rural enterprise and training, towards appropriate people. Awards of ERDP funds are made in line with principles of equal opportunities.

 The Strategic Rail Authority's "West Coast Main Line Strategy", published in June 2003, envisages that the modernisation of the line from London to Crewe will be completed in autumn 2004 and the Crewe-Weaver Junction-Liverpool section in summer 2005, including sections with a maximum line speed of 125mph.

 The UK is the lead nation on Counter Narcotics (CN) in Afghanistan and has a PSA target to contribute to a reduction in poppy cultivation in Afghanistan by 70 per cent. in five years with elimination in 10 years. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the UK are working closely with the Afghan Transitional Administration to help them implement their National Drug Control Strategy.
<P>

<a name="31117w46.html_para5">The UK has developed a plan of activities to support the Afghan authorities in implementing their Strategy, including law enforcement, institution building, drugs demand reduction and alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers.
<P>

<a name="31117w46.html_para6">As the lead nation, the UK has committed &#163;70 million over three years and posted additional personnel to Afghanistan to lead this work. It is also planned to hold a counter-narcotics conference in February 2004 in Kabul, involving Afghan and international representation, to encourage further international support for the delivery of the Afghan strategy. I will co-host this with President Karzai.

Forced marriage is a serious human rights abuse and is not sanctioned by any religion or culture.

The CLU has dealt with victims, male and female, aged between 11 and 39, and from a wide range of backgrounds including Sikh, Hindu, Catholic and Muslim to date.

<P>
<a name="31117w49.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The elections in north Cyprus on 14 December are of pivotal importance to the future of the island. This is an important opportunity for Turkish Cypriots to decide their own future. It is essential that these elections should be conducted in a transparent and democratic manner, free from interference. We are calling on all those who have influence, including Turkey, to help ensure the elections in the north are free and fair. We welcome indications from the Turkish Government of the importance they attach to this.
<P>

<a name="31117w49.html_para1">With regard to legal action against the media, we are deeply concerned about any attempts to limit press freedom. On the particular cases raised, we condemn the physical attack on the journalist Murat Kanatli, reportedly by the 'Grey Wolves' group in north Cyprus. The five further journalists mentioned were charged with a range of offences, including insulting the Turkish Security Forces and undermining the "state". These charges relate to articles reporting events at Doganci (Elye) on 25 March 2003, when opposition parties and pro-solution forces tried to hold a symbolic referendum in support of the Annan Plan. The police raided the protest, an army contingent removed the "ballot box" and the organisers were arrested. The timing of these prosecutions (seven months after the event) adds weight to the assertion that the indictments are politically motivated. Furthermore, we are concerned by reports that a number of these cases will be tried in a military court.

<P>

<a name="31117w49.html_para4">We continue to have concerns about the number of "settlers" who have recently been granted citizenship in north Cyprus. The fact that this took place in such numbers immediately before an election is undermining confidence in the electoral process. The opposition in northern Cyprus has applied to the "Higher Electoral Council" (YSK) for an injunction barring those who have become citizens since the municipal elections in June 2002 from voting in the elections on 14 December. We await a ruling on that particular issue. The Turkish Cypriot courts have already barred two hundred people from voting in the elections who had been granted citizenship by the "Council of Ministers".

<a name="31117w49.html_para8">The nature of trafficking means that it is a hidden crime and there are no reliable figures about children being trafficked into or out of the UK. There have been a few high profile instances of children being trafficked into and through the UK, but there is insufficient information to say if this is a growing problem. However, the very nature of the crime demands that is treated very seriously, which is why the Government have introduced criminal sanctions covering child traffickers and has tasked the Reflex group with co-ordinating intelligence on the problem.

 We maintain regular contact with the UN Secretary General, the UN Development Programme and the World Food Programme about Zimbabwe. We supported EU resolutions at the UN Human Rights Commission in 2002 and 2003. Regrettably these resolutions fell to 'No Action' motions.

<a name="31117w51.html_para4">As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear to the House on 10 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 524, we would only go to the United Nations Security Council for a resolution when we believed that we would win one. Tabling a resolution on UN sanctions would be certain to fail and would only hand Mugabe a gratuitous victory.

 [<i>holding answer 27 October 2003</i>]: The UK ideas were designed to stimulate a debate on improving the international asylum system. Our thinking continues to evolve. But we remain focused on the provision of better protection in asylum seekers' own regions to reduce the motivation to cross continents to make a claim; and to reduce the burden on the asylum system from those misusing it to gain entry to the UK for economic or other reasons. This is not about shifting the burden to poorer regions.
<P>

<a name="31117w51.html_para20">The majority of the world's refugees are already unable to access asylum systems in the European Union. It is therefore essential to strengthen protection in their region of origin, close to their homes, in order to ensure accessible and effective protection for people fleeing persecution and conflict.

 The UK's proposals were designed to stimulate a debate on improving the international asylum system. Our thinking continues to evolve and we are engaged in dialogue with the UNHCR, the European Commission and others to consider how we might put these ideas into practice. We are thinking less in terms of specific protection areas or 'zones' and more in terms of strengthening capacity in regions of origin. The aim would be to reduce the motivation to cross continents to make a claim; and to reduce the burden on the asylum system from those misusing it to gain entry to the UK for economic or other reasons.

 Information on final decisions is not readily available and complete information could only be obtained by examination of individual case files to obtain information on the outcomes of initial decisions, of subsequent appeals to the Immigration Appellate Authority and the Tribunal, and of cases which have been reconsidered. This would incur disproportionate cost. 31,800 cases were awaiting an initial decision at the end of June 2003 (the latest date for which published figures are available); of these 8,900 cases were work in progress ie the application had been outstanding for six months or less.

 It is Government policy that children of compulsory school age here as part of an asylum seeking family should receive education. This applies to all children, not just those whose parents are in receipt of support. Currently, with the exception of the small number of families who are detained, children are entitled to attend mainstream schools. For those who are detained a modular programme of education is provided at the relevant removal centre if detention is expected to last for more than a very short period. In the vast majority of cases, the detention of families with children will last for no more than a very short period, usually less than 14 days and often for only a few hours or days prior to removal.

 As part of the initial screening process asylum seekers, including those affected by Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (NIA Act 2002), are required to provide proof of residence at a particular address. Residence at that address is then made a condition of their temporary admission into the United Kingdom, to which other conditions may be added, principally a requirement that the asylum seeker reports regularly to the Immigration Service (IS).

Friend the Home Secretary first announced on 22 May this year, the Government are intending to introduce further legislative measures to address the specific problems of abusive appeals and undocumented applicants in the asylum system which continue to undermine the credibility of the system. As stated in the letter we sent to stakeholders, we consider that these are urgent measures and are therefore seeking to introduce them as soon as parliamentary time allows. While we are seeking the views of key stakeholders on the new provisions we believe that further reform is needed quickly if we are to capitalise on the success of our measures to date. Further dialogue is taking place with stakeholders on specific measures and a copy of the letter to stakeholders has been placed on the website of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate so that it is available to the public.

 The amendments by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to their media and disciplinary guidelines have been completed. They give greater prominence to the issue of anonymity and underline that suspects should not be named before charge. They go on to highlight the possible dangers of doing so in that not only is there the risk of causing irreparable damage to a suspect's reputation, but also because unwarranted disclosure could leave a force open to civil proceedings. ACPO promulgated these guidelines to all forces in mid-October 2003.

 The requested information is given in the table.

<a name="31117w54.html_para0">There was a change of counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which had the effect of increasing the number of crimes counted. Numbers of offences for years before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="31117w54.html_para1">The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) was introduced across England and Wales in April 2002. Lincolnshire Police Force introduced the Standard in March 2002. Broadly, the NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of crimes recorded by the police. Therefore, following the introduction of the Standard, numbers of recorded crimes are not comparable with previous years.

 There is limited family accommodation at Dungavel Removal Centre and the number of families at the centre fluctuates from day-to-day. For example, during September there were, on any one day, as few as two school age children at Dungavel and never more than 15.

The research corroborates a number of other independent studies which have been summarised in reports by the European Commission in 2000 and the former Department for Education and Employment in 1999.

The evidence demonstrates that migrants contribute to economic growth, productivity, innovation and public finances. The fiscal study estimated that immigrants made a net &#163;2.5 billion contribution to the economy in 1999&#150;2000.

 The standard membership of a police authority outside London under section 4(1) of the Police Act 1996 is 17 members, of whom nine will be councillors appointed from relevant councils, three will be magistrates appointed by the local Magistrates Courts Committee and five will be appointed from local people (independent members) who mainly live or work in the police area. The Home Office and Association of Police Authorities published joint guidance on the selection and appointment of independent members of police authorities in England and Wales on 20 September 2002. This guidance reflects the intention in the Act that the independent membership should, as far as practical, represent the interests of a wide range of people in the community and be appropriately skilled. It does not specify organisations.
<P>

<a name="31117w58.html_para2">Where there is a single relevant council in a police area, it selects from its membership the nine councillor members of the police authority according to political balance. If there is more than one relevant council, then a Joint Committee of those councils makes the appointments on the balance of parties prevailing among the members of the relevant councils taken as a whole. The apportionment between relevant councils is a matter for the Joint Committee. This is set out in Schedule 2 of the Police Act 1996 as amended.

 The procedures for managing visitors awaiting entry to a prison varies at each establishment and is not recorded centrally.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para1">The provision of a covered area immediately outside the gates is often dependent on the structural design of the prison building. However, around 109 establishments provide a visitors' centre which offers visitors both shelter and, in most cases, support services that are available before and immediately after the visit is due to take place.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para2">Many of those who do not have a centre provide basic facilities such as a waiting area. Recent enquiries suggest that around 10 prisons appear to have no current plans for a visitors' centre and we are exploring with them their intentions in terms of assisting visitors.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are being introduced to reduce the suicide rate in prisons apart from the installation of safe cells.  [138369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w60.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide in prisons. Over the next few months the outcome of this programme will be reviewed taking into account pilot project evaluations and emerging research findings. The next steps and approaches will be resolved in consultation with partner agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para3">As part of this close partnership with other agencies and organisations, there has been a targeting of efforts where the risks are highest. A particular focus, and an investment of over &#163;21 million over the three year programme, has been on physical improvements at six pilot sites. These improvements have been in reception, first night and induction areas, installing more first night centres, and by having more crisis suites and gated cells that enable staff to watch at-risk prisoners closely.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para4">Dedicated drug detoxification units and mental health in-reach support have also been established, along with a series of inter-related projects to develop improved suicide prevention and self-harm management policies, concentrating on pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care and peer support, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para5">Prison Service Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators have been trained and are now operating in the majority of prisons. Additionally, the Samaritans are recruiting and training more prisoner peer supporters (known as Listeners) in high-risk establishments. Listeners are prisoner volunteers who are selected, trained and supported by Samaritans to offer confidential support to their fellow prisoners who may be at risk of suicide, otherwise in crisis, or simply in need of someone to talk to. 1,241 new Listeners were recruited between 1 October 2001 and 31 March 2003 with further recruitment and training continuing. The scheme's objectives are to assist in preventing suicide, reducing self-harm and to help alleviate the feelings of those in distress.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 in promoting race equality; and what criteria he applied in carrying out the assessment.  [137059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31117w60.html_spnew3"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
 The Government work closely with the Commission for Racial Equality, (CRE) which has statutory responsibility for enforcing the duty to promote race equality under the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000).
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para6">The CRE commissioned Schneider-Ross, a firm of diversity consultants to evaluate the response of public authorities to the statutory duty to promote race equality. The research had two main elements, quantitative and qualitative, covering two core stages. The first of these was a questionnaire based survey of 3,338 public authorities and educational institutions, using two questionnaires designed to address the different elements of the general and specific duties that apply to the two broad categories. The second was an analysis of a random sample of 143 race equality schemes and policies from the main sectors covered by the duty, assessed against the recommendations of CRE Code of Practice and CRE guidance materials.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para7">The Schneider-Ross report found that overall local government was the highest achieving sector. Around a third of local authorities were on track; a third had good foundations to respond well to the duty to promote, and, a third needed to carry out more work in order to comply. The criminal justice service was strong, especially in the police and probation services. The weakest sector was schools.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para8">The Home Office has initiated a Race Relations (Amendment) Act Strategic Sectoral Audit.
<P>

<a name="31117w60.html_para9">The audit is a sector by sector analysis of whether the key ingredients for success are present or not in each sector. The work on mapping the landscape of current sector activity builds on the findings of the Schneider-Ross survey. We are working closely with the CRE to take this forward quickly so that necessary support and attention can be made available to those public bodies who need it.

<a name="31117w61.html_para1">The Department does, however, monitor factors relating to workplace stress including workload and working conditions through its staff surveys. The Department has taken action to address some of the main identified factors, including filling vacancies, recognition of good performance and improving technology. The Home Office is committed to supporting staff in achieving a balance between their work and home responsibilities and has a range of flexible working patterns to help staff achieve this.

<a name="31117w61.html_para2">A welfare service is available and offers personal support for staff suffering from any form of stress. In addition, stress awareness courses are available and information on how to recognise stress and suggested coping strategies, is accessible via the Home Office Intranet. The aim of these resources is to help staff recognise the early signs of stress and take appropriate action.

<a name="31117w61.html_para3">The Department is aware of its legal obligation to provide a safe working environment for employees and is committed to meeting targets for reducing the number of working days lost generally due to work related injuries and illness arising from the government's Revitalising Health and Safety initiative.
