 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the note on the Total Liability of Unfunded Public Service Occupational Pension Schemes published on 2 March 2006, what the impact on total liability would have been if all unfunded state pension schemes had adopted the real discount rate of 2.4 per cent.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the cause of the Prior Year Adjustment made in the 2004&#150;05 accounts of the unfunded occupational public service pension schemes and <i>(b)</i> the impact of the adjustment upon the cash cost of these schemes.  [57265]</p>




<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60309w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Des Browne: </b> 
 The Note deposited in the Library on 2 March showed that one component of the increase in liabilities reported in accounts of unfunded public service pension schemes as of 31 March 2005 was the impact of prior year adjustments amounting to approximately &#163;6 billion in total across all the accounts of all the schemes. This is the total effect of incorporating new data on membership and entitlements which, had it been available earlier, would have led to the liabilities being reported as higher by this amount in previous estimates. The new data and the new total liability calculated from it does not have a material effect on the projections of cash payments to be made by these schemes as a proportion of GDP in future, as shown in the latest Long Term Public Finance Report published in December 2005.

The 1998 Convention applies, as it stands, to the member states of the European Union as they were in June 1998. Once the Convention has entered into force (90 days after the last of the 15 original signatory states has notified the EU Council that it has adopted it), it will mean that any holder of a Great Britain or Northern Ireland driving licence disqualified from driving in another European Union member state in which the Convention applies will be required to surrender his licence to (or have his licence kept from him by) the United Kingdom authorities, whichever is applicable, until such time as the period of disqualification has been served. Under the Convention there would be reciprocal arrangements to deal with licence-holders of other states to which the Convention applied which had been disqualified in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, so that they would be disqualified in their state of residence for motoring offences committed here.

However, meanwhile signatory states may, if they choose to do so, cooperate on a bilateral basis within the framework established by the Convention. The United Kingdom passed the necessary primary legislation to enable it to ratify the Convention, or to apply it early under the process of notification provided by the Convention, as part of the Crime (International Cooperation) Act 2003, and I recently exchanged letters with my Irish colleague declaring our joint intention to cooperate bilaterally as soon as possible.

<i>[holding answer 6 March 2006]:</i> The Department and the Treasury have not discussed the matter of funding for the acquisition of the portrait of John Donne for the National Portrait Gallery. The sources of funding for the purchase available to the Gallery include grant-in-aid allocated by the Department, self-generated income, including bequests and donations, and contributions from grant-making bodies. Government has not ring-fenced any grant-in-aid to national museums and galleries for acquisitions since 1992&#150;93. This allows the Trustees the freedom to decide how much of their grant-in-aid should be devoted to purchases for the collections.

<a name="stpa_41">Following tax remissions, the amount that the National Portrait Gallery must raise by the end of May is &#163;1,652,000. The Gallery has launched a public appeal, with a generous opening contribution from The Art Fund of &#163;200,000 and since then, some &#163;25,000 has been contributed by members of the public. The Gallery has also made an application to the National Heritage Memorial Fund for a contribution towards the costs of acquisition.

<a name="stpa_42">Both the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) and the Heritage Lottery fund have a good track record on funding acquisitions.

 Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda. A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour. For example Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; DFES through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need; DEFRA and their work in tackling litter and fly tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and DCMS who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and

In 2005&#150;06, the Home Office has allocated &#163;75,000 to Swindon to tackle antisocial behaviour. &#163;40,000 has been used to fund Operation Graffiti&#151;a multi-agency initiative to tackle environmental crime and specifically the issue of graffiti. &#163;10,000 has been used to implement the Its Your Call Anti Social Behaviour reporting line and ensure that it is resourced between 9 am and 5 pm during week days. &#163;25,000 has been used to work with the most anti social families. The Home Office has specifically allocated &#163;25,000 to every Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in both England and Wales to fund an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator. This amounts to &#163;9.4 million per annum. We have already provided guidance and support to local agencies including local authorities to help them to target resources and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated. The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 has been fundamental to our work which has changed the culture of public services and protected our communities. However, while attitudes are shifting, the public&#039;s concern is not yet adequately reflected in the priorities of all our services. The Respect Programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today. People need to see and feel that a difference can be made. Swindon received &#163;3,000 from the Police Standards Unit as part of the third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC). A number of local initiatives are underway to disperse people in antisocial behaviour hotspots in the town centre, including the proposed closure of John Street and patrols of licensed premises. The Government are determined to target those individuals whose abuse of alcohol results in causing disorder in our towns and cities. We have recently undertaken our third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign to crack down on such behaviour. We have also introduced a range of new powers through the Licensing Act 2003 to deal with the problems of alcohol misuse. In addition, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will introduce a new civil order&#151;a Drinking Banning Order&#151;which will allow for the exclusion from the area concerned of individuals aged 16 or over who are responsible for alcohol-related disorder.

 The Government&#039;s strategy is to bear down on all points in the drugs supply chain in order to disrupt criminal gangs, stifle drug supply and reduce the harm caused to communities in the UK. Increasing quantities of drugs are being seized and organised crime groups and dealers disrupted.

<a name="stpa_47">The latest figures published by HMRC for 2004&#150;05, show that over 3,000 kg of heroin and 10,600 kg of cocaine were taken out, 299 trafficking groups were disrupted or dismantled and &#163;33.3 million of drug-related criminal assets were seized, depriving dealers of their financial lifeblood. The number of drug trafficking groups dismantled or disrupted rose from 193 in 2002&#150;03 to 268 in 2003&#150;04 and 299 in 2004&#150;05.

The number of offenders convicted of producing or dealing cocaine, crack cocaine or heroin rose by 6 per cent. between 2003 and 2004 and over 80 per cent. of them received an immediate custodial sentence. In Swansea, from 1 April 2005 to date the police report having charged 34 people with trafficking Class A drugs as part of their ongoing operations against supply. But we are not complacent. The Drugs Act 2005 increased the powers of police to bring drug dealers to justice. The Serious Organised Crime Agency, which comes into being in April, will further strengthen our ability to disrupt and convict organised criminals engaged in Class A drug supply. Police force restructuring will ensure that police forces have the capacity, capability and resilience to effectively deal with regional crime such as major and organised drugs supply.

 Under section 59 of the Police Reform Act the police can seize any mechanically propelled vehicle which is being driven both in a careless and inconsiderate manner on-road, or off-road (including on common land without lawful authority), and causing alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public. At the beginning of November 2005 we issued to all chief officers in England and Wales additional guidance on the legislation explaining the rationale behind it, clarifying its terms and the circumstances in which it might be used and offering examples of effective operations. At the same time regulations governing the use of the power were simplified.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60309w08.html_spnew9"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Police and Justice Bill proposes to put the basic command units (BCUs) on a statutory footing and requires their boundaries to be aligned with those of local authorities. They will continue to cover a small geographical area within a force such as a town or district. In some two-tier areas, many district councils are too small to constitute a single BCU. It would therefore be possible to brigade two or more district councils to form one BCU. This would be a matter for chief constables following consultation with key partners, such as local authorities, in crime and disorder reduction partnerships and in local criminal justice boards.

 The Government are keen to improve the accountability between the police, local authorities and other service providers and the public.

The Respect programme will ensure effective dialogue between local people and services by introducing regular and systematic &quot;face the people&quot; briefing sessions, involving senior representation from the police and local authorities. These sessions will provide a further opportunity for communities to make clear their priorities and to hold those responsible for service delivery to account.

 In order for a pesticide to gain approval in the United Kingdom an extensive range of toxicological tests must be performed. These tests incorporate an extensive group of rigorous study protocols to address the health issues that have been shown to be relevant to pesticide exposure such as issues of acute and chronic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive effects, developmental (foetal) toxicity and others. Reference doses for acceptable human exposures to pesticides are derived by applying assessment (safety) factors to the dose that produces no adverse effects in the most sensitive, relevant animal study. The factor is normally 100, made up of 10 fold for the assumption that humans are more sensitive than the most sensitive animal species tested, and 10 fold for sub-populations of humans (including the foetus) that may be more sensitive than the norm. There will always be a minimum &#039;safety&#039; margin of 100 between a dose causing no effects on the foetus in animal studies and the acceptable human exposure to a pesticide. This approach is in line with risk assessment practices for chemicals both nationally and internationally.

These new tools will take some time to develop and we have to note the caution expressed by the Treasury that risk assessment methodologies can be highly specialised and specific to the nature of the risk <sup>2</sup> .

1. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 5. Totals and sub-totals have been rounded separately and so may not appear to be the sum of their parts.<br>

2. Figures do not include Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS), Gurkhas or Mobilised Reservists. The information relates to the flows of UK Trained Regular Army Personnel in the Scottish regiments, regardless of whether they serve away from the main body of the regiment, this does not include other arms/services attached to the regiments.<br>

3. Soldiers joining the infantry are not allocated to a particular regiment until completion of training at the Infantry Training Centre (Catterick). Officers are allocated a regiment on completion of their commissioning course at RMAS. Therefore the table includes those officers and soldiers who joined the Scottish regiments on completion of training. It will also include direct entries to the trained strength, such as trained re-entrants.<br>

4. The aforementioned figures will include those individuals who have entered the trained strength with an intake code from &quot;illegal absence&quot;, flowing either from untrained to trained or directly to trained strength. These figures may therefore appear different to other published figures.<br>

5. The table includes an &#039;Unspecified&#039; Regiment, this is where soldiers have not yet been assigned to a specific Scots Div Infantry Regiment on their Record of Service.<br>

6. RS&#151;Royal Scots , RHF&#151;Royal Highland Fusiliers, KOSB&#151;Kings Own Scottish Borderers, BW&#151;Black Watch, HLDRS&#151;Highlanders and A & SH&#151;Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.<br>

A separate evaluation by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which focused only on the first year of the pilots, identified that additionality was not as high as we would have hoped at that stage. The IFS report has pointed to the need to ensure better targeting of &#039;hard to reach&#039; employers and be more rigorous in applying learner eligibility rules. We are confident that the position has improved since the first year of the pilots. We have also learnt important lessons from the pilots about the key factors motivating employers and learners to engage in training, and the best ways to adapt training provision to the needs and pressures of the workplace.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of whether the period between publication of final versions of the <i>(a)</i> Occupational Pensions Schemes (Modification of Subsisting Rights) Regulations and <i>(b)</i> Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Regulations) was compatible with HM Revenue and Custom&#039;s stated objective of delaying the implementation of the simplified pension tax regime until April to allow employers and providers sufficient time to implement fully the benefits of simplification.

 The Government do their best to ensure that regulations are laid in sufficient time. In the case of the Modification of Subsisting Rights Regulations, we have been working very closely with pension industry lawyers to ensure that the regulations provide the necessary flexibility that the industry itself has asked for. This means that we have had to strike a balance between ensuring that the regulations are effective and making sure that they are laid as early as possible.

<sup>(32)</sup> Information services include the costs of websites and telephone lines directly related to raising awareness/encouraging action on departmental initiatives with the general public and other specific targeted groups. The bulk of the increased costs in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 are accounted for by increased expenditure on the development of online services delivered through the Department&#039;s websites.<br>

<p><a name="st_252"><a name="60309w28.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Under the Recreation and Youth Services Order (Northern Ireland) 1986 the Sports Council for Northern Ireland (SCNI) is statutorily responsible for the development of sport in Northern Ireland, including the distribution of public funding to sport. It receives both exchequer and lottery funding for this purpose. Among its programmes, it already has in place an Athlete Support programme which is designed to assist identified sportspeople to achieve greater success in targeted international competition, including the Olympic games. During 2005&#150;06 the SCNI has so far committed &#163;248,150 to athletes on the elite level of the Athlete Support programme. At present two individuals involved in sailing and two elite hockey squads are in receipt of funding from the SCNI in relation to preparations with the ultimate aim of competition in the next Olympic games. The total budget for the Athlete Support programme for the years 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 is &#163;600,000 per annum.

 Dentists&#039; current national health service earnings will be protected for at least three years, with an annual uplift for pay and prices, and there will be a 5 per cent. reduction in the courses of treatment that general dental services practitioners are expected to carry out each year. Evidence from personal dental services pilots shows that removing the current fee per item remuneration system leads to simpler courses of treatment, with fewer individual interventions and more time available for preventative care. In the Department&#039;s view, this is likely to reduce practice expenses as a proportion of gross NHS income, and therefore increase net income, but the precise impact cannot be quantified.

This evidence showed that one of the main benefits of abolishing the fee-per-item remuneration system was that dentists were able to carry out simpler courses of treatment with more time for preventative work. The pilots also indicated that there were difficulties monitoring services solely on the basis of patient capitation or similar measures. The system of units of dental activity which are the same as weighted courses of treatment, is designed to promote the same benefits seen in PDS pilots whilst ensuring there is clarity about the level of service expected in a year.

 It is not possible to aggregate and compare the cost to the national health service of providing routine and emergency supply of domiciliary oxygen by pharmacists and central suppliers because of differences in service provision and the basis for calculating costs. In the past, there was no explicit arrangement for pharmacists to provide oxygen to patients at home on an emergency basis. Pharmacists received payment for provision of an oxygen cylinder service, which included the cost of equipment listed in Part 10 of the drug tariff, together with locally negotiated fees for service delivery. The contract for the new service includes the provision of oxygen to patients on an emergency basis, with a delivery requirement of four hours. The cost of all oxygen services provided by new suppliers is on a per day basis. It takes into account the required flow rate for a patient and the hours per day a patient uses oxygen.

<p><a name="st_318"><a name="60309w35.html_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The safety of all medicines and vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine, is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the commission on human medicines (CHM). The MHRA uses a variety of data sources for this purpose but an important source of information is spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions that are reported by health professionals, pharmaceutical companies and most recently by patients through the yellow card scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60309w35.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_240">Since 1988, the MHRA has received a total of 13 reports of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), 11 reports of rheumatoid arthritis and 16 reports of multiple sclerosis in people who have received hepatitis B vaccination. This is in the context of 16.2 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine sold in the United Kingdom. We are unable to state how many of these suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) occurred in national health service workers as this information is not captured on a yellow card.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60309w35.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_241">Since the yellow card scheme is entirely voluntary for health professionals, these data cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the frequency of suspected ADRs to vaccines or medicines as not all cases may be reported. In addition, an association of a patient&#039;s illness with a particular medicine or vaccine may not always be made, particularly for conditions that take some time to manifest. It is important to note that the reporting of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug or vaccine. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication, a previously undiagnosed underlying illness or a coincidental newly occurring illness.

<a name="stpa_274">By December 2008, the patient pathway should be 18 weeks inclusive of out-patients, diagnostics, and in-patients waits. National health service organisations are developing local plans to achieve this pathway. The milestones themselves are not targets and as such there is discretion locally as to how best to progress towards 18 weeks overall.

<p><a name="st_351"><a name="60309w39.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The responsibility for carrying out pre-employment checks, including Criminal Records Bureau, Protection of Children&#039;s Act and Protection of Vulnerable Adults checks where applicable, rests with the relevant employer whether an national health service organisation or social services department or other regulated provider of health or social care. The NHS is required to follow the guidance, &quot;Safer Recruitment&quot; issued in May 2005, which covers all the pre-and post-appointment checks that NHS employers are required to make before appointing anyone, including employees, volunteers, students, trainees, to a position in the NHS. In regulated social care, we expect providers to comply with regulations on pre-employment checks made under the Care Standards Act 2000, which came into force in April 2002.
