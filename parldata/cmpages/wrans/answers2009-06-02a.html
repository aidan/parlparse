 The Department for International Development (DFID) is aware that some countries supported by the Global Fund are at risk from health facility stores temporarily running out of essential antiretroviral drugs (stock-outs). DFID officials have spoken to the fund's Secretariat about this, including recently at the Global Fund's Executive Board (5-6 May 2009). Formally, the UK supported a resolution made at the board meeting which obliges the fund's Secretariat to address this issue urgently, to report on whether its existing procedures are adequate, and to propose solutions which would minimise the risks of disruptions to treatment both in the short term and on an ongoing basis. In developing countries such as Zimbabwe, DFID is also assisting, where possible, in the provision of drugs while problems in Global Fund supported programmes are being addressed.</p>

 The Environment Agency has confirmed that the accuracy of the surface water mapping was independently assessed, although the information currently available to do this is limited. The maps of Areas Susceptible to Surface Water were compared with those of the 15 Integrated Urban Drainage pilot projects and models already held by the independent consultants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="90602w0013.htm_para1"><a name="09060274003379">The information on the maps is still under development and is currently only considered suitable for emergency planning purposes. The maps give an indication of the broad areas likely to be susceptible to surface water flooding based upon an extreme summer rainfall event with no drainage systems working. The information is not sufficiently accurate to use for individual properties as the current version excludes, for example, the impact of buildings and kerb heights on surface water flows, which at the local level can be significant. There will be properties at risk from surface water flooding that will not be included within the outline areas on the maps, and possibly other individual properties within the areas outlined that are not at risk because of particular local features that the mapping process did not reflect.</p>

Encouraging results have been seen so far from the first three months in 2009, including some excellent partnership working between industry, police, local authorities and other Government Departments. More tangible results from management information have included the recovery of quantities of stolen copper cable from Network Rail and BT (including one find worth over &#163;10,000), recovery of other stolen metals including lead, 46 lengths of rail, base plates, rail clips, and boilers, stolen kegs, and also the detection of red diesel. There have also been five arrests, three Environment Agency prosecutions and the identification of three cases of benefit fraud.</p>

BERR has received correspondence from Members of Parliament and others relating to the circumstances of UK Visteon plant closures which touch on redundancy and pensions matters and the issue was the subject of an Adjournment debate on 30 April. I am pleased to note that since the debate, the unions and Visteon Corporation have agreed a significantly improved redundancy package and that staff at the three Visteon UK plants voted overwhelmingly to accept it.

 The National DNA Database (NDNAD) is designed to match DNA taken from crime scenes with that taken from individuals. It does not hold information on whether those with records on it have convictions, as this is not necessary for this purpose. It is therefore not possible to provide information on the number and proportion of people on the NDNAD who were recorded as having a conviction on the Police National Computer (PNC) in each of the last 10 years. Some data on whether those on the NDNAD have convictions are available from PNC, but not as part of its routine functions and not within the cost limit for parliamentary questions. However, the National Policing Improvement Agency does obtain this information periodically.</p>

Average figures do not give an accurate indication of performance, since any force's performance can be affected by a number of factors, including the volume of cases sent to a force to process in any given month, the number of staff available to process the checks and the IT resources on hand to forces. With these variables, performance can fluctuate within individual forces from one month to the next.</p>

The principal reason for this has been the high volume of Disclosures that have been presented for processing.

The majority of the prisons were built in the last 10-15 years (in most cases with Government assistance) to replace outdated facilities not fit for purpose.

</ul><a name="90602w0024.htm_brev3"><a name="09060284001789"><ul><p class="tabletext">In light of the emerging economic downturn pressures we decided to suspend the planned closure of 25 Jobcentres. This decision was announced in November 2008. There has been a further closure of three small sites in London during March 2009. These had been announced last summer prior to the decision to suspend future closures. There will be no new Jobcentre closures while the current economic conditions persist.</p>
</ul><a name="90602w0024.htm_brev4"><a name="09060284001790"><ul><p class="tabletext">Jobcentre Plus inherited around 1,500 offices from the merger of the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service in 2002. We have modernised our Jobcentre network to improve customer service, rationalising our estate to provide excellent high street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer. We remain the largest office network in Government with 741 modern Jobcentres. This high street presence is supported by 31 modern contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres.</p>
</ul><a name="90602w0024.htm_brev5"><a name="09060284001791"><ul><p class="tabletext">In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support at our partners&#146; premises. That is particularly important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically such services can be delivered in partnership with Children&#146;s Centres or on Local Authority premises or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>
</ul><a name="90602w0024.htm_brev6"><a name="09060284001792"><ul><p class="tabletext">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now also delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have around half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

 Local housing allowance was rolled out nationally in April 2008 for customers in the deregulated private rented sector who make a new claim for housing benefit, and for existing customers who move address. It is a way of calculating the rent element of housing benefit based on the area in which a customer lives and their household size. Local housing allowance is paid to the tenant rather than the landlord in most circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_507"><a name="90602w0025.htm_para2"><a name="09060284000473">Local authorities may make payments to the landlord where they consider that the claimant is likely to have difficulty in paying their rent and it is in the interest of the claimant to do so. We therefore encourage landlords not to wait for the eight-week period to be reached but to contact the local authority as soon as a payment is missed so that they can begin gathering the evidence required to make a decision on direct payment.</p>

Evidence from the evaluation has shown that customers regard paying the rent as a matter of prime importance and that most would prioritise this above all other payments. 84 per cent. of tenants are successfully managing their own housing benefit. Of the remaining 16 per cent. only a third are having their housing benefit paid to the landlord because they have fallen into arrears of eight weeks or more. Two-thirds are having their benefit paid to the landlords because the local authority, working together with landlords, has identified that they might not be able manage their rent payments.

 The Department does not have data on the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. However the national Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) records the number of people recorded on practice disease registers with a diagnosis of dementia. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 to 75 per cent. of cases of dementia so the prevalence of patients with dementia gives an indication of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. This prevalence figure is available only for the two latest releases of QOF, covering 2006-07 and 2007-08 (financial years). However, these numbers are likely to be an underestimate of the true position. The Dementia UK report, published in 2007 by the Alzheimer's Society estimated that two-thirds of the people with dementia never receive a formal diagnosis.</p>

 All pharmacy and general practitioner (GP) system suppliers have to follow a rigorous assurance process prior to being given authority from Connecting for Health to nationally deploy their Release 2 services. This is made up of a number of key stages including clinical safety testing and initial implementation in a limited number of GP and pharmacy sites.</p>

The exact start date of initial implementation is dependant on how quickly these systems progress through the final stages of testing. Based on current supplier plans, it is hoped that initial implementation will begin in the summer. The outcomes of the initial implementation stage will be used to finalise plans for wider rollout of Release 2 across the country.</p>

 The Government receive a range of representations from groups and individuals on a wide range of topics, including savers. Since 1997, the Government&#146;s savings strategy has focused on developing better incentives for saving, ensuring people have the capability to make the right savings decisions for them, and that they have access to appropriate savings opportunities. The Government introduced tax-free ISAs in 1999, and announced increases to the ISA limits at Budgets 2007 and 2009. Over 18 million people now have an ISA. The Child Trust Fund was introduced in 2005, and the Saving Gateway will be introduced in 2010 to encourage saving amongst working-age people on lower incomes. The Government have also legislated for reforms to the private pensions system that will encourage and enable more people to save for their retirement.</p>

 The Department takes any allegations of abuse very seriously indeed. The Government commissioned two major reviews into historical abuse&#151;Sir William Utting&#146;s report &#145;People Like Us&#146; (1997) and Sir Ronald Waterhouse&#146;s report &#145;Lost in Care&#146; (2000). Kendall House closed in the 1980s, but since then tighter controls have been put in place which address all the issues raised by the allegations about Kendall House. The Government changed the regulatory framework and brought in the Care Standards Act 2000, which focuses on safeguarding children and promoting their welfare.</p>

 The remit of the National Safeguarding Delivery Unit is explained on pages 7-11 of &#145;The protection of children in England: action plan&#151;The Government's response to Lord Laming&#146;, published on 6 May. This sets out that the unit will work with Ministers, local authorities, other national partners and with Government regional offices to challenge and support every Children's Trust in the country to deliver the best possible arrangements for keeping children safe. Regional Government office staff will work as part of the unit and, as is the case now, will need to examine some local authority documentation in their role of providing support and challenge. The power to intervene in the case of children's services departments in local authorities remains unchanged and rests with the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

 The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) does not hold information on the household income of all households with children. Therefore it is not possible to calculate how many young people aged 16-19, who are participating in provision that meets the criteria for attracting EMA, could be eligible for EMA based on their household income but do not claim it.</p>

International evidence, as well as evidence from local areas that have made most progress in reducing under-18 conception rates since the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched, shows that comprehensive, age-appropriate SRE, alongside easy access to CASH services, brings down rates.</p>

 The Department has recently undertaken a review of its field forces working with local authorities (LAs) and children's trusts. The term field force has been used in a wide sense to cover all advisers funded or jointly funded by DCSF to work directly with LAs and children's trust partners. This includes NDPB staff where relevant, directly contracted groups of advisers, advisers who are co-located with the Government Office Children and Learner Teams and sections of DCSF Head Office directly supporting LAs e.g. Youth Task Force.

However it is possible that a number of applicants who were found to be homeless, but were not owed a main duty have also been included, so these figures may be over-reported.<br>
2. RSLs with less than 250 units are not required to complete CORE returns.<br>

 We already expect and encourage local authorities to use their planning powers to help increase the supply of social housing.

In addition we have just concluded consultation on allowing local authorities to apply for any new council houses they build (or acquire or otherwise bring back into use) to be held outside the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) Subsidy system. This will enable them to keep the rental income and sale receipts of any such properties, which, to date, has proved a disincentive to build.</p>

 The Decent Homes Standard itself does not specifically cover overcrowding. &#145;Crowding and space&#146; is one of the 29 hazards within the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). To be decent, a home must be free of all Category 1 hazards under the HHSRS and also meet the other three criteria (adequate thermal comfort, repair and modern facilities and services). Under the HHSRS, crowding would constitute a Category 1 hazard if the property and its occupancy constituted an unacceptable risk of serious harm.

 As noted in the consultation impact assessment accompanying the new streamlined Planning Policy Statement 4 (PPS4), we do not envisage that our proposals will impose additional burdens or extra costs on local planning authorities.

In addition, Camden has selected National Indicator 186 as a stretch target and action under this indicator is critical to achieving the Government&#146;s climate change objectives. Performance will be monitored by the Audit Commission under the comprehensive area assessment (CAA) which will look at how well Camden&#146;s services are working together to improve the quality of life for local people. CAA will be a catalyst for better local outcomes, more responsive services and better value for money and an independent evidence base for central Government on progress against national priorities.</p>

Assessments should preferably be carried out at the sub-regional level, for separate housing market areas, by housing market partnerships (where established). Housing market partnerships should include key stakeholders such as house builders, social landlords, local property agents, local communities and other agencies, such as English Partnerships (now the Homes and Communities Agency) where they have a recognised interest in an area.</p>

Key stakeholders should also be involved in updating the assessment from time to time.</p>

 The proposals in the Government&#146;s response to the widely welcomed Rugg Review of the private rented sector are at a high level and still subject to consultation.

The CML data is for repossessions on first-charge mortgages only, including Buy-to-Let mortgages, as issued by their members. CML estimate that their lenders currently account for 98 per cent. of mortgage lending. The FSA data, as well as covering possessions on first-charge mortgages, cover possessions on second-charge loans by Regulated firms (many second charge lenders are not regulated) but do not cover possessions as comprehensively on Buy-to-Let mortgages, as some of these are from unregulated firms. The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA&#146;s statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>
