               <b>Michael Moore:</b>
 I have regular discussions with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on a wide range of issues. The Government's priority is to deal with the deficit, and the end-year flexibility system has led to accumulated stocks of around £20 billion across the United Kingdom which would further increase the deficit if they were spent. The Government have therefore committed to abolish this system and to replace it with a new system which will provide flexibility while strengthening spending control. However, in recognition of the unique situation of the devolved Administrations, the Government have allowed Scotland to carry forward £130 million of agreed under spend from this year into next.</p>

These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the value of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

 We expect the vast majority of 14 and 15-year-olds to follow the National Curriculum and take GCSEs and, where appropriate, other qualifications at level 2. In her report, published on 3 March, Professor Alison Wolf recommended that the Government make explicit the legal right of further education colleges to enrol young people under 16, and ensure that funding procedures make this practically possible. She also stressed the importance of a core academic programme for all young people to the age of 16, regardless of the type of educational institution they are attending. We are currently considering all of Professor Wolf’s recommendations and will publish a Government response in the spring.</p>

Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract £430 of funding which will go to the school or academy, via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting, or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.

 The coalition Government are committed to improving the quality and consistency of information for prospective university students. We want applicants to be able to easily understand what a course will cost, what it will contain and where it might lead. To ensure pupils make well-informed choices about their options at 18, they need access to impartial careers advice that is independent of any organisation with a vested interest and underpinned by objective information and data. That is why schools working in partnership with expert, independent careers advisers will be at the heart of our new arrangements for careers guidance. Both strong leadership and a work force of the highest calibre are needed to guarantee a consistent level of professional expertise. We are therefore working with the Careers Profession Alliance to establish common professional standards and a code of ethics and to ensure that careers qualifications include an appropriate focus on the essentials of careers guidance.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 4 February 2011]:</i> The Secretary of State for Education wrote to the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) on 31 January 2011 to notify them of the national initial teacher training place targets for academic year 2011/12. The TDA has written to training providers with detailed allocations for 2011/12 including those for the Graduate Teacher Programme in the Tees Valley. These allocations have seen small increases for both the primary and secondary phases. As set out in the Schools White Paper 2010, ‘The Importance of Teaching’, our intention is that there should be an increasing emphasis on school-led training, for example through Teach First and Teaching Schools.</p>

 Through the Education Bill, schools will be placed under a duty to secure access to independent, impartial careers guidance for all pupils aged 13 to 16. A new national quality standard for careers guidance providers will serve as an indicator of quality for schools who will be free to determine how best to fulfil the new duty, based on their understanding of the needs of their pupils.</p>

In addition, we are developing a Key Stage 4 Destination Measure to show young people and parents what a school’s former pupils go on to do at age 17.</p>

               <a name="11031575001174"> Pressures in managing the population arise from a number of factors. These include the size of particular demographic sections of the prison population and capacity available to accommodate those segments, the geographic distribution of population between regions and NOMS ability to transfer prisoners to maximise the use of space, and whether there are any sudden local increases in population or losses of accommodation. As the total population approaches within approximately 1% of the prison estate’s useable operational capacity, the risk of potentially requiring police cells under Operation Safeguard increases and more rigorous assessment of population pressures is required.</p>

The directive requires all member states to have a compensation scheme for victims of “intentional violent crime” and ensures that compensation is accessible regardless of where in the EU a person becomes a victim of crime by creating a system of co-operation between national authorities.</p>

 Young adults sentenced to detention in a young offender institution (DYOI) are detained in young offender institutions (YOIs) as required by section 98 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. These are normally self-contained but in some instances are situated within an adult prison with which they share the majority of their facilities.

Natural England's project management procedures require that a role equivalent to an SRO is appointed for all projects and the seniority of the person fulfilling the role is determined by our financial scheme of delegation.</p>

 In 2006, arrangements were put in place to ensure continued access to the types of technical advice provided to DEFRA (and other Government Departments) by the three predecessor bodies to Natural England, following the vesting of Natural England. The Technical Advice Customers Group was established to review these arrangements, and met a number of times in the early years of Natural England’s operation. It has met twice since 1 January 2008. The last meeting of the group, in 2008, concluded that provision of technical advice was working well and could in future be delivered through existing planning and management channels between DEFRA and Natural England.</p>

 We would prefer to see all animals stunned before slaughter. However, religious slaughter (slaughter without prior stunning) is currently allowed in the UK in recognition of the religious beliefs of Muslim and Jewish faiths. This is consistent with the European directive 93/119/EC which permits an exemption from the requirement to stun animals for methods of slaughter required by certain religious rites.</p>

Schedule 12 of the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 sets out the requirements in more detail, including conditions for restraint, handling, slaughter and minimum bleed-out times.</p>

 The Government encourage the highest standards of animal welfare at slaughter. Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing has been implemented by The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, as amended. These regulations govern animal welfare at slaughter and are designed specifically to prevent cruelty or poor practice in slaughterhouses.</p>

               <a name="11031575001619"> The regulations make it an offence to cause any animal avoidable excitement, pain or suffering at any time between its arrival at a slaughterhouse and when it is killed. In particular, animals must be stunned properly so that they are unconscious and unable to feel pain during the slaughter process unless the slaughter is carried out for meat for a religious purpose.</p>

This regulation will apply from 1 January 2013 and will replace Directive 93/119/EC. The new regulation introduces a number of additional requirements including a requirement that all slaughterhouses (above a minimum size) will have to appoint a specific person responsible for animal welfare and ensure their staff are properly trained and certified. The regulation also permits the use of national rules to maintain existing welfare protection where that is better than the minimum standards set out in the regulation. There will be full consultation on the way regulation 1099/2009 is implemented.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 14 March 2011]:</i>The UK Government make their opposition to whaling known to Japan at every appropriate opportunity. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the right hon. Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), and other Ministers, including those from DEFRA, raised whaling with the Japanese Government on several occasions last year. Furthermore, I have written to my Japanese counterpart to express concern over whaling and, in particular, the wide-scale hunting of dolphins. Senior officials also regularly make representations on whaling with the Government of Japan, most recently in January 2011.</p>

The additional capabilities include more protected vehicles and more specialist explosive ordnance disposal and search equipment including remote control vehicles, for use by our C-IED teams, and enhancements to our military working dog capability; these, and enhancements to other critical capabilities, will make a considerable contribution to operational capability, increase the protection available to our armed forces, and enhance their ability to defeat the IED threat.</p>

 The aim of the Cross Government Working Group, which was convened following the immigration changes in 2009, was to ensure that ex-Gurkhas in Nepal were able to make an informed decision to come to the UK and if they did so, that there was an end-to-end process to make their settlement as smooth as possible. The Working Group consisted of the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the UK Border Agency, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Cabinet Office, the Foreign Office and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The issues of pension and welfare payments were not examined by the Working Group. All ex-Gurkhas who settle in the UK are entitled to apply for the full range of state benefits, if they are unable to work. There are no plans to review this. The Working Group met three times, most recently on 16 February 2010, although most business on the key issues has been and continues to be conducted bilaterally between Government Departments.</p>

 As stated in the National Security Strategy the Government believes that attacks through cyberspace constitute a threat to our national security on a par with terrorism. We are investing an extra £650 million over the spending review period to address this threat. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) will play its part by incorporating cyber security into the mainstream of defence planning and operations; supported by the establishment of a Defence Cyber Operations Group (DCOG).</p>

A two-star military officer has been appointed to drive implementation and will be chairing a programme board with representation from within the MOD, the Cabinet Office and other Government Departments. We have established a strong cyber policy and plans team which will develop MOD cyber policy, lay the ground work for the establishment of the DCOG, and enhance MOD's cyber capabilities. By 2015, the DCOG will be fully operational, manned and equipped.</p>

 The strategic defence and security review sets out the capabilities we will be enhancing and those we will be removing or gapping from the armed forces as we move towards the Future Force 2020 structure. We recognise that there will be risks associated with these decisions. We are managing these risks by: ensuring our operations in Afghanistan are prioritised; maintaining our military strategic intelligence capability; ensuring we have adaptable capabilities; deepening our partnerships; preserving the ability to reconstitute our levels of military capability in areas which are currently lower priority; and, by maintaining our strategic deterrent.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Defence, the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox), announced on 16 February 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 78W, that the formation of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation would result in savings of some £1.2 billion for the first four years, from estate running costs, and the disposal of surplus land and buildings. Precise details are being finalised, including those as part of the re-basing study currently under way, but we would expect about half of it to be delivered through greater efficiency in the management and delivery of infrastructure services leading to savings in manpower and contract costs.</p>

 The big society is an approach and philosophy which is at the heart of the Government’s reforms across all policy areas with the aim of localising power and opening up public services and encouraging social action. Each Department has a range of specific programmes which will contribute to growing the big society. These policies are co-ordinated across Government through meetings at official and ministerial level, including the Informal Ministerial Group on the Big Society and Localism, which shares ideas and supports progress on cross cutting issues relating to the big society.</p>

 The Department is taking steps to reduce the size of its office estate. Measures to deliver this include consolidation of accommodation across the Home Office Group and the adoption where practicable of the Government's workplace standards of eight square metres per person and a ratio of eight workstations per 10 staff. Estate consolidations are under way in London, Croydon and Liverpool. In Croydon for instance buildings totalling 26000 square metres were surrendered last December. Plans for further significant consolidations are being developed in other major cities and in back office accommodation held at ports of entry.</p>

 Each of the five UK Border Agency approved accreditation bodies were approved for an initial period of two years. The Accreditation Service for International Colleges, Accreditation UK and the British Accreditation Council were all approved in July 2007. The Association of British Language Schools was approved in March 2009, and the Church of England Ministry Division in May 2009. The government has made clear in its recent consultation on student visas that it intends to strengthen the current arrangements for accreditation. The existing approvals have not therefore been formally renewed, pending decisions on the longer-term arrangements. However the accreditation bodies are continuing to provide the service for which they were approved.</p>

 The UK Border Agency is committed to providing a first-class visa service meeting its customer service targets for processing applications. 95% of non-settlement applications are processed within three weeks and many applications are dealt with much faster. Although applicants are advised to allow sufficient time for their applications to be processed, visa sections overseas recognise that this is not always possible and will expedite cases where there is an urgent and genuine need to travel.</p>

2. This and other tables contain full-time equivalent figures that have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Because of rounding, there may be an apparent discrepancy between totals and the sums of the constituent items.
3. Comparable strength (excludes those on career breaks, or maternity/paternity leave). The Police Numbers Task Force (2001) recommended that a clear presentation was made of the numbers of staff employed by police forces including those seconded into the force and those on any type of long or short term absence. These new calculations were first used in 2003, and are not comparable with data prior to March 2003. The data from 2003 onwards used here are termed comparable because they have been calculated on the old basis to allow comparison.

 The assessment for personal independence payment is being designed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability. Its membership encompasses a wide variety of relevant expertise and reflects a broad range of experience in the needs of disabled people. As well as representatives from RADAR—the Royal Association for Disability Rights—and Equality 2025, the group includes individuals from professions such as occupational therapy, psychiatry, physiotherapy, social work, general practice and community psychiatric nursing. This approach ensures that the initial development work is being undertaken within a holistic view of the impact of disability.</p>

Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. Once the broad principles are in place, we will work with the assessment group and disabled people and their organisations on the refinement and testing of the detail of the criteria. We know it is essential that the assessment accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is already considering. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's recent report on disability living allowance reform, “Who benefits?”, and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design.</p>

 As was announced at publication of the Welfare Reform Bill on 17 February, the Government's intention is to bring in any change to the mobility component as part of the wider reform of disability living allowance (DLA). Consultation on wider reform of DLA with the key proposal of a new benefit to be known as personal independence payment concluded on 18 February. The intention is that all working age recipients of disability living allowance will be reassessed under the conditions of entitlement to personal independence payment from 2013 to establish whether they have entitlement to that payment.</p>

 The length of time it will take for a customer to have their incapacity benefits reassessed is dependent upon a range of factors. Among other things, this includes the speed with which the customer returns their medical questionnaire and whether the customer needs to attend a face to face assessment. On average this would normally take around 13 weeks but this may be quicker if a face to face assessment is not required.</p>

 I do not expect there to be any significant effect on the number of prosecutions for health and safety offences because of reductions in the budget of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Almost all of the prosecutions for health and safety offences arise from the investigation of accidents, incidents and complaints. HSE has no plans to reduce the resources available for such investigations.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 14 March 2011]:</i> We propose that in order to qualify for personal independence payment, the individual must have met the conditions of entitlement to a specific rate of the daily living or mobility component during the six months preceding the date they become entitled. This is intended to distinguish between a long-term impairment or health condition—for which financial support through this benefit may be appropriate—and shorter term conditions where other support mechanisms exist.</p>

Individuals may also be entitled to a range of social security benefits depending on their circumstances during this period.</p>

The additional state pension paid to such a person is reduced by an amount equivalent to the GMP that would have accrued had he or she been contracted out through a defined benefit scheme, although the actual pension paid may be higher or lower than the contracted-out deduction. However, calculating the COD in this way ensures that people are treated in the same way, regardless of how they were contracted out.</p>

However, pensions or annuities bought from defined contribution contracted-out schemes since April 2006 do not have to provide for any indexation. Individuals can choose to buy a flat-rate annuity which will have a higher starting payment than an escalating annuity but not increase over time. This means that in these cases it would be possible for the COD to increase while the occupational pension remains the same.</p>

 The Department for Communities and Local Government does not hold any information as to the number of synagogues and Jewish cemeteries desecrated in each local authority. However, data are available in the three police force areas which have the largest Jewish communities. These data would classify the desecration of Jewish cemeteries and synagogues as criminal damage. Whenever a critical incident occurs related to either desecration of Jewish cemeteries or synagogues, the National Community Tension Team ensure that they link in with the Community Security Trust to reassure the Jewish community and ensure that each incident is investigated.</p>

 The programme of business record checks (BRC) will not commence until completion of the formal consultation through the consultation document issued on 19 December 2010. Following that consultation, and taking into account the responses received, HMRC will trial the BRC process using a ‘test and learn’ approach to ensure that this is supporting businesses by either giving them assurances regarding the standard of their record-keeping, or alternatively advising them on areas of those records where improvements can be made.

 HMRC’s random inquiry programme indicates that poor record keeping is a problem in around 40% of all small and medium enterprise cases (circa five million). Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development indicates that poor record keeping generally leads to an underassessment of tax even where there is an audit-type check into a return for the period covered by such records. On this basis, poor business record keeping is responsible for a tax loss in up to two million SME cases annually.</p>

 Following natural disasters, many Governments offer emergency service personnel as readily as the UK. We therefore do not find that we need to encourage other Governments to respond, but we do try and encourage better co-ordination of those emergency service teams that offer assistance. The UK aims to co-ordinate with other European Union member states through the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), which acts as a focal point for the exchange of requests and offers of emergency service personnel. We also support the rapid deployment of humanitarian experts through providing funding and personnel to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination network (UNDAC). Experts from the UK Fire and Rescue Service also work with the United Nations International Search and Rescue Group (INSARAG), the UN co-ordination body on search and rescue.</p>

The announcement has been accompanied by a comprehensive communications effort to raise public awareness of the scale of the challenge and the difference that well spent aid makes to people’s lives. This achieved widespread coverage across national and regional media and online with the main aid review documents being downloaded over 24,000 times. Communicating via our social media channels, Facebook and Twitter, we reached over four million people.

 On 9 February the European Commission adopted a Decision on the safety requirements to be met by the revision to European standard BS EN 13120:2009 to address certain risks posed to children by internal blinds, corded window coverings and safety devices. We expect this to be published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> shortly. The UK has been instrumental in the European Standards Committee in ensuring that the revised standard covers all internal blinds and is robust regarding child safety. Work on this is progressing, and we hope to see a revised standard in 2012.</p>

 The Department, through strategic health authorities, has monitored the use and application of growth funds allocated to develop Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services as part of comprehensive spending review 2007.
