 Our policies over the past 12 years have made a real difference in providing increased support to help people on benefits move into work. The introduction of the national minimum wage and tax credits have meant that almost everyone is better off in work than on benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="100318w0003.htm_para0"><a name="10031851000543">However, for some, the financial gains are not clear enough. The reduction in housing benefit when income increases can discourage people from moving into work even when they are financially better-off by doing so. Many are also concerned about the effect on their benefit income where their income changes and worry about reporting changes to earnings</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="100318w0003.htm_para1"><a name="10031851000544">On 15 December 2009 we launched the consultation document "Supporting People into Work: The next stage of Housing Benefit Reform" which examines how housing benefit might play a part in encouraging people to work. We consulted on a specific proposal to set fixed awards of housing benefit for six months which would be unaffected by increases in income and earnings during that time. This would remove some of the uncertainty over benefit entitlement that comes with going back to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="100318w0003.htm_para2"><a name="10031851000545">The consultation concluded on 22 February 2010. We are considering the responses that we received as well as the details of how we will take our proposals forward. The level of help that we will provide will depend on final design decisions. We will set out these decisions in due course.</p>

 Income-related benefits help provide a secure source of income for people out of work or receiving low income in work. Although most people are better off in work due to the introduction of the national minimum wage and tax credits, and the availability of housing benefit and council tax benefit when in work, benefit entitlement can be reduced as their income from working increases. This is known as the benefit taper. The combined taper rate that an individual faces is known as the marginal deduction rate (MDR) and reflects the proportion of any extra pound earned that is lost through increased taxes and national insurance and reduced benefits or tax credits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="100318w0003.htm_para3"><a name="10031851000548">The level of the housing benefit taper targets support at those most in need, by ensuring that those with very low income receive help with their living and housing costs, whilst those with higher incomes become independent of benefit and maximising incentives to increase their earnings. Reducing the taper would be expensive and increase the level of income required to become entirely independent of benefit. We need to ensure that the taper in housing benefit continues to balance affordability with targeting support to those on lower income.</p>

1. Figures for 1997 and 1998 have been derived by applying 5 per cent. proportions to 100 per cent. Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study totals and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>
2. Figures from August 1999 onwards have been rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
3. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits, so for example, the decision for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on grounds of a mental and behavioural disorder would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the personal capability assessment.<br>
4. Employment and support allowance replaced incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008 and data by medical condition are not yet available for employment and support allowance claims.<br>

 Contractors and civil servants carry out a wide range of roles in Afghanistan, including at the main hospital in Camp Bastion and in catering posts in main operating bases. They are also employed in specialist roles such as Financial and Commercial Officers. Civil servants and contractors are an important resource on operations, and are principally used to complement military capacity and capability. Their support to operations is highly valued.</p>

 The health and welfare of horses is of particular importance as the equine industry is a sizeable and significant component of the national, especially rural, economy and community. DEFRA plays a key part in working with the industry to devise and implement policies to protect all equines, and to control equine exotic diseases. Vigilance and good practice on the part of horse owners/keepers and biosecurity are all vital in the fight against animal disease and DEFRA works in partnership with industry to raise awareness of and promote best practice in these areas.</p>

These are often part of European initiatives carried out across member states. For example, although the likelihood of introduction of African Horse Sickness virus from abroad to the UK via legal trade in horses and other equidae is considered very low, ongoing work to increase national preparedness for an outbreak of that disease, should it occur, is well under way through work on a control strategy for the disease, with a view to legislation coming into force this summer. This work has also strengthened other elements of preparedness for equine diseases more generally, for example, by increasing and deepening joint working between the sector and Government, and putting in place stronger stakeholder engagement mechanisms.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment he has made of the likely effect on the UK's <i> (a)</i> food security and <i> (b)</i> environment of (i) decoupling and (ii) reduction in livestock numbers. [322852]</p>

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="10031851001151"><a name="100318w0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="10031851002501"><b>Jim Fitzpatrick:</b>
 A market-driven and consumer focused agricultural sector is crucial for European and global food security. Removing the distortive link between direct payments and production allows farmers to respond more readily to market requirements and should therefore have a positive effect on food security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="100318w0010.htm_para0"><a name="10031851001152">Production data shows that while livestock numbers have fallen slightly in recent years, with decoupling of the common agricultural policy (CAP) support being a factor in this decline, both the value and volume of meat production has increased through higher yields. The effect of declining animal numbers on production will be partly offset by increases in productivity, such as higher milk yields and lower mortality. Together with productivity changes, market demand by domestic and overseas consumers will be a major contributor to the overall size of UK livestock herds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="100318w0010.htm_para1"><a name="10031851001153">The extent to which decoupling has led to a reduction in stocking densities has led to certain environmental outcomes, including an overall reduction in environmental pressures (such as overgrazing). There are already rural development programmes within pillar II of the CAP which are specifically designed to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally beneficial land management practices, and there are early signs that progress is being made in this area. Such targeted programmes need to be continued and strengthened with reform.</p>

 The Government recognise that the management of noise nuisance requires a co-ordinated and long term approach that embraces various aspects of modern society. This is why DEFRA published the Noise Policy Statement for England this week, setting out the long-term vision of government noise policy, promoting good health and good quality of life through the management of noise, within the context of government policy on sustainable development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="100318w0010.htm_para2"><a name="10031851001160">The application of the policy statement should mean that noise is properly taken into account at the appropriate time and reinforces the raft of legislation that already exists that gives powers to local authorities to deal with noise complaints.</p>

 Animal Health (AH), which administers the pet travel scheme, does not collect specific financial information on the scheme's operation. This is because its officers are allocated to deal with all imports and not just those of pet animals. However, an estimate based on information available indicates that the cost to AH for one year's operation of the scheme is £987,187. Costs have remained broadly stable over the last five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="100318w0010.htm_para3"><a name="10031851001163">This is based on information from the main UK ports and airports (Heathrow, Manchester, Dover, Harwich, Portsmouth, Southampton) and from the specialist service centre for imports in Chelmsford.

These are supplemented in prisons by local searching strategies and daily checks on store areas. We have a security breach policy which is linked to our conduct and discipline policies.

 The visit of the Cabinet to Exeter on 5 February 2010 was one of several ministerial visits across the region that day. There was a public engagement event and a formal Cabinet meeting. The purpose of the meeting was for the Cabinet as a whole to hear the views of people in the south-west. Feedback from local people who have attended the Exeter event and other previous meetings has been very positive; people welcomed the opportunity to raise important local, regional or national issues directly with the Cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="100318w0014.htm_para2"><a name="10031851001631">The cost of the public engagement event and the Cabinet meeting was approximately £51,964, excluding VAT. This figure includes the cost of hiring the venue, catering, associated security and delegate management. The budget for these events is held by the Cabinet Office. The cost of any security provided by the police is a matter for the relevant police force. The transport to and from these visits is a matter for the Secretary of State in each Department but wherever possible Ministers are encouraged to travel by public transport and keep costs to a minimum.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 March 2010]:</i> Learners aged 19 to 25 entitled to a learning difficulty assessment are covered by a statutory duty placed on the Learning Skills Council under s139 A of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. From 1 April 2010, responsibility will transfer to local authorities (LAs) following changes announced in the Learning Skills Act 2008 and the Apprenticeship, Schools, Children and Learning Act 2009. Such learners will continue to be funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families through the arrangements with the Young People's Learning Agency and LAs. This will support the policy that there should be a single body with responsibility for all young adults with learning difficulties and/or disabilities up to the age of 25 who require significant levels of support.</p>

 On 1 March 2007 my right hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), the then Minister of State for Schools launched the policy to install fire sprinkler systems to protect the fabric of new schools. This was included in Building Bulletin 100 later that year. It is best practice to provide sprinkler systems in new school buildings and major refurbishments and DCSF encourages and expects client bodies to install them.
