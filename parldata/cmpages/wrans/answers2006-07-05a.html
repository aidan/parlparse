Ladyman</b><i> [holding answer 29 June 2006]: </i>The current
development phase is a joint project between the Directorate General
for Transport and Energy in the European Commission and the European
Space Agency (ESA). The Supervisory Board of the Galileo Joint
Undertaking is established to ensure an adequate information flow and
political control by member states of the implementation of the
development phase.</p><p><a name="06070581000042">The
Government are aware of the sensitive nature of some parts of Galileo.
We continue to monitor the project closely. We have been careful to
ensure that any agreements with partners in the programme that are not
member states of the EU or ESA specifically exclude them from
participation in all sensitive
aspects.</p><p><a name="06070581000043">Individual
member states of the ESA and EU participating in Galileo are
responsible, under their own national and/or any international export
control regimes&#151;such as MCTR (Missile Technology Control Regime)
and Wassenaar&#151;of which they are signatories, for the control of
strategic exports and should apply these rules to Galileo as required.
For example, all EU countries follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms
Exports which prohibits export of military technology, including dual
use technologies where a military end use is known or suspected, to
non-EU states, including China, where this is inappropriate. An
assessment of the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end
use is a key criterion under the code. The UK Government assesses
Galileo technology proposed for transfer to non-EU states against these
criteria.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 1070W</b><br>

the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Wales Office
was an early adopter of pre-legislative scrutiny and the national
health service (Wales) Bill was scrutinised during the 2001-02 session.
Since then, a further three Bills introduced by my Department were
published in draft for consultation: the Public Audit (Wales) Bill; the
Transport (Wales) Bill; and, the Commissioner for Older People (Wales)
Bill. A public consultation has always been conducted in parallel with
the pre-legislative scrutiny process. My Department has also introduced
two further Bills. My Department had conducted a public consultation
jointly with the Welsh Assembly on the principles underlying the Public
Services Ombudsman (Wales) Bill, and as there was general support for
the proposals, further scrutiny was not considered necessary, and would
only have further delayed the legislation. The Government of Wales
Bill, which is currently before the House, was introduced without
pre-legislative scrutiny, because the proposals need to be implemented
for the May 2007 Assembly elections. Extensive consultation was however
undertaken on the White Paper, which was published well in advance of
this Bill being introduced. All of the Department's formal
consultations also abide by the Code of Conduct on

to the loss of electrical power following damage to Gaza's only power
plant. The closure of the Nahal Oz oil pipeline from 26 June to 2 July
and greater difficulty in movement due to the destruction of three
bridges providing north-south access have also had an effect. Hospitals
in Gaza are maintaining services by using back up generators, although
there are reports that supplies of some essential drugs and supplies
are nearly finished. It is difficult for anyone from the south to
access to the main referral hospital in Gaza city in the
north.</p><p><a name="06070581000207">The Gaza
economy has been severely constrained since March, when Hamas assumed
power. Since then, the access point for exports from Gaza has been
closed, trade with Israel has all but stopped and a very limited number
of public sector salaries have been paid. Most of the water supply to
Gaza is pumped from wells. Supplies are being continued by connecting
pumps to generators, but there is concern that fuel for these
generators is dependent on the Nahal Oz pipeline remaining
open.</p><p><a name="06070581000208"><b><a name="06070581000296">Richard

&#163;487,000 and &#163;520,000 respectively. The difference in
cost between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs
of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected. Major works
and other contracts were negotiated on the basis of the revised sitting
arrangements in both September 2003 and 2004. It is therefore
impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of
alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that around

the House sitting in each September

Murrison:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Defence (1) what stock of tetanus immunoglobulin is held <i> (a)</i>

[80340]</p><p><a name="060705105000124">(2)

[80341]</p><p><a name="060705105000125"><b><a name="060705105000192">Mr.
Watson:</b> The Ministry of Defence&#146;s requirement for
tetanus immunoglobulin is low. It is only used to treat patients with
wounds who have not received the normal tetanus vaccine. Very few such
cases arise in our armed forces since MOD aims to ensure that all its
personnel have up-to-date tetanus vaccinations prior to deployment. The
only people who would need it would therefore be any service personnel
who missed their vaccination and any non-UK individuals who are treated
in our medical facilities in
theatre.</p><p><a name="060705105000126">There is a
temporary UK national shortage of tetanus immunoglobulin. We do not
currently have any centrally held defence stocks in the UK. However,
with the exception of designated field hospitals, units are not
required to hold tetanus immunoglobulin, although some do at the
discretion of individual medical officers. We are not aware of any
stock shortfall of tetanus immunoglobulin in the designated field
hospitals and we do not expect a shortfall to arise before supplies
become available
again.</p><p><a name="060705105000127">Routine
tetanus immunisation is given by the combined low dose
diphtheria/tetanus/inactivated polio (Td/IPV) triple booster which is
administered at trainee entrant establishments. Personnel who require a
further booster dose because they have sustained an injury from which
they could be at risk of an acute tetanus infection can also be given
the Td/IPV triple booster. Supplies of the Td/IPV triple booster are
not affected by the national shortage of immunoglobulin, and there are
currently no known shortages in naval or military
units.</p><p><a name="060705105000128">In light of
the national shortage, the MOD has repeated recent Department of Health
guidance on tetanus immunoglobulin to defence medical personnel,
advising them of the necessary action they will need to take. This will
mainly involve ensuring that all personnel have up-to-date tetanus
vaccinations.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 1110W</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0607061000001">Solicitor-General</h3><h3 align="center"><a name="0607061000003">Chief

am told that during the trial three witnesses gave evidence as to a
practice of putting detained looters in water which appears to refer to
&#147;wetting&#148;. Mr. Daniel O'Connell formerly a Lieutenant
Platoon Commander said there was a practice of making looters wet which
was discussed at the company &#147;O&#148; Group meetings; however
it was not formal policy. He indicated that he had witnessed one such
incident of looters being put into a dyke where they were waist high
and in no real
danger.</p><p><a name="0607061000066">Major Peter
MacMullen the Company Commander said that the looting problem was
discussed at Battle group meetings and that he was aware of a range of
sanctions that were being deployed, which included people being put
into water so that they would be left cold, wet and
miserable.</p><p><a name="0607061000067">Mr. Niall
Brennan, formerly the Company Second in Command, said he knew of other
companies throwing looters into the Shatt al Arab River. He did not
consider they were in danger of drowning and claimed that he did not
consider this dangerous because it involved the use of minimum
force.</p><p><a name="0607061000068">Despite this
evidence, coming from higher up the chain of command, the evidence
given at trial made it clear that neither the commanders on the ground
nor the individual soldiers were aware of such a policy or practice
(officially sanctioned or otherwise). Not one of the accused raised
this in their witness statements or interviews under caution. None of
the members of their platoon or section who gave evidence knew of such
a policy or had even heard of looters being put into water-knowledge of
the policy, if one did indeed exist, was restricted to the middle
echelons of the chain of command
only.</p><p><a name="0607061000069">During the course
of the trial a statement was obtained from the then Battle Group
Commander, Brigadier Riddle-Webster, who said that the practice of
&#147;wetting&#148; had never been discussed and had he heard of
such a practice he would have put a stop to it immediately since he
regarded it as illegal, dangerous and immoral. However due to legal
reasons this was not put before the

In respect of the numbers of those persons specified in the question
who may be on the electoral register, I explained in my previous answer
on 12 June 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1045W, that this
information is not collected. Electoral registers are available for
public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has
been included may notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as
to the eligibility of that individual. Currently, it is an offence to
fail to supply information to the ERO and knowingly supply false
information on the annual canvass
form.</p><p><a name="0607061000124">The Electoral
Administration Bill, strengthens the objection process and creates a
new offence of supplying false information of any kind to an ERO, or
failing to supply information, in connection with registration, at any
time. The electoral register does not specify the immigration or asylum
status of individuals entered on it; however, the addition of a
&#147;nationality&#148; box in the registration form does provide
an opportunity for EROs to determine the eligibility of an applicant
for inclusion in the register on the basis of their stated
nationality.</p>

hard to establish and build on the Apprenticeship Frameworks and
procedures required for successful equality. The Apprenticeships
