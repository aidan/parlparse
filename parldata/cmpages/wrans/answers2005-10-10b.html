The UK argued that the treaty does not apply to the use of nuclear energy for military activities and that therefore it was under no duty to provide the Commission with data on the decommissioning. The European Court of Justice found that the Euratom treaty is not applicable to uses of nuclear energy for military purposes and held that article 37 did not apply to the decommissioning of the Jason reactor.

 The future aircraft carrier project is in its assessment phase, the aim of which is to inform how best to meet our developing capability requirements and to balance the key parameters of performance, time and cost. The complement and displacement of the carriers form part of that assessment and final decisions on these and other main specifications have yet to be taken. Such details, together with estimated costs, are being constantly refined and it would be unhelpful to focus on specific figures until after the main investment decision.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list UK armed forces units hatted for potential deployment with <i>(a)</i> EU and <i>(b)</i> NATO units.  [16073]</p>

 The Government declare forces to NATO and the EU through the Defence Planning Questionnaire and Force Catalogue respectively. The declarations entail that those forces are earmarked as available in principle for potential deployment on NATO or EU operations. Any actual decision to deploy is taken by the Government, voluntarily and on a case-by-case basis. However the Government are committed under article V of the North Atlantic Treaty to deployment in collective defence as required.

 The European Defence Agency was formally established on 12 July 2004 by a unanimous Heads of State and Government decision. It was established under the Council Joint Action 2004/551/CFSP on the basis of Article 14 of the Treaty on the European Union.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) has a number of workstrands under way that are intended to improve the effectiveness of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM), including the possible introduction of a voluntary intergovernmental code of conduct. While this work is not intended specifically at removing duplication, we would expect through a more competitive and efficient EDEM that market forces would have a beneficial impact on surplus capacity and inefficiencies. More generally the EDA intends to look at future demand and capacity in various sectors of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (such as armoured fighting vehicles), as well as member states&#039; national strategies for these areas, which may lead to recommendations for improving the efficiency in these sectors. However it will be for each member state to decide how or indeed whether to take these forward.

<a name="stpa_8">Our work to formulate a national defence industrial strategy, recently announced by the Minister for Defence Procurement, will identify those industrial capabilities that we wish to retain within the UK in order to ensure appropriate sovereignty and/or contribute to collaborative efforts. We expect to make a major announcement on this work by the end of 2005, along with our initial conclusions on specific sectors. The strategy is one of many initiatives that contribute to the wider aim of ensuring that the capability requirements of the armed forces can be met, now and in the future, on a cost-effective basis.

 The Government&#039;s main mechanism for supporting renewable energy is the Renewables Obligation. The Renewables Obligation, which requires electricity suppliers to source a proportion of their electricity sales from eligible sources of renewable energy, is technology neutral. However, as a market-based mechanism, the Obligation rewards the most cost effective renewable energy sources. As wind energy is the most economically competitive form of renewable technology with scope for expansion, it is likely that most new renewable capacity between now and 2010 will be wind generation (both onshore and offshore).

There might be times when there is no Welsh speaker available who can answer the query in full, especially if it is complex or specialised. In these cases, the caller will be given the option of discussing the matter in English or writing to us in Welsh&#151;in which case, they would receive a written reply in Welsh.

If they receive a call from someone wishing to speak Welsh, the operator will explain that he or she cannot speak Welsh but will offer to try to connect the caller to a Welsh speaker within the department. If none of our Welsh speakers was available, the operator would explain that this was so and offer the caller the option of continuing the conversation in English, or of leaving their details so that a Welsh speaker could ring back later.

<a name="stpa_106">The HIPC initiative provides relief and cancellation of debts owed to multilateral institutions as well as debts to bilateral governments. To date, debt relief worth $56 billion (&#163;30 billion) in nominal terms has been agreed for 28 countries. Other countries are likely to enter the Initiative next year under its extended &quot;Sunset clause&quot;. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that in recent years the HIPC Initiative has freed up around $1 billion a year from debt service payments for the 28 countries that have qualified under HIPC. The UK is the second largest contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, which assists multilateral institutions with the costs of providing debt relief under HIPC. We have pledged a total of $436 million (&#163;240 million) to the Trust Fund ($221 million, plus $88 million of the European Commission contribution in 2000, and a further $95 million, plus $32 million of an EC contribution in 2002).

We expect to spend about $46 million (&#163;25 million) on qualifying countries this financial year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_110">In June 2005, the G8 Finance Ministers endorsed a proposal to cancel all the remaining debts of HIPCs to the IMF, IDA and the AfDF. When agreed by the international community, the deal will be worth about $55 billion (&#163;30 billion) in debt stock cancellations for the current 38 HIPCs. Donors will provide about $49 billion of this over the next 40 years to IDA and AfDF to compensate for foregone reflows. The cost of debt relief at the IMF ($6.1 billion) will be financed from internal resources, although the donors have committed to provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF&#039;s ability to assist poor countries is not diminished. Annual resources for poverty reduction freed up by the proposal will be around $1 billion in 2007, rising to around $1.7 billion in 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_111">The precise costs to the UK of the G8 proposal are yet to finalised, but are likely to be about $6 billion (&#163;3.3 billion) over the whole 40-year period of implementation. The G8&#039;s proposal, when agreed, will supersede the MDRI for HIPCs, although the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the MDRI to qualifying non-HIPC countries. Assistance under the MDRI is likely to be worth $184 million (&#163;100 million) over the period to 2015 for currently qualifying countries, and up to $463 million (&#163;256 million) if all potentially eligible countries qualify.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_112">G8 Finance Ministers also reiterated in June their continued commitment to the full implementation and financing of HIPC. The UK already exceeds its commitments under HIPC. Our commitment to HIPC and other bilateral debt cancellation policies continue and were not altered by the G8 Finance Ministers&#039; decisions in June.

 DFID relies on the joint united programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for official figures on children affected by HIV. UNAIDS has the global mandate for collating and publishing official statistics on global and sub-Saharan African AIDS epidemics. They publish an annual epidemiological update, which outlines the status of the global and regional AIDS epidemics. However, UNAIDS does not release specific data on future projections, due to methodological constraints. As such, DFID has neither made nor received projections of the number of children infected by HIV in each year up to 2015.

At least &#163;150 million has been earmarked for orphans and vulnerable children, 80 per cent. of which will be spent in Africa. For example, we are supporting UNICEF with an estimated &#163;38 million over three years to assist the worst affected countries in east and southern Africa and some post- conflict countries, to take essential steps to develop and implement comprehensive national action plans.

 Sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, are some of the most cost-effective and beneficial health service interventions available. However, the unmet need for condoms, and other methods of family planning, is very high. The United Nations population fund (UNFPA) estimates that global condom needs for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is around &#163;9 billion annually. Every year there are 340 million new cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Most occur in young people. Many go untreated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w19.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_134">DFID is working to change this situation. We work with governments and others to help poor countries develop and implement their own national strategies to overturn the HIV epidemic and to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights. As for so many other aspects of basic health, improving sexual and reproductive health depends on well functioning health systems and improving the access of people to supplies such as condoms. We believe that effective HIV prevention programmes include providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services including condoms. We also believe that it is important to make special efforts to ensure that those who are most vulnerable have access to these services. This includes sex workers.

<p>
<a name="51010w19.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_135">DFID provides significant support for reproductive health commodities including condoms, through its country programmes and assistance to multilateral organisations such as the UNFPA. The UNFPA estimates that some one billion condoms supplied by donors were used in developing countries in 2001. Nearly half of these were provided by the UK. For the past 10 years, DFID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million condoms annually. We are currently looking at a sustainable long-term response to reproductive health commodity shortages with other donors, in order to provide a more predictable basis for the funding and availability of these essential supplies.

 There is a strong link between Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV infection, particularly in Africa where unsafe sex is the main mode of HIV transmission. DFID supports raising awareness as an integral part of broader approaches to STI and HIV prevention, which include other activities such as provision of sexual and reproductive health services and commodities (e.g. male and female condoms). We are also helping to remove financial, social and geographical barriers to the poorer populations, accessing information, health services and commodities; we also advocate against stigma and discrimination related to HIV.

 DFID recognises the important role that parliaments in developing countries can play in the scrutiny of the management of public resources, including aid agreements entered into by the respective governments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_144">However, DFID has not provided support specifically for parliamentary scrutiny of the terms and conditions of aid agreements but we are currently working with many African countries to support and strengthen parliamentary oversight bodies, e.g. Public Accounts Committees and Supreme Audit Institutions such as National Audit Offices. These are the key links in the formal system of financial accountability in most countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_145">This support includes assistance in Malawi for strengthening the institution of parliament to have powers over state spending, the budget and taxation. In Zambia, a new multi-donor public financial management reform programme, to which DFID is contributing, includes a component to enhance a parliamentary oversight of public resource management. In Uganda, together with other donors, DFID has supported the Office for Parliamentary Development, which has helped to strengthen the parliament, including by the provision of training for parliamentarians.

 DFID recognises the importance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank being transparent and accountable to parliaments in developing countries. Clearly, such accountability needs to be at the heart of their relationship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_146">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the World Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. This is a national strategy for development that sets the agenda, which donors, including the World Bank, should follow in each country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_147">In the past, parliamentary engagement in the PRS process has often been weak. However, over the past two years, DFID country offices have begun to support 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 74W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
stronger involvement of parliamentarians in the PRS process. DFID is providing support for parliamentary engagement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent monitoring group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_148">At board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new World Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes board minutes public. The World Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_149">The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has held workshops in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda to raise awareness among parliamentarians.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_150">The World Bank Institute has also supported the African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) and the Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) to encourage parliamentary scrutiny and action against corruption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. This provides opportunities for parliaments to scrutinise the World Bank and engage more deeply in development policy issues. The independent network has some 450 members from over 90 countries and facilitates direct dialogue between parliamentarians and the World Bank to achieve greater transparency of policies and practices.

<p><a name="st_154"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In December 2004 the UK agreed a new poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) arrangement with Uganda which provides a grant of up to &#163;145 million over three years to support the implementation of the Uganda Government&#039;s poverty eradication action plan (PEAP). We indicated at that time that &#163;40 million would be set aside as PRBS in the financial year 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">The arrangement links budget support to reforms detailed in the PEAP. It includes criteria on Uganda&#039;s political transition to multiparty politics, which will help maintain the stability required to make progress in reducing poverty, alongside criteria relating to macro-economic and sector policies and management. All the indicators are drawn from the PEAP and are designed to ensure our support is transparent and predictable. When our last release of budget support fell due in March 2005 we were concerned by several aspects of the political transition, including that insufficient progress had been made towards establishing a fair basis for a multi-party system. We, therefore, decided to withhold &#163;5 million out of the total of &#163;40 million for the financial year.

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The conflict in northern Uganda severely disrupts normal economic activity and for the moment constrains economic recovery. Over 90 per cent. of the population in the districts that are most affected are currently displaced and dependent upon humanitarian relief. We are providing substantial humanitarian support in response to this need. In 2004&#150;05 we provided over &#163;11 million of emergency assistance which was channelled mainly through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Red Cross. In 2005&#150;06 a further &#163;3 million for emergency assistance has already been committed and more is planned. The UK and other donors are discussing with the Government what assistance will be required to support economic recovery in the north once the security situation has sufficiently improved.

<p><a name="st_156"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In recent years, we have provided resources for UNICEF&#039;s humanitarian programmes in northern Uganda, which includes support for emergency education provision and vocational training. In total, we provided &#163;650,000 for UNICEF&#039;s work in northern Uganda in 2002&#150;03, &#163;1.62 million in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;1.37 million in 2004&#150;05.

 A high proportion of the disposable cups and take-away containers currently used by the House of Commons Refreshment Department are potentially recyclable. However, because they are all inherently contaminated with foodstuffs and there are very limited facilities for the separation of waste, there is little opportunity for effective recycling of these items other than by incineration to generate electricity, as presently happens.

Bidders have been asked in general to propose materials and packaging that deliver environmental benefits and, specifically, to propose disposable catering cups and take-away food containers that are more readily recyclable. The waste management contract is also in the process of being re-tendered by the Parliamentary Estates Directorate and arrangements for the better separation of waste are being reviewed as part of this process.

 Two legislative proposals relating to harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport are currently being negotiated within the EU institutions. The first is a proposal to replace the existing rules on drivers&#039; hours as contained in EU Regulation (EEC No. 3820/85). The second is a proposed directive (known as the &quot;enforcement directive&quot;) to replace the current requirements relating to the levels of checks member states must undertake to ensure compliance with the driver&#039;s hours rules.

<a name="stpa_13">The transport council reached a political agreement on both these proposals on 11 June 2004, and the Common Positions were formally adopted on 9 December 2004. Under the Common Position on driver&#039;s hours the main changes proposed for the core provisions on driving and rest times are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">an increase in the minimum uninterrupted daily rest period from 8 to 9 hours (plus changes to the way total daily rest is taken);.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">2. While these figures represent gross payments actually made to the barristers during the year, some of those monies have been (or may in the future be) repaid to the Community Legal Service Fund by other parties. This will happen in cases where the legally aided party wins the case and recovers costs from the opponent. Once those costs are recovered the legally aided party&#039;s solicitor refunds some or all of the money to the CLS Fund. As a consequence the figures may not reflect the actual cost of the barristers&#039; fees to the Fund. In some cases where costs are recovered from the losing party the actual cost to the CLS Fund may be very little or even nothing.</p>

<a name="stpa_63">On 29 August, the executive director of the UNODC Costa announced provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&#150;05 from their annual poppy survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes (mt), a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004. Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for a significant increase in yield since last year. UNODC will publish their final report in October, but these figures are unlikely to change. The yield figures are disappointing, but the cultivation figures give a better picture of farmers&#039; intentions (a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05).

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51010w34.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 In July 2000, the Taliban imposed a ban on opium poppy cultivation. By July 2001, the tactics they employed had led to a 91 per cent. reduction. This ban was enforced with a combination of fear and bribery, and led to a rise in the price of opium so that those with opium stockpiles profited, many of whom colluded with the Taliban Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w34.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">The lack of a viable central state and war-damaged infrastructure in Afghanistan created conditions in which opium cultivation could thrive once again. Opium is highly profitable for those controlling land, and for the warlords and Governors controlling peripheral parts of this mountainous country. There has been little incentive for them to engage with the embryonic central state and, until recently, government institutions have been unable to impact on the trade. President Karzai, with support from the international community, is working hard to change this and is increasing central government presence in the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 117W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provinces. The President has made clear that eliminating opium is vital for Afghanistan&#039;s future and is key to stability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w34.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">Progress has been made. The provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&#150;05 announced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in August show an estimated 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation over the previous year. Production and yield, however, are expected to be down since last year by only 2.4 per cent. as good weather and an absence of crop disease brought about a significant increase in yield. It is going to take a long time to uproot something so deeply entrenched in Afghanistan&#039;s culture and economy. But like the Afghans, the UK has always maintained that we are in this for the long term.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary last had discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka on the peace process when he met Foreign Minister Kadirgamar in London on 14 March. The tragic assassination of Mr. Kadirgamar on 12 August was an unconscionable act of terrorism which we and our international partners have condemned unreservedly. This and the ongoing violence in Eastern Sri Lanka have put the Ceasefire Agreement in Sri Lanka under increasing strain and the peace process is facing its most serious challenge since the Ceasefire Agreement came into force in 2002. It is incumbent on both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the Ceasefire Agreement fully.

<a name="stpa_80">In statements on 19 September and 26 September respectively the Tokyo Co-Chairs, including the UK as the EU Presidency, and the EU condemned the LTTE&#039;s continuing use of violence and called on the LTTE to take immediate public steps to demonstrate their commitment to the peace process and their willingness to change. An immediate end to political assassinations and the recruitment of child soldiers would be two such steps. It is essential that the LTTE responds. The European Union has also made clear that delegations from the LTTE will no longer be received in any of the EU member states until further notice. The EU is also actively considering the listing of the LTTE as an organisation engaged in terrorism (the UK has proscribed the LTTE since 2001). We also deplore the activities of paramilitary groups which fuel the cycle of violence and unrest. The Government of Sri Lanka have a responsibility under the Ceasefire Agreement to disarm or relocate these groups from the north and east.

Steps were taken to launch a new Commission for Rural Communities division as a distinct body within the Countryside Agency&#039;s legal framework on 9 March 2005, pending the passage of legislation to establish the Commission as a statutory body in its own right. The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill contained an estimate of around &#163;458,000 for the cost incurred in 2004&#150;05 for the establishment and launch of the Commission.

<p>
<a name="51010w42.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_144">PVR I is required at all UK petrol stations with sales above 500 cubic metres of petrol a year. The PVR I controls should prevent all petrol vapour from this source escaping to the atmosphere. Statutory guidance reflects the mandatory requirements relating to the technical standards systems must meet when installed. The guidance also specifies the maintenance regime which must be carried out to ensure PVR I systems continue to operate effectively. Local authorities carry out periodic inspections of petrol stations to ensure compliance with the requirements.

<p>
<a name="51010w42.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_145">Research has shown that PVR II systems under laboratory conditions can reduce emissions of petrol vapour to air by around 85 per cent. We are considering whether to require some petrol stations to install PVR II equipment.

 The Department&#039;s current estimate for the number of plastic bags given away in England between these dates is 66.8 billion bags. This estimate is based around a figure of 10 billion per annum for UK carrier bag usage, contained within a consultant&#039;s report for WRAP in 2005. This figure was cited by in the Scottish Executive&#039;s Extended Impact Assessment for the plastic bag levy bill. The figure for England per annum is generated by calculating the proportion of the UK population that live in England (currently 83.5 per cent.) and adjusting the UK figure accordingly. In calculating this figure over several years it has to be assumed that the figures have been constant since 1997 as we do not hold any data relating to the fluctuations in usage over this period.

<a name="stpa_273">To encourage the provision of private and occupational pensions that work for women, we introduced part-time workers regulations which ensure that terms and conditions of employment, including those related to access to occupational pension schemes, do not discriminate against part-time workers. We have also introduced stakeholder pensions to offer a low-cost, portable and flexible pension option which can be particularly suitable for women taking career breaks. Measures in the Pensions Act 2004, such as new rules to increase the pension rights of early leavers, are also beneficial to women.

 Under the Private Finance Initiative, the estate of the former DSS, was transferred to the private sector in April 1998 for the provision of fully serviced accommodation. Following the formation of the Department for Work and Pensions, the estate of the former employment service became subject to the same partnership contract (known as PRIME) in December 2003. Within the contract, there are specific clauses that cover environmental impacts, and encourage the private sector partner to develop environmental improvements The Department&#039;s Estates partner&#151;Land Securities Trillium, whose Environmental Management System is accredited to International Standard ISO 14001, works closely with the DWP corporate Sustainable Development Team to identify opportunities for environmental improvements. The Sustainable Development Team contract manages this element of the partnership, and continually assesses performance. Regular partnership meetings are held between the Department and Land Securities Trillium to monitor progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w54.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_276">The partnership approach has enabled innovative measures to be developed&#151;such as the use of spend to save projects designed to improve energy and water efficiency across the estate, and a programme to maximise the recycling of paper waste. Full details of all measures can be found within the annual DWP Sustainable Development Report, to which Land Securities Trillium make a full contribution.
