 We expect that gap funding grant payments of up to &#163;120 million will be made to registered social landlords (RSLs) in support of large scale voluntary transfers in 2008-09.

 The following table shows the number of community sentences that terminated in England and Wales for 2005-07. It also provides the percentage split for the reason of termination, including the percentage that completed successfully (those that ran their full course and that terminated early for good progress).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="81112w0002.htm_para0"><a name="08111229000400">The improvement in positive terminations for non-community orders reflects the fact that these are pre-Criminal Justice Act 2003 sentences and were only given for offences committed before 4 April 2005. Negative terminations tend to occur earlier in the life of an order, leaving a higher proportion of these orders to terminate successfully over the course of time.</p>

 The Political Parties and Elections Bill provides two powers for the Electoral Commission to enter premises. The first power is contained in paragraph 1(5) of schedule 1 to the Bill, and replicates, with one important change, the existing power in section 146(3) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. This provides that, at any reasonable time, the Commission may enter premises for the purposes of carrying out its functions. Having entered under the power, the Commission may inspect documents relating to the income and expenditure of the individual or organisation whose premises the Commission has entered. It may also make copies.</p>

 Table 1 shows incidents of prisoner on staff assaults in each of the last five years by prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="81112w0003.htm_para15"><a name="08111229000820">The information set out is subject to important qualifications. The NOMS Incident Reporting System processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="81112w0003.htm_para16"><a name="08111229000821">Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories: prisoner on prisoner, prisoner on officer, prisoner on other and other (which may include non-prisoner perpetrators). The recorded incidents of assaults on prison officers are not completely exclusive to officers; establishment recording sometimes includes assaults on other prison staff in this category. Rises or falls in reported numbers from one year to the next are not a good indicator of an underlying trend for a particular prison. Additionally there have been improvements in reporting over the years, and this is reflected in the tables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="81112w0003.htm_para17"><a name="08111229000822">Assault data are complex and the numbers need to be interpreted with caution. Information recorded as assault incidents may involve one or many prisoners as some assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim. Additionally in a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="81112w0003.htm_para18"><a name="08111229000823">The numbers supplied refer to the number of individual assault incidents. The numbers refer to all incidents recorded as assaults; these may also include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact events and allegations.</p>

Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and since mid 2007 this has been applied to the public and contracted out estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety.</p>

 There are positive indications that accredited programmes may be effective in reducing re-offending for offenders in the community. The re-offending rate for all offenders who had undertaken interventions was 55 per cent., based on a two-year reconviction rate. Programme completers did statistically significantly better than those who did not start or who dropped out of programmes. The rates were 38 per cent., 61 per cent. and 64 per cent. respectively.</p>

The procedure seeks to reduce the noise of arriving aircraft by ensuring that aircraft remain as high as possible for as long as possible and that segments of level flight during descent, which increase engine noise, are avoided. Guidance in the form of an arrivals code of practice on the use of CDA, developed in partnership with the industry, was originally issued in February 2002. This guidance has been kept under review and a revised code was published in November 2006. The code can be accessed on the departmental website at:</p>

Following the successful implementation of the code at these airports, the code has been used by NATS as a basis to promote and encourage greater use of CDA at other airports nationally and internationally. However it has to be acknowledged that local operational circumstances and restraints can vary from airport to airport. CDAs are agreed by air traffic controllers and pilots on a flight-by-flight basis, according to weather and traffic conditions. In all cases, NATS' overriding consideration is the safe and efficient operation of air traffic control (ATC) operations.</p>

In addition, MOD&#146;s Service Risks Insurance Premium Refunds Scheme contributes towards the inflated life insurance premiums which some insurers charge personnel serving on operations.</p>

The response explained that some brokers have special arrangements with insurers for providing motor insurance for service personnel. In particular, the Services&#146; Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel, who are a panel of independent insurance and investment advisers specialising in advising service personnel, can arrange motor insurance cover without premium loading and offer rates that are competitive with the rates available to civilians and in many cases are cheaper. They also provide some benefits that are not normally found in policies sold to civilians.</p>

The Department of Health, in conjunction with the MOD, has launched five community mental health pilots targeted at veterans. Each site has a trained community veterans&#146; mental health therapist. Veterans can access this service directly or through their GP, ex-service organisations, the Veterans&#146; Welfare Service, or social service departments, the initiative is NHS-led and reflects NHS best practice. This will address assessment and treatment of veterans&#146; mental health problems in the longer term. Within the north of England, a pilot is in operation at NHS Bishop Auckland General Hospital.

 The Annapolis process has been a first step to restoring trust between Israel and the Palestinian people. We should seek to build on it to create a process which can deliver a broader peace, in which all exercise their rights and fulfil their responsibilities. This would be a true settlement between Israel and all Arab states. I hope it will be given new momentum from the beginning of the new American administration.</p>

 Through our embassy in Kathmandu, we have monitored the situation of Tibetan refugees in Nepal closely since protests began earlier this year. On 23 June, our ambassador to Nepal joined a d&#233;marche on the Nepalese Foreign Secretary to raise concerns of the international community about the arrest of three prominent Tibetans in Kathmandu and the use of arbitrary detention under the Public Security Act. Staff from our embassy in Kathmandu have also accompanied officials from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights when they observed police action against protests by Tibetan refugees. We have encouraged the Nepal police to ensure that all officers act with restraint when handling protest groups and urged that action is taken against any officers accused of using excessive force. Together with our EU and other international partners, we will continue to monitor the situation in Nepal closely.</p>

Opportunistic screening is offered to all sexually active women and men, aged under 25 years, in a variety of health and non-health care settings. The Department has made increasing screening volumes and reducing chlamydia prevalence a priority for the national health service and it is included as a tier two indicator in the operating framework for 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

 A stage 1 equality impact assessment (EIA) of the National DNA database (NDNAD) was conducted by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) in June-July 2007. This was an initial screening process to identify any potential equality issues in NDNAD processes. It made a number of recommendations which are being progressed by a working group comprising NPIA officials and representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the NDNAD Ethics Group.

The payments involved and relevant dates are presented in table 2. Decoupling is also a major focus of the current health check negotiations, where agreement is expected to be reached on phasing out several other coupled payments (with their amounts again being added to the SPS and SAPS), with expected phase-outs as presented in table 3. The UK &#147;Vision for the Common Agricultural Policy&#148; is clear that in the longer term, direct payments should be phased out completely, with payments to farmers targeted at delivering public benefits, including environmental benefits, through a re-shaped pillar two.</p>

 Neither DEFRA nor Ofwat, the independent economic regulator of the water industry, collects information on the increases in water bills for groups of customers of a particular funding or charitable status. Where a company makes a change to the way it charges for water or sewerage services, Ofwat challenges the company&#146;s proposals to make sure charges are not unduly preferential to one customer group over another. Groups of customers are defined by the costs they are likely to impose and are independent of the financial or charitable status of individual non-household customers. Ofwat&#146;s checks also ensure that the company gains no additional revenue from the new method of charging.</p>

Most notably, my Department published the finding of a major review of the impacts of rural land use and management on flood generation in November 2004. Subsequently, further work was commissioned on the analysis of historical data sets to look for the impacts of land use and management change on flood generation. The final report will be published in the near future. The Environment Agency takes into account the role that washlands or wetlands may play in flood management when it is considering specific flood management problems.</p>

and the middle east. This indicated that tax policy and administration do not enable business and promote growth in most developing countries. Even in the countries which have in place appropriate taxes at appropriate rates, weak tax administration results in a heavy financial and time burden for businesses, especially for small and medium enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="81112w0018.htm_para1"><a name="08111242000900">The studies, which were endorsed by a DFID/FIAS supported conference in Zambia in February 2007 of senior officials from Africa, showed that past donor assistance on tax had too often been fragmented between policy and administration. Tax reform had tended to focus on short-term revenue generation rather than structuring the tax system to promote economic efficiency and growth (and therefore longer-term revenue generation). This requires promoting investment, private sector development and the creation of a culture of compliance. DFID and FIAS have now initiated a project to help address such problems, by developing and piloting best practice policy guidance and support for implementation.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) participates annually in the joint Government-donor review of the public financial management reform programme, with the most recent taking place in May 2008.

Tax revenues continue to grow, with a 37 per cent. increase during the first three quarters of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007; revenue out-turn up to September 2008 is 99 per cent. of budget forecast (compared to 85 per cent. in 2007); and Government have spent 72 per cent. of their budget in the first three quarters of 2008 (compared to 62 per cent. in 2007). In December, the Government will launch a second phase of the programme. This will build on these successes and provide additional focus to financial management in line ministries. It will also address outstanding issues from the first phase, including the integration of recurrent and capital budgets, and strengthen the links between planning, budgeting and expenditure.</p>

 Talks between the Government of Nepal and the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN) resulted in a 20-point agreement reached on 7 August 2007.

<p><a name="stpa_532"><a name="81112w0020.htm_para9"><a name="08111242001046"><i> (a)</i> Nigeria has made good progress in improving the management of its oil revenues since the restoration of civilian rule in 1999. In 2004 the Government introduced an oil price based fiscal rule (OPBFR) which was given legal force within the federal-level Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2007. The FRA provides a framework for  <br>

fiscal management and institutionalises reforms intended to enhance fiscal transparency, accountability and medium-term fiscal sustainability. All oil revenue above a predetermined threshold has been held in a special excess crude account (ECA). Application of the OPBFR rule has led to considerable budget surpluses and quick accumulation of foreign currency reserves, which currently amount to over US$60 billion, covering more than 30 months of imports. Debt management has also improved greatly. In 2006, Nigeria used US$18 billion of its oil savings to settle its Paris Club debt obligations, leading to a public debt to GDP ratio of 12.5 per cent. of GDP in 2007. This is lower than the 34 per cent. median for countries with the same sovereign credit risk rating of BB-. External debt is now only 16 per cent. of total stock, most of this being multilateral debt contracted on concessional terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_533"><a name="81112w0020.htm_para10"><a name="08111242001047">Oil accounts for over 90 per cent. of total government revenues. Since 1999, approximately half of all revenues go to the federal Government and the rest to state and local governments. Under Nigeria's constitution, states have considerable autonomy. A major challenge to further improving fiscal policy in Nigeria is incentivising states to adopt sound public financial management policies, despite pressure to spend the increased revenues from higher oil prices, and building states&#146; capacity to implement the necessary reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_534"><a name="81112w0020.htm_para11"><a name="08111242001048"><i> (b)</i> In addition to the aforementioned reforms, Nigeria has also taken significant steps to strengthen its systems of accountability. It is now a global leader in the extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI), which aims to generate greater transparency in the flow of revenues from extractive industries. The Nigerian EITI (NEITI) successfully completed a full physical, process and financial audit of the oil and gas sector for the period 1999 to 2004. The 2005 audit is almost complete. In 2007, Nigeria became the first country to enact the EITI into legalisation. Further work is needed to institutionalise NEITI, and enforce the NEITI Act. Nigeria is also taking steps to improve the transparency and efficiency of its budget process, including the development of medium term sector strategies within a medium term economic framework. Progress on institutionalising budget reforms has been slow due to resistance from political interests, poor co-ordination, and weak capacity. Public procurement legislation was recently introduced, which aims to improve the transparency and effectiveness of public expenditure. Implementation and enforcement of this legislation could be impeded by weak capacity in ministries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="81112w0020.htm_para12"><a name="08111242001049"><i> (c)</i> Non-oil growth to generate employment and raise incomes is a priority of the Nigerian Government. The non-oil sector provides the majority of livelihoods, mostly in agriculture, and is currently contributing strongly to overall growth. The IMF estimates that non-oil growth in 2007 was 9.6 per cent., compared to annual averages of 7.8 per cent. across all sectors for 2004 to 2007, and just 2 per cent. between 1980 and 2002. Agriculture, construction, telecommunications, transportation, retail and wholesale have all grown strongly. However, despite the strong response of the non-oil sector to reforms to date, major challenges remain. Nigeria is ranked 118 out of 181 countries in the World Bank Doing Business 2009 survey, and Nigeria's huge infrastructure gap must be addressed if the economy is to fully realise its growth potential. Non-oil exports  <br>

The recent strong performance of the telecommunication and financial sectors demonstrate their growth potential once regulatory frameworks are established and macroeconomic conditions are favourable.</p>

This approach ensures that they are better equipped to deal with a diverse set of circumstances and meeting the needs of our customers.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 October 2008]:</i> We have no specific costs that can be directly attributed to moving income support carers to a modified jobseeker&#146;s allowance as they constitute a minority of the income support caseload that would be moved. As such, the work we have done to cost a move to a modified jobseeker&#146;s allowance has been on the basis of moving the entire caseload. However, there would be no change in the amount of benefit paid to carers on income support nor would there be any additional one-off implementation costs associated with this specific group.

 The consultation process for the relicensing of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) is part of an assessment of their performance being undertaken by the National Audit Office. SSCs are being assessed by the NAO in five groups of five between now and August 2009. Each SSC has been asked to provide a stakeholder map to the NAO which includes sector specific stakeholders such as trade associations, employer forums and professional bodies and where appropriate sector specific awarding bodies. The NAO will then as part of the evidence gathering process use the map to consult with the identified key stakeholders. The consultation is an inclusive process and any organisation which wishes to input evidence on any SSC can submit their views to the NAO. This includes professional bodies, regulatory bodies, awarding bodies, funding bodies and regional partners, as well as individual employers.</p>

 I have been asked to reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, as matters to do with employers&#146; liability compulsory insurance (ELCI) sit with the DWP. I understand that your inquiry is about ELCI and not public liability insurance. At present, where a potential claimant who has been injured or made ill through their work and is unable to identify the employer&#146;s insurer to claim against, they may use the employers&#146; liability code of practice tracing service. The code of practice, which was launched on 1 November 1999, is a voluntary code operated by the insurance industry, which requires signatories to retain historical records of insurance policies for 60 years.</p>

For this reason, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to consider positive measures within the industry to address this issue. I understand that the ABI are looking into the feasibility of a database.</p>

 Details of the evidence considered by the steering group are referenced in its report. As the report acknowledges, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of individual sex and relationships education (SRE programmes). The best evidence comes from evidence reviews, such as Douglas Kirby&#146;s &#145;Emerging Answers: Research findings on programmes to reduce teenage pregnancies and STIs&#146; (2007), which identified the key characteristics of effective SRE programmes. None of the evidence reviews suggest that provision of SRE led to increased levels of sexual activity.</p>
