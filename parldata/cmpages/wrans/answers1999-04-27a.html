<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to support the cashmere industry.  [77648]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 My Department has worked hard to support the UK cashmere knitwear industry. In response to the US threat of punitive duties on imports of cashmere knitwear from the EU, we announced a bond scheme which indemnified exporters of UK-manufactured cashmere against losses arising from the US action. In the event, and after intensive lobbying from the UK Government, the US removed cashmere knitwear from the list of products subject to the US retaliation.

<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the implementation of the provisions of the minimum wage legislation.  [81940]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 We estimate that implementation of the national minimum wage has directly benefited almost 2 million workers. Initial feedback indicates that very few employers are deliberately seeking to evade their responsibilities. Recent research commissioned by Reed Personnel Services shows that almost 9 out of 10 companies surveyed support the national minimum wage in principle and were paying their workers the minimum wage rates in advance of its introduction on 1 April.
<P>

<a name="90427w01.htm_para0">The Inland Revenue is enforcing the national minimum wage policy, and will supply this Department with data on all matters relating to compliance on a regular basis. Further information on the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage will be available once official statistics are published in the autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what regulations apply to the standards of goods and services sent to the United Kingdom by companies based overseas; and if he will make a statement.  [82043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> As far as I am aware, all the regulations for which my Department has responsibility dealing with goods and services supplied in the UK, apply irrespective of whether the company supplying those goods or services are based within the UK or elsewhere overseas.

<a name="90427w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement about the future of the Export Credits Guarantee Department's reinsurance facilities.  [82624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Following the privatisation of ECGD's Insurance Services Group in 1991, which was responsible for providing credit insurance in respect of raw materials, consumer durables type exports normally sold on up to 6 months credit, ECGD has provided reinsurance support to private sector credit insurers when there has been a lack of private reinsurance for this class of exports. Since then, demand for ECGD reinsurance has declined as private market capacity has increased. ECGD is to conduct a review of its role in the provision of reinsurance. This will be preceded by a public consultation which will commence shortly. The results of the review are expected in the Autumn.
<P>

<a name="90427w01.htm_para1">A copy of ECGD's consultation document has been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what meetings he has had with the Assembly election campaign leaders of each of the political parties.  [79387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I am not sure what is meant by "election campaign leaders". I have had no meetings with any individuals in respect of the organisation of the Assembly election campaign for their Party. I have had many contacts with Welsh MPs, including the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey), as the leaders of their Welsh Parliamentary Parties, and as there are no Welsh Conservative MPs, with the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) as the spokesperson for the Conservative Party on Welsh Affairs. I have also had regular informal contact with Mr. Rod Richards and Mr. Mike German as the respective leaders of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party in Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the work he has done to secure <i>(a)</i> Korean and <i>(b)</i> Japanese inward investment into the United Kingdom.  [81102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 1999]:</i> In addition to taking any opportunity to promote Wales to overseas markets, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Wales has hosted a reception at Lancaster House for senior Japanese industrialists and has written to potential and existing investors. He has also met the Ambassador of each country.
<P>

<a name="90427w01.htm_para2">I led an inward investment mission to Japan last October. These efforts have been in addition to the day-to-day efforts of the Welsh Development Agency.
<P>

<a name="90427w01.htm_para3">Following the transfer of functions, this issue will be a matter for the National Assembly.

<a name="90427w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 Information on the basis of a diagnosis is not centrally available. The only available information, as given in the table, is based on the 1991 Census of Population and the 1997 Welsh Household Interview Survey, the latter being a sample survey and subject to sampling error. The two sources are not wholly comparable, but can be used as an indication of the relative numbers by authority in each year.

<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 In the Welsh Health Survey, a postal survey carried out in 1995, people were asked "Do you have depression now that you have had for 3 months or more?". The following table shows, by health authority and unitary authority, the percentage of the respondents (aged 18 and over) who answered yes. Because of possible response bias in surveys of this nature, the figures given may overstate the actual prevalence of the condition in the population.

<a name="90427w02.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the total number of genetically modified food trial sites; how frequently they have been inspected by the Health and Safety Executive; and if he will list those sites which have not been inspected in the past 12 months.  [72677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 February 1999]:</i> Since the current regulations came into force in 1993, genetically modified crops have been grown on approximately 373 individual test sites, some at the same research establishments or farms. In the coming growing season, we have received notifications that genetically modified crops will be grown at 65 different sites.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para1">There is no set pattern of inspection. In previous years about half of the active test sites have been inspected each year. From April 1999, inspections will increase so that at least one test site from each consent is inspected. In total, we expect about 70 to 80 site inspections to take place and repeat inspections will be carried out where necessary. Also from this year, an annual report on inspection activities is to be produced listing the sites which were inspected. Copies of the report will be placed in the Library as soon as the report is produced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 1999]:</i> The information requested is not available. There is no requirement to keep or collect such information.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para2">Anyone intending to use premises for the keeping of genetically modified animals in the United Kingdom must give prior notification to the Health and Safety Executive under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations, but there is no requirement to keep records of the export of such animals.




<P>

<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para3">The keeping of genetically modified mammals is subject to licencing by the Home Office and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. The Home Office collects figures on the discharge of transgenic animals but these figures do not distinguish between export and other methods of discharge such as humane killing.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to have gathered enough scientific evidence from farm-scale testing of genetically modified crops to make an assessment of the environmental and wildlife consequences of the commercial growing of such crops.  [81639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is difficult to give a clear statement about when we expect to have gathered enough scientific evidence, but the programme of ecological studies will run for three years in the first instance.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para4">In the first year, the evaluations of the effects of the management of the GM crops on wildlife will be carried out on a limited number of sites, as explained in my answer given today to my hon. Friend's other question (PQ 81638). The first year's work will establish the methodology for future years, but will also generate information which could give an early indication of whether there could be adverse effects.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para5">The work in the subsequent years 2000 and 2001 will be carried out on at least 20 sites for each crop. Because this work is carried out on a greater number of sites, the results will have greater statistical significance. The research contractors will be following the crops through the cropping rotations in subsequent years.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para6">To ensure that this work is scientifically sound, we are in the process of appointing an independent steering committee to oversee the experimental design and methodologies, the statistics, and to advise on the interpretation of the results. I will consider the advice of this committee about at what stage we have gathered enough evidence and whether, and if so, what further studies need to be carried out. The work will be reviewed year by year and we will use this to decide how best to proceed with the managed development of GM crops in the UK.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_wqn4"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has for farm-scale test sites for genetically modified crops in addition to the three he announced on 15 April in the current year.  [81638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 This year, three fields of genetically modified (GM) spring oilseed rape and four fields of GM maize will be planted for the farm-scale evaluations and compared with a similar number of fields of equivalent non-GM crops. It is anticipated that three to five fields of GM winter oilseed rape will be planted in August.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para7">In subsequent years, at least 20 fields of each crop will be planted to enable the evaluations to be carried out at a scale which will generate sufficient information to ensure 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1999 : Column: 90</I><P>
that a rigorous statistical analysis can be carried out to identify whether or not the management of the GM crops results in indirect effects on wildlife compared to non-GM crops.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para8">Information on the farm-scale evaluations will be published shortly on the DETR Website (www.environment.detr.gov.uk/acre/wildlife/index.htm).
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_wqn5"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what regulations he has applied to the dispersal of seed from genetically modified crops grown in farm-scale test sites over the next five years.  [81640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 All the releases of genetically modified (GM) crops will be carried out under the appropriate authorisations in accordance with the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992, as amended. With respect to the control of dispersal of seed, the farmers growing the crops will in addition be applying the guidelines being prepared by the industry body Supply Chain Initiative for Modified Agricultural Crops (SCIMAC). The draft guidelines cover the issue of seed dispersal, and farmers will be advised to take the necessary precautions to prevent seed spillage and dispersal.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what quality control measures are in place to ensure that highway repairs undertaken by the Highways Agency are of adequate durability.  [81957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Highway repairs undertaken by the Highways Agency are usually procured under contract and the terms of the contract include the "Specification for Highway Works" (the latest edition was published by the Stationery Office in May 1998). This is the main document that sets out the performance, materials and workmanship requirements.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para9">Workmanship on site and contract compliance is supervised by suitably qualified and experienced highway engineers and inspectors commissioned by the Highways Agency.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para10">The specification includes detail of checkpoints at which suppliers provide the Highway's Agency's agents with evidence of compliance with the specification either by testing of materials and/or by staged inspection of the work. Work is not accepted until it is certified as meeting the requirements of the specification.

<P>
<UL>(2) when he plans to lay guidance issued under the contaminated land regime before each House of Parliament;  [81799]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meale </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> Implementation of the contaminated land regime in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is dependent upon statutory guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State, and also on secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para11">The Act requires the Secretary of State to consult the Environment Agency and others before he issues that guidance. Two rounds of consultation on draft texts have been carried out. We intend to issue a further draft of the guidance, for a final round of consultations, in June, with the aim of laying the final draft before each House of Parliament before the Summer recess. We intend to make the Commencement Order and Regulations necessary to implement the Part IIA regime at the same time.
<P>

<a name="90427w02.htm_para12">This should enable us to bring the regime into force in England on 1 December. Implementation of the regime in Scotland and Wales is the responsibility of their respective Secretaries of State.

<a name="90427w03.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the current maximum sentence for serious offences relating to asbestos.  [81026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 At present, the higher courts may impose unlimited fines for Health and Safety at work offences, including those related to asbestos, and may imprison people for breaching asbestos licensing requirements. The lower courts may fine up to &#163;20,000 for certain charges, which may be brought in asbestos-related cases, and up to &#163;5,000 for others. However, within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the Courts alone.
<P>

<a name="90427w03.htm_para0">I am concerned that the general level of penalties imposed by the Courts for Health and Safety offences, including those related to asbestos, do not match their seriousness, especially given that lives are being put at risk. The Government are considering what can be done to address this, including consideration of whether the available maximum penalties remain appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list those topics to which subsidiarity cannot apply, being wholly within the sole competence of the European Union.  [81430]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There are two topics which are solely within the competence of the European Community by virtue of the Community Treaties, and to which subsidiarity is therefore not applicable. These are: (a) the Common Commercial Policy; and (b) the Common Fisheries Policy insofar as it relates to conservation of marine resources.
<P>

<a name="90427w03.htm_para1">The Community may also acquire implied exclusive competence by enacting legislation which restricts the ability of Member States to act in a particular area as long as that legislation is in force. Examples of such areas are parts of the Single Market and the Common Agricultural Policy. However, before enacting this legislation, the Community would, since entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, have had to take subsidiarity concerns into account.

 The Department does use Queen's Counsel in the conduct of its litigation. They are used for important and complex cases. For the rest, the Department uses the panel counsel referred to in the Written Answer to the hon. Member from my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General on 26 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>1-2</i>. Approval for off-panel counsel is sought from my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General as necessary. Records are not maintained in a form which would enable the number of occasions in which the Department has instructed Queen's Counsel to be identified in the last three years and the cost of doing so would incur disproportionate cost.

<a name="90427w04.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security by how much it would be possible to increase the basic state pension, taking into account savings on means- tested benefits and increases in income tax revenues, if the &#163;100 winter fuel payment were abolished and all the proceeds spent on the basic state pension.  [81975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The amount allocated for Winter Fuel Payments for 1999-2000 is &#163;0.8 billion. We estimate that this would provide an increase in the basic State pension for one year only in the order of &#163;2.55 a week for Category A cases and &#163;1.50 a week for category BL cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have no plans to use the private sector to deliver Social Security benefits. However, we will be using the private sector to support the delivery of new systems and to support staff to manage the changes needed to achieve the Government's objectives for Welfare Reform.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w04.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Ministers decided in November 1998 that in 4 of the 12 Single Work-focused Gateway (SWFG) areas, organisations from the private and/or voluntary sector would be invited to lead the delivery of SWFG. We would expect to see all successful organisations finally selected to deliver SWFG working in partnership with local organisations from the voluntary, private and public sector within each locality.

 HSG(95)8 "NHS responsibilities for meeting continuing health care needs" covers the arrangements that health authorities need to make for patients who have continuing health care needs which can be met in hospital, nursing homes or their own homes. The guidance confirms that people in nursing homes may require some regular access to specialist medical, nursing or other community health services, including specialist medical or nursing equipment, but does not specifically list pressure-relieving equipment. There have been no changes to the guidance since it was issued in 1995. In the light of the Health Committee report on the interface between health and social services, there will be a review of continuing health care policy.

 Local authorities in London have powers to control ear piercing and cosmetic body piercing businesses by licensing using provisions in the London Local Authorities Act 1991, or by registration and byelaws using provisions in the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1981, depending on which legislation they have adopted. The majority of London local authorities have adopted licensing powers.
<P>

<a name="90427w05.htm_para0">Local authorities outside London have powers to register and make byelaws for ear piercing businesses under the provisions of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, but not for cosmetic body piercing businesses.
<P>

<a name="90427w05.htm_para1">Local authorities are empowered to make byelaws or licence conditions for ear piercing businesses related to hygienic and safe practice. Breaches of these byelaws and licence conditions may lead to the cancellation of registration or a licence.
<P>

<a name="90427w05.htm_para2">In addition, under the London Local Authorities Act 1991, local authorities in London may revoke or refuse to grant, renew or transfer a licence, if the individual carrying on the business is not reasonably regarded by the local authority as a fit and proper person to hold a licence. Therefore it is possible that if information about a conviction for a sexual offence came to light, the local authority may decide to revoke or refuse to grant, renew or transfer a licence.
<P>

<a name="90427w05.htm_para3">Following consultation by the Department in 1996 on the regulation of skin piercing, we have decided that primary legislation should be introduced, if parliamentary time allows, to give local authorities outside London powers to regulate cosmetic body piercing businesses. Those authorities are at present able to use general enforcement powers under health and safety at work legislation, should they judge that there is a risk to customers' health and safety. Also, the cosmetic body piercing businesses which are registered for ear piercing under the existing legislation will already be subject to local authority inspection.

<a name="90427w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Aircrews in the Second World War included personnel from all three Services, although the Royal Air Force were the only Service to use the classification of "lacking moral fibre". Cases where aircrew had significant psychological problems were dealt with by administrative procedures and fell into two categories; those which were seen as having medical causes, and those where the determination and reliability of the airman in the face of danger were doubted. It was the latter category that were actually classed as "lacking moral fibre".
<P>

<a name="90427w06.htm_para1">The Royal Air Force has no central record of officers/airmen classified as "lacking moral fibre" during World War II and this information could be obtained only 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1999 : Column: 103</I><P>
through a manual check of individual personnel files. Whilst it might be possible to obtain background information on officers categorised as "lacking moral fibre", airmen's personal files will have been destroyed, and only a basic Record of Service retained. It would not therefore be possible to discover any background information on the reasons behind any "lack of moral fibre" annotation recorded on an individual airman's record.
<P>

<a name="90427w06.htm_para2">Service Records are amended only on those rare occasions when there is irrefutable evidence that inaccurate information has been entered.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that standards in all public examinations are rigorously maintained. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority carries out a rolling programme of reviews to ensure that examination demand and grade standards are maintained in all major subjects. The first such review, published in 1996, confirmed that standards in A-level mathematics and chemistry remained broadly comparable between 1975 and 1995. The second review, published in March this year, confirmed that standards in A-level physics remained broadly comparable between 1976 and 1996. The A-level biology review is due to be published next year. Specific recommendations from the reviews for ensuring that standards continue to be maintained--and where necessary are strengthened--are being incorporated in the revised A-level criteria, which will underpin the new syllabuses to be introduced from September 2000.

<a name="90427w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The next stage of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will come into force on 1 October. Service providers will then have to take reasonable steps to change practices, policies or procedures which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service; provide auxiliary aids or services which would make it easier for, or enable, disabled people to use a service; and overcome physical features which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service, by providing the service by a reasonable alternative means.
<P>

<a name="90427w07.htm_para0">I have placed in the Library copies of the report on the public consultation exercise that the Government held jointly with the National Disability Council from 30 July 1998 to 13 November 1998, as well as copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment. I have also laid supporting regulations and a revised Code of Practice, which describes the current and new duties and gives examples of good practice. It also helps service providers and disabled people to understand the law. Subject to the completion of the relevant Parliamentary procedures, we aim to publish the Code, and other information about the Act, at the end of June. This represents significant progress in our programme to tackle discrimination against disabled people.
<P>

<a name="90427w07.htm_para1">The final phase of the later rights in Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act is scheduled to come into force in 2004. As a matter of good practice, service providers should be considering now what steps to take in respect of removing or altering or providing a means of avoiding physical obstacles which prevent access to their services.
<P>

<a name="90427w07.htm_para2">The duty of reasonable adjustment on trade organisations will also come into force on 1 October. They will then have to take reasonable steps to prevent any arrangements they make placing a disabled member or applicant at a substantial disadvantage compared with people who are not disabled. I have laid a separate Code of Practice for trade organisations, which takes into account the brief guidance on trade organisations currently in the Employment Code of Practice. I have also placed in the Library copies of the associated Regulatory Impact Assessment and Consultation Report. Supporting regulations are not necessary.

 In a small number of cases, it was initially difficult to set curfew ranges for premises in multiple occupation or of unusual shape or size; but the contractors have been able to meet these problems by installing additional monitoring equipment, re-calibrating curfew ranges or restricting the curfewee to certain areas of the property.

<P>
<a name="90427w09.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what decision he has made about the new national body for tourism in England.  [82544]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w09.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 On 14 December 1998 we announced in A New Cultural Framework that we would establish a new streamlined, more strategic body to support tourism in England. An Implementation Team was set up in January, supported by an Advisory Group representing the industry. We have now considered its report, which was received on 9 April and of which a copy has been placed today in the Libraries of both Houses. I am now able to announce more fully the details of the framework within which the new arrangements will operate under the leadership of a Chairman, whom I will shortly appoint.
<P>

<a name="90427w09.htm_para3">The new body will be known as the English Tourism Council (ETC). Its prime role will be to provide strategic leadership to drive delivery of the national tourism strategy. It will have a parallel function as a centre of excellence supporting the industry in five key areas: research, in particular work on emerging markets and sectors; quality, including work on the accommodation schemes and also attractions and seaside resorts; overseeing systems for data collection and analysis; championing sustainable tourism, and wider access; and spreading news of innovative ideas and examples of best practice in all these areas of work.
<P>

<a name="90427w09.htm_para4">There will be a significant switch of funding so that most is available for tourism in the regions and I want to see a new system for its distribution. This will enable a greater proportion of the strategy to be delivered at regional level and will secure enhanced benefits for tourism in the regions. The money will continue to be passed via the ETC to the Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs), except in the case of London where the Department will pass it directly to the Mayor of London, while recommending that the London Tourist Board is the most appropriate partner for delivery of the national strategy.
<P>

<a name="90427w09.htm_para5">We are currently considering applications received for the post of Chairman of the ETC, whom we will announce as soon as a decision has been made. At present the Board consists of six other members and we intend to increase that to eight. Decisions on staffing will be for the Chairman and Chief Executive, but are likely to lead to a different structure with higher skilled staff and a new mode of working. The ETC is likely to relocate within Thames Tower, Hammersmith but, in due course or if the funds allocated for its transition allow, the organisation may decide to move to new premises.
<P>

<a name="90427w09.htm_para6">Once the new Chairman and Chief Executive are in place, the ETC will be able to finalise its Strategic Action Plan and the Planning and Bidding Guidance for the Regional Tourist Boards on regional funding. We expect this to be possible by July, at which stage there will be a public launch of the new national body for tourism in England, one that has a far clearer and more focused remit than before and will be better equipped to maximise England's tourism interests. In the meantime, I am 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1999 : Column: 115</I><P>
grateful to the current Chairman, Board members and staff at ETB who continue to provide a high standard of support for this vital industry.

 When voluntary bodies and registered charities are invited to respond to a consultation document, it is not standard practice to automatically meet the postal costs incurred. However, any individual request for reimbursement would be considered on its merit. Where a voluntary organisation receives a grant from the Department towards its central administration costs, it is not unreasonable to expect postal costs in responding to consultation documents to be met from that grant.

 The Industrial Development Board (IDB) build one advance factory in 1998-99. This is a high-tech unit of 5,400 sq m and is located at Duncairn Gardens in the North Belfast Constituency. IDB built no advance factories in 1997-98, but did build one specialised call centre of 2,800 sq m on a speculative basis at Springvale Business Park in the West Belfast Constituency.
<P>

<a name="90427w10.htm_para2">Government policy is to reduce to a minimum IDB's stock of advance factories. Recent project experience has shown that IDB-led construction programmes can meet the requirements of the most demanding inward investors' timetables. Furthermore, there is an increased demand for bespoke factories. Flexibility to provide advance units will, none the less, be retained where such action is considered essential in attracting investment to particular disadvantaged areas.

 In determining the level of counsel to use either for legal proceedings or when seeking legal advice, the Treasury will consider the individual circumstances of each case.

 14.5 million ecus in payment appropriations were added to subsection B3 of the 1998 EC budget in the supplementary amending budget for 1998.

Under this framework, individuals will be able to obtain 20 per cent. discounts, rather than tax relief, on the first &#163;500 a year of eligible learning which they pay for--with 80 per cent. discounts for certain key courses, including computer literacy. Contributions paid by employers into employees' ILAs will qualify for a deduction from taxable profits and will be tax and NICs free in the hands of their employees, provided employers contribute to the ILAs of their lowest paid workers on similar terms.

 We committed &#163;3 million for the period June 1998 to March 1999 for programmes of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees affected by the conflict in Kosovo. No additional allocations were made between October 1998 and 23 March 1999. Since March 23, the Government have committed a further &#163;20 million for assistance to the Kosovo refugees.
<P>

<a name="90427w15.htm_para0">Our field offices in Tirana and Skopje are currently identifying priorities for future assistance. We are also ready to provide help for those in need within Kosovo as soon as secure access can be guaranteed.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate her Department has made of the number of refugees who <i>(a)</i> left Kosovo up to 24 March and <i>(b)</i> have left Kosovo since 24 March; and what sources it uses to make such estimates.  [81920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Our primary source for estimates of refugee numbers is the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It estimates that 69,500 refugees left Kosovo for neighbouring states as a result of internal conflict up to 24 March 1999: and that a further 530,500 have left since 24 March, as at 26 April.

<a name="90427w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Our programme in Zimbabwe includes major projects for the supply and social marketing of male and female condoms, and training health workers in treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. We are also supporting a community-based AIDS awareness programme known as "Stepping Stones". We welcome President Mugabe's recognition of the AIDS issues in his Independence Day speech, and the establishment of a National AIDS Coordinating Council. This will provide a basis for discussions of further support, consistent with our new Country Strategy Paper.

<a name="90427w15.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her Department's policy when <i>(a)</i> conducting legal proceedings and <i>(b)</i> seeking legal advice as to the circumstances in which Queen's Counsel should be instructed; and for each of the last three years (i) on how many occasions her Department instructed Queen's Counsel and (ii) what was the total cost of instructing Queen's Counsel.  [81768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90427w15.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service, the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the Serious Fraud Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Office predominantly use Junior Counsel when it is necessary to instruct counsel to provide legal advice or to conduct legal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90427w15.htm_para1">In civil cases, the two First Treasury Counsel are both Junior Counsel and they will advise and represent the Government without a Queen's Counsel in many of their important cases. In addition, the Attorney-General maintains four panels of Junior Counsel whom departments are expected to use for the majority of the government's civil litigation. The Attorney-General's, or Solicitor-General's, approval is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed to appear for any Government Department in civil litigation.
<P>

<a name="90427w15.htm_para2">A panel of Senior Treasury Counsel and the Junior Treasury Counsel, who are all Junior Counsel, exists in London to provide advice in more significant criminal case work, and to handle most serious and complex work at the Central Criminal Court. More generally, the Crown Prosecution Service maintains circuit-based lists of Junior Counsel to conduct almost all its criminal casework in the Crown Court in England and Wales. Outside London, Queen's Counsel are instructed in all contested murder cases, and occasionally in other very serious or complex casework prosecuted by the Crown.
<P>

<a name="90427w15.htm_para3">In determining the level of counsel to use, the Department will consider the individual circumstances of each case. It will take into account, inter alia, the importance and sensitivity of the case, and the complexity of the law, the weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree or experience and expertise required before deciding whether to instruct Queen's Counsel or Junior Counsel.
<P>

<a name="90427w15.htm_para4">The number of occasions on which the Department for International Development has instructed Queen's Counsel in the last three years, and the cost of doing so, cannot be given without incurring disproportionate cost.

 The World Health Organisation regulates the use of human organs for transplantation. The Department has no information on the prevalence of the practice of selling human body parts from living donors.

<a name="90427w15.htm_para5">Our Department has cancelled the debts of over 30 countries, worth over &#163;1.2 billion since 1978. In September 1997, we launched the Commonwealth Debt Initiative, announcing that we were willing to cancel the remaining aid debt due to the UK from lower income Commonwealth countries to those countries which are committed to the International Development Goals and are following sound economic policies which benefit the poor, and which promote responsive and accountable government, encourage transparency and bear down on corruption.
