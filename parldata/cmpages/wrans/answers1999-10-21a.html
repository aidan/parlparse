<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made in the development of measures to protect coral and related nurseries for fish.  [93493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UK is a founding member of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), a co-ordination mechanism aimed at promoting coral reef protection and sustainable use of coral reef resources world-wide. One of the functions of ICRI is to provide a framework for supporting the development of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN).
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para0">Since February 1997 the UK Government have funded the development of the South Asia node of the GCRMN in India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. This has already successfully established the foundations of an effective coral reef management mechanism in the region.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions visited the Maldives earlier this year and saw this programme in action. Whilst he was there, he was able to announce &#163;300,000 of additional UK funding from the Department for International Development, which will assist countries of the region further to strengthen their national coral reef information systems. It will also enable local people to be trained in a wider range of data analysis and its use in coral reef management and will provide continuing advice to the national institutions implementing the monitoring programme.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para2">In the past, the failure to undertake routine monitoring has been a significant constraint to effective protection and management of coral reefs. This UK funded programme has established a model which can be applied to other reef systems as a basis for helping poor coastal communities to optimise sustainable benefits from coral reef resources, including fisheries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the implications for sub-post offices of the industrial tribunal ruling of 27 September that sub-postmasters and mistresses are entitled to receive the national minimum wage.  [95175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 It is too early to comment on any broader implications for the sub-post office network of the Inverness Employment Tribunal's decision on the pre-hearing of the case brought by Mrs. Elizabeth Bain, the sub-postmistress at Tore, that she is entitled to be paid the national minimum wage. I understand from the Post Office that nationally there are fewer than 1,500 sub-postmasters and post-mistresses for whom the Tribunal's decision is likely to affect their remuneration arrangements with the Post Office.

 ECGD is in active discussion with representatives of the British Bankers Association on a successor to the FREF Scheme that expired on 30 September. To allow time for these discussions to be completed, and for an appropriate successor scheme to be put in place, the scheme has been rolled forward for a further two months to the end of November.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress has been made by UK offshore oil and gas producers and oil companies in dealing with the millennium bug; and what measures have been taken by his Department to ensure the security of concessionary coal supplies over this period.  [95427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I can now report the findings of the independent assessment process established by the DTI which confirms that UK oil and gas producers and oil suppliers have now attained a 100 per cent. blue status against the Action 2000 assessment criteria and are now assessed as ready to ensure that it will be business as usual and that there should be no major disruption to supplies due to the Year 2000 threat to computer systems. The DTI has been pleased to take on the role of "responsible body" reporting to the Action 2000 national infrastructure forum on the year 2000 preparations being made by the oil industry and UK's offshore oil and gas producers.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para3">The DTI has approached this task in a systematic and thorough way, making full use of the industry's own resources. It has engaged WS Atkins Consultants Ltd.--an internationally known and highly respected engineering consultancy with extensive experience within the oil and gas industry--to validate independently the process adopted and its results. The industry has fully supported this important work and provided full and frank access to all the relevant information and staff.




<P>
<P><I>21 Oct 1999 : Column: 611</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para4">The independent verification approach adopted by DTI has been agreed with Action 2000 and designed to build on the work already in hand by offshore and onshore companies to avoid duplication of effort. It has been closely supported by the relevant trade associations (UKOOA--offshore oil operators association, UKPIA--UK Petroleum Industry Association and AUKOI--Association of UK Oil Independents).
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para5">For the offshore sector, DTI arranged for companies to conduct a stringent assessment process supported by UKOOA, which involved preparation of a report on each operator's state of readiness and its independent confirmation by either a "peer group assessor" or an external consultant.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para6">To enhance further the independent element in this process, WS Atkins carried out a programme of visits to review the process adopted, the supporting data and its conclusions. The format and extent of the visit programme was determined by WS Atkins. It covered all the key elements of the offshore oil and gas industry including production and onshore terminal/pipeline facilities, and was designed to ensure they could reach a fair view on the overall status of the upstream industry.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para7">For the downstream oil sector covering the supply and distribution of refined oil products, WS Atkins were engaged to carry out a more intensive role. They prepared and issued on behalf of DTI a detailed and closely targeted questionnaire to all the main downstream players. Following a detailed analysis of the responses WS Atkins conducted a series of detailed on site follow-up visits designed to validate the questionnaire responses. Officials from DTI and other interested Government Departments also participated in some of the visits.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para8">Again, the visit programme was determined by WS Atkins and designed to ensure that they were able to form a fair view of the overall status of the downstream industry. The programme was carefully planned to cover all aspects of the industry. It looked vertically through the supply chain and covered refining, pipelines, distribution terminals, and retail outlets. It embraced all sectors of the industry from the majors, and hypermarkets through mid-size players to smaller retailers. It extended throughout the UK covering locations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para9">Throughout the process, DTI has worked closely with Action 2000, other responsible bodies and the various trade bodies to ensure nothing was overlooked and ensure that the process adopted reflected good year 2000 practice.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para10">At the National Infrastructure Forum meeting in January 1999, the industry attracted an overall "amber" assessment against the standard colour code adopted by Action 2000. I am pleased to report that WS Atkins have confirmed that the industry has since then made substantial progress both onshore and offshore, and has now attained 100 per cent. "blue" status. A copy of their summary reports have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and copies made available on the DTI internet site. WS Atkins have also confirmed that the validation process adopted by DTI provides an effective means of independently validating the industry's state of progress, 



<P>
<P><I>21 Oct 1999 : Column: 612</I><P>
both in terms of its suitability to the offshore/onshore sector, and general good practice in relation to year 2000 risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para11">In detail WS Atkins have awarded 100 per cent. "blue" status in respect of the upstream sector which covers firms engaged in the production and transport to shore of oil and gas, and related gas interconnectors. 100 per cent. "blue" status was also attained by those companies assessed in the downstream oil sector. The assessed companies are responsible for over 90 per cent. of UK oil supplies and cover the receipt, refining, distribution and retail of oil products.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para12">The DTI has agreed a follow up plan with WS Atkins, to continue to monitor progress and carry out a further independent check visits to monitor the industry's ongoing readiness throughout the millennium period.
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para13">Regarding coal, the Department is responsible for supplying concessionary fuel to some 90,000 former employees of British Coal. This accounts for 20-25 per cent. of all solid fuel for domestic use. Currently, two large coal companies are under contract to DTI for the supply and distribution of concessionary fuel (CPL Distribution Ltd. and T. H. Fergusson).
<P>

<a name="91021w01.htm_para14">The Department appointed Aon Risk Services Ltd. (risk management consultants) to assess the security of supply of concessionary fuel over the millennium period. This covered the fuel distributors as well as a number of major producers. In addition, Aon was asked to advise on the position in the wider retail market for household coal in so far that the same systems are used by the companies under contract to DTI for distributing concessionary supplies. Aon's conclusions are equally encouraging with all the main operators now assessed as achieving 100 per cent. blue rating. Aon will be involved in continued monitoring of the position.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the Government's response to consultation on proposals to reform the system of gas and electricity regulation, and on his plans to assess the regulatory, environmental and equal treatment impact of the proposed Utilities Bill as a whole.  [95429]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In October last year, the Government published a consultation paper on their proposals for reforming the system of gas and electricity regulation. After considering the responses, I have published a document which sets out the Government's proposals on the issues raised ("The Future of Gas and Electricity Regulation: The Government's Proposals for Legislation", DTI, 13 October 1999, ref. URN 99/1049). These proposals will form part of the Utilities Bill which the Government intend to introduce when parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="91021w02.htm_para0">My Department has also published draft regulatory impact, environmental and equal treatment appraisals of the provisions to be sought in the Utilities Bill, requesting comments by 15 November.
<P>

<a name="91021w02.htm_para1">Copies of the documents have been placed in the Library of the House, as has a list of the names of those who responded to the consultation document and who 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91021w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The first commencement order (S.I. 1999/2509) for the Act was made on 8 September, bringing sections 38 and 42 into force on 9 September and section 18(6) on 30 September.
<P>

<a name="91021w02.htm_para2">The second commencement order (S.I. 1999/2830) was made on 14 October. Under it, sections 2, 3, 13(1) to (3), 18(1) to (5), 19 to 23, 26 to 33, 34(4), 35, 36(1) (in part), 37, 39, 40 and 43, Schedules 2 and 6 and paragraphs 1, 2, 5 (in part), 6 and 8 of Schedule 7 will come into force on 25 October and sections 7 to 9 and Schedule 4 will come into force on 15 December.

We will be consulting on our response to the review very shortly. The Department greatly values the Public Lending Right scheme and last year found extra funding to maintain the rate per loan. We have also provided increases in funding for the next three years and are currently consulting on an increase in the rate per loan from &#163;2.07 to &#163;2.18. However, we have no plans at present to raise further the allocation to the Public Lending Right. Any bid for increased funding would need to be considered alongside the Department's other programmes.

 We will vary, or revoke, any licence which authorises the use of the LD50 test (as defined by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guideline 401) and which was issued since 5 September 1998. On this date, amendments to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 came into effect.

<a name="91021w04.htm_para18">We have accepted legal advice that Section 5(5) of the Act as amended does not allow licensing of the LD50 test for the purpose of meeting international regulatory requirements.

<a name="91021w04.htm_para19">In accord with this principle, we will also review all authorities to use the LD50 test in licences issued before September 1998.

 Under the 1999 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme agreed with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, companies supplying branded medicines to the National Health Service to a value of more than &#163;1 million per annum are required to reduce their prices by 4.5 per cent. from 1 October 1999. As an alternative to an across the board reduction, they are allowed to modulate the prices of these medicines by reductions that equate to an overall level of 4.5 per cent. Companies themselves decide on a commercial basis which medicines should be reduced in price and by how much and supply this information to the Prescription

It should be noted that companies can remodulate their prices following the initial reduction. Up to date information on the prices of medicines is maintained in the pharmaceutical trade press, copies of which are in the Library.

 The resumed extra-ordinary conference of the Parties on Biosafety Protocol will take place in Montreal on 24-28 January 2000. My Department is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and other Government Departments in assessing the options put forward by other negotiating groups in the informal consultations in Vienna. Our posts are also active in feeding in information on developments in other countries for consideration in discussion with EU partners.

<P>
<a name="91021w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Early agreement of a workable and effective Biosafety Protocol is an important objective for this Government. We welcomed the decision made by Minister Mayr to resume the extra-ordinary Conference of the parties to agree the Protocol and particularly the strong political commitment to complete the Protocol expressed by all negotiating groups at the informal consultations in September. Hard work is still needed to come to final agreement on the outstanding issues to be covered under the Protocol. We will be making every effort to promote successful completion of the negotiations.

 The spending on official publications since May 1997--which includes the costs incurred by the Department in publishing, preparation, production and purchase of copies for official use--is estimated to be &#163;1,040,000. This excludes the cost of publications produced for internal use. Where the Treasury makes use of a private sector publisher, printing and design costs are generally met by the publisher as part of their acceptance of the risk of publication.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> The Student Loans Company has informed me that at 31 August 1999 167,716 student loans accounts were in arrears. The total value of the arrears at that date was &#163;70,062,402. These figures are for the United Kingdom. These arrears arise from mortgage style loans taken out under the previous scheme. The new loan system where repayments are directly linked to a borrower's income after leaving university or college and are repaid through the Inland Revenue should result in lower levels of arrears.

Draft standards will be issued for consultation shortly. We are expecting the final standards to be published in Spring 2000.
<P>

<a name="91021w08.htm_para6">These standards will provide the base for the development of a core curriculum for adult basic skills and national tests at Levels 1 and 2.

Those discussions have not yet involved joint funding of schools, though there is joint funding through the European Peace and Reconciliation Package of teaching materials for Irish-medium primary schools.

<a name="91021w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The publication of a fundamental review of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW) was announced in the House on 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>553</i>. The Secretary of State for Health announced his intention then to establish mechanisms for regulating the personal social services workforce in England and to hand over CCETSW's functions for social services training to the new body.
<P>

<a name="91021w09.htm_para3">I have given careful thought to the best arrangements for regulating the social services workforce in Northern Ireland, consistent with the Government's plans as outlined in the Social Services White Papers for England, Scotland and Wales. I have taken into account that there are to be separate regulatory bodies for England, Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<a name="91021w09.htm_para4">I have concluded that there should be a separate body for the regulation of the social services workforce in Northern Ireland and that it should, as in England, Scotland and Wales, assume responsibility for CCETSW's training functions. However, the Northern Ireland body must have the closest possible alignment with similar machinery in the other countries of the UK, and officials will be working to ensure that effective links of this kind are put in place.
<P>

<a name="91021w09.htm_para5">We also need to have coherent overall arrangements for developing and enforcing high standards of conduct and practice, and for ensuring that workforce and training strategies are directed towards the same standards. I have, therefore, also asked officials to ensure that we bring together the work of the regulatory body and the work in Northern Ireland of any future National Training Organisation for the personal social services.
<P>

<a name="91021w09.htm_para6">Children and adults who use the social services in Northern Ireland should be able to rely on a workforce that is properly trained, appropriately qualified and effectively regulated. We will be bringing forward more detailed proposals for the new regulatory body in a social services paper to be published shortly. It is our intention to ensure that the new arrangements in Northern Ireland are available at the same time as in other parts of the United Kingdom.

Cancer services in Northern Ireland are presently being reorganised to ensure that all cancer patients are managed by specialist cancer teams. Such care is associated with a better quality of life and improved prospects of survival. All patients with prostate cancer, who require surgery will be treated by specialist teams. Current research evidence does not support population screening for prostate cancer.<P>

 The portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II can be on display in RUC stations, though the RUC have advised that there is no formal policy about displaying the portrait. The Patten Commission did not make any specific reference to this issue in its report, however, it did recommend that the police service should maintain a 'neutral working environment'. This proposal, as with all the other recommendations, is part of the current consultation process.

In addition, the Government are already committed to legislation to place the CPS Inspectorate, which is at present internal, on an independent statutory basis.

 The restructuring of the CPS into 42 areas was implemented on 1 April 1999.

 Since taking office last summer I have visited 16 CPS areas throughout England and Wales, as well as CPS Headquarters and CPS Inspectorate. The Attorney-General has visited four areas since taking up the post and has another three visits planned. I have another seven visits planned this year and by next summer I anticipate I will have visited all CPS areas. The visits have given me a valuable insight into the workings of the CPS and how the Glidewell and Narey initiatives are being taken forward.

They have had many years' experience of prosecuting in the magistrates' court and so are well equipped to meet the demands of higher court advocacy. Changes in the Access to Justice Bill allow CPS staff who are barristers to join their colleagues in the Crown Court.

 The Attorney-General's role in relation to charities is wide-ranging and of historic origins. The Attorney-General's function is to represent the Crown as <i>parens patriae</i> and so to act as protector, both of charity in general and of particular charities.
<P>

The Attorney-General is a necessary party to any litigation in which the objects of a charity need to be separately represented, for example, where the interest of the Trustees do not coincide with the objects of the charity.

 The Enforcement Concordat sets out a blueprint for fair, practical and consistent enforcement. It has been developed in consultation with all the key stakeholders in the enforcement process. The Concordat policies and procedures therefore represent a consensus about best practice in regulatory enforcement. The Concordat provides a balanced approach to enforcement based on the philosophy that enforcers should work with businesses who wish to comply while at the same time taking firm action against those who deliberately flout the law or act irresponsibly. The organisations that have adopted it have provided a clear statement to business and others being regulated about what they can expect from enforcement officers. I commend the Enforcement Concordat to all local and central government enforcement officers.

 EC proposals on the rules to be applied to food described as "genetically modified (GM) free" are expected to be published in the next month or so. Until these rules are agreed any products described in this way will continue to be regulated by the Food Safety Act 1990. This Act makes it an offence to describe, by way of labelling or advertising, a food falsely or in a way likely to mislead a purchaser as to its nature, substance or quality. In addition, the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 makes it an offence for a trader to supply food to which a false trade description has been applied or to which a trade description has been applied which is misleading to a material degree. The interpretation and enforcement of these requirements is initially a matter for local authorities, and ultimately for the courts, to decide.
