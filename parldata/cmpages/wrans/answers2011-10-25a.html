They will be able, through their local and neighbourhood plans, to identify, for special protection, green areas of particular significance to them. This local significance could be because of the green area’s beauty, historic importance, recreational value (including land used for allotments where it is not already protected by allotment legislation), tranquillity or richness of its wildlife. By designating land as local green space, local communities will be able to rule out new development other than in very special circumstances. Full public consultation on the draft framework was launched on 25 July and closed on 17 October.</p>

               <a name="11102556000083"> Research produced by the university of Derby in 2006, based on a partial survey of local authorities, reported that in the period 1996 to 2006, the number of allotment plots fell by 50,630. The report, commissioned but unpublished by the previous Government, was posted up on the DCLG website on 6 May at:</p>

               <a name="11102556000084"> Recent indications are however that the tide is turning. The number of allotment disposal cases has reduced significantly from 57 in 2005 to 15 last year. In addition, the National Society of Allotment and Leisure report that in certain areas of the country significant progress has been made in providing more land to meet demand for allotments, for instance, 52 new allotments sites have been created in the south west within the last year alone. Increasingly, councils are providing extra plots through bringing into use extra plots on existing sites, by extending existing sites or splitting plots in half as they become vacant to help meet demand. These practices are very much in keeping with the recommendations set out in the DCLG/Local Government Association guidance to local authorities in “A Place to Grow”, which can be found at:</p>

               <a name="11102556000085"> Surveys undertaken by West Kirby Transition Town in conjunction with the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners show waiting lists for allotments have grown considerably. The latest survey results published on 6 May 2011 estimated that around 87,000 people are on waiting lists for just over 152,000 statutory plots managed by principal local authorities (not including those run by parish or town councils or allotment associations). This equates to 57 people waiting for every 100 plots. In 1996 there was an average of four people waiting for every 100 plots.</p>

 On 5 October 2011, my Department outlined plans to release formerly-used land and property with enough capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015. To get development moving, we will be looking to extend the use of build now, pay later models—meaning developers do not have to find the money upfront for the land but can pay as the development gets underway, or homes are sold. This will help tackle cash flow problems which can act as a barrier to house building.</p>

 The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) is investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident on 18 July 2011 involving a tamper train on the Northampton Loop being hit by loose metal panels from containers from a freight train. The details of the incident were as described as follows:</p>
            <a name="111025w0001.htm_brev17"> 
            <a name="11102559001241"> 
            <p class="tabletext">At 17:55 hrs, the driver of a tamper travelling on the Down Northampton line, reported that his cab had been struck by an object from freight train 4L68, the 12:15 hrs container service from Birch Coppice (near Tamworth) to Felixstowe, as it passed on the adjacent line. The tamper driver had observed a metal panel flapping from the side of the approaching container train. He released the safety device in his cab as he moved to protect himself and the tamper came to a stand. The side window of the cab had been smashed but he escaped injury. He then called the signaller to request that all trains be stopped on the adjacent line. When he re-continued his journey, the tamper driver reported finding another similar panel beside the track closer to Rugby.</p>
            <a name="111025w0001.htm_brev18"> 
            <a name="11102559001242"> 
            <p class="tabletext">The two metal panels were later recovered from the trackside and were found to be from two containers that were on 4L68. The containers were fitted with power generation equipment. The panels, approximately 2.5m high x 1m wide, had been screwed to the container sides; each had covered a louvred-aperture. The RAIB has examined the containers and found evidence of loose and missing screws on other panels that had been fitted.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_384"> 
               <a name="111025w0001.htm_para65"> 
               <a name="11102559000172"> The RAIB has examined the panels that became detached and the containers to which they were originally attached. Through interviews, industry records, CCTV images and analysis the RAIB has determined the sequence of events leading up to the incident. It has identified that the panels became detached due to failure of their fastening arrangements to the container.</p>
            <p>

               <a name="11102559000173"> The RAIB has identified the controls that are in place to manage and approve design and modifications to freight containers. The RAIB is currently considering their effectiveness and the industry's compliance with them. Similarly, it is investigating the railway specific arrangements that are in place to prevent unsafe containers entering railway service.</p>

 The Department's proposals for lane rental initially would involve a very small number of "pioneer" schemes that are carefully targeted, with charges only being applied on the busiest streets at the busiest times. These would be used to gather evidence. This targeting maximises the opportunity for utility companies to reduce or avoid their exposure to charges by working in less disruptive ways. In addition, approval for a scheme would only be granted by the Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening), where any costs were justified by the benefits from reduced traffic congestion. The impacts of any “pioneer” schemes, including any effects on utility bills, will be carefully considered before decisions are taken on whether lane rental could usefully play a wider role.</p>

Consolidating the Home Office estate will move staff into fewer buildings, releasing savings of over £12 million per annum. The detention estate changes support the UK Border Agency's strategic objectives of securing the border and controlling migration and also help meet the coalition agreement to end the detention of children. Providing details of all building and maintenance works costing less than £250,000 would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

 Each Immigration removal centre has a comprehensive self harm reduction strategy in place to support detainees who are deemed to be at risk of suicide or self-harm.

A specific care map tailored to the issues faced by the individual is produced to ensure provision of multi-disciplinary support, including input from both health care professionals and staff at the centre. The ACDT document is reviewed at regular intervals to ensure the correct support is provided while the individual is thought to be at risk.</p>

 The independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements was published by way of a written ministerial statement on 18 October 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 62-63WS. Given the thoroughness of the report, it is right that the Government consider the findings very carefully before announcing to Parliament what action we intend to take. An announcement will be made in due course.</p>

1. Data from Q1 2010 onwards are provisional.
2. All people held are detained in the United Kingdom solely under Immigration Act powers and exclude those in police cells, Prison Service establishments, short-term holding rooms at ports and airports (for less than 24 hours), and those recorded as detained as detained under both criminal and immigration powers and their dependants. Figures include dependants.
3. Relates to most recent period of sole detention. The period of detention starts when a person first enters the UK Border Agency estate. If the person is then moved from a removal centre to a police cell or Prison Service establishment, this period of stay will be included if the detention is solely under Immigration Act powers.

 The Independent Family Returns Panel is a key part of the fresh approach to managing family returns which the Government have put in place to end the detention of children for immigration purposes. Members of the Panel were appointed on an interim basis in March 2011 and a recruitment round is now under way to appoint permanent members through fair and open competition. The posts were advertised on 30 June. Interviews of the shortlisted candidates began on 19 September and are due to conclude on 10 November. We aim to announce the membership of the new Panel as soon as possible after that.</p>

We understand that as many as 20,000 people have been displaced by recent fighting, many without access to basic needs such as food, clean water and medicine. I have agreed that funding through the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and a humanitarian non-governmental organisation already working in the area may be used to assist displaced people in Kachin State.</p>

 Girls and women are at the heart of the coalition Government's development agenda.

The recruitment and retention of female teachers is particularly an issue in rural areas.

 The UK plans for dealing with the negative effects on developing countries of the importation or dumping of electronic waste, is to deal with the problem at the source and to prevent the exportation of hazardous e-waste from the UK so that it does not reach developing countries. Working electrical equipment can be exported for use overseas. However, under the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive, it is always illegal to export hazardous e-waste from the UK for disposal to developing countries. The UK has a national intelligence team and a national environmental crime team. As part of their remit, these teams are tasked with preventing the illegal export of e-waste. They use an intelligence-led approach to target the most prolific, serious and organised illegal waste exporters. This has led to a 98% success rate of finding electrical waste when stopping targeted shipping containers.</p>

 Camelids in Great Britain are considered to be incidental, spillover hosts of bovine tuberculosis, generally acting as sentinels of the infection in the local badger populations and cattle herds. Our preliminary veterinary risk assessment indicates that they pose a risk of spreading bovine tuberculosis infection mainly to other camelids, for example through mating, movements, purchases and shows. The risk that camelids represent to other species is considered to be low, compared to that posed by transmission from cattle and from badgers.</p>

 The Government do not collect these statistics. The matter is primarily one for Digital UK, the independent not-for-profit company leading the implementation of switchover. Digital UK's Tracker survey to September 2011 indicates 93% of UK households are now watching a digital TV service on their main television set. In the London TV region, the figure is 89%. Digital UK does not hold the information requested on the number of businesses prepared for digital switchover, but evidence to date suggests they are usually well prepared. Digital UK provides digital TV switchover information to chambers of commerce and other business organisations as part of its information campaign.</p>

The Secretary of State for Education, the right hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), has powers to intervene if a local authority is failing to meet its statutory duties.

               <b>Mr Robathan:</b>
 Some employees have to change jobs for legal reasons, for example to meet a Disability Discrimination Act requirement, or to meet urgent departmental needs. The new job may be outside of reasonable daily travel of the civil servant's home or involve additional travel costs. Where this is the case, the Department may decide to assist with those relocation costs, either with a move of home at public expense, or more often, limited help with the extra travel costs in the initial period. As part of a reorganisation or restructure within a business area it may also be necessary to relocate work and the posts associated with that work. This may mean an employee is moved into a specific job, or a group of staff may be moved with their jobs to another location. Additionally many employees change posts but do not attract any relocation allowances.</p>

 Our planning assumption is that the Department will rely on the NHS Commissioning Board for senior clinical advice and leadership of the kind currently provided by those fulfilling the role of national clinical director, except where there is potential for conflicts of interest to arise when wider consultation might be necessary. No decisions have yet been taken about whether roles and titles will change under new arrangements. Those will be decisions for the NHS Commissioning Board.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) does not hold data relating to costs and only holds obesity data for in-patient care in hospitals. Obesity-related care in a primary care setting is not included in these figures.
2. A count of finished consultant episodes is not the same as the number of patients; a person may have more than one episode of care in a given period.
3. Activity includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.
4. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.
5. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis: the number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03), primary and secondary diagnosis fields in an HES record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code used to identify obesity is E66.
6. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

 The closure of COI is part of a package of measures to reform the organisation of Government communications in order to further improve its effectiveness and efficiency. The reforms are designed to increase cross-Government collective responsibility for government communications, thereby avoiding any possible departmental bias. A Communications Delivery Board has been established, which will oversee an annual planning cycle covering all planned direct communications, enabling identification and elimination of wasteful spend.</p>

 The Political and Constitutional Reform (PCR) Committee is scrutinising draft Government legislation which would extend the timetable for UK parliamentary elections from 17 to 25 working days. In the context of this proposal, I wrote to the Committee suggesting that it would be helpful to welcome views as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process on whether the existing deadline for postal vote applications (which is currently 11 days before polling day) should be moved further in advance of the date of the poll. The Government will consider any recommendations made by the PCR Committee carefully, although we would be reluctant to erode the flexibility for electors which the current deadline offers.</p>

 Information on the highest qualification held on entry to higher education is shown in the table, for young (aged under 21 on entry) English-domiciled undergraduate entrants to UK higher education institutions, in the academic years 2007/08 to 2009/10. However, these qualifications may not necessarily be the ones on which successful admission to the institution was based; a student whose highest qualification on entry is not vocational may additionally hold a vocational qualification at a lower level, and vice versa. Information for the 2010/11 academic year will become available from January 2012.</p>

 There is no single recommended multiplier factor used by the Department. This is because in analysing the impact of an intervention on the number of supply chain jobs created or safeguarded, proper account needs to be taken of deadweight, displacement, substitution and leakage effects in accordance with UK Government appraisal guidance “The Green Book”. The multiplier factor used will also reflect the sectoral and geographical scope of the intervention and whether we are considering the short or long-term effects of Government action.</p>
