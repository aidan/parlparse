 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> The information requested on Wales is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales.
<P>

<a name="00125w01.html_para0">The table shows the notional average Council Tax per dwelling for each of the major precepting authorities in England. The more common measure for comparison is the Band D Council Tax from which all bills are derived and on the basis of which all taxpayers in the same band within an authority pay the same amount. This is also given. It has a closer relation to how Council Tax bills are derived and hence what taxpayers will be paying.

 It is the role of the Government office for the North West to promote environment issues in the Merseyside region. The Government office are currently actively working with others to raise awareness in the North West about biodiversity issues. The Government office is a member of the North West Biodiversity Forum whose aims are to support, encourage and positively influence the conservation of biological diversity in the North West. Other members of the Forum include Lancashire County Council, the Environment Agency, English Nature, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Joint Countryside Advisory Service, County Wildlife Trusts and North West Water.
<P>

<a name="00125w02.html_para0">The Government office is currently promoting the production of a biodiversity booklet via the Forum to raise awareness among decision makers about biodiversity in the region to highlight, particularly, those species and habitats deemed to be under threat from development.
<P>

<a name="00125w02.html_para1">It is not a policy of the Government to carry out research into public awareness of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 anywhere in the United Kingdom, although they aim to make as much information available as possible through the Department's website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Data are not collected in the form requested. However, it is known that early Boeing 747s, of which about 550 were constructed up until 1981, used depleted uranium counterbalance weights in their control surfaces.
<P>

<a name="00125w02.html_para2">A risk to health could arise only in the unlikely event that a crash, followed by a sufficiently severe and long lasting fire, were to cause aerosolisation and dispersal of the material. It has been established from the condition of the recovered counterweights and the evidence of fire damage following the recent Korean B747 aircraft crash that there has been no airborne dispersal of uranium from the crash site. Sixteen of the 20 counterweights used in the aircraft have so far been recovered.

 The scope of the Advanced Informed Agreement (AIA) procedure within the Biosafety Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity is one of the issues currently under negotiation in Montreal. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the proportion of living modified organisms (LMOs) that will come within its scope. The position of the United Kingdom and its European Union partners is that an effective and workable AIA procedure is necessary for the Protocol to contribute to biosafety, and that LMOs for food, feed or processing (commodities) should be included within the scope of the Protocol. At the negotiations, informal contact groups have been set up to look specifically at issues of transboundary movements of commodity LMOs and the scope of the Protocol.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Our largest public consultation exercise on policy matters in the last five years was that conducted to inform the strategic defence review which was launched on 28 May 1997. The then Secretary of State invited everyone who wished to contribute to the review to put forward their ideas and over 570 submissions were received. Each submission was analysed to record the subjects of concern, and circulated to the appropriate Working Groups for consideration. 486 authors consented to having their submissions made public. These were placed in the Libraries of the House and provided on microfiche to 12 public libraries across the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I have today announced a package of extra measures for 2000-01 and 2001-02 to widen access to higher education and tackle student hardship in England and Wales. The full year cost of the package has been estimated at &#163;68 million. This honours the commitment I gave to Parliament on 13 July 1998 to monitor the new student support arrangements introduced after the Dearing Report. It also builds on the findings of the Review of Access Funds and Hardship Loans carried out last autumn.
<P>

<a name="00125w03.html_para3">The system of student support is working well: full-time entrants to higher education have increased by nearly 5,000 this year and more money is now going into universities and colleges. The system is fair and equitable to students, families, and the taxpayer. But our Review highlighted the specific financial concerns of older students, notably the costs of child care, especially for lone parents, school meals, and travel. The Review also found that mature students, in particular, need guarantees of financial support if they are to undertake and complete courses of higher education. These new measures target extra help at full-time mature students, disadvantaged young people and parents on low incomes with children in higher education.
<P>

<a name="00125w03.html_para4">In 2000-01, &#163;17 million will be set aside for non-repayable Access Funds Bursaries for mature students of up to &#163;1,000 per student, according to need, available at the start of the academic year. Further support, depending on circumstances, will also be available from a Hardship Fund of &#163;57 million, for students who run into financial difficulties during the course. Hardship Loans will remain available to mature students but they will no longer have to take out a Hardship Loan before receiving support from the Hardship Fund. We will additionally provide an 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2000 : Column: 152W</I><P>
income-assessed grant to meet the cost of school meals for students with dependant children aged 4 to 16. We have also decided to ease substantially the income assessment for mature students who will now be able to have &#163;7,500 of their income disregarded without losing entitlement to student support, instead of a minimum of &#163;820.
<P>

<a name="00125w03.html_para5">In 2001-02, three further measures will be introduced to widen access and tackle hardship. We will raise the parental contribution threshold from &#163;17,370 (at 1999-2000 rates) to &#163;20,000, which will mean around 50,000 more families on modest incomes will no longer have to contribute towards their children's higher education. I shall also review the other contribution thresholds. Up to &#163;10 million will be available for non- repayable Bursaries through Access Funds of up to &#163;1,000 for young students from disadvantaged backgrounds, building on schemes already developing at a number of universities. Both these measures will help students from families on low incomes with no history of entry to higher education. We will provide further help for mature students by introducing a means-tested child care grant, based on the actual costs of child care of up to &#163;100 a week per child, for those with dependant children, which will be fully disregarded by the Department of Social Security for benefits purposes.
<P>

<a name="00125w03.html_para6">Where necessary, we will make amendments to the Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999 and the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1999 to give effect to these changes for 2000-01. Amendments to Regulations to give effect to the changes for 2001-02 will also be made in due course. Changes to the guidance on the use of the Access and Hardship Funds will be given to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, and individual Higher Education Institutions, shortly.

As a matter of public record, Peter Downes declared at the time of his application that he had undertaken significant political activity in the last five years as a member of the Liberal Democrats and an elected member of Huntingdonshire District Council. No other adjudicator at present in post declared an engagement in significant political activities during the previous five years.

When the data for 1998-99 are available my officials will consider the need for further action to help LEAs improve their performance in this area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w04.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 In June last year, my Department and the Department of Health jointly consulted on draft guidance on the education of children looked after by local authorities. Some 205 consultees replied by the mid-October deadline, and officials have since discussed some of the key issues arising from the consultation with partners in local government and the voluntary sector. Officials are now revising the guidance, and I expect the final guidance to issue before the end of March.

<a name="00125w04.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> My officials, and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, are currently working with the Department for International Development to develop a guidance document for schools on the opportunities and benefits of bringing a global perspective into different subjects and the wider life of school. This will draw attention to the many opportunities that the revised National Curriculum offers for raising children's awareness of a range of issues including ethical trading. It will also let teachers know where they can find advice, support and high quality resources which will support teaching and learning about these issues.
<P>

<a name="00125w04.html_para5">The programmes of study for Geography and Citizenship in the National Curriculum provide ample opportunities for pupils to learn about ethical trading since they include specific provision for teaching about the world as a global community, global interdependence and sustainable development. The emphasis is on explanatory discussion of contemporary issues and ethical trading would fall into that category.

 The School Travel Advisory Group (STAG), which presented its report to Ministers on 13 January, has made a number of recommendations in relation to school travel. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library. In particular, STAG has commissioned research into best practice on increasing bus use for journeys to school, to report in June 2000.

 Schools will have their own health policies reflecting the needs of their pupils. Clearly where pupils suffer from particular conditions schools should include these in their policy where it is appropriate, taking advice from the local medical service and specialist organisations as necessary.

<a name="00125w05.html_para0">We have made available to schools advice and information on sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia via the Government's Wired for Health website which has links to the Sickle Cell Society and UK Thalassaemia Society.

 We have no plans to compel teachers to apply for the threshold--teachers will be able to choose to apply on a voluntary basis. We said in the Technical Consultation Document on teachers' pay reform that no serving teacher would lose out on existing salary entitlements as a result of our proposals. We have proposed to the School Teachers' Review Body that teachers who are successful at the threshold should receive a salary increase of up to &#163;2,000.

 Better employment services for people with disabilities are an important element of our commitment to comprehensive civil rights and an intrinsic part of our Welfare to Work policy. That is why we have devoted an additional &#163;30 million for the Employment Service's specialist disability programmes over the three years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02, with more resources for Access to Work, Supported Employment and the Job Introduction Scheme. Significant improvements to services to support disabled people have been a feature of all New Deals. Through New Deal for Disabled People we are testing new ways of helping people on incapacity benefits to return to work. We are considering how the main lessons from the pilots should be built into the next stage of this New Deal. We hope to make an announcement in the near future.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> In my reply to the hon. Member of 12 January 2000, <i>Official Report, </i>column 183W, I mentioned the major global evaluation study commissioned by DFID of British bilateral and joint-funded project support for environmental improvement and protection, and made specific reference to projects in Kenya and Tanzania.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2000 : Column: 162W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00125w06.html_para0">The study also assessed DFID-funded projects for environmental protection and management in India, China and Brazil, including their impact on local people. The study reviewed 19 projects in India and found that all except two will have positive environmental impacts. Social impact has been varied. While many achieved environmental improvements benefiting local people, negative social impacts associated with resettlement and environmental health were noted in two projects.
<P>

<a name="00125w06.html_para1">In China, 16 projects were reviewed. It has been difficult to address social issues and identify social impacts in these projects given the reluctance of the Chinese authorities to support inputs which could be confused with political interference. Local people have benefited from the environmental improvements achieved by several of the projects but involuntary resettlement posed 'a potentially serious problem' in at least one project.
<P>

<a name="00125w06.html_para2">In Brazil, the key focus has been on environmental protection in Amazonia. All projects reviewed were found to have been at least moderately effective, with objectives complete or largely achieved in three projects out of the sample of six. Three of the projects were environmental research projects and two aimed to strengthen scientific capacity. As a result, immediate social impacts, positive or negative, were limited.

 At a national level, as well as working closely with those with an interest in farm diversification, in particular, MAFF and the Countryside Agency, Tomorrow's Tourism highlights the need to maintain the economic viability of rural businesses through diversification such as farm tourism. Regional Tourist Boards, funded in part by the English Tourism Council (ETC), have primary responsibility for encouraging farm tourism by giving advice, support and guidance to new and existing tourism businesses, as well as those wishing to enter the sector. The Department's officials working in the Government Offices for the Regions also provide advice and support where appropriate. The ETC is currently considering a number of bids for funding from Regional Tourist Boards, including proposals to promote farm tourism more effectively. We will ensure this work is closely co-ordinated with the existing new proposals for farm diversification announced by right hon.

Moreover, in 1998-99, the latest available figures suggest that English local authorities spend some &#163;75 million and Welsh local authorities nearly &#163;5 million on tourism promotion, while Scottish local authorities provided &#163;7.4 million in grants to area tourist boards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to change Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit review procedures; and if he will make a statement.  [107149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w07.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 From April 2001, we propose to modernise the review procedures in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit by bringing them into line with the arrangements for decision-making and appeals in child support and Social Security introduced under the Social Security Act 1998. Those arrangements have now been successfully implemented in other Social Security benefits. The Appeals Service has made--and is continuing to make--improvements to the level of service provided to appellants. We are proposing to extend that service to people who wish to appeal against local authority decisions on their Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit claims.
<P>

<a name="00125w07.html_para1">The changes will mean that, as now, people will be able to ask their local authority to look again at any disputed decision, but if the differences cannot be resolved they will have a right of appeal to a tribunal administered by the Appeals Service. People claiming Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit will also be expected to provide prompt evidence and information in support of their claims, in the same way as for other Social Security benefits.

 Prospective pensioners are invited to claim Retirement Pension four months prior to attaining minimum State pension age. This period allows time for the customer to make a claim and the Benefit's Agency to obtain the information needed to put the correct Retirement Pension entitlement into payment.
<P>

<a name="00125w07.html_para3">There are times, particularly at the beginning of a new tax year, when the contribution information needed to confirm Retirement Pension entitlement is not available. In this circumstance, the Benefit Agency makes an award based on the contribution information available and makes arrangements for payments to be made at an interim rate until a full assessment can be made. When the contribution information is available a revised award is made. The customer will receive revised notification of their entitlement and payment of any arrears due.
<P>

<a name="00125w07.html_para4">The Benefits Agency aims to clear 95 per cent. of Retirement Pension claims in 60 days. This is measured from the date of receipt of a claim form to the date an award is recorded on the Pensions Strategy Computer System.

 The matters covered by the Care Standards Bill (Lords) have been subject to extensive consultation over a long period. Many of the measures were set out in the White Paper "Modernising Social Services" (Cm 4169--copies of which are available in the Library), which followed various consultation exercises. The matters relating to private and voluntary healthcare were subject to consultation following the publication of "Regulating Private and Voluntary Healthcare: A Consultation Document", copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00125w08.html_para4">Since the Bill's publication, I and my Ministerial colleagues, and officials in the Department have held a number of discussions about the provisions of the Bill with representatives of provider interests, service user groups and professional interests. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has held no consultations specific to the Care Standards Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> Health authorities have wide discretion over the terms and conditions they apply in the use by recipient voluntary organisations of Section 64 grants. This is appropriate given the wide variety of circumstances that may arise. In all their financial transactions, health authorities are required to exercise the standards of financial management and control specified in their standing orders and standing financial instructions--which follow the normal conventions for public bodies--and are audited on their performance. Making a specific requirement to be notified of changes in the objects of the organisation would not necessarily provide an additional safeguard, since changes may not necessarily have any bearing on the purpose for which the grant was made.

<a name="00125w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to regulate the independent foster care home sector in respect of <i>(a)</i> quality of care provided and <i>(b)</i> charges to local authorities;  [105911]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions he has had with the independent foster care home sector with regard to quality of care and cost to local authorities;  [105912]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the levels of charges made for the provision of foster care by <i>(a)</i> the independent foster care home sector and <i>(b)</i> local authorities; and if he will make a statement.  [105910]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We announced in the White Paper "Modernising Social Services" that independent fostering agencies will, in future, be regulated. The intention is that they will have to register with and be inspected by the new National Care Standards Commission. The changes are being introduced in the Care Standards Bill. As an interim measure, we are planning to introduce a voluntary accreditation scheme for independent fostering agencies.
<P>

<a name="00125w09.html_para0">If a local authority decides to place a child with a foster carer operating in the independent sector, it is a matter for that authority to satisfy itself that they are getting quality and value for money from the agency. This requirement is set out at Standard 24 of the recently launched National Standards for Foster Care, which seeks to underpin the provision of high quality foster care for children and young people throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00125w09.html_para1">We are aware that local authorities tend to pay considerably higher weekly rates for foster care when that care is through independent foster agencies, rather than directly through local authority foster carers. At least to some extent, this results from the extra functions provided by agencies and the particular needs of the individual children. We have no control over the rates paid by local authorities to independent fostering agencies or to their own carers. This is, however, an issue that we are looking at in the context of the Quality Protects programme, and in particular in relation to our plans to improve the number and quality of placement options for looked after children.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00125w09.html_para2">We are unable to provide a breakdown between local authority and independent sector foster care charges, as such figures are not collected centrally. We do, however, have information on the overall amount spent on local authority foster placements and for 1997-98 (the latest year we have available) the gross expenditure figure for England was &#163;339 million. &#163;15 million was also spent on children in other community placements.
<P>

<a name="00125w09.html_para3">There is also a Social Services Performance Indicator that showed the reported unit cost of foster care (gross weekly expenditure per child looked after in foster care) as &#163;199 for 1998-99 and &#163;211 for 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="00125w09.html_para4">Officials in the Department have had some discussion with representatives of the independent foster care sector about ensuring good quality standards, and these will be continued in the context of the voluntary accreditation scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 came into force on 5 April 1999. In the initial three months no payments were made to trusts. In the second quarter &#163;2,671,409 was collected and paid to National Health Service trusts in England, Scotland and Wales. In the third quarter this figure rose to &#163;13,823,013, making the total paid to NHS trusts by the end of December 1999 &#163;16,494,422.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w10.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Transport Bill makes provision for the establishment of the Strategic Rail Authority. In Scotland it will administer all passenger rail franchises including the making of franchise payments to the relevant train operating companies. The Authority will also receive directions and guidance for Scottish passenger rail services from the Scottish Ministers together with financial provision from the Scottish Consolidated Fund to help meet the costs of these services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government are committed to tackling low pay through the national minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission found, in their First Report, that low pay occurs throughout the country and there is often much variation within different parts of the country as there is between one part of the country and another. Latest figures indicate that some 40,000 low paid workers in Scotland had already benefited from the introduction of the national minimum wage at the time of implementation (March-May 1999). The second report of the Low Pay Commission will be published soon, and we expect this to give more detail about low pay by region.

Substantial investment in new digital technology will allow a more responsive service to be provided from fewer centres.

In addition, the Joint Ministerial Committee on Poverty met last month and will ensure that the UK Government and the devolved administrations work effectively in partnership to alleviate poverty.

Before consideration can be given to closure, at least one survey of court users is carried out. Proposals for closure are always subject to public consultation, authorised by the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor has authorised public consultation on closure proposals for the following courts: Aberdare, Caerphilly, Chepstow, Gravesend, Lichfield, Monmouth and Workington; and has approved closure of Grays Thurrock and Great Yarmouth to take effect from 31 January 2000.

For the purpose of this exercise the forecast assumes that the OTMS will continue in its current form until at least the end of 2002-03, and that the contracted companies will obtain the necessary consents and commence incineration in line with their autumn 1999 programmes. The forecast will be updated in January/February 2000 to reflect the latest position. <P>

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2000]:</i> The EU Slaughter Premiums for adult cattle and calves are paid in partial compensation for the cuts in support prices which will be made on 1 July in each of the years 2000 to 2002. Those price cuts will affect the price of most animals sold on the EU market, including cull animals. While the price paid for animals slaughtered under the Over Thirty Months Scheme in the UK is set by Commission Regulation rather than by market forces, the Agriculture Council decided not to exclude such animals from Slaughter Premium, because to do so would be to discriminate against UK producers.

 The European Community legislation which is relevant to this issue is that governing the farm-based arable and livestock aid schemes introduced as part of the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Under the rules of Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS), farmers in the United Kingdom are allowed to use the full field areas which are shown on Ordnance Survey maps as the basis of their claims, provided that their fields are fully utilised. If this condition is not fulfilled, then only that part of the total area which is actually cropped can be claimed. The use of total field areas is of considerable benefit to our farmers but it can only be justified if the extent of uncropped areas around field margins, including the area occupied by any hedges which may be present, is kept within reasonable limits. AAPS applicants have recently been notified about new guidance from the European Commission about the maximum width of field margins that is consistent with the use of full Ordnance Survey areas in aid applications. They have also been urged to seek advice about minimising the environmental impact of any action they may need to take in order to comply with the new guidance.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what weighting was given to the journey time of livestock in recent award of contracts to abattoirs by the Intervention Board under the over 30 month scheme.  [102359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w12.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Intervention Board, which is responsible for the administration of the over thirty month scheme (OTMS), attaches considerable importance to ensuring that sufficient slaughtering capacity is available in the right areas to minimise the travelling time for animals entering the scheme, consistent with the need to protect the public purse and ensure a good quality service. Tenders were grouped and evaluated by region to ensure that all areas received a reasonable level of service. East Anglia and South East England were grouped as a single region in view of the relatively small number of cattle coming forward from these areas for slaughter. As a result of the changes being introduced following the tender, some journey times will, inevitably, increase, but in no case will journey times exceed those laid down in animal welfare guidelines. Some journey times will decrease. Farmers will continue to be able to access the scheme through the network of 170 markets registered to collect OTMS cattle.

<P>
<a name="00125w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Tenders were considered on a regional basis to ensure that sufficient capacity was contracted for the number of animals coming forward for slaughter in the region. Within this regional approach, under which East Anglia and South East England were grouped as a single region, the ranking (highest to lowest) of the criteria for evaluating bids received for OTMS slaughter services were: quality of service, price, ability to offer a dedicated service, ease of supervision and throughput (equal ranking), location.

2. In 1998 fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions. It appears that this change may have led to the recording of additional labour who were not previously included in the returns. The change in questions has also led to a redistribution of labour between the various categories, most notably for salaried managers. Caution is therefore advised when comparing the 1998 and 1999 results with previous years. <P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of recent reports that sesame seed and oil in foods intended for young children can produce serious anaphylactic attacks; and what discussions his Department has had with Nestle on the matter.  [103363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 It has been known for some time that sesame seeds can produce potentially severe reactions in individuals who have a pre-existing sesame allergy. Sesame oil could in theory also produce reactions depending on how much of the allergenic sesame protein is present.
<P>

<a name="00125w13.html_para0">It would seem sensible to advise that certain infants should avoid sesame seeds and food containing sesame, in case the consumption of sesame increases the risk of the infant developing sesame allergy. This advice is by analogy with the Committee on Toxicity's (COT) advice on peanuts. In its report on Peanut Allergy, the COT advised that during weaning, and until at least three years of age, the diets of infants with a parent or sibling with atopic disease (i.e. liable to develop allergic conditions) should not include peanuts and foods containing peanuts. This is because these foods may increase the risk of sensitisation and should be avoided. Further expert advice is being sought on this and the situation will be kept under review in the light of developing knowledge.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w13.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In 1997 the European Commission initiated legal proceedings against the United Kingdom for the under-implementation of the veterinary supervision requirements of EU meat hygiene legislation. Since then the Government have made a number of representations to the Commission about the level of veterinary supervision in licensed premises (abattoirs, cutting plants and cold stores) in Great Britain producing or handling fresh (red) meat. The Government have accepted the need to bring the UK's veterinary supervision levels into line with the EU requirements in as short a time as possible, but pointed to the shortage of veterinarians willing to undertake meat hygiene work in the UK as a key obstacle to immediate compliance. The Government therefore set out a plan for achieving full and complete compliance by stages, over a number of years, as additional veterinary resource became available to the Meat Hygiene Service.
<P>

<a name="00125w13.html_para7">The Commission has noted the UK's programme and has made clear that it expects all the relevant controls and supervisory measures to be in place in the UK, in accordance with EU legislation, by the middle of 2001.

<a name="00125w13.html_para8">Separately, the Government also sought the European Commission's views earlier this year on the level and frequency of veterinary supervision required by the Fresh Meat Directive (64/433/EEC, as amended) for those low throughput (permanently derogated) slaughterhouses and cutting plants approved under Article 4 of the Directive. In summary, the Commission's advice was that the official veterinarian must carry out ante mortem inspections in red meat slaughterhouses, although post mortem inspections may be performed by either the official veterinarian or by an auxiliary. In addition, the hygiene rules must be monitored in all low throughput premises by either an official veterinarian or an auxiliary acting under his/her responsibility. Copies of the Commission's advice were placed in the Library of the House on 13 October 1999.

<P>
<a name="00125w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> The English common law recognises a public right of fishing in territorial tidal waters. However, that common law right can have been abrogated or limited (including in relation to the methods by which it may be exercised) in a number of ways in the past, including by domestic or European legislation, by private Act of Parliament, by Charter or by ancient usage.
<P>

<a name="00125w13.html_para10">As far as is known, there is no exhaustive list of instances where the common law right has been abrogated or limited in the ways described. Therefore, only the courts are in a position to be able to rule on whether the fishery referred to by my hon.

<P>

<a name="00125w13.html_para11">However, the private rights, if any, in this fishery have been limited by various elements of EC legislation, including restrictions on minimum landing size and mesh size as well as by the establishment of the bass nursery area at the Isle of Grain Power Station Outfall.

We do, however, work closely with other interested organisations, including the Meat and Livestock Commission, to try and open up new markets for United Kingdom cattle semen and to promote exports via trade fairs and other events both here and abroad.

<P>
<a name="00125w14.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The last year that the UK participated in the EU surplus food scheme was 1998 when the sum made available to the UK for the distribution of surplus beef was &#163;20.3 million. No separate Departmental budget allocation was made for advertising the scheme; expenditure for advertising the scheme was made available from overall Intervention Board funds. The funds allocated to the UK by the EU for the surplus food scheme were fully utilised.

 EU/ACP trade talks are due to conclude next month. They are expected to roll forward the Sugar Protocol for a further eight years, and to provide for its review by 2008. In any review a major UK policy consideration will be the need for an equitable outcome for the cane refining sector to maintain its competitive position relative to the beet sugar sector.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> Rules on labelling of food products are harmonised at EU level.

We are funding consumer research into these questions. We shall be holding open meetings and inviting consumers to write or e-mail us with their views.

 Under previous launch aid contracts between the Government and Rolls-Royce plc, that company is entitled to a reduction in the amount of levy which it pays in respect of engines which are derivatives of engines which have previously benefited from launch aid, in recognition of the extra investment which the company has made in producing those derivatives. Agreement has recently been reached between my Department and Rolls-Royce plc on the revised rates of levy which are payable on certain derivatives of the RB211-524, V2500, Spey, Tay and Industrial RB211 engines. My Department will be seeking a Spring Supplementary Estimate in due course which will include provision for the repayment to Rolls-Royce plc of certain of the amounts which have been overpaid by that company in respect of these derivative engines.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> We are not convinced that the mandatory exception for certain temporary copies as proposed in Article 5.1 of the draft Directive is the right approach, and we feel that the European Parliament's proposal to limit this exception to cases where use of protected material has been authorised by right owners would achieve a fairer balance between the different interests involved. We do not consider that this amendment would prevent or inhibit caching or other acts by intermediaries, which would clearly be inappropriate. However, the Commission and several other Member States are opposed to the European Parliament amendment, and its seems unlikely that it will receive sufficient support to be adopted. We have therefore encouraged dialogue between intermediaries and right owners, who are concerned that Article 5.1 will impair their ability to control illegal uses of their material, in order to establish whether other approaches can be found which are mutually acceptable.

We have also had numerous other meetings with a wide range of interested parties on various aspects of the Directive. We will, of course, continue with these consultation processes until negotiations on the Directive are completed.

Certain endangered animals imported for the pet trade are also protected under European Wildlife Regulations, which implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department with respect to the draft of the Data Protection (Crown Appointments) Order 1999, for what reasons it is proposed to make personal data about the Provost of Eton, the Poet Laureate and the Astronomer Royal subject to an exemption.  [106060]<P>

<a name="00125w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Order exempts from the subject information provisions personal data processed for the purposes of assessing any person's suitability for certain offices. Like the other positions cited in the draft Order, these are Crown appointments. They typically involve communications between the Sovereign and the Prime Minister and involve information and judgments on individuals, often provided in confidence by third parties.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department with respect to the draft of the Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 1999, for what reasons each exemption is necessary; if he will provide examples illustrating the distinction between public interest and substantial public interest wherever the latter term is used in the Order; what discussions he had on paragraph 5 of the Order with those authorities responsible for advising the Government on matters relating to genetics; and if he has notified the European Commission of the effect of the Order.  [106058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Each provision in the Schedule to the draft order is necessary to permit the processing of sensitive personal data in connection with the purpose or function referred to in the paragraph. Without such an order the first data protection principle in Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 would prohibit the processing. As required by article 8.4 of the European Commission Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), the processing may be carried out only if it is in the substantial public interest. There is no express reference to the substantial public interest in paragraphs in the Schedule to the draft order where the categories of processing described are considered always to be in the substantial public interest. Where there is such a reference, this is required to meet the requirements of article 8.4, as the general category of processing described may otherwise include some processing which may not be in the substantial public interest. The draft order has been prepared following a public consultation exercise and discussions with many organisations which process sensitive data and with the Data Protection Registrar. The Government have not expressly sought the views of genetics advisory bodies. The Government do not intend to inform the European Commission of the provision made in the draft order prior to it being considered by Parliament.

 Information is not held centrally on the numbers of police officers and police support staff paid within these specific salary bands. It is possible, however, to give the numbers of police officers serving in each rank, using figures correct at 31 March 1999, together with the range of salaries in each rank effective from 1 September 1999. The salary ranges given are for officers serving in provincial forces; officers serving in London receive additional allowances. The salary figures do not include overtime (where applicable) or other allowances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if it is his policy to encourage these with experience of other professions and with skills developed in other careers to join the police; and what assessment he has made of the adequacy of police rates of pay to attract such recruits;  [105610]

<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the recruitment of mature individuals by the police and of the pay levels of such new entrants in their previous employment.  [105614]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The recruitment of police officers is a matter for individual forces. There is no upper age limit for recruits, and applicants of all ages and background who fulfil the force entry criteria are encouraged to join. Clearly there is value in recruiting people with a wide range of skills and experience. Centrally held data are not available on the ages of recruits or their previous work experience.
<P>

<a name="00125w23.html_para0">Police rates of pay are contained within Police Regulations. There is an annual pay award for federated ranks, settled by a formula which keeps police pay in line with inflation. In 1998, pay was increased by 4.0 per cent. and in 1999 by 3.6 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00125w23.html_para1">Starting pay for recruits has been raised as a possible deterrent to applications from mature candidates who would be otherwise suitable for appointment. We are considering the issue and will refer it to the Police Negotiating Board if this seems warranted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00125w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The annual pay award for federated ranks is paid with effect from 1 September each year. The starting salary for appointments on probation (new recruits to the police service) in the year from 1 September 1997 was &#163;15,438; it was &#163;16,056 in the year from 1 September 1988 and &#163;16,635 in the year from 1 September 1999.
<P>

<a name="00125w23.html_para2">At current rates of pay, a recruit will receive a pay rise to &#163;18,612 on completion of 32 weeks initial training and a further rise, on completion of 2 years probation, to &#163;19,713.

<a name="00125w23.html_para3">In 1997, the starting pay of appointments on probation (&#163;15,438) was 80 per cent. of national average earnings; in 1998 (&#163;16,056), 81 per cent. and in 1999 (&#163;16,635), 79 per cent.
