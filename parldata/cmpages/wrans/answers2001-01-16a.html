<a name="10116w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many cases have been dropped after an initial charge has been laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions, in each year from 1992 to 2000.  [145221]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The table shows the number of proceedings dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in each year since 1992.

<P>

<a name="10116w01.html_para0">The table shows separately the number of defendants whose cases were discontinued in magistrates courts, and the number of defendants whose cases were dropped in the Crown court before a jury was sworn. The table also expresses these figures as a proportion of cases completed in each year.
<P>

<a name="10116w01.html_para1">Discontinuance has remained stable at around 12 per cent. to 13 per cent. of cases completed in magistrates courts during the period under review. However, the proportion of cases dropped in the Crown court has increased over recent years, from 7.2 per cent. in 1997 to 11.9 per cent. in the period January-September 2000. This is believed to be because the abolition of live committals in April 1997 removed the opportunity of testing prosecution witnesses before a case reaches the Crown court.
<P>

<a name="10116w01.html_para2">Charges in criminal proceedings are initially brought by the police rather than the Director of Public Prosecutions. Each case that the police send to the Crown Prosecution Service is then reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor to ensure that it meets the criteria for a prosecution set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> Public procurement procedures are based on the presumption that competitive tendering should apply as the norm but recognise that in certain, exceptional circumstances single tender procurement is justified providing that value for money and probity criteria are met.
<P>

<a name="10116w01.html_para3">In these respects the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has advised that it has complied with public procurement procedures in the thousands of procurements of goods, works and services undertaken for the Millennium Experience project. Over 90 per cent. of procurements have been by competitive tender. Of those that have been single tender 10 were in excess of &#163;1 million. Of those five were awarded to companies who had previously won work on the project through competitive tendering processes and were judged, for

In each case where this occurs the Company will continue to ensure that the rates charged are competitive, that value for money is delivered and that the necessary processes applicable to the extension of contracts in these circumstances are implemented.

 The Government are currently in negotiation with Legacy plc, as preferred bidder for the Dome. If negotiations go well we hope to be in a position to exchange contracts in February.

<a name="10116w01.html_spnew3"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has enhanced on-site security and has implemented comprehensive checking and authorisation procedures to ensure that any assets leaving the site have proper sign-off. This includes the establishment of an Asset Protection Team whose role is to oversee the movement, protection, secure storage and eventual disposal of assets whether owned by a third party or by NMEC. A special vehicle inspection bay has been created to screen all vehicles leaving the site and there is now only a single exit point from which vehicles can leave.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much European funding has been obtained for tourism in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> north-west England and <i>(c)</i> Merseyside for 2001.  [144909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w02.html_spnew0"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 There are numerous potential sources of European funding that could benefit tourism in this country. For instance, economically depressed areas in the UK will benefit from over &#163;6 billion of European regional funding under Objectives 1 and 2. Merseyside will receive &#163;840 million of Objective 1 funding during the seven year programme to help economic development. Objective 2 funding totalling &#163;500 million over this period will be providing help to parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria. It is difficult to identify the precise amount of an award that would benefit a specific sector such as tourism. However, we have been advised by the North West Tourist Board that tourism in Sefton and Liverpool will benefit from an award of &#163;1.5 million under Objective 1. There will also be support for Liverpool's bid for European Capital of Culture, Sefton's integrated tourism marketing initiative and the Merseyside Partnership's Merseyside Advantage strategy from the European Regional Development Fund.

 This Department's national strategy, "Tomorrows Tourism", sets out a framework for the sustainable development of tourism throughout England, including Merseyside. As part of that strategy we provide funding via the English Tourism Council to support projects in the regions. The North West Tourist Board and local partners are responsible for delivering the regional strategy for their area. We have been advised by the Board that tourism will benefit from an award of &#163;1.5 million to Sefton and Liverpool under Objective 1 (Sefton's share of the award is &#163;400,000) and from European Regional Development Fund support for Liverpool's bid for the European Capital of Culture, for Sefton's integrated tourism marketing initiative and for the Merseyside Partnership's Merseyside Advantage Strategy.

<P>
<a name="10116w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> The Government are happy for organisations or individuals to operate lotteries providing they comply with the provisions of the existing legislation. Under section 5 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 there can be only one operator of the National Lottery, although other organisations can run individual games with the agreement of the section 5 operator (which must act reasonably in its dealings with a section 6 applicant). The Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 allows for four distinct types of lottery; society lotteries, local lotteries, private lotteries and small lotteries incidental to exempt entertainments. The larger society lotteries run by charities, sports clubs and local authorities must register with the Gaming Board for Great Britain. The maximum sale value of the tickets which may be sold in a single

lottery is &#163;1 million. The top prize which may be offered is &#163;25,000 or 10 per cent. of its proceeds, whichever is the higher, and each lottery may sell no more than &#163;5 million worth of tickets in a single year.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2001]:</i> Donations to political parties are not a factor in the assessment of bids or tenders for Government work. Decisions on the competition for the future use of the Dome have been taken on the basis of objective and independent advice on what bids best met the published competition criteria. I declared an association with Robert Bourne to my officials before consideration began in December 1999 of the bids which qualified under the competition. I included in my subsequent written declaration that Robert Bourne had made contributions to my Constituency Labour Party. On the advice of my officials, I removed myself from any part of the consideration of the qualifying bids and from the subsequent decisions on shortlisting and granting of preferred bidder status.

 The Government have no such plans, which could be contrary to our international commitments unless it is part of a European agreement. However, the proposal for the Directive on universal service and users rights relating to electronic communications networks and services stipulates in its annexe VI that all the television sets sold in Europe should have at least one open interface socket permitting the connection of a digital receiver.

 The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is managed by the Board of Trustees established by the National Heritage Act 1983 and has the status of an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body. I am today announcing the Quinquennial Review of this body which will evaluate its performance and status. The Review also meets a commitment under the Government's Better Quality Services initiative which requires Departments to review their services and activities over a five-year period to decide how best to improve quality and value for money.

 In the year 1992 there were no prosecutions for breaches of meat hygiene regulations and four for breaches of pesticide safety regulations for which my Department was responsible. Other authorities will have had responsibility, especially up to 1 April 1995 when the Meat Hygiene Service was established and after 1 April 2000 when the Food Standards Agency was established. The relevant figures for subsequent years are:

<P>
<a name="10116w04.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Squire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the future of the Defence Diversification Agency.  [145997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w04.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We remain fully committed to defence diversification--the "spin-out" of defence technology to the civil sector for wider benefit. The Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) has made a very successful start in delivering that policy objective since its establishment in 1999. The implementation of our Public Private Partnership proposals for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) will make a further and very substantial contribution to defence diversification. It will be in the interest of "NewDERA" to exploit opportunities for the "spin-out" of defence technology to the civil sector. At the same time we shall want to ensure that the Defence Scientific and Technical Laboratory (DSIL), the part of DERA to be retained in the MOD, also contributes fully to defence diversification activity.
<P>

<a name="10116w04.html_para3">Since the DDA currently operates as part of DERA, some reorganisation over the next few months is inevitable. Responsibility for the agency, we propose, will be transferred from DERA to MOD headquarters, from where it would continue to facilitate the achievement of our defence diversification objectives. It would ensure that opportunities for "spin-out", and also the "spin-in" of civil technology to the MOD, are disseminated and exploited, and that industry is assisted with its own diversification planning. A major part of diversification activities would in future be undertaken from within NewDERA and DSTL, by existing DDA staff operating from their current locations, continuing the work that they do now, and transferred to NewDERA and DSTL for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="10116w04.html_para4">We shall work closely with industry and other stakeholders to ensure that the DDA continues to secure our policy objectives. Detailed new arrangements will now be worked out and we shall consult about the staffing

implications in the normal way. In the light of experience of the new organisation, we shall consider further the establishment of a Defence Diversification Council.

<a name="10116w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Swinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what depleted uranium rounds were discharged for training purposes in Saudi Arabia on the Devil Dog Dragoon ranges in 1990-91; and if the ranges were cleared after firing.  [145128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> According to records held by my Department, a small number of DU rounds were fired at Devil Dog Dragoon Ranges in Saudi Arabia during January 1991. These munitions were fired for commissioning purposes, that is, firing at a soft canvas target in order to form a Mean Point of Impact, from which data could be obtained on the accuracy of the tank's main armament when firing this type of ammunition. The rounds fired were L26 120 mm Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) Challenger tank DU rounds, which were first deployed operationally during the Gulf Conflict.
<P>

<a name="10116w04.html_para5">We do not have details of the numbers of rounds which may have been fired, or the precise dates of any such firings but contemporary authoritative records show that two areas within Devil Dog Dragoon Ranges were designated for the firing of tank main armaments, as well as for other large calibre rounds which contained no DU material. These ranges were designated T1 and T2. Contemporary records indicate that the clearance of any UK Unexploded Ordnance from these ranges was completed during March 1991.

 I have nothing to add to the answer provided by my hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces on 5 June 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 17-18W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his policy towards the <i>(a)</i> development and <i>(b)</i> use by British armed forces of thermobaric weapons.  [145371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w04.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not have any weapons based on 'thermobaric' munitions in its inventory. However, such weapons exist and it would therefore be irresponsible not to keep developments in this field under review, not least to develop protective measures for our personnel.
<P>

<a name="10116w04.html_para6">We have asked industry to consider how best to provide an anti-structure capability for use by the infantry in the urban environment. It is possible that this solution may involve using blast rather than fragmentation effects.

The current US Administration has not sought our agreement to the use of facilities in this country for National Missile Defence. Nor would we expect any such request from the United States until and unless the next Administration decided to proceed with deployment of such a system.

As is usual in these circumstances, rigorous formal inquiries were instigated. These included a Board of Inquiry. The report from the Board of Inquiry is currently being considered by Senior Officers. Following the accident, and in advance of final recommendations, some additional precautionary measures have been introduced.

 Between 1992 and the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), the number of Territorial Army Centres (TAC) remained almost constant, with any closures part of routine management of the Volunteer Estate. SDR resulted in a fundamental reorganisation, reduction and in some cases redeployment of the Territorial Army. Prior to SDR, there were 455 TACs. 342 have been retained for

 The Department is organised financially into Top Level Budgets reflecting major outputs rather than geographical location. Expenditure records reflect this organisation and are maintained for only commodities and Top Level Budgets. While we do not record all departmental expenditure by region, the Defence Bills Agency paid defence contractors based in Scotland some &#163;691 million during 1999-2000, some 3 per cent. of Defence expenditure.

 Putting condemned meat in the human food chain is a very serious matter and one that could affect human health.
<P>

<a name="10116w06.html_para0">The charge in this case was one of unusually serious criminal activity involving food safety, based on an intention to defraud others for financial gain. The fresh meat sector is one of the most strictly regulated sectors of the food industry. Penalties under the Food Safety Act 1990 reflect the nature of the regulatory offences generally prosecuted under it. In this case, the appropriate charge was a common law conspiracy to defraud, where the penalties available are greater than those under specific food legislation. If the law needs strengthening to ensure better protection of human health, we will not hesitate to do this.

 The last Chief Medical Officer's report was published in August 1998 by Sir Kenneth Calman shortly before he left office. The present Chief Medical Officer came into post in late September 1998. He has taken stock of the publications issued by the CMO and introduced a number of changes. He is currently exploring the opportunities for greater use of web-based publishing methods.
<P>

<a name="10116w06.html_para1">After listening to a wide range of views he also intends to introduce changes to the format of his annual report. Although the previous format served its purpose well in the past, it is very detailed and it is not always clear in what areas action is being called for. The practice of the CMO's annual report containing descriptions of a wide range of Government policies which are contained in other documents added to the detailed nature of the reports.
<P>

<a name="10116w06.html_para2">It is the intention of the CMO to produce a new format of the report. Although it was intended that the new report would be ready for the end of 2000, due to other pressing commitments it is hoped that it will now be published in the first quarter of this year. It will be shorter, with a clear

<P>
<a name="10116w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his reply of 20 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 196W, (1) what steps he plans to take to provide a secure regulatory framework on the market for those products which are safe combinations of herbal remedies and food ingredients; and if he will make a statement;  [145568]
<P>
<UL>(2) pursuant to his answer of 20 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 196W, if it is his policy to promote within discussions on the proposed Traditional Use Medicines Directive efforts to reduce the 30 year qualifying period for the demonstration of traditional use to a shorter period that reflects the conditions of the existing UK market;  [145582]
<P>
(3) pursuant to his answer of 20 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 196W, if it is his policy to promote within the discussions on the proposed Traditional Use Medicines Directive the objective of extending its scope to include products which are combinations of herbs with other ingredients and which have been on the market for the qualifying period <i>(a)</i> as part of the combination in question or <i>(b)</i> as an ingredient separate from the one with which it is to be combined;  [145581]
<P>
(4) what response the Medicines Control Agency has made to the European Commission in its call for comments on the draft Traditional use Medicines Directive; and if he will arrange for that response to be published in the <i>Official Report</i>.  [145389]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Our priority in continuing European discussions on the proposed directive is to achieve a secure regulatory regime for traditional herbal remedies. We are aware that there are also some traditional medicines which consist wholly or partly of non-herbal ingredients. Our current position is that, once the directive goes beyond relatively discrete categories such as traditional herbal remedies, it may become more difficult to contain the wider public health and regulatory consequences. We therefore wish to continue to review the developing shape of the directive and the implications for overall medicines regulation before firmly committing ourselves to supporting the principle that coverage should extend more widely.
<P>

<a name="10116w07.html_para0">We are also considering carefully our detailed position on the definition of traditional use, including the qualifying time period, and on criteria which might apply in the case of combinations. One general consideration is that the normal regulatory requirements for medicines include demonstration of efficacy. While we have 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2001 : Column: 156W</I><P>
advocated in Europe the specific case for lifting the requirement for efficacy in the case of genuinely traditional herbal remedies, we would have concerns about the potential implications if the parameters for traditional use were set so loosely that a very wide range of medicinal products were no longer required to demonstrate efficacy.
<P>

<a name="10116w07.html_para1">At this stage we do not yet know the views of other member states on specific issues relating to combination products. We would expect a clearer picture to emerge over the coming months as European discussions continue. The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has submitted our initial response to the European Commission on the preliminary draft of the proposed directive. Copies of the MCA's letter will be placed in the Library. We will continue our current consultative approach with herbal interest groups.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much of the recently financed extra money for cancer care will be targeted in <i>(a)</i> the West Midlands and <i>(b)</i> Coventry.  [144973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w08.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently announced a national investment of &#163;450 million earmarked for cancer and heart services which will help to raise standards of care and cut waiting times for treatment.
<P>

<a name="10116w08.html_para0">Each health authority, in consultation with National Health Service trusts, will need to draw up an agreed policy for cancer services and report on their plans to use the money through the service and financial framework process.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w08.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much of the recently announced extra money for cancer care will be targeted at specific forms of cancer; and which research institutes and sites of excellence will benefit from the additional money.  [144974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w08.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The NHS Plan announced that health authorities will receive an additional &#163;280 million in 2001-02, &#163;407 million in 2002-03 and &#163;570 million by 2003-04 for improving cancer services as set out in the National Health Service cancer plan.
<P>

<a name="10116w08.html_para1">The plan sets out the priorities for cancer services including improved prevention measures; increasing the cancer work force; reducing waiting times for diagnosis and treatment; introducing the most effective treatments (including implementing recommendations by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on anti-cancer drugs and implementing evidence-based guidance on 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2001 : Column: 157W</I><P>
effective service delivery); updating cancer equipment, and reorganising delivery of care. The aim is that, as the plan is implemented, patients with all forms of cancer will experience prompt access to treatment and care based on up-to-date evidence. Early action will include implementation of recent and forthcoming guidance on upper gastrointestinal, urological and haematological cancers; new waiting times targets to ensure rapid access to treatment for people with breast cancer, childhood cancers, testicular cancer and leukaemia; and the start of the roll out of the breast screening programme to women aged 65-70.
<P>

<a name="10116w08.html_para2">All centres of research excellence will benefit from the extra money announced for cancer care. In addition by 2003, we will be investing an additional &#163;20 million each year in the new National Cancer Research Network 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2001 : Column: 158W</I><P>
(NCRN) and an extra &#163;4 million each year on prostate cancer research. The NCRN will, among many other things, further integrate research and cancer care.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many children suffer from autism; and what proportion this represents of children <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> in each region.  [145422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It is widely accepted that the estimated prevalence rate of classic autism is between four and five per 10,000 population. Prevalence of all autistic spectrum disorders is more difficult to estimate but could be as high as 91 per 10,000. These incidence figures would imply that, in England, between 5,000 and 6,000 children up to 18 years of age are affected by classic autism and that up to 110,000 children may be affected by autistic spectrum disorders. We have no evidence of variations in the incidence of autism across regions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he is taking to improve the recruitment of <i>(a)</i> trainee and <i>(b)</i> trained scientific staff by the NHS; and if he will make a statement.  [145407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Advisory Group for Scientists and Technicians has been charged with developing plans to improve work force planning, education, training and career development among that group of staff. The Department is also developing a specific strategy for improving recruitment and retention, liaising closely with employers, professional bodies and trade unions to raise the profile of the work of scientists.
<P>

<a name="10116w09.html_para0">The National Health Service Careers Service, including the website http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk has been extended to include scientists and technicians. A new generic scientists and technicians careers leaflet has also been prepared.

<a name="10116w09.html_para1">To address particular recruitment and retention problems in pathology laboratories pay increases of between 7.3 per cent. and 16.7 per cent. have been offered from April 2001 to over 6,000 trainee Medical Laboratory Scientific Officers (MLSOs), MLSO1s and MLSO2s. Other scientific and technical staff have been offered a 3.7 per cent. increase.

<a name="10116w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will introduce legislation on food labelling to make it an offence to remove labels when repackaging foods and to require labels to indicate <i>(a)</i> country of origin, <i>(b)</i> country of production and packing and <i>(c)</i> whether the produce is organic.  [144757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Relabelling when repackaging food is generally necessary in order to ensure that the label gives accurate information on the repackaged product. Failure to remove the original label risks causing confusion. Misleading labelling does give rise to an offence.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2001 : Column: 162W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10116w09.html_para2">Origin labelling rules are harmonised at European level. We are actively pressing for these rules to be amended to improve the amount and clarity of origin information on food labels. In the meantime, guidance issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in February last year, and placed in the Library, makes clear that origin labelling must be carefully worded to avoid confusion between the origin of ingredients and the place of final processing.
<P>

<a name="10116w09.html_para3">Produce that is organic is already generally identified. Organic food production is strictly regulated by written standards. It is illegal to offer for sale any food described as organic unless it has been produced in full conformity with European rules by registered producers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the recent parliamentary and presidential elections in Ghana.  [145186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Presidential and parliamentary elections took place in Ghana on 7 December. Opposition leader John Kufuor, New Patriotic Front Party (NPP), polled the most votes (48.44 per cent.) but failed to secure the necessary 50 per cent. vote to win the first round. Vice President John Mills of the ruling National Democratic Congress took 44.8 per cent. In parallel parliamentary elections, the NPP achieved a majority taking 97 seats against the NDC's 90 out of a total of 200. Election day was generally peaceful with a few reports of violence and little sign of electoral malpractice. Overall turnout was estimated at 60-65 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10116w11.html_para2">The second round run-off between Kufuor and Mills took place on 28 December. Kufuor won taking 57 per cent. of the votes cast. The atmosphere in the second round was tense. Although violent incidents occurred in some NPP dominated areas, the security forces largely behaved in a non-partisan way. The electoral process was again considered to have been free fair and transparent and to have reflected the will of the Ghanaian people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are concerned at the disturbing reports of the destruction of non-official Catholic and Protestant Churches, and Buddhist and Taoist temples in Wenzhou, China in late 2000 and the death of Liu Haitao. Such activities run contrary to the provisions on religious freedoms contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China signed in October 1998.
<P>

<a name="10116w12.html_para0">We regularly press the Chinese authorities to respect these provisions and to permit free religious worship outside the parameters of the official Churches in China. We did so at the latest session of the UK/China human rights dialogue in October 2000. We have raised specific concerns about the destruction of Churches and Temples in Wenzhou, and the case of Liu Haitao. We will address again the whole issue of freedom of religious belief in strong terms during the next round of the high level UK/China human rights dialogue in Beijing between 12-14 February.

 I welcome the involvement of both sides in discussions on the basis of the proposals put forward by President Clinton. I hope that the parties will seize the opportunity to bridge the gaps on his proposals. We continue to appeal to both sides to take further steps to halt the violence, action which is essential to build confidence and lay the foundations for further progress in the negotiations. Britain remains closely engaged. At the Prime Minister's request and with the Foreign Secretary's support, Lord Levy visited Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan between 5-9 January, as the Prime Minister's personal envoy. He urged the Israelis and Palestinians to take urgent steps to build confidence and to re-engage in negotiations.

 My right hon. Friend meets university representatives from time to time in the normal course of business and discusses various issues. The Government's position on "top-up" fees is clear--we are opposed to them and have legislated to prevent universities from levying such charges. Nor are "top-up" fees necessary. The Government have invested &#163;1.7 billion (18 per cent. in real terms) in additional planned resources in higher education over the six years between 1998-99 and 2003-04.

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has a duty to provide for medical and dental inspections and treatment for school pupils. Local education authorities and school governing bodies are required to make arrangements for encouraging and assisting pupils to take advantage of this provision.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> Awareness of Holocaust Memorial Day has been directly promoted in schools through the development of an Education Pack, which was launched on 9 November as part of the build up to the day on 27 January. The Pack has been produced by an Education Working Group of experts from non-government organisations, including the Holocaust Educational Trust who, on behalf of the working group, are making the pack available to all schools.

 The term "Environmental Impact Assessment" describes a procedure that has to be followed for certain types of project before they may be granted development consent. The procedure requires the developer to compile detailed information about the likely significant environmental effects of the proposed project. The information prepared by the developer is presented in a written report to the body responsible for deciding whether to grant development consent. This report is the "Environmental Statement". The term "Environmental Statement" is defined, for the purposes of those Regulations, in regulation 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1988.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> My Department has carried out a one year study measuring mercury particle and vapour concentrations near a crematorium site at Sutton Coldfield. That study ended in December 2000. Results so far indicate that annual mean concentrations of mercury particles are likely to be less than 0.1ng/m <sup>3</sup>  (nano-grams per cubic metre), and often below the limit of detection, while concentrations of mercury vapour are around 3.0ng/m <sup>3</sup> .

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The introduction of the Reporting of Injuries and Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) in 1996-97 resulted in a change of injury class for members of the pubic including passengers. There is now no distinction between a major and minor injury, the reporting trigger being that the injured person is removed from the site of the accident to hospital immediately.<P>

2. The rates shown in the tables are for injuries to passengers on all railways in Great Britain broken down into train accidents, movement accidents and non-movement accidents. Train and movement accident rates are related to billions of passenger miles. Non-movement accidents are shown per billion passenger journeys as that figure relates more closely to the use of stations.<P>

3. Train accidents are--collisions, derailments, trains running into obstructions, fires on board trains and missile damage to drivers cab windows. Movement accidents are injuries caused by the train but not falling in the category of train accidents, e.g. passengers falling out of a train door while the train is travelling between stations. Non-movement accidents do not involve trains, e.g. passengers falling on platforms at stations.<P>

The scheme was provisionally accepted for funding in the recently announced local transport capital settlement on the basis of the appraisal information provided with the Plan. We have indicated that the appraisal requires some more work. However, it demonstrates that the present value of benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms are of the order of &#163;22 million compared with present value costs of &#163;9 million. There are other benefits that have not been expressed in monetary terms. I have made arrangements for a copy of the appraisal to be placed in Library.

Agency (DERA) undertakes marine environmental sampling in the Solway Firth. The results of this monitoring are made available to the public via the local authority. Between 1981 and 1995, DU munitions were test fired at the Eskmeals range in Cumbria. These firings were conducted solely on land and no munitions were fired into the Irish Sea. There is an ongoing environmental monitoring programme in the Eskmeals area also.
<P>

<a name="10116w18.html_para0">In December 1993, the MOD commissioned an independent assessment of the impact of firing DU munitions at MOD ranges. The "Environmental Assessment of the Firing of Depleted Uranium Projectiles at Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright Ranges", produced by environmental consultants WS Atkins, was published in July 1995. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. The report concluded that there was no significant risk to members of the public or the environment from the DU firing programme.

<P>
<a name="10116w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have decided in principle that the rules of Rural Bus Subsidy Grant should be changed to give local authorities more flexibility in its use. We propose to allow authorities the freedom to use up to 20 per cent. of the grant on support of existing rural bus services. Authorities will also be able to use the grant to provide ongoing support for services initially supported under the Rural Bus Challenge scheme. These changes will involve amendments to the current rule which prevents use of the grant for services which were already being run as at 1 May 1999.
<P>

<a name="10116w18.html_para2">We will be consulting the Local Government Association on the details of this change and the monitoring arrangements which will be involved with the intention of new rules being in place for the coming financial year.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mr Smith is unavailable and therefore I am writing to you on his behalf.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I accept that the Agency's performance is still falling short of the service we want to deliver to our customers. We are striving for continuous improvement and the Secretary of State has set us challenging performance targets for this year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since 1996 we have increased the proportion of non-resident parents who are fully complaint from 32% to 47.6% and in 1999/00 we collected and arranged &#163;730.9m, compared to &#163;400m in 96/97.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, I agree that there is still someway to go. In the longer term, the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 will lead to radical improvements in the service we offer our clients. Maintenance calculations will be based on a simple percentage of the non-resident parent's net income - 15% for one child; 20% for two and 25% for three or more. The simpler system of rates will make it easier for parents to know how much they are expected to pay, and sorting out child support quickly will enable parents to get on with their lives without the current uncertainty about maintenance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The reforms will be introduced for new cases by April 2002 with existing cases transferred at a later date when the system is seen to be working well. However, there is much that we can do in the meantime with the new legislative powers in the Act. This is why we have agreed with Ministers that the new parentage and information gathering provisions and the extension of child support jurisdiction will come into effect from the end of this month. And in April we will bring the driving licence provisions into effect. This will mean that from 31st January 2001, the CSA will be able to presume parentage if it is denied but the non-resident parent was married to the parent with care at any time between the child's conception and birth, or if unmarried he is registered on the birth certificate. The Agency will also be able to presume parentage if he refuses DNA testing or disputes a positive DNA result.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From 31st January 2001 it will be a criminal offence not to co-operate with the Child Support Agency, carrying a fine of up to &#163;1000. From April 2001, persistent offenders can have their driving licence removed by the courts.</FONT></UL>

 The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that non-human primates can be used only if no other species is suitable. In addition to regulatory testing to help ensure the safety of medicines, non-human primates are also used for other important areas of fundamental research. For example, they contribute to programmes of work relating to Parkinson's disease, visual impairment, stroke, diabetes, disorders of reproduction and vaccine development.

 Holocaust memorial day is focused on learning the lessons of the holocaust and other more recent atrocities that raise similar issues. We took a conscious decision to focus on events around the holocaust and thereafter, although we did examine requests to consider the atrocities and other events that preceded the holocaust. Examples include the crusades, slavery, colonialism, the victims of Stalin and the Boer war. It is always difficult to draw a line and wherever it is drawn it runs the risk of being misinterpreted.
<P>

<a name="10116w20.html_para12">A particular focus on events around the period 1939-45 and thereafter should not be seen as failing to acknowledge, sympathise and respect the concerns about prior events.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy to ban the Draize test used to determine irritancy of products; and if he will make a statement.  [145380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Following the Government's announcement of a ban on the testing of cosmetic products and ingredients, the Draize eye safety test is no longer used for that purpose. However, national and international regulatory bodies require that non-cosmetic products, ingredients and chemicals are tested to ensure that they are safe (for humans, other animals and the environment) during manufacture, transport and use.
<P>

<a name="10116w21.html_para0">The Draize test is a safety test required for regulatory risk assessments of chemicals and a range of manufactured products which may be deliberately or accidentally brought into contact with the eyes. An example of this would be preparations used in medical eye drops.
<P>

<a name="10116w21.html_para1">Some non-animal alternatives to the Draize eye test are available for some screening purposes. However, these can be used only for a limited range of test materials.
<P>

<a name="10116w21.html_para2">The Home Office has published guidance and minimum severity protocols for this procedure. Such animal testing takes place only when in vitro screening tests have been used to identify, classify and eliminate materials with obvious irritant potential. Careful consideration is given to all available information on a substance to avoid testing of substances likely to produce severe effects on test animals. In this regard the Draize eye test is not carried out on strongly acid or alkaline substances or on substances which have demonstrated severe adverse skin effects in dermal tests or on substances which have demonstrated potential corrosive effects or severe irritancy in the alternative tests currently available.
<P>

<a name="10116w21.html_para3">This country has taken, and continues to take, a leading role in Europe in encouraging the use of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used and refine the procedures to minimise pain and suffering. To this end the Home Office has funded work conducted by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), but it has been concluded that the currently available alternatives to the Draize test have significant limitations and cannot replace live animal use at this stage.

 It is an offence under the Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985 to supply a substance to someone under the age of 18 knowing or believing that the substance, or its fumes, is likely to be inhaled for the purposes of intoxication. Under the 1996 Offensive Weapons Act, it is an offence to sell a knife to a person under the age of 16 years.

 Subject to a number of limited exceptions the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 applies throughout the United Kingdom.

However, section 10 (Giving advice and assistance), section 13 (Education about electoral and democratic systems), and section 145 (General function of Commission with respect to monitoring compliance with controls imposed by the Act etc.) confer powers on Scottish Ministers to extend the functions of the Commission under those sections to cover local government elections in Scotland. Section 19 of the

National Police Training plans to provide about 640 places per training intake during 2001-02. The distribution of these places between NPT centres is expected to change in the course of the year as development proceeds at some sites and the need for leased satellite premises is reviewed.

The number of places provided can be increased if demand exceeds forecasts, provided forces are able to identify and second suitable staff to act as trainers.

 We share the view of the Scottish Executive that the report of the study should be approached with a considerable degree of caution, and that it does not support the conclusion that changes to licensing law in Scotland made in 1976 have caused more violence or binge drinking. The report is in any event of limited relevance to our proposals for reforming the licensing laws in England and Wales, which do not involve reproducing the Scottish arrangements.

These regulations are over 12 years old and so I am minded to undertake a review. I am currently discussing such a review with my officials and I will announce my decision shortly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on her plans for the reform of the Court of Protection.  [145736]<P>

<P>
<a name="10116w25.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Plans for the reform of the Court of Protection are set out in the Government's Policy Statement "Making Decisions", issued in October 1999. The Policy Statement sets out the Government's proposals to reform the law in order to improve and clarify the decision-making process for those who are unable to make decisions for themselves. This includes establishing a new single court jurisdiction which will deal with all areas of decision-making for adults without capacity. The new jurisdiction will be based at the Court of Protection. The establishment of the new Court will require legislative change.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when she will publish the final evaluation report of research into pilot information meetings under Part II of the Family Law Act 1996; and what plans the Government have to implement Part II of the Act.  [146031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w25.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Final Evaluation Report has been published today, and copies have been placed in the Library. The Lord Chancellor and I are grateful for Professor Walker and her team at Newcastle University for the very detailed and informative report they have produced.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para0">On 17 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 213W, the Government announced that they would await the Final Evaluation Report before deciding the way forward on Part II.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para1">The research has concluded that none of the six models of information meeting tested over a two-year period is good enough for the implementation of Part II on a nation-wide basis. It has shown that, for most people, the meetings came too late to save marriages and tended to incline those who were uncertain about their marriages towards divorce. While people valued the provision of information, the meetings were too inflexible, providing general information about both marriage saving and the divorce process. People wanted information tailored to 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2001 : Column: 220W</I><P>
their individual circumstances and needs. In addition, in the great majority of cases, only the person petitioning for divorce attended the meeting, but marriage counselling, conciliatory divorce and mediation depend for success on the willing involvement of both parties.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para2">The Report has suggested testing a further model designed to address the majority of the shortcomings identified in the pilots. However, this new kind of meeting would not solve the underlying problems associated with compulsory information meetings, in particular the timing of the meetings in the divorce process and their inability to engage both parties.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para3">Furthermore, in the Government's view the problems with Part II are not limited to the provisions on information meetings. The new procedures would be complex and likely to lead to significant delay and uncertainty which would not be in the best interests of the couple or their children. There are concerns that the provisions would prove unworkable in practice.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para4">The Government therefore do not believe Part II would fulfil the principles of Part I of the Act, to which they remain committed. These principles include saving saveable marriages and, where marriages break down, bringing them to an end with the minimum distress to the parties and children affected.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para5">The Government are not satisfied that it would be right to proceed with the implementation of Part II and propose to invite Parliament to repeal the relevant sections of the Family Law Act 1996 once a suitable legislative opportunity occurs. This decision does not affect section 22, in Part II, relating to the funding of marriage support services, which is in force and will remain so. In addition, while it is not possible to implement separately the provisions at sections 9(3) and (4) of Part II, the Government are sympathetic to the needs of Jewish women who are denied a religious divorce, and is considering the best way forward.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para6">The Government will draw on the Evaluation Report and build on the initiatives already under way in their efforts to support marriage and stable relationships and to reduce the damaging impact of family conflict and relationship breakdown on children. They have taken forward a wide range of measures over the past three years to help families, including establishing the new Children's Fund and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, improving maternity and parental leave arrangements, and increasing funding for marriage and relationship support to a total of &#163;5 million per annum by 2002-03.

 During the current financial year (2000-01), the Lord Chancellor's Department will spend &#163;4 million on marriage and relationship support, an increase of &#163;0.8 million on funding for the financial year 1999-2000.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what action his Department is taking in respect of the recommendations in the final report of the Civil Justice Reform Group in Northern Ireland.  [146030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Final Report of the Civil Justice Reform Group was published on 16 June with a consultation period until the end of September. The Lord Chancellor's original purpose in establishing the Group was to ensure a reform programme tailored to Northern Ireland's needs and informed by those with practical experience of the system.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para10">The Lord Chancellor and I are very grateful to Lord Justice Campbell, who chaired the Group, and to the other members for their work. We are also grateful to those who responded during the consultation period. Broadly, the Lord Chancellor and I accept the Report's main direction and its principal recommendations. There are notable departures from arrangements in England and Wales but the Government are satisfied they are appropriate in the Northern Ireland context.
<P>

<a name="10116w25.html_para11">There are a few technical recommendations in relation to expert evidence on which the Lord Chancellor and I do not share the views expressed in the Report. These will require further consideration and of course there are other points of detail to be looked at closely during the implementation process, but overall the Government are of the view that the Report's recommendations represent a major step forward in the reform of the civil justice

Implementation will begin as soon as possible with an increase in the small claims jurisdiction early this year followed by an approximately two year rolling programme of subordinate legislation and operational changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10116w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The provision of a new magistrates court in Liverpool forms part of a proposed Private Finance Initiative project to provide serviced accommodation for the Merseyside magistrates courts committee.
