<a name="01220w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paul Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what increase in road traffic there has been since the Hatfield train derailment.  [141622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 According to the Association of Train Operating Companies, there is a 13 per cent. drop in passenger revenue in the most recent statistics for December. The effect has not been uniform with some lines much more badly affected than others. If all of the people who have switched from rail had instead travelled by car this would have increased road travel overall by about 1 per cent., with some routes affected more than others. In practice, the effect will have been less as some journeys will have been abandoned and some passengers will have used alternative models of public transport. Daily monitoring of traffic levels by my Department has shown no significant increase in traffic in recent weeks, but relatively small percentage changes in road travel can easily be masked by other influences including, over recent weeks, bad weather depressing traffic levels.

<P>
<a name="01220w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the advantages and disadvantages regarding energy efficiency in the rented commercial office sector where <i>(a)</i> tenants are given an incentive to save energy by a separate energy cost based on actual energy consumption, alongside charges for floor space rental and <i>(b)</i> landlords are given an incentive to save energy through building refurbishment, by charging a fixed rental price from the owners of the building being occupied, regardless of energy use by the tenant.  [142256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department has made no detailed assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages arising from the two scenarios identified.
<P>

<a name="01220w01.html_para0">However, my Department's Property Advisory Group drew attention to various barriers to greater energy efficiency in commercial buildings in its 1998 report, "Sustainable Development and Buildings". The report identified that in some leasing arrangements, where the tenant reimburses the landlord's energy costs, neither party has an incentive to achieve greater energy efficiency. The Group commended all-inclusive occupation agreements as a means of giving the landlord and tenant a mutual incentive to reduce energy consumption. The Group explored this further and concluded that while there was considerable and growing interest in all-inclusive leases in 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 2000 : Column: 168W</I><P>
the commercial property sector, wider adoption would primarily be a matter for market evolution. I intend to give further consideration to this.
<P>

<a name="01220w01.html_para1">The forthcoming Climate Change Levy will provide a major incentive for greater energy efficiency in the non-domestic sector. The Government do and will continue to provide information to encourage business to become more energy efficient, through its Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme. The programme promotes strategies to motivate the different players in the rented commercial property sector through a suite of publications setting out best practice in design, construction, occupation and energy services. Good Practice Guide 258, "Looking for a new Investment Angle?" targets developers, landlords and financiers, with Good Practice Guides 285, "What will energy efficiency do for your business?", and 288, "Is poor energy efficiency in your office hitting your bottom line?" targeting tenants and occupiers. Each document spells out to the relevant audience the environmental, financial and other business benefits to be gained from investing in major energy efficiency improvements and in practising good energy management. The guide for tenants encourages businesses not only to exercise proper management over areas where they have direct control, but also to explain to current and potential landlords that they expect to be provided with environmentally smart buildings.

<P>
<a name="01220w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for <i>(a)</i> 1996-97, <i>(b)</i> 1997-98, <i>(c)</i> 1998-99, <i>(d)</i> 1999-2000 and <i>(e)</i> 2000-01, (i) his Department's total spending on advertising campaigns, (ii) the cost of each individual advertising campaign and (iii) the criteria that were established to gauge the effectiveness of each campaign; and what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of each campaign based on these criteria.  [142723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My Department uses advertising on TV and in various other media to inform the wider public about how they are affected by departmental legislation, and also to effect attitudinal change in such fields as road safety and climate change.
<P>

<a name="01220w01.html_para2">Each major campaign is rigorously evaluated to ensure maximum effectiveness and value for money. Evaluation criteria are set according to the individual objectives of each campaign (for example awareness and understanding of road safety issues are tracked along with changes in public attitudes and against infringement and casualty statistics), and the results of each evaluation exercise are used to inform campaign development.
<P>

<a name="01220w01.html_para3">Historical data on the individual objectives and evaluation criteria for each campaign can be supplied only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The duty to draw up maps showing open country and registered common land in England falls entirely on the Countryside Agency. Local authorities will have an opportunity to comment on draft maps if they wish to do so, but this is not expected to involve significant cost. The need to appoint additional wardens, where appropriate, to help with management of the new right of access will arise when the new right comes into effect in a few years' time. A recent study for the Local Government Association suggested that the cost of managing the new right, including wardening, will be around &#163;1.5 million per year for England and Wales. We intend to make provision for funding of wardening services through the normal revenue support system for local authorities. Taking into account the specific functions of local authorities under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, and the extensive provision for appeals by landowners to the Secretary of State, we do not consider that there is likely to be any need to make provision for costs arising from potential legal action.

However, no. 9 then also had to be taken out of service in February 2000 because of a problem with the drive shaft. From that date, until September 2000 when escalator no.7 returned to service, there was no up escalator from the Victoria Line.
<P>

<a name="01220w02.html_para5">An alternative up escalator service, via the Piccadilly Line escalators was available for most of this time (although these escalators then developed problems early in September 2000).

 This is an operational matter for London Underground. However, I understand that London Underground escalator contracts are put to open tender, thus the number of tendering contractors varies each time. London Underground and its subsidiaries presently have maintenance agreements with four contractors (one of whom is internal).

 These are operational matters for London Underground (LUL) and Railtrack.

For the last quarter (20 August to 11 November 2000) 1.55 per cent. of scheduled peak

<a name="01220w02.html_para7">The information on commuter rail services is not available in the form requested. However, in 1999-2000, the main cause of 9 per cent. of train delays was attributed to train crew shortages.

Cardiff Railways are expected to forward a formal bid for RPP funding to reopen the Vale of Glamorgan line. The shadow SRA assesses bids received against the Franchising Director's Planning Criteria, and against value for money in the delivery of the scheme and in comparison with other projects.

 Following earlier rulings on state aid by the European Commission, all projects that involve private sector developers and the use of grant to help fund developments that would otherwise not be commercially viable have come under particularly close scrutiny. To clarify the position and to help speed up consideration of individual projects, such as those coming forward for Objective One funding on Merseyside, we have asked the Commission to approve a number of national schemes which will provide models for projects of this type.
<P>

<a name="01220w03.html_para0">Two of these schemes are for projects which will involve state aid and would operate in the Assisted Areas. These schemes were put to the Commission in December last year. A positive response from the Commission is expected shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> As announced by the Deputy Prime Minister in a written answer on 15 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 85-86W, the negotiated settlement of this long-running dispute involved a total payment of &#163;355.77 million. This litigation followed an investigation by the Pensions Ombudsman into an agreement in 1986 between the National Bus Company and the then Government which had resulted in the payment to the Government in 1990 of the surpluses of the two NBC pension funds.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to publish his response to the recommendation of the panel that conducted the public examination of the draft regional planning guidance for the south-west; and if he will make a statement.  [144004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has today published for consultation Proposed Changes to the Draft Regional Planning Guidance (RPG10) for the south-west.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para3">In March my right hon. Friend set out a new approach to planning for housing provision. This was taken forward in more detail in the revised Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 3 also published in March. More recent guidance on regional planning has been set out in PPG11, and important issues for the regions to take forward are contained in the urban and rural White Papers issued last month. The Proposed Changes to the draft RPG for the south-west reflect the principles and priorities set out in those statements. They aim to support economic growth and regeneration, while protecting and enhancing the region's environment. They endorse the housing target proposed by the Panel of around some 20,350 additional dwellings a year as the starting point for the plan, monitor and manage approach.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para4">This is a modest increase of 10 per cent. on the figure of 18,350 proposed by the local authorities in their draft, and is well in line with existing levels of provision. We are also, however, proposing to increase to 50 per cent. the target for such housing to be on previously used land buildings and buildings, compared with the 44 per cent. proposed by the Panel. This takes account of the likely availability of such land in a largely rural region, but also of the advice in PPG3 to make more efficient use of land, particularly within urban areas. This higher target figure means that the slight increase in overall housing provision will not lead to any additional demand for greenfield sites.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para5">We endorse the Regional Planning Body's view that most development should be concentrated in the cities and larger towns. This is consistent with our policies for urban renaissance and the better use of land. To aid that objective we have proposed changes which will help local authorities to make swift progress on the identification of the extent and potential of such settlements. The potential of these areas will now be the subject of studies with the Regional Planning Body, the local authorities concerned and other interested parties. Building on the Panel's recommendations, we are proposing a sequential approach to development, looking first at the capacity and reuse of previously developed land within urban areas, then 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 2000 : Column: 179W</I><P>
possible urban extensions. Where it is not possible to make such provision, the possibility of new settlements in sustainable locations may be an option.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para6">We have accepted the Panel's recommendation for a review of the Green Belt around the main urban areas as an essential part of the process of finding sustainable locations for development. It should be carried out by the local authorities, with any changes taken forward through the review of development plans. The policies are designed to help achieve an urban renaissance and the improved economic and social viability of the rural areas, while protecting and enhancing the countryside.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para7">The Proposed Changes set out priorities for transport investment and study, and include revised parking standards. However, they make clear that more work needs to be done to develop the Regional Transport Strategy to facilitate the economic performance of the region, achieve more sustainable patterns of movement and to combat congestion.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para8">The consultation period on the Proposed Changes will be for 12 weeks, ending on 14 March 2001. Copies of the relevant documents have been placed in the House Library and made available to the region's MPs.

uranium (DU). These surveys would have detected any contamination levels at which special health and safety precautions defined in Statutory Instruments would have had to be introduced. No DU levels above five becquerels per square centimetre were found during Iraqi equipment monitoring and therefore no special precautions were needed under current or past legislation.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para11">Between 1985 and 1999, the relevant legislation was the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1985 and controlled and supervised contamination areas existed when DU contamination levels exceeded 60 and 20 becquerels per square centimetre respectively. Controlled contamination areas are those in which personal protective equipment is generally worn and where washing, monitoring and decontamination facilities are immediately available. Supervised contamination areas present a lower level of risk and the principal requirement is for these areas to be monitored to prove that contamination levels are not increasing towards controlled area levels. From January 2000, the corresponding controlled and supervised contamination area levels were increased to 82 and 27 becquerels per square centimetre respectively. This change results from the introduction of new legislation and a re-evaluation of dose coefficients by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2000]:</i> No formal financial cost/benefit analysis has been applied to the work involving pigs to study the potential benefit of treatment with pentoxifylline following septic shock initiated by haemorrhage and peritonitis at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) at Porton Down. However, balancing 'cost' to the animal and the likely scientific benefits to mankind is a pivotal consideration.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para12">This research was part of an ongoing programme to improve the treatment of military casualties injured by weapons. Haemorrhage was induced by the withdrawal of 40 per cent. of the blood volume and peritonitis by the placement of known quantities of bacteria on a small quantity of sterile faeces within the abdomen. The animals were then resuscitated (blood volume increased) with intravenous fluids, and pentoxifylline was administered.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para13">The pigs were anaesthetised throughout all procedures and never allowed to regain consciousness. The anaesthetised pigs were monitored for 24 hours and those still alive at the end of this period were culled while still under anaesthesia.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2000]:</i> No formal financial cost/benefit analysis has been applied to the work involving the marmoset model to investigate whether a low dose of sarin disrupted performance of behavioural tests at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) at Porton Down. However, balancing 'cost' to the animal and the likely scientific benefits to mankind is a pivotal consideration.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para19">The marmosets lived in established male/female pairs in a housing system of interlinked cages. Behavioural tests were presented daily on a touch-sensitive screen in front of their home cage. Animals were always free to choose whether or not to engage in the task. This test battery was specifically devised to 'bridge the gap' between non-human primate research and human studies. Each correct response was rewarded with a small quantity of banana milkshake which was not routinely fed as part of their varied and nutritionally complete diet.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para20">During performance of the task, the animal's electroencephalography (EEG) was measured by means of a surgically implanted radiotelemetry device. This technique represents a significant refinement in terms of animal welfare and does not involve the restraint of the animal. Once implanted, the data collection system did not interfere with the animals' freedom.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para21">Following administration of the sarin, animals were closely observed by experienced staff and no clinical signs were detected either in the short-term or over the duration of the study. The research team was supported by dedicated animal care staff and a highly experienced veterinary surgeon throughout the study.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para22">The techniques developed in the course of this work represent a significant advance in both animal welfare and scientific quality. This research involving marmosets has demonstrated that exposure to a single, low dose of the nerve agent sarin did not disrupt performance of a complex behavioural test and did not produce significant changes in brain electrical activity. These techniques have more widespread applicability in a number of areas of civilian research, notably in the investigation of neurodegenerative disorders.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para23">All work with animals undergoes an Ethical Review Process and has to demonstrate that as much as possible has been done to replace the procedures with alternatives not using living animals, to reduce numbers of animals used in particular studies, and to refine the procedures to minimise pain, suffering distress or lasting harm prior to the issue of licences to undertake work.

<a name="01220w04.html_para24">All work involving the use of animals at the CBE Porton Down is also undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which is overseen by the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="01220w04.html_para25">In addition to the statutory controls, an independent body, the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (AWAC), reviews the arrangements for animal care and welfare at DERA sites, monitors the research programmes to ensure standards are the highest possible and advises on best practice.

<P>
(4) what plans he has to equip the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyers with launchers enabling them to fire the Tactical Tomahawk missile; and what steps he is taking to procure this.  [143345]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Royal Navy operates Tomahawk Block IIIC missiles. As was demonstrated in Kosovo, Tomahawk Block IIIC missiles are highly effective weapons, which fully meet our requirements for a coercive capability in terms of accuracy, weight of ordnance and the ability to attack the likely target set. At present, we foresee a long-term requirement for this system to be operated by our SSNs.
<P>

<a name="01220w05.html_para0">Following the Kosovo campaign, an additional order of Tomahawk missiles was placed with the US. Upon completion of the outstanding order we will have a full inventory of Block IIIC missiles.
<P>

<a name="01220w05.html_para1">In the event that further Block IIIC missiles were expended during future conflicts, the Tomahawk Block IV missiles (also known as Tactical Tomahawk or Tactom) would represent the only means of procuring additional Tomahawk missiles. At present Tactom is intended only as a vertical launch weapon and therefore would not be suitable for firing from UK SSNs. However, in common with the UK, the US has identified a requirement for a horizontal launch variant of Tactom as not all of its SSNs are fitted with vertical launchers. Initial joint research has demonstrated the feasibility of developing a horizontal launch variant of Tactom.
<P>

<a name="01220w05.html_para2">The development of a horizontal launched variant of Tactom represents a more cost effective route than procuring vertical launchers. Accordingly there are no plans to fit Astute class SSNs with vertical launcher capable of firing Tactom. There are currently no plans to equip the Type 45 destroyer with a land attack capability, however, the design of the Type 45 would allow the incorporation of such a launcher should the requirement arise.

<a name="01220w05.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Subject to approval, we expect to place a contract for Sonar 2087 early in 2001, and for it to be fitted to all Type 23s. Sonar 2087 is a tactical, variable-depth, active and passive sonar system which will operate with the Type 23's existing bow-mounted active Sonar 2050: the former system will provide a long-range picture with the latter filling in the nearer range.
<P>

<a name="01220w05.html_para3">Changes to the planned in-service date of Sonar 2087 were made in recent financial planning rounds, based on careful consideration of competing defence priorities and the need to maintain coherence between Sonar 2087 and the Type 23 refit programme. This is part of our normal process for making best use of the defence budget to meet changing priorities. Subject to completion of contractual negotiations with the successful prime contractor, Sonar 2087 is expected to enter operational service around 2005 when initial trials are complete. The precise shipfitting programme is also subject to contractual negotiations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01220w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Government have approved the Post Office's Strategic Plan for 2000-05. This is a five-year rolling Plan which is updated annually. The Plan represents a key element in the new arm's-length relationship that the Government are establishing with the Post Office in fulfilment of the reforms described in the White Paper published in July 1999. The Post Office will be building on the previous year's Plan and pursuing its strategy of becoming a global player in the distribution market.
<P>

<a name="01220w07.html_para0">Although much has been achieved over the past year, the Post Office recognises that there remains much to do. The market place for postal services is increasingly competitive and there are tough challenges to be faced, 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 2000 : Column: 190W</I><P>
but the Post Office is working to build on current initiatives and to seize commercial opportunities as they arise in the UK and internationally.
<P>

<a name="01220w07.html_para1">The key features of the Strategic Plan are commercially confidential, and as such will not be published. In May this year the Government set the Post Office a return on capital employed target of 13 per cent. for 2000-01, which translated into an operational pre-tax profit target of &#163;392 million for the year. Return on capital employed is defined as profit before interest payable and tax, but after operating interest receivable, divided by operating capital employed. This target excluded the network of post offices, where the report of the Performance and Innovation Unit on the network of post offices was awaited, and the non-operational interest arising from past surpluses held on the Post Office's balance sheet. This target was to be subsumed within the overall post-tax profit target for the Post Office as a whole, as described in the White Paper. The Government have now set a post-tax profit target figure for the group of &#163;260 million for the financial year 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="01220w07.html_para2">As already announced, the 'dividend' that the Government effectively take out of the Post Office is now set at 40 per cent. of the post-tax profits of the business as a whole, and therefore if the Post Office achieves the profit target, this equivalent of a commercial dividend will be &#163;104 million. This is subject to a dividend floor payment which this year will be raised from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the dividend that would be paid if the Post Office meets its overall profit target. The dividend floor payment will therefore be &#163;93 million. The Post Office will not pay dividends until it becomes a plc, but in the meantime will set aside the relevant amount in its reserves.
<P>

<a name="01220w07.html_para3">In order to help the Post Office to plan for the medium term, the Government have also set an indicative financial return for 2002-03 of 13 per cent. return on capital employed in the Post Office's operational business, excluding the network of post offices and any non-operational interest arising from past surpluses.

 The Royal Ulster Constabulary have advised that there continues to be a high threat of attack from dissident republicans over the pre-Christmas period, with the most likely targets being the security force personnel and establishments. Recent events show the potential for the escalation of sectarian attacks. Commercial premises could be subject to incendiary attacks. On 8 December police advised owners of commercial premises to be extra vigilant about the security of their property in the run up to Christmas. The Royal Ulster Constabulary are taking all possible precautions to ensure the safety of the public and premises.

Terrorism relies in part on the availability of funding. Successive Governments have made provision in counter terrorist law to enable the police to tackle this funding. The Terrorism Act, which is due to come into force early next year, carries forward that regime which includes an offence of inviting another to support a terrorist organisation with money or property. It is also an offence to receive or provide money or property for that purpose. Under the Act, the police can also apply for an order of the court to trace terrorist property by seeking customer information from financial institutions.

 Matters related to coroners are the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor, and it is the decision of coroners as to whether or not autopsies are conducted. Having decided that an autopsy is necessary a coroner will normally request the State Pathologist's Department to conduct it. It is not possible to provide the average lengths of time taken to provide coroners with such reports without a considerable diversion of resources. Each case is unique and may involve obtaining toxicological analyses and other inputs from elsewhere.

 Many products consisting of combinations of herbal and other ingredients can currently be sold legally, for example under food or cosmetic law, and we anticipate that this will continue to be the case.

 If the proposals for a directive on traditional medicinal products can be agreed, we expect that it would provide a secure legal basis for regulating a wide range of traditional herbal remedies of the kind currently sold to the public under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968. It is unlikely that the directive would have a direct impact on arrangements whereby herbalists make up and supply the public with herbal remedies following face to face consultation, as permitted under section 12(1) of the Act.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> The Council's new strategy involves updating its overseas network to ensure maximum impact in countries of greatest importance to the UK, and the expansion of new IT-based services, especially in western Europe. In line with this, the Council has announced the closure of subordinate offices in Hamburg, Cologne, Munich, Leipzig and Turin. The closure of the country directorates in Belarus, Ecuador, Lesotho and Swaziland, and the offices in Kaduna, Enugu and Ibadan in Nigeria have also been agreed. Further closures will be announced over the next five years after consultation with the relevant authorities in each country and the staff affected.

There is a radiation hazard, although DU is a low specific activity material as defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which means that its level of radioactivity is lower than most man-made radionuclides; and a chemical toxicity hazard, similar to that posed by other heavy metals such as lead.
<P>

<P>
<a name="01220w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In April 1998 the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales formed a small independent group to review existing policies and legislation in England and Wales concerning the management and conservation of salmon, trout, eels and freshwater fish. The Review Group submitted its report in February 2000, and the Salmon and Freshwater fisheries Review was published in March. Interested individuals and organisations were then invited to comment on the Review.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para11">Over 700 individuals and organisations sent in comments, and these have been taken into account in deciding the Government's response to the Review. The great majority strongly supported the Review's recommendations and conclusions, although concern was expressed about some individual recommendations, in particular one relating to the coarse fish close season on rivers.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para12">The Government intend to respond to all the 195 recommendations in the Review in relation to England, and this detailed response will be placed in the Library of the House, and sent to all hon. Members who have expressed an interest in the Review, after the recess. 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 2000 : Column: 206W</I><P>
The National Assembly for Wales will be responding separately. In the meantime, I would like to outline the key elements of our response.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para13">The Government welcome the Review, which we consider to be a major contribution to the development of modern policies on salmon and freshwater fisheries. It endorses the Review's recommendations on the rationale for Government involvement in the conservation and management of salmon and freshwater fish and accepts the great majority of the Review's recommendations relating to salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation. When parliamentary time permits the Government intend to introduce proposals for new salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation to implement the agreed changes.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para14">The Review recommends a substantial increase in grant-in-aid to fund the Environment Agency's fisheries function. The Government have considered this recommendation with particular care. We note that pressures on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food budget made it necessary to reduce grant-in-aid in England by &#163;1.5 million in 2001-02; grant-in-aid paid to the Agency by the Ministry next year will therefore fall to &#163;3.2 million.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para15">The Government have, however, now decided, in the light of the Review's recommendation, to increase grant-in-aid in England by &#163;3 million a year for the years 2002-03 and 2003-04; this will mean that grant-in-aid for each of these years will be set at &#163;6.2 million--an increase of 30 per cent. on the level of grant-in-aid in the current year. It will be for the Environment Agency to decide how these additional funds should be spent, but the Government have identified two priority areas: conserving and restoring salmon stocks and improving controls over unauthorised transfers of coarse and non-native fish.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para16">Salmon stocks in England are currently at historic low levels and the Agency will use the extra funds to further the implementation of the Salmon Action Plans on all 47 main salmon rivers in England, with the aim of increasing the number of rivers in which salmon stocks meet the conservation limit.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para17">Coarse fish imported illegally from outside the UK and unauthorised fish transfers can spread fish diseases to wild stocks; unauthorised introduction into waters in England of non-native fish species also poses a threat to native species and to biodiversity. The Agency will aim to secure a significant reduction in the number of unauthorised transfers of fish.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para18">In allocating additional grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency the Government accept the Review's conclusion that the Environment Agency's fisheries functions continue to be funded from both grant-in-aid and rod and net licence income. We also endorse the Review Group's view that the Agency's work on coarse fish and on trout should benefit from grant-in-aid, in particular when new work is being undertaken. We expect the Agency to devote around one third of the &#163;3 million increase in grant-in-aid to work on coarse fish.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para19">As the Review Group points out, Government spending on salmon and freshwater fisheries is not restricted to Environment Agency Grant-in-Aid; these fisheries also benefit substantially from other forms of Government expenditure. Projects for habitat improvement and to 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 2000 : Column: 207W</I><P>
develop salmon and freshwater fisheries are, for example, eligible for assistance under agri-environment schemes and the England Rural Development Programme. The Environment Agency and Sport England are continuing to liaise closely to identify any specific projects where two organisations can collaborate together.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para20">The Review recommends that the existing phase out of mixed stock salmon net fisheries should be accelerated by offering compensation to netsmen to encourage them to leave these fisheries on a voluntary basis as soon as possible. It also recommends that the Government should provide substantial pump-priming funds to launch the necessary compensation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para21">The Government welcome the Review's endorsement of its policy on mixed stock fisheries. We agree that it would be desirable to speed up the current phase out, on a voluntary basis, and have decided to contribute to the cost involved. We will contribute a maximum of &#163;750,000 for this purpose, payable in the years 2002-03 and 2003-04. However, the Government share the Review Group's view that those who benefit from the phasing out of mixed stock fisheries, particularly riparian owners and anglers in both England and Scotland, should contribute a major share of the cost. The Government's contribution to the costs of a compensation scheme will, therefore, be conditional on private interests raising a matching sum.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para22">The Government will discuss the details of the proposed compensation scheme with interested parties. We propose that the scheme should initially focus on the largest mixed stock fishery, the north-east salmon drift net fishery.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para23">The Review contains a number of recommendations on angling close seasons; these attracted more comments than any other changes proposed by the Review Group. A substantial majority of these expressed opposition to the recommendation that the coarse fish close season should be abolished on rivers. The Government endorse the general approach on close seasons proposed by the Review Group, and have already, in line with the Group's recommendations, confirmed byelaws lifting the close season in most canals. As to the coarse fish close season on rivers, the Government agree with the Environment Agency's view that any change to the coarse fish close season on rivers should be based on science, that at present there is inadequate information on rivers and that no decision on lifting the close season should be considered until further evidence is available.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para24">The Review makes recommendations on a variety of other matters that can affect the conservation of fish in freshwater, including agriculture, forestry, water abstraction, land drainage and flood defence, and predation, most of which the Government have accepted.
<P>

<a name="01220w11.html_para25">A number of the recommendations in the Review relate to the duties of the Environment Agency. The Government note that the Agency is currently subject to a Financial, Management and Policy Review. This will be a comprehensive review that will ask fundamental questions on the purpose, functions and organisation of the Agency. In these circumstances, the Government have not yet reached a decision on the recommendations in question; we will determine our response to them in the light of the outcome of the FMPR.

 Residents of the Channel Islands are eligible for the &#163;5 Accommodation for Residential Care television licence scheme and the 50 per cent. reduction in the licence fee for registered blind people. They are not currently eligible for free television licences for the over-75s, though the Guernsey authorities have announced their intention in principle to introduce such a concession. Unlike the Accommodation for Residential Care scheme and the reduction for blind people, which are funded from within the television licensing system, the cost of the over-75 concession is met from public funds. Whether or not to fund such a concession in the Channel Islands is therefore a matter for the Island authorities.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December, 2000]:</i> The information provided in this answer is for the period up to 30 November 2000. As of that date, a total of 29,253 prisoners had been placed on Home Detention Curfew since the scheme commenced on 28 January 1999.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para9">The original offences committed by prisoners released under the scheme during the period, the number of prisoners convicted of each specific offence, the average sentence received and served for those offences, and the average period spent on the scheme in respect of prisoners convicted of each specific offence are shown in Table 1. The data are taken from the Prison Service's inmate information system, based on the data recorded by each prison. The table provides as detailed a breakdown as is possible from central records.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para10">As at 30 November, a total of 1,019 prisoners placed on the scheme had breached the conditions of their curfew. A breakdown of this number showing the original offences committed by those curfewees is shown in Table 2. My answer of 13 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 535W, indicated that the total at 30 September was 854. This was erroneous; the correct figure was 949, as indicated in the table which was referred to in the answer and placed in the Library on that date.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para11">Information on curfewees whose licences are revoked and who disappear before being recaptured is not held centrally. However, information is held on the number of curfewees unlawfully at large at any one time. On 30 November, there were 58 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large. This represents fewer than 4 per cent. of the total number of revocations.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para12">Details of the offences committed by those 58 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large on 30 November 2000 can be found in Table 3.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para13">As at 30 November 2000, 1,418 curfewees had their licences revoked, using the powers available to the Secretary of State under sections 38A(1) and 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The reasons for revocation were as follows:

<a name="01220w13.html_para18">Prisoners whose current sentence is in respect of an offence committed before 1 January 1999 are not liable to be recalled under section 39 of the Act. In such cases, where the curfewee has breached the requirements of probation supervision or where they have committed a further offence and it has not been possible to revoke their licence under section 38A of the Act, the breach may be referred to the courts under section 38(1) of the Act. The total number of such cases referred to the courts is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para19">A breakdown of the original offences committed by the 1,418 recalled curfewees, together with a breakdown of the reasons for their recall, is at Table 4.

Where a curfewee has been charged with more than one offence, these have been shown separately.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para21">Table 6 gives a breakdown of cases involving prisoners placed on the scheme who are known to have been convicted, cautioned or have a prosecution pending in respect of an offence committed while on Home Detention Curfew which is similar in character to the index offence or offences for which they were originally convicted.
<P>

<a name="01220w13.html_para22">The scheme is designed to ensure a better transition for short-term offenders between custody and the community. Prisoners are placed on Home Detention Curfew only after a careful risk assessment and the safety of the public is paramount at all times.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> The review I am conducting is of the operation of the voucher scheme for destitute asylum seekers, looking at the evidence for the various criticisms that have been levelled at the scheme. Our asylum policy is aimed at ensuring that we fully discharge our international commitments to genuine asylum seekers, while at the same time minimising the attractiveness of the United Kingdom for those whose applications for asylum are unfounded. In determining what action to take as a result of the vouchers' review, we shall have regard to this aim. We have no plans to change the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Business Plan at this stage.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has recently announced the provisional police funding settlement for 2001-02. Under the settlement, West Midlands police authority is set to receive central Government supported funding of &#163;409.8 million, an increase of &#163;17.1 million or 4.3 per cent. over 2000-01. West Midlands will also receive in 2001-02 (on present estimates) &#163;6.87 million from the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) in addition to the &#163;2.67 million expected in 2000-01. Details of funding for 2002-03 is not yet available but will include the annual cost of earlier recruitment under the fund. The CFF is a targeted initiative that will allow forces to recruit additional officers over and above any previously planned recruitment levels. Under this scheme the West Midlands will be able to recruit an additional 523 officers over the years 2000-01 to 2002-03. There is flexibility within the CFF for forces to accelerate or defer part of their allocation between 2000-01 and 2001-02. West Midlands police have bid to accelerate 49 CFF recruits from their 2001-02 allocation into 2000-01. Funding for the CFF is provisional and is dependent on forces meeting the continuation criteria.

<a name="01220w14.html_para5">West Midlands police authority has also benefited this year from a &#163;3.3 million grant from the &#163;20 million anti-robbery fund, a targeted initiative to tackle robbery in metropolitan areas.

<a name="01220w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) will provide three levels of disclosure--Basic, Standard and Enhanced. In all cases, application may be made only by the individual in question. In a Basic level case, the individual may apply directly to the CRB. In other cases, the application must be endorsed by a person registered with the CRB for this purpose, whose function at this stage is to confirm that the application meets the relevant criteria. Often, this will be an employer or a voluntary organisation, but it may be someone acting on their behalf.
<P>

<a name="01220w15.html_para14">It is expected that the registration process will commence in April, that the issue of Standard and Enhanced disclosures (which will principally relate to persons working with children and vulnerable adults) will start next summer, and that the issue of Basic level disclosures will begin in the summer of 2002, when the CRB will be fully operational.
<P>

<a name="01220w15.html_para15">Disclosure documents will be distinctive in appearance, will set out the information as clearly as possible, and will incorporate measures to reduce the risk of forgery. Work is continuing to determine the costs of the Bureau, and the level of fees. The Bureau will operate to demanding service standards, including the time taken to supply documents. Standards will be set as soon as possible, and will be made public. Guidance will be produced for employers, employees and others using the CRB's service. This will explain how the service will operate, the importance of safeguarding personal information, how the CRB's service can supplement good recruitment practice, and the arrangements for any appeal or complaint.

<P>
<a name="01220w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Age-related National Insurance rebates to members of Contracted-out Money Purchase Schemes and to Appropriate Personal Pensions are currently capped at 9 per cent. of earnings between the Lower and Upper Earnings Limits to restrain the costs to public finances. At that level it enables most people who were already contracted-out when age-related rebates were introduced to continue to stay in their pension scheme.

<UL>(2) what discussions he has had with interested organisations and representative groups about the payment of social security benefits to recipients who are unlikely to have any form of bank account after the proposed change to the ACT system from 2003.  [143587]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="01220w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 When, in 2003, we move to paying benefits directly into bank accounts by Automated Credit Transfer (ACT), we recognise that there will be some people who will be unable to be paid by this method. For these, we are considering what alternative simple electronic money transmission system, which could be accessed at post offices, may be commercially available.
<P>

<a name="01220w17.html_para0">We have had a number of approaches from organisations that are interested in providing this alternative payment system and have listened to their proposals on a commercial in confidence basis. No decisions have been made or agreements reached.
<P>

<a name="01220w17.html_para1">As part of routine liaison with representative groups the Department has discussed a range of issues including how to pay those benefit recipients who are unable to be paid by ACT.

 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> Publicly planned funding for higher education is to increase by &#163;412 million in 2001-02, &#163;268 million in 2002-03 and &#163;298 million in 2003-04. The increases in contributions to fees by students or their parents on current planned fee income projections, taking into account increases in student numbers and inflation, are accrued to be &#163;48 million, &#163;26 million, and &#163;24 million, representing 11.6 per cent. of the total increase in 2001-02, 9.7 per cent. in 2002-03 and 8 per cent. in 2003-04.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> Of the members initially appointed to the 47 local Learning and Skills Councils, 46 per cent. have current or recent business experience. In a number of areas, vacancies have been left to allow for additional appointments over the coming months to strengthen further the representation of business people on local Councils, and the representation of other interests as appropriate. When all of these further appointments have been made, we expect that the overall 46 per cent. figure will remain broadly unchanged, and that business representation will be at least 40 per cent. on each local Learning and Skills Council. The initial and expected percentages for each individual local Learning and Skills Council, together with the number of vacancies left open for business people, are contained in the following table:

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> The Department does not make direct education provision for those with autistic spectrum disorders. It is for local education authorities, schools and other education and training providers to arrange suitable provision for all those with learning difficulties and disabilities, including those with autism, in collaboration, where appropriate, with other service providers from the statutory, voluntary and independent sectors. The Employment Service is responsible for helping those looking for work, including jobseekers who are disabled. Although there are no programmes specifically for people with autism, there are a range of mainstream and specialist disability programmes which can help people with the disorder.

 The cost of the introduction of the ITT numeracy skills tests in summer 2000, and development work on the computerised ITT skills tests in numeracy, literacy and ICT for introduction in 2001 thus far, is &#163;2.45 million. This will ensure that all new teachers have the necessary knowledge and skills in these key areas.

 The level of support available to students in 2001-02 will be 2.4 per cent. higher than for 2000-01, in line with forecast price increases. I am today placing a Memorandum in the Library giving details of the new loan, grant and fee rates for 2001-02. These rates will be incorporated in the Education (Student Support) Regulations, which cover support for eligible students under the current arrangements, and in the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations and Education (Student Loans) Amendment Regulations, which cover the small number of students who are still eligible for support under the previous arrangements. These Regulations will all be laid before Parliament in due course.

 During the development of the climate change levy, the Government have received many representations from business and other interested parties and these views have helped to refine the design of the levy. The financial impact on any sector will depend on a number of factors, including its future energy consumption, the level of employment, eligibility for discounts, use of renewable or combined heat and power energy, and take up of enhanced capital allowances.

<P>
<a name="01220w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Budget 2000 announced that the aggregates levy would be introduced from April 2002 at a prudent and cautious rate of &#163;1.60 per tonne to ensure that the price of aggregates extraction better reflects its social and environmental costs. It will be introduced at a uniform rate in order to keep it simple and to give a clear signal to purchasers of primary aggregates to use more sustainable materials. The Quarry Products Association has proposed at some future stage a lower rate of levy for quarries that generate lower environmental costs. Officials will be discussing this proposal with the Association.
