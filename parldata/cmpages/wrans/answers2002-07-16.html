Skin test results are confirmed by microbiological culture of tissues removed at post mortem. The main time delay in getting results from the culture of mycobacteria taken from post mortem samples is due to the time it takes for the mycobacteria to multiply sufficiently to be identified.

<P>
<UL>(2) pursuant to her answer of 1 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 71, on fishing, what assessment she has made of the impact of the United Kingdom not meeting the required targets set under MAGP IV in the pelagic sector on the quota allocations from 1 January 2003 for <i>(a)</i> pelagic species and <i>(b)</i> white fish species.

 The UK has chosen the option to set MAGP IV targets for the pelagic segment of the fleet in terms of fishing effort; and we expect those effort targets to be achieved at the end of 2002, as they were at the end of 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what reports she has received from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate regarding the release of radioactive substances into the groundwater under Sellafield in Cumbria from tanks; and if she will make a statement;  [65062]
<P>

<P>
<a name="20716w01.html_spnew12"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I have not received any reports from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate about the release of radioactive substances into groundwater under Sellafield. I am aware, however, that technetium-99 (Tc-99) has been detected in groundwater from boreholes in and around the Sellafield site. I understand that the likely source of the Tc-99 leakage is from the B24I sludge storage tanks.
<P>

<a name="20716w01.html_para2">The Environment Agency has carried out an assessment of the radiological impact of the levels of Tc-99 detected and is satisfied that this would be insignificant. Recent borehole data from BNFL supports this conclusion. The groundwater at Sellafield is not used for drinking water supplies.
<P>

<a name="20716w01.html_para3">The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Environment Agency, respectively, have asked BNFL to undertake further monitoring of Tc-99 levels on and off the Sellafield site. The regulators will consider whether

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Our latest estimates relate to 2000, and suggest that in that year UK farmers received in total &#163;4.9 billion of support. In addition to the direct payments and market support measures that fall directly to the EU and UK budgets, this includes the effect on farmers' incomes of the higher prices paid by consumers as a result of the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the reasons for the maintenance of the foot and mouth disease livestock movement restrictions, with specific reference to the 20-day standstill rule.  [67199]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is firm veterinary and scientific advice in support of the present movement controls which are designed to protect against the rapid spread of any new incursion of disease.
<P>

<a name="20716w02.html_para0">The 20 day standstill is an important element of these controls for two reasons. Firstly, it allows time for the disease to become evident in animals brought on to a holding and so improves the prospect of identifying disease on infected premises before animals move off. Secondly, it also prevents potentially infected animals being moved off the holding during the 20 day period and so slows the rate of spread of any undetected disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans there are to increase the number of ports that will allow the import and export of animals that have been vaccinated against rabies.  [67581]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Animals subject to the Rabies (Importation of Dogs, Cats and Other Mammals) Order 1974, as amended, must enter the UK through Dover (Eastern Docks), Harwich (Parkeston Quay), Hull, Portsmouth or Southampton. If the animals are vaccinated against rabies but do not meet the requirements of the Pet Travel Scheme they must go into quarantine.
<P>

<a name="20716w02.html_para1">However, dogs and cats which fully meet the requirements of the Pet Travel Scheme may enter England, without going into quarantine, through the ports at Dover, Portsmouth, Harwich, Poole and Plymouth. These ports are the ones used by carriers on routes approved by this Department. My Department will consider applications for approval from transport companies for routes into England using other ports. It is currently processing an application for a route which would use Newhaven. Whether transport companies choose to seek approval is a commercial and operational decision for them.

 The Secretary of State does not hold such a map.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Independent Scientific Group for Cattle TB (ISG) advise that it is too early for an analysis of results. It is a basic rule for scientific trials that results are not published prematurely. It has however been possible to complete a preliminary analysis of the risk factors associated with cattle TB, and this is set out in the ISG's Third Report, available in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="20716w02.html_para3">A summary of the completed work for each triplet is shown on DEFRA's website at www.defra.gov.uk/ animalh/tb/point5/p5prog.

 The Department recently consulted on draft guidance to local highway authorities in relation to the requirement in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to prepare and review rights of way

improvement plans. Once the relevant provisions are in force, later this year, local highway authorities will be required to take a strategic look at how the local network of rights of way takes into account the needs of the public and to prepare a statement of the action that they propose to take to improve the network, including creating new rights of way where they are shown to be needed.
<P>

<a name="20716w02.html_para4">In January this year we issued a consultation paper on proposals for regulations under section 16 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 which enables landowners voluntarily to give people a statutory right of access to their land. The consultation ended on 15 April and we are presently considering the responses from landowners and others. The Department is also working closely with the Forestry Commission which, earlier this year, arranged a number of seminars for private woodland owners on the provision of access under section 16. In addition, private landowners are encouraged to allow permissive public access under DEFRA's agri-environment schemes. The provisions are currently the subject of a public consultation that began on 8 July and will end on 27 September 2002.

 I recently published draft guidance arising from rights of way provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The draft guidance encourages local highway authorities to take positive management measures, such as consideration of the use of lighting and schemes to encourage informal surveillance to counter problems of criminal activity on public rights of way.
<P>

<a name="20716w02.html_para5">Where rights of way are facilitating high levels of crime in built up areas the provisions that are covered in the guidance will enable such rights of way to be diverted or extinguished.

[70041]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w02.html_spnew10"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government announced the plan to establish a National Access Database in the Rural White Paper "Our countryside: the future a fair deal for rural England" in November 2000. The Countryside Agency has commissioned consultants to look at the feasibility of establishing such a database. The feasibility study is being funded from within the Agency's annual grant in aid settlement. The Agency will publish a research note in September 2002 and use the findings of the study to make recommendations on how the project should proceed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2002 : Column 138W</I><P>
the UK Government did not support the development of mandatory and indicative targets for biofuels in the relevant EU draft directive.  [69340]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20716w03.html_para0">In common with the majority of other European Union member states, the UK Government do not support the European Commission's proposals for mandatory targets applied uniformly to every state, as originally proposed by the European Commission in the Biofuels Directive. In order to maintain the UK's ability to set national policy on the basis of the UK's own domestic circumstances, the Government favour the adoption of flexible, indicative targets; an approach endorsed by the European Scrutiny Committees of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20716w03.html_para1">The Government actively support the use of transport biofuels, in particular through the 20 pence per litre reduction in fuel duty on biodiesel&#151;due to come into effect shortly&#151;and through the further round of the Green Fuels Challenge, offering zero duty for pilots demonstrating innovative technologies for environmentally beneficial fuels.

<BR>
3. To ensure the UK's objectives are reflected in the revised Council Directive 91/414/EEC and to maintain our international reputation as a leading regulatory authority.
<BR>
<i>Efficiency</i>
<BR>
1. To implement a Quality system by the end of December 2002 that enables an improvement in quality and efficiency and which takes account of priorities identified in the 2001 Customer Satisfaction Survey.
<BR>
2. To deliver 3 per cent. efficiency savings through the combination of achieving reductions to processing times for applications for approval and through savings in cost of outputs.
<BR>
<i>Financial performance</i>
<BR>
1. To recover from industry and Government the full economic cost (as calculated according to resource accounting principles) of its services.

 I am delighted that the Royal Society have today published the report of their independent Scientific Review of Infectious Diseases in Livestock. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20716w03.html_para4">This report was commissioned by the Government following the unprecedented outbreak of foot and mouth disease last year. I am very grateful to Professor Sir Brian Follett and his committee for producing such a thorough and excellent report in such a short space of time. This is a very significant contribution to our work to strengthen our ability to guard against and deal with animal disease.
<P>

<a name="20716w03.html_para5">I welcome the importance that the report places on the livestock industry in this country and Great Britain having animal disease free status.

<a name="20716w03.html_para7">The report's recommendations will be of crucial importance in developing the Government's emergency preparedness for controlling animal diseases, and we will need to study these closely, in particular the recommended approach to vaccination against foot and mouth disease. The Government has never rejected vaccination as an option in the fight against foot and mouth. The report recognises that there are aspects of vaccination, in particular trade and technical issues, which are not yet resolved, but which can and should be resolved. Even then, vaccination will not necessarily be a panacea and will not necessarily be right in all circumstances. The report notes that, even with emergency vaccination in place, culling would still be necessary.

<a name="20716w03.html_para8">I welcome the Royal Society's endorsement of the need to take forward the work we have in hand on a greatly improved contingency plan for foot and mouth. Its findings on biosecurity and animal movements will also be of particular importance.

The guidelines explain how to calculate whether a hedge is likely to block out too much light from a garden and from the main rooms of a house. These scientifically based tests might carry some weight with hedge owners and help them to understand the impact of their hedge. As a result, they might be more willing to negotiate with neighbours.
<P>

<a name="20716w03.html_para13">We are now preparing a leaflet for members of the public, advising them how they might approach their neighbours to try to agree a solution to their hedge problems.

<a name="20716w04.html_para2">The provision of parking facilities, including park-and-ride, is a matter for the local highway authority and rail operators. In addition to the major schemes, a number of smaller schemes have been implemented or proposed by the local authorities as part of their local transport strategies. These have included proposals for the extension of existing sites or new sites for both bus-based and rail-based schemes. The smaller schemes as presented in the local transport plans annual progress reports submitted in July 2001 are summarised in the table. Details of the smaller schemes, including proposed timetables are not kept centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what resources the Government will be putting into rural stations for services and maintenance of stations in the next three years.  [69396]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Station maintenance is funded from the generality of Railtrack's income. Rural stations and services can also benefit from the &#163;430 million funding available through the Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) operated by the Strategic Rail Authority. Extended in December 2001 to run for 10 years, the RPP fund is designed to assist in the provision of new or enhanced local and regional rail services or facilities.

<P>

<a name="20716w04.html_para3">Any major changes to the junction between the A404(M) and the M4 are subject to the Thames Valley Multi-Modal Study. In the interim, it is proposed to widen the immediate approach from the A404(M) to the junction roundabout as a low cost measure to decrease queue lengths and increase throughput on A404(M).

 Figures for Great Britain from the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) show that there were 78,577 buses and coaches with nine or more seats registered on 31 December 1997. On 31 March 2002, the equivalent figure was 89,867, an increase of 11,290.
<P>

<a name="20716w05.html_para0">In the same period, 31,386 buses and coaches were newly registered. The average age of the local service bus fleet has fallen from 9.4 years in 1997 to 8.4 years in 2001 and the bus industry is committed to reducing it to 8.0 years and maintaining it at that level in line with the Government's 10-year plan for transport. From 31 December 2000 all new buses used on local or scheduled services have been accessible to disabled people including wheelchair users.
<P>

<a name="20716w05.html_para1">Bus service provision in rural areas has been enhanced since 1998 by additional funding to local authorities in the form of Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) and Rural Bus Challenge (RBC). RBSG funding for 2001&#150;04 is &#163;138 million and is supporting 1,800 new and enhanced services in rural areas. The RBC competitions have provided &#163;69.8 million to enable 213 innovative local authority schemes for rural communities to be introduced. Since 2001 the Urban Bus Challenge, targeted at urban communities suffering from high levels of deprivation, has resulted in awards of &#163;15.3 million to 32 schemes in 24 local authority areas.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20716w06.html_para1">The National Land Information Services (NLIS) is a project, which has been developed and is run by the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) for local government.
<P>

<a name="20716w06.html_para2">NLIS is an important part of the Government's policy to improve the home buying process. In particular it has the potential of significantly improving the turnaround times for conveyancing searches. We have written to local authorities drawing the benefits of both NLIS and the associated National Land and Property Gazetteer project to their attention. I have placed a copy of that letter in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="20716w06.html_para3">From information provided to us by the IDeA as at 28 May 2002, we understand for local authorities in England that: 117 of the 388 authorities are electronically connected to NLIS with 81 authorities connected at Level 2, and 36 at Level 3.
<P>

<a name="20716w06.html_para4">From information provided to us by the IDeA as at 28 May 2002, we understand for local authorities in England and Wales that: there are 132 local land and property gazetteers (LLPGs) produced by local authorities which are linked to the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG); with a further 117 gazetteers in prospect to be linked to the NLPG in the near future; and a further 33 local authorities known to be developing LLPGs.
<P>

<a name="20716w06.html_para5">There is no direct funding available from Government for local authorities to participate with NLIS. The Government are providing &#163;155 million over the next 



<P>

two years to local authorities and to partnerships of local authorities targeted towards helping authorities electronically enabling all their services.
<P>

<a name="20716w06.html_para6">Fees for searches of the local land charges register are fixed by statutory instrument in accordance with the Local Land Charges Act 1975. Otherwise, it is for local authorities themselves to set income targets and fees for dealing with conveyancers' inquiries. However they must do so taking account of the cost of providing the service.

 The contractor for the Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon programme, Saab Bofors Dynamics, estimates that a total of 520 jobs will be created or sustained in the United Kingdom as a result of this contract. The timing of the creation of these posts and their permanency is a matter for the contractor and as such I cannot comment specifically. However, work on the programme has now started and production for the UK is expected to be complete by 2010. This could be extended if the contractor wins further orders from other customers.

<P>
<a name="20716w07.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Skill Force scheme forms part of the Ministry of Defence's contribution to wider Government social exclusion policies. The initiative aims to prevent young people from feeling long-term disaffection with school and society. It is currently being piloted in 11 areas and in 47 schools in England and Scotland.
<P>

<a name="20716w07.html_para0">An integral part of the Skill Force pilot scheme has been rigorous and independent evaluation by the British Market Research Bureau. The most recent evaluation report, based on the two original schemes that started in September 2000 in Newcastle and Norfolk, has been completed. The report has shown that Skill Force has helped to maintain attendance rates of over 90 per cent. among children who would otherwise have been expected to display sharply declining attendance, sometimes leading to exclusion through years 10 and 11. Exclusions among participating children in these schools have been reduced by 72 per cent. compared with those predicted by the head teachers at the start of the scheme. A copy of the full report will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20716w07.html_para1">The positive results from the independent evaluation have encouraged DfES to work with the MOD in offering Skill Force more widely. In response to the Government's Street Crime Initiative, Skill Force is one of the schemes 11 local education authorities have been invited to consider to help them to deliver part of DfES's Behaviour Improvement Programme. The LEAs concerned have all been in discussions with the MOD and a final decision on locations and schools is expected to be made in the next month. In addition, discussions are currently being held with a view to extending the pilot scheme to Wales. A decision is expected shortly.

 The Eurofighter In Service Date (ISD) is dependent on industry's ability to deliver an aircraft that meets the nation's requirements.

<P>
<a name="20716w08.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The type 45 destroyer has been designed with substantial weight and space margins to enable its capability to be upgraded through life. At present, no Ministry of Defence studies have been done to assess its specific suitability for a Ballistic Missile Defence role.

 The type 45 will be a versatile destroyer capable of contributing to world-wide maritime and joint operations in multi-threat environments and providing a specialist air warfare capability. With regard to the planned capabilities and systems for the warship, I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 24 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 232, to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies). As the design of the type 45 progresses, opportunities to upgrade the ship's capability are being identified and acted upon. During the

 The Defence Housing Executive has been set challenging targets each year since its establishment as an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Defence in 1999. In 2001&#150;02 these targets were as follows:
<P>

<a name="20716w08.html_para0">

<BR>
<i>Key Target 1</i>
<BR>
To house at least 72 per cent. of families in accommodation that matches their entitlement by posting date or on return to Great Britain from overseas; and at least 93 per cent. within 28 days of their required date.
<BR>
<i>Key Target 2</i>
<BR>
Less than 5 per cent. of occupants should experience significant defects within 14 days of moving in.
<BR>
<i>Key Target 3</i>
<BR>
To complete the planned upgrade of 2,400 properties by 31 March 2002 as part of the programme to upgrade core stock by November 2005.
<BR>
<i>Key Target 4</i>
<BR>
To complete at least 95 per cent. of emergency repairs within 24 hours of notification; at least 90 per cent. of urgent repairs within five working days of notification; at least 95 per cent. of routine repairs within two months of notification.
<BR>
<i>Key Target 5</i>
<BR>
To reduce the management margin progressively towards 10 per cent. by November 2005, better to balance supply and demand, while delivering other key targets.

<P>

<a name="20716w08.html_para1">All the above targets have been met except that key target 4 on repairs indicates a slight shortfall in performance on urgent and emergency orders, although urgent repairs were considerably improved over the previous year. Targets for routine repairs were met.

The cash figures in the table show the PE/DPA operating costs for each of the years in question. There have been various structural changes over these years; accounting conventions have also changed with the move from cash to resource budgets. It has not been possible to adjust the figures fully to reflect these changes. Cash figures for 2001&#150;02 have yet to be finalised.

<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para1">Mineworkers and their families will obviously feel great disappointment at the news that production at the Selby complex will be phased out over the next 20 months. The chief executive of UK Coal, Gordon McPhie, said today that


<BR>
'there was no prospect of the Selby complex becoming viable'.

<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para2">Our analysis supports this conclusion: the independent review undertaken on our behalf by IMC Group Consulting Ltd. has endorsed UK Coal's assessment that there is little prospect for a later closure date, concluding that there is now an inevitability of a cessation of production at the complex. Seeking to prolong the life of the pit would be hugely expensive, and become increasingly so over time, for no long term gain. Therefore it seems to be unavoidable that the mine will have to close, and it would make little sense to seek to delay this by paying extra money to the pit. I very much regret this situation.
<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para3">I am committed to providing for the welfare of Selby's mineworkers and their families. The Government have worked closely with UK Coal and the local Member of Parliament, my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan), and are today announcing a substantial closure package for regeneration and retraining, on top of an extended redundancy settlement. UK Coal's current redundancy agreements end in March 2003. UK Coal wanted to extend the current redundancy terms to cover the whole period of job losses at Selby, but were unable to bear the full costs of doing so at a time when it is making substantial losses and when such a large programme of redundancies is in prospect. We will contribute &#163;10 million to enable Selby miners to receive the pre-privatisation "British Coal" redundancy terms.
<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para4">I can also announce a multi-agency Task Force to combat the impact of the pit closures in the Selby coalfield to be led by Yorkshire Forward member, Lord Haskins.

<a name="20716w10.html_para15">All payments are subject to agreement from the European Commission. No further coal or steel redundancy schemes will be put in place by the Government once the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty has expired.
<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para16">We have the most efficient coal industry in Europe, but to date European rules have prevented us from supporting viable investment projects through Regional Selective Assistance. My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Construction, has therefore secured agreement at a European level to the flexibility to pay investment aid for pits that have a viable future and we will shortly be consulting on the case for introducing such a scheme in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para17">Such a scheme could allow for coal to be treated on a level playing field with other industries. We need to be clear that any new scheme will be cost-effective and make a real contribution to the capacity of the industry to exploit viable reserves of coal in the UK. As part of this analysis we will also commission an independent study of the remaining reserves at existing deep mines to help identify where investment support might be directed. Subject to the conclusions of our work and to the availability of resources we may be in a position to make specific proposals by the end of the year. The details of any scheme will of course need to be agreed with the European Commission consistent with the new EU regime.
<P>

<a name="20716w10.html_para18">I am also announcing a targeted extension of the current operating aid scheme, to the end of 2002, in order to help secure the long-term future of viable mines under exceptional short-term pressure and will consult on the details shortly. Aid has been paid under the current scheme on the understanding that recipients are viable without aid beyond July 2002, so a general extension of the scheme would not be appropriate. However real concerns have been raised about the risk that short term pressures at a small number of pits may force operators to change existing mining plans in such a way as to close off for good access to significant and otherwise viable reserves of coal. I therefore intend to seek the European Commission's agreement to a modified extension of the current subsidy scheme targeted to address these specific concerns.

 So far approximately 1.2 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries.

We are also supporting a number of other humanitarian programmes which will help to create an environment for the sustainable return of both refugees and IDPs, including the United Nations-led programme of mine clearance and mine awareness in Afghanistan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w14.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Chancellor announced yesterday a significant increase in the combined budget for child care, early years and Sure Start, rising to &#163;1.5 billion in 2005&#150;06. This includes a more than doubling of investment in child care by 2005&#150;06, following an inter-departmental review of child care co-ordinated by the Performance and Innovation Unit.
<P>

<a name="20716w14.html_para2">The extra investment will support the expansion of child care places across the country, and the integration of good quality child care with early years education, family support and health services through a network of children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas.
<P>

<a name="20716w14.html_para3">In keeping with this new focus on integration, responsibility for early years education, child care and Sure Start will be brought within one inter-departmental unit based within the Department for Education and Skills.

<P>

<a name="20716w14.html_para4">This new inter-departmental unit will report to a new Minister for Sure Start, early years and child care, who will be jointly appointed to the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions, to ensure that our early years and child care vision delivers on both our educational and employment objectives. I have asked Baroness Ashton, who led the inter- departmental review of child care, to take on this role.
<P>

<a name="20716w14.html_para5">Baroness Ashton will report to a new cross- departmental ministerial group on Sure Start, early years and child care. This Group will be a sub-Committee of MISC9, the Cabinet sub-Committee on Children's Services. The focus on health has been vital to the Sure Start programmes already up and running. To ensure that this is maintained, the sub-committee will be chaired by the Minister for Public Health. The sub-committee's other members will include the Paymaster General and the Minister for Disabled People.
<P>

<a name="20716w14.html_para6">The Secretary of State for Education and Skills will continue to speak on these issues in Cabinet. At junior ministerial level, the Minister for Disabled People will answer questions in the House of Commons.

 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> The European Commission co-funds, with Universities, courses and academic posts in relevant subjects via its Jean Monnet project. The project did not operate last academic year, but according to the Commission website, this programme contributed funding towards 94 academic posts and 209 course modules in UK universities in the year 2000. There will be another round of the project this year. The posts supported are referred to by the Commission as 'Chairs' but are not always professorships. Academic institutions make their own appointments, which are then subject to approval by the Commission. Further information about the Jean Monnet project and the activities it supports can be found on the European Commission website www.europa.eu.in/ comm/education

 Most provision for the education of children with special needs (SEN) is included within general revenue grant support for local authorities. The Education Standard Spending Assessment formula through which this general support is distributed allows for different levels of additional educational need, between authorities, but does not specifically allocate funding for SEN needs. In practice, about 11 per cent. of local authority schools expenditure is attributable to SEN and to other "special" kinds of provision such as pupil referral units. In addition to general grant support, the Government pay specific grant through the Standards Fund which will support &#163;91 million of expenditure on SEN in 2002&#150;03. This specific support is distributed to authorities on the following basis: 70 per cent. on full time equivalent pupil numbers in all LEA maintained schools and 30 per cent. by entitlement to free school meals.

<a name="20716w17.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he plans to take steps to collect centrally information on <i>(a)</i> the proportion of individuals with a diagnosis of severe mental illness who are in employment and <i>(b)</i> trends in the prevalence of employment among such individuals.  [68126]

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The Department is taking steps to ensure that this information is collected for both local and national monitoring. Local services have been asked to ensure that written care plans for people with mental health problems on the enhanced level of the care programme approach show plans to secure suitable employment or other occupational activity. The outcomes implementation programme and the implementation of the mental health minimum data set will ensure that these data are collected routinely.

<a name="20716w17.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact on black and ethnic minority groups of the proposals contained in the draft Mental Health Bill.  [68665]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w17.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government acknowledge the inequalities that people from black and minority ethnic groups face in mental health services and the over-representation, in particular, of young black men in the mental health system has been well documented (Mental Health Act Commission Biennial Report 2001). The mental health task force has been given a specific remit to look at black and ethnic mental health and are developing a strategy that will address the provision of services to people from these groups, while the proposals contained in the draft Mental Health Bill will offer individuals greater safeguards of their rights.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w17.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the effect he estimates extending compulsion, as envisaged in the draft Mental Health Bill, will have on average waiting times for treatment.  [68252]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w17.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We anticipate that the impact on waiting times for urgent treatment will be minimal. The implementation of the "national service framework for mental health", and the development of new services such as assertive outreach, crisis resolution and early intervention, will help to ensure that fewer people become so ill that they need compulsory treatment.

<a name="20716w18.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 I have had a number of recent discussions with other Government Departments and organisations about the older people's standard spending assessment formulae. I also commissioned independent research into this formula. As a result of these discussions and research there are a number of possible options for change to the existing formula that we are considering. A consultation document was issued on 8 July setting out these options and councils have 12 weeks to comment on them.

<a name="20716w18.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will provide a list, by region, of the publicly funded elderly care homes in the last five years; and how much money they received in real terms.  [68527]

<P>
<a name="20716w18.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Prior to April this year, local councils were responsible for the registration of residential care homes. Lists of registered homes were not maintained centrally. Nor are there central records of the size of contracts entered into with individual homes either by councils or by people who used income support to purchase care which they had arranged for themselves. However, the following table shows the gross expenditure on residential care and nursing provision by councils with social services responsibilities in each region in England at 2000&#150;01 prices for the five years from 1996&#150;97 to 2000&#150;01.

<a name="20716w18.html_para5">Barts and the London NHS Trust met with specialist commissioners on 5 July and agreed funding arrangements for MS therapy. A clinical discussion forum took place on 11 July. As a result of these discussions, all patients who are under the NHS for their MS care but are receiving MS therapy on a private prescription, are now eligible for NHS treatment, as long as the Association of British Neurologists criteria has been met. Consequently, all patients in this category will now be called in for review.

Standards are now much more in line with patients' expectations. National results of the PEAT programme, as set out in the table, were published on 31 October 2001.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, para.30.2.5, which notes that Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of their business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where <i>(a)</i> insurance is a condition of a lease <i>(b)</i> the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity; or <i>(c)</i> incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options.

 Although specific reduction targets have not been set, we are continuing to support the work of the confidential inquiry into stillbirths and deaths in infancy to improve care during pregnancy and provide the right quality and level of support. The difficulties of premature birth and the tragedy of losing a child through stillbirth and miscarriage have some associations with, and are always compounded by, poverty and social exclusion. We are addressing this through the 'Sure Start' initiative, including pilot programmes to provide personal co-ordinated support for pregnant teenagers, and parents under the age of 18. We are also investing more in the provision of maternity care and seeking to ensure the most effective configuration of these essential services.

 The health education authority (HEA) was originally commissioned by the Department in 1996 to provide sun awareness information. The HEA then developed the "Sun Know How" campaign up until the HEA's functions were moved to the health development agency and health promotion England in March 2000. As the "Sun Know How" messages had been successful, existing HEA promotional material continued to be made available but on a smaller scale. The success of the campaign was acknowledged and it was recognised that a new approach was needed.

On 14 March a new website, www.doh.gov.uk/sunsafe, providing sun safety advice, was launched. We are also collaborating with other key stakeholders this year in ensuring that a range of sun safety advice is publicly available.

<a name="20716w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> Almost every general practitioner (GP) has a desktop PC. Software suppliers must meet Requirement for Accreditation standards for GP's to be reimbursed. Therefore they must ensure that systems support the ability to write prescriptions via the desktop. Limited numbers of GPs are able to issue prescriptions electronically via the Electronic Transmission of Prescription pilots, which are currently being run by three private sector consortiums on behalf of the Department.

 The Department has received six letters regarding the amounts taken from local authorities through the standards spending assessment (SSA) to fund the National Care Standards Commission.
<P>

<a name="20716w22.html_para4">Before deciding to transfer local authorities net expenditure on registration and inspection from the national SSA we consulted local authorities. This method of transferring funds was supported by most local authorities. However, as a result of the comments we

<P>
<a name="20716w22.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State has had no meetings with ministerial colleagues specifically regarding child protection in sport or inter-agency working on child protection in sport. However, officials have attended meetings of the child protection in sport unit steering group&#151;a joint initiative between the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Sport England. The child protection in sport unit advises organisations on how to introduce child protection policies, commissions research into abuse within sport and raises the profile of child protection among sports' governing bodies. One of the unit's key aims is that sport will play a full and positive part in inter-agency child protection work.

<P>

<P>
<a name="20716w22.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The ultimate responsibility for deciding what treatment is best for an individual patient rests with health professionals, who in consultation with the patient, are required to exercise their clinical judgment. These decisions can be complex and may need to take account of a range of factors; chief among these must be the ability of the patient to benefit from the treatment proposed. Non-surgical treatments for arthritis include the new drugs, infliximab (Remicade) and etanecerpt (Enbrel) which were recently approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.
<P>

<a name="20716w22.html_para5">The importance of good arthritis services, particularly for the health and well being of older people is recognised in the national service framework for older people.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The Department's head of procurement is responsible for information and communication technology (ICT) procurement for the Department itself.
<P>

<a name="20716w22.html_para6">Procurements undertaken by national health service trusts and authorities in England are formally the responsibility of the relevant chief executive. They are advised and supported by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. As an integral part of the Department, the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency is in a key position to advise on policy and the strategic direction of procurement, and its impact on developing healthcare, across the NHS. The agency contracts on a national basis

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 2002]:</i> Under the national health service contract, digital hearing aids had been available at a cost of between &#163;140 and &#163;205 each, for moderately powered aids. The contracts and prices have been renegotiated by a team set up by Ministers and led by James Strachan, Chief Executive of Royal National Institute for the Deaf, which includes representatives from the Department and the purchasing and supply agency, and allows moderate powered digital aids to be purchased at &#163;65 to &#163;75 each plus value added tax.

 Precise information on this subject is not available except where intoxication is an element of the definition of the offence (as with driving while intoxicated). The term alcohol-related crime potentially covers any criminal act where the perpetrator may have been drinking alcohol prior to, or at the time of, the offence. While the relevant offence may be recorded, there is at present no requirement on police forces to record whether or not the offender had been drinking.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2002 : Column 223W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20716w25.html_para0">We know from the British Crime Survey that about 40 per cent. of all violent crime is alcohol-related, that is where the victim considers that the offender had been drinking prior to the commission of the offence. But victims are less able to make such an assessment where the offence does not involve direct contact with the offender.
<P>

<a name="20716w25.html_para1">The suite of Best Value Performance Indicators for the police for 2002&#150;03 will provide a more consistent measure of alcohol-related violence across all police forces in England and Wales, by including both a measure of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises and a measure of violent offences committed under the influence of an intoxicating substance.
<P>

<a name="20716w25.html_para2">The Government is determined to tackle the range of problems that arise from alcohol misuse, including alcohol-related crime and disorder. This includes tackling under-age drinking, recognising that young people are generally less likely than adults to differentiate between legal and illegal substances. As part of the response to this, each Drug Action Team has now drawn up a Young People's Substance Misuse Plan detailing how education, prevention and treatment activities for drugs and alcohol will be expanded according to local needs and integrated within wider provision for children and young people.

None of these proposals have so far been adopted by the Council of Ministers. The United Kingdom has not exercised its right to opt in to the adoption and application of these measures.

 My predecessor, my right hon. and noble Friend, Lord Rooker, wrote to hon. Members on 15 May 2002 setting out how their representations in relation to immigration cases would be dealt with. In exceptional, urgent and compassionate cases, private office staff will intervene directly and act according to the nature of the case to try and seek an urgent resolution.

<a name="20716w26.html_para1">However, due to the nature of exceptional, urgent and compassionate cases, there are no specific guidelines which private office staff follow. Each case is considered separately, dependent on its individual circumstances.

<a name="20716w26.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government recognise that there may be certain people from northern Iraq who are in need of international protection under the terms of the 1951 United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees. However, there are also some asylum seekers from that region who, after careful consideration of their application, do not appear to meet the criteria set out in the convention. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner is on record saying that it would not object to the return to northern Iraq of asylum seekers from that area who have been found, through fair and objective procedures, not to be in need of international protection.
<P>

<a name="20716w26.html_para2">Iraqi citizens of Kurdish origin are able to return voluntarily to northern Iraq. We are exploring the options for enforcing returns to northern Iraq using routes that will not cross territory controlled by the Government in Baghdad. We hope to be in a position to begin enforced returns shortly.

<a name="20716w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> Home Office Ministers considered the matter very carefully, but concluded that the issues, including those regarding compliance with the authorities granted to Imutran Limited under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 for its xenotransplantation research programme, did not merit such an inquiry. Nor were they considered to justify any other form of special investigation. Instead, in November 2000, the then Home Secretary (Mr. Straw) asked the Chief Inspector of the 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2002 : Column 229W</I><P>
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate to carry out a routine assessment of compliance with the relevant authorities issued to Imutran Limited under the 1986 Act. The Chief Inspector's report, which covered five years work, was published on 13 July 2001 and copies placed in the Library. It confirmed that the general level of compliance was good and identified no new factors justifying a judicial inquiry.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 2002]:</i> The use of biometric techniques to link a travel document to the rightful holder has long been recognised as a policy goal by passport issuing authorities around the world. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is developing a biometric standard for use in machine readable travel documents to ensure global interoperability. The United Kingdom (UK) is supporting the work of ICAO in establishing this standard. In addition the UK Passport Service is investigating ways to use biometrics information in UK passports and in passport cards as the latter are developed; and in its efforts to counter fraud.

 The then Home Secretary (Mr. Straw) announced the establishment of the Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet on 9 May 2001. Since then, the full Task Force has met four times and most recently on 3 July 2002. The work of the Task Force has been taken forward by a number of Sub Groups which have met regularly and have been looking at the criminal law, law enforcement, child protection measures, public awareness, training and further developing co-operation between the industry and others on reporting and handling child protection issues.
<P>

<a name="20716w27.html_para1">Members of the respective Sub Groups have given freely of their time to support the aim we set last year: to make the United Kingdom the best and safest place in the world for children to use the internet, and to help protect children the world over from abuse fuelled by criminal misuse of new technologies.
<P>

<a name="20716w27.html_para2">The Task Force has developed, run and now evaluated a successful national awareness campaign. Research had confirmed two key gaps: first, that parents are ill-informed about their children's use of the internet and chat rooms, and second that young people give out their personal details without considering the consequences. Two campaigns were designed, one to target 14 to 16-year-olds and the other parents/carers of 11 to 13-year-olds. The media used included press advertising, cinema, radio, on-line and viral marketing from December 2001 until spring 2002. Independent evaluation of the campaigns shows significantly improved awareness of the key messages in both target audiences. The Task Force is now considering that evaluation and how to build on the momentum created.

 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="20716w28.html_para3">

<BR>
<i>(a)</i> The Government have no formal role in encouraging local authorities to install sprinkler systems. It is a matter for local consideration, although authorities will be assisted by the proposed introduction of the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). This will provide a risk based approach to the implementation of safety measures in dwellings. The HHSRS provides an analysis of risk from 24 broad hazards, including hazards from fire, and of the counter-measures to address those risks. Sprinklers are listed as one of the measures to promote fire safety.
<BR>
<i>(b)</i> Although there are currently no plans to revise the building regulations to include provisions for domestic sprinkler systems into new build houses, we are keeping this under review in the light of emerging standards and improvements in sprinkler technology. We have recently let two research contracts to look at the whole issue of residential and domestic sprinklers, including an assessment of their actual effectiveness and the undertaking of a regulatory impact assessment to consider their costs and benefits. The results and conclusions of this work should be available around the end of 2003.

<P>
<a name="20716w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Authorities cannot refuse to secure accommodation or provide advice and assistance, as appropriate, to applicants where this is required as a result of a specific duty being owed to them under Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996. Rough sleepers or homeless people who apply to a housing authority for accommodation or advice and assistance must be treated in the same way as all other applicants.
<P>

<a name="20716w29.html_para2">Authorities do not have a power to return homeless people or rough sleepers to another area, but where an authority decide that an applicant is owed the main homelessness duty and (a) he or she does not have a local connection with the area of the authority and (b) does have one with the area of another authority, the case may be referred to that other authority.

 As we set out in the Green Paper, "Modernising Local Government Finance", we believe that the case for recognising that pay levels vary across the country is clear-cut.

 Of the corporate governance inspections that have been carried out to date four reports have come into the public domain prior to publication. Such premature disclosure does not help authorities to derive full benefit from inspections. The Audit Commission strongly advises local authority officers and members not to reveal the contents of draft reports prior to an agreed release date. Confidential drafts are provided in order to allow full discussion and deliberation of the recommendations within the council; and between the council and the inspectors, and the incorporation of any subsequent changes to the report before publication of a final report. The detailed management of these arrangements is a matter for the Audit Commission and the authority concerned.

 The Government are keen to involve districts in local PSAs, but believe that better outcomes can be achieved through co-operation between county and district councils than by districts acting alone. It therefore offers incentives to encourage county councils to work with their districts in drawing up and implementing their local PSAs. Most of the county councils involved in the roll-out of local PSAs to top tier authorities have involved their districts, including Suffolk county council, whose local PSA was recently agreed. There are no plans to extend local PSAs to districts alone.

<BR>
As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning the list of members of the Public Sector Classification Committee, and the process by which they were selected. (70512)
<BR>
The Public Sector Classification Committee's members are selected for their National Accounts expertise. Most are automatically entitled to membership through holding particular jobs in The Office for National Statistics. The committee may co-opt others in particular cases if their areas of expertise are relevant. The membership is:
<BR>
Head of National Accounts Group (chair)
<BR>
Head of National Expenditure & Income Division (vice-chair)
<BR>
Head of National Accounts Co-ordination Division
<BR>
Head of Balance of Payments & Financial Sector Division

[70514]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics is responsible for classifying institutions and transactions for national accounts in accordance with international guidelines. Ministers have decided to adopt national accounts definitions in the monitoring and control of public finances. Similarly in the EU, the Council has decided to adopt national accounts definitions in the Maastricht Treaty, its protocols, and in the Stability and Growth Pact.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w32.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue have not entered into agreements that absolve individuals from the general obligation to submit an annual tax return. Under Inland Revenue's power of care and management agreements of the type described were entered into and intended as a practical basis for taxing future income and gains where there would otherwise have been particular difficulties in establishing an exact figure. The Inland Revenue are no longer making these agreements.
<P>

<a name="20716w32.html_para4">No central records were kept of these agreements at the time they were made, but the number of individuals so far identified to have been covered by them in the years in question is as follows:

 The Budget 2002 summary leaflet was designed, written and edited by Treasury officials. The costs of production and distribution of the leaflet were met from within Departmental Expenditure Limits and amounted to approximately &#163;208,000.
<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para0">The leaflet is available free of charge from the Treasury and is published on the Treasury website.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Inland Revenue department's Vote on Account provision for 2002&#150;03 will be sufficient to finance spending until Royal Assent to the Appropriation Act later this summer.  [68862]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w33.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Royal Assent to the Appropriation Act was given on 8 July. Prior to that point, the overall Vote on Account provision for the Inland Revenue Estimate was sufficient in terms of both resources and cash to finance spending until Royal Assent. However, the Valuation Office Agency's Request for Resources (RfR) 4 had consumed &#163;500,000 more resources than anticipated in the Vote on Account because of a change in the profile of the liabilities.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2002 : Column 254W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para1">The increase in resources was offset by lower resource consumption on RfR1 enabling resource consumption on the Estimate as a whole to remain within the overall Vote on Account resource provision. The net cash requirement remained unchanged.

 The Government's annual anti-poverty report, "Opportunity for All" shows progress on a range of poverty and social exclusion indicators linked to child poverty&#151;low-income, worklessness, health, education and housing&#151;each of which is reflected in a short-term Public Service Agreement (PSA).
<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para2">The Government will continue to make progress towards their goal of eradicating child poverty with the introduction in April 2003 of two new tax credits&#151; the child tax credit and the working tax credit.

 This Government are committed to halving child poverty by 2010 and abolishing it within a generation. As a result of personal tax and benefit changes announced since 1997, by April 2003 the poorest families with children will be on average &#163;2,400 better off in real terms.
<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para3">To make further progress towards its eradication goal, Government are introducing two new tax credits&#151;the child tax credit and the working tax credit&#151;in April 2003. The Government are also making substantial investment in services for children.

It has introduced the minimum income guarantee and is committed to raising it in line with earnings throughout this Parliament.

 The Government keep all taxes under review as part of the normal Budget process.
<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para5">In the UK, racehorse owners, including breeders, already benefit from the VAT Registration Scheme for Racehorse Owners which allows owners, breeders, dealers and trainers who generate business income through horseracing, to register for VAT and thus recover the full VAT costs on the purchase and training of their horses. In addition to this stud farming is treated as farming for tax purposes and is therefore subject to special reliefs such as the Agricultural Buildings Allowance and Agricultural Property Relief.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20716w33.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Most public servants now are covered by occupational pension schemes and any that are not have access to stakeholder pensions. Individuals may opt out of their employer's pension arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para6">Precise eligibility for membership is a matter for the individual pension schemes. Since 1995 public service occupational schemes have been required to provide access to part-timers. Where eligibility has been extended retrospective membership has not usually been allowed unless it is legally required.
<P>

<a name="20716w33.html_para7">A recent ECJ ruling on the Preston case, concerning a part-timer working for the NHS who claimed retrospective admission, means that many thousands of part-timers will be admitted into public service scheme prior to 1995, once the outstanding legal issues have been resolved in the Employment Tribunals.

 Inquiries into the use of land mines by poppy cultivators in Afghanistan indicate that this was predominantly a case of rumour to disrupt the crop eradication programme. There has been only one reported incident since the start of the eradication campaign: on 22 April 2002 25 people were injured, seven seriously when a land mine was detonated in a poppy field in Uruzgan. Two deaths were reported but these were not verified. Casualties included people undertaking the crop eradication.

 Attaining universal primary education by 2015 will require a major increase in the supply and retention of trained teachers. National governments will need to determine appropriate policies and strategies for achieving this. Teachers' salaries absorb a very large share of education expenditure and in many countries national resources will need to be supplemented by external financing. We believe the international community should provide recurrent expenditure support for basic education to countries that are clearly committed to Education for All and are demonstrating strong management of their resources. The World bank's Fast Track initiative provides an opportunity for accelerating such support and we are working closely with the bank on taking this forward.

 The Government believe that education is a basic human right which enables people to transform their own lives and the society in which they live. Education also has a vital role to play in enabling developing countries to achieve the levels of economic growth that are necessary for tackling poverty and achieving sustainable development. We are strongly committed to the Millennium Development Goals on education: achieving universal primary education by 2015 and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schooling by 2005. We believe that these goals are achievable if the governments of poor countries implement effective policies and receive the right assistance from the international community.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, para 30.2.5, which notes that government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where <i>(a)</i> insurance is a condition of a lease <i>(b)</i> the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity <i>(c)</i> incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options [Government Accounting, para 30.2.11a].

Generally child benefit is not payable for children who are absent from Great Britain (GB), and the current rules provide for most exceptions. The written approval of the school the child normally attends ensures there is a continuing link with GB throughout the temporary absence. Although entitlement for children being educated in non AWAY countries ceases after they have been absent for 12 weeks, if they return for home visits and then go abroad temporarily again, a new 12 week easement begins.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2002]:</i> Maternity benefits are being reformed as part of the Government's drive to help pregnant women and parents financially and to achieve a better balance between their work and home lives.
<P>

<a name="20716w36.html_para3">The improvements introduced by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 mean that entitlement to maternity allowance is now based on a woman's earnings and that help is extended to women earning at least &#163;30 a week but less than lower earnings limit applied to national insurance contributions. As a result of these changes, an additional 16,000 low-paid expectant mothers a year can get maternity allowance. Our reforms have also increased maternity allowance by 15 per cent. for around 11,000 self-employed women who previously received less benefit than employed women.
<P>

<a name="20716w36.html_para4">Prior to 20 August 2000, entitlement to maternity allowance was based on the payment of either Class 1 or Class 2 national insurance contributions by the mother within the relevant qualifying period.
<P>

<a name="20716w36.html_para5">We have also introduced Sure Start Maternity Grants to help people on low incomes meet the cost of buying essential items for a new baby. These grants have been increased this year to a significant &#163;500 for babies due or born on or after 16 June 2002. The new scheme means more than just a cash payment. Mothers and expectant mothers also receive health advice for themselves and, importantly, for their child.
<P>

<a name="20716w36.html_para6">Prior to March 2000, Social Fund Maternity Payments were available to women or families in receipt of qualifying benefits or tax credits. These payments replaced the maternity grant in April 1987. Between 1982 and 1987 eligibility for the maternity grant was based solely on a test of residency in Great Britain. For confinements taking place before 4 July 1982, eligibility for the maternity grant was linked to the contribution record of either the mother or her husband using national insurance contributions of any class.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 2002]:</i> No. There are no plans exclude working families tax credit awards from the assessment of child support maintenance.

 No decision on the date for the commencement of the new child support scheme has been taken.

 The Employment Committee is next due to meet on 18 July 2002, which will be an informal meeting under the Danish Presidency. Each member state has two nominated delegates to the Committee and for the UK those represent the Departments of Work and Pensions and for Education and Skills. The main business of the Committee is the European Employment Strategy and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has lead responsibility for the Strategy. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has a significant interest, as do my right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Scottish Executive Ministers, Secretaries of the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.
<P>

<a name="20716w37.html_para2">There is close contact between relevant officials to ensure that ministerial responsibility is properly represented at the Employment Committee and, indeed, on any activity under the Employment Strategy. For example, the main UK output under the Strategy is the UK Employment Action Plan and the devolved Administrations actively contribute. The Plan will be discussed with the European Commission in the autumn and the devolved Administrations have been invited to attend that meeting.

 The Social Fund plays an important role in the welfare system by helping the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society with the cost of intermittent expenses. Access to the Social Fund is therefore generally limited to people receiving income- related benefits or, in the case of Sure Start Maternity Grants and Social Fund funeral payments, tax credits. Crisis loans are available to anyone where there is a serious risk to their health or safety.
<P>

<a name="20716w38.html_para0">We keep all elements of the Social Fund under review to see whether further improvements can be made to its operation and to ensure that the Fund supports our wider welfare reforms. However, we have no plans to broaden the eligibility criteria.

Women and men were recruited in equal numbers and the proportions of those recruited from ethnic minority groups, those with disabilities, and those attending universities other than Oxford and Cambridge have all increased.
