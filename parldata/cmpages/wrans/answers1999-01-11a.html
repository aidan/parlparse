To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what targets she has set for reducing the unemployment differential between Catholics and Protestants; and by what criteria she will measure the impact of fair employment legislation.  [64209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Government alone cannot reduce the unemployment differential. It also requires practical action and attitudinal change on the part of employers, educators and the unemployed themselves. To assess the rate of progress, the Government propose to commission the Equality Commission to agree with the representatives of employers, employees, political parties and other interests, benchmark measures for the future reduction of the unemployment differential, informed by up-to-date professional analysis. Moreover, the Equality Commission 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 2</I><P>
will be given a role in advising the Government on measures which they might introduce to reduce the number of, or religious imbalance in, the unemployed.
<P>

<a name="90111w01.html_para1">The impact of the legislation will continue to be measured by changes in the composition of the workforce and by the comparison of the Community composition of those appointed to jobs with that of those applying.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will list the measures taken in each month since February to reduce security activity.  [64205]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Since the reinstatement of the Provisional IRA ceasefire in July 1997, the Chief Constable has announced a progressive reduction in security measures in the Province. Each step has been fully consistent with the level of threat and taken after a review of the security situation.
<P>

<a name="90111w01.html_para2">From February to the end of August, key factors which influenced the levels of security across the Province included the "tit for tat" killings following the murder of Billy Wright in 27 December 1997, devices in 5 town centres, attacks of security forces and the marching season.

<a name="90111w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what was for each police division in Northern Ireland for <i>(a)</i> 1996, <i>(b)</i> 1997 and <i>(c)</i> 1998 up to the latest available date the number of incidents of robbery and attempted robbery from the dwellings of persons of pension age and above where violence was used or threatened, the number of persons who have been made 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 4</I><P>
amenable in the courts, the number of cases pending, the sums stolen and the value of goods stolen and the number of persons injured by the robbers.  [64763]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Statistical data are not maintained in a manner to indicate, readily, the number of prosecutions pending for such offences or how many persons have been made amenable through the courts. The following tables record the available statistics including information in relation to robberies and attempted robberies which have been cleared up by the police. The figures for 1998 require end-year verification and are therefore quoted on a provisional basis. For statistical purposes, a case is said to be cleared if a person has been charged, summonsed, or cautioned for the offence; if the offence is taken into consideration by a court; if there is sufficient evidence to charge a person but it is not proceeded with because, for example, the suspect is under the age of criminal responsibility; or if the suspect has died.

 Since 2 May 1997, there has been one official visit made by a Minister from this Department to Buckinghamshire. The Lord Chancellor attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Chesham on 16 June 1998. Whilst I have made no official visits, I know the local area well.

<a name="90111w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The over-riding principle of Civil Service recruitment procedures is that they should be fair, and selection should be on merit at each stage. Monitoring in this area is based on ethnic origin, and not nationality. The nine ethnic minority categories monitored by the Lord Chancellor's Department are based on those used in the 1991 census which did not include an Irish category. They will be reviewed in the light of any suggested changes in the 2001 Population Census.

<a name="90111w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide the information in the form requested. In cases that settle out of court, the terms of the settlement are not recorded on the Legal Aid Board's computer system, and it is therefore not possible to determine whether, in these cases, the plaintiff's claim was met in full. Information is available only in respect of cases where no damages were awarded. The proportion of cases receiving no damages in each of the last five years, was as follows:

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board does not acknowledge receipt of civil legal aid applications received, nor does it keep solicitors informed of the progress of the application. On average, the Board receives 450,000 applications for civil legal aid a year. In the majority of cases, a decision is made within one to four weeks. As the majority of applications are decided within a short period, sending acknowledgment letters would create additional costs and an unnecessary administrative burden.

 The Legal Aid Board's Corporate Information System (CIS) was implemented on a phased basis which began with the first office going live in November 1997 and the final office in November 1998. The system is now fully operational in all Board offices. CIS is a fully integrated case management system for all types of legal aid with a single database. It replaces systems which were supported by increasingly ancient software and hardware which were not Millennium compliant. CIS provides the Board with more effective control over the management of the Legal Aid Fund and is an essential part of the Board's strategy for preparing for contracting with suppliers of legal services.

 It is the Board's policy to pursue recovery of all debts unless it is evident it would not be cost effective to do so. The average value of debt written off nationally and in the Reading legal aid region in 1997-98, which are the latest figures available, are as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Since the introduction of the Legal Aid Board's Corporate Information System (CIS) records of all contribution payments received from assisted persons, for both live and closed cases are maintained on the database. The Board's current policy is to maintain these records indefinitely and information can be printed out at any time.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 9</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90111w02.html_para8">The Board's Reading area office moved onto CIS in April 1998. The above procedure applied from that date. Prior to the introduction of CIS, full records of contributions received for all live cases were maintained on a computer system (OLIFS). At the end of a case, the system would produce a Closing Financial Statement which is retained for six years from the date the case was closed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 In 1997-98, the gross cost of legal aid services paid for out of the Reading Legal Aid Area Office was &#163;105 million. The figure includes payments on account, final bill payments, VAT and disbursements, where applicable. It excludes the amounts that the Board received in contributions, costs paid by other parties and damages, all of which are sent direct to the Legal Aid Board's Financial Services at its Headquarters in London. The amount of gross costs paid to the legal profession nationally in 1997-98 was &#163;1,612 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Legal Aid contributions are paid by the assisted person by monthly instalments to the Legal Aid Board. Contributions are paid throughout the life of a case. Payments are normally sent direct to the Board's Financial Services at its Headquarters in London. All payments received are recorded centrally on the computer system. In the absence of information to the contrary, any excess contribution instalments received by the Legal Aid Board are treated as payments in advance of future instalments due. Repayments are not, therefore, made to the assisted person until the conclusion of a case unless specifically requested. Any overpayments made to the Legal Aid Board would be identified and accounted for at the end of the case.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what arrangements have been made to monitor franchised legal aid firms <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in the Reading legal aid region.  [65104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w02.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board's arrangements for monitoring legal aid franchises apply nationally. Over a period of up to nine months, applicants for a legal aid franchise are subjected to two audits by the Board. A preliminary audit is carried out to ensure the applicants have developed appropriate procedures to meet the requirements set out in the Franchising Specification and to assess the effectiveness of implementation. If successful, a pre-contract audit will then be undertaken. The pre-contract audit will cover, in more detail, the requirements of the Franchising Specification, including the general and management requirements and transaction criteria, which are the Board's measure of the quality service process. Once a firm of solicitors has been awarded a legal aid franchise, the Board's liaison managers and franchise quality auditors will undertake regular audits of the firm's case files approximately every twelve months.

 The riot control agent CR was only ever manufactured by the MOD at the Chemical Defence Establishment at Nancekuke, Cornwall, between 1962 and 1977. On the closure of Nancekuke and the subsequent return of the site to the RAF, the remaining stocks of CR were transferred to the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Porton Down.

 There has been no change to the Strategic Defence Review decision to cancel the planned final batch of Trident D5 missiles. Since the SDR, we have authorised $100.6m for US fiscal year 99 procurement of Trident missile components as announced in my written answer of 30 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>453</i>. Some of these relate to the completion of earlier missile orders; of the remainder, some will be required as in service spares and the balance will be sold back to the US in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding that I announced on 30 July 1998, <i>Official

<P>
<a name="90111w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 We concluded in the SDR that storing Trident warheads separately from the missiles would be incompatible in current circumstances with maintaining a credible minimum deterrent with a submarine-based nuclear system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Trident missile system was procured off the shelf from the United States under the provisions of the Polaris Sales Agreement of 1963, as amended for Trident. Missile system components, including spares and replacement parts, are procured on our behalf by the US Department of Defence (DoD). For most elements of the system, the DoD uses Prime Contractors (for example, for the missile itself the prime contractor is Lockheed Martin Missile Systems) who in turn employ numerous sub-contractors. Because of the nature of the procurement, we do not have detailed visibility of the sub-contractor network, but I can say that for most major components single suppliers are employed because of the high costs of supplier qualification and the low levels of production now remaining.

<a name="90111w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Government do not support the concept of a permanent United Nations Volunteer Force because it would involve duplicating expensive capabilities that already exist among member states, and because it would be impractical to create a single force that could cater for every eventuality. We believe the most effective way to provide the UN with military support is through the Secretary-General's Standby Arrangements initiative. Since 1994, the United Kingdom has declared a range of forces to be potentially available under the United Nations' Standby Forces Planning Arrangement to facilitate the rapid deployment of forces once political decisions on their use have been made. Following last year's Strategic Defence Review, we have decided to strengthen our commitment by declaring the whole range of our rapidly deployable forces as potentially available to the United Nations. This will be formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding which we plan to have ready for signature by March this year.
<P>

<a name="90111w03.html_para1">The forces declared in the Memorandum of Understanding will be drawn from the new Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, which will have an initial operational capability available by 1 April 1999 and be fully operational by 2001. Each of the elements of this force will be held at graduated states of readiness, ranging from 24 hours up to and including 30 days.
<P>

<a name="90111w03.html_para2">We believe the training and readiness of the United Kingdom's Armed Forces to be the equal of the best in the world. Nevertheless, we remain committed to seeking improvements to these high standards. That is why we announced, also as part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, that the Chief of Joint Operations will have increased authority for enhancing the training and preparedness of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces.

 It was originally estimated that training on the new developments at Otterburn would commence in 2001. When training could now start depends on the length of the re-opened Public Inquiry. Until we know the length of the Inquiry, it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the effect on training nor of any associated costs.

<P>
<a name="90111w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We fully accept the UN's undertaking that personnel under the age of 18 will not be included on UN peacekeeping missions. When my Department responds to a UN request for the deployment of UK troops to a peacekeeping operation, the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) allocates tasks to the three Services as appropriate. UN requirements are of course complied with, including age restrictions. However, there may be occasions when Royal Navy units already deployed overseas, are called at short notice to such an operation. These units may contain small numbers of under 18 year-olds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the cost of the pigmeat imported from outside the United Kingdom which was purchased for consumption by British service men and women in each of the last three years.  [65121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The procurement of food for the Armed Forces is contracted to Booker Foodservice who were selected and took over the contract on 1 October 1997. In the first year of the contract Booker Foodservice imported some &#163;1.45 million worth of pigmeat, representing 50 per cent. of the Armed Forces' requirement for bacon and gammon. The balance of the requirement for bacon and gammon and all of the requirement for pork were obtained from UK sources at a cost of &#163;4.25 million. Unfortunately, the cost of imported pigmeat for the previous two years, when NAAFI held the contract, is not available. We believe, however, that the proportion of imported pigmeat will have been broadly similar to that advised by Booker Foodservice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w05.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what changes he proposes to make to the way in which Government departments account for VAT on contracted- out services.  [65410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The 1984 Finance Act provided for Customs and Excise to make refunds to departments in respect of the VAT they pay on contracted out services. This was designed to remove a potential disincentive to contracting out services to the private sector, where this represented value for money for the taxpayer. Since 1996-97 these VAT refunds have been netted off against expenditure in departments' Estimates and Appropriation Accounts. The Government have reconsidered this approach and concluded that it is not consistent with the legislation governing the treatment of receipts, which requires most receipts of Government departments to be appropriated in aid or surrendered to the Consolidated Fund. We will therefore revert to the arrangements that applied prior to 1996-97. So long as cash based Estimates and Appropriation Accounts continue to exist refunds of VAT on contracted out services will be appropriated in aid, an approach which provides a greater degree of transparency.

 The estimated national television licence fee evasion rate was 7.2 per cent. at the end of March 1998 and is expected to fall significantly by the end of the current financial year. Information below national level is not available in a comparable form.

 This Department has not made any estimate of the proportion of girls who have given up sport upon leaving school.
<P>

<a name="90111w07.html_para0">The 1994 Young People and Sport Survey, which focused on ages 6-16 and was carried out by the then GB Sports Council, showed that, at age 16, the participation rate for girls in sport was 77 per cent. The 1996 General Household Survey, which focused on age 16 and over, showed that the participation rate in the age group 16-19 was 79 per cent. The same surveys show that the participation rates were 81 per cent. at ages 14-15, but fell to 70 per cent. at ages 25-29. However, direct comparisons are not appropriate because of the different nature of the two surveys.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to ensure that New Opportunities Fund support for healthy living centres addresses issues of social exclusion in rural areas.  [64472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 1998]:</i> The Policy Directions issued to the New Opportunities Fund make it clear that the primary aim of the healthy living centre initiative is that the centres should target people in communities with the worst health and greatest health inequalities, including those in pockets of deprivation within rural areas which may not be readily identifiable as deprived under the current criteria for determining deprivation. A particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that the centres are accessible to people who experience disadvantage, or who have difficulty accessing existing health facilities and services.
<P>

<a name="90111w07.html_para8">The National Lottery Act 1998 requires the New Opportunities Fund to draw up a strategic plan containing its assessment of needs and its priorities in dealing with them, on which it must consult the Secretary of State. This ensures that there is a proper strategy for distributing Lottery proceeds. The Fund is currently consulting on its draft strategic plan and looking at ways it will focus on the most disadvantaged 20 per cent. of the population. The Fund proposes to give particular priority to, among others, deprived rural areas.

<a name="90111w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 1998]:</i> The New Opportunities Fund is currently consulting on its application guidance and developing its assessment criteria, but for healthy living centres the criteria will include consideration of the benefit to deprived communities and groups; additionality to mainstream health provision; innovation and quality of provision; community and user involvement; equality and access to the project; links with local health improvement

<a name="90111w08.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 14 December that as part of the Departmental Spending Review outcome sport will receive increased Government funding of almost &#163;8 million over the next 3 years, some &#163;2 million more than the &#163;6 million already announced in July. The extra funding will not only help the UK Sports Council with the lead role we all want to see it play in UK sport, but will contribute to the existing range of provisions that the English Sports Council (ESC) makes in the field of social inclusion.
<P>

<a name="90111w08.html_para1">The National Lottery is also making a major impact in addressing the needs of communities up and down the country, both in terms of sport and the other good causes.

Sports projects in economically deprived regions can apply for additional Lottery support under the ESC's 'Priority Areas Initiative'.

<P>

<a name="90111w08.html_para2">We are working towards the goal of social inclusion in a variety of other ways. I am the 'lead' Minister for a Policy Action Team which has been set up to examine best practice in the use of arts and sports projects in deprived areas.

 Information is not held centrally on the numbers of television sets installed in non-domestic premises other than hotels, and even for hotels information is not held in the form requested. The available statistics on domestic television ownership show only the number of households without television, those with one set and those with more than one set, broken down into colour and black and white. Over 60 per cent. of households with colour television have more than one colour set; a further 7 per cent. of households with colour television have an additional black and white set and a similar proportion of households with only black and white television have more than one set. Charging all households with more than one television set an additional licence fee would raise an estimated &#163;1,320 million in extra television licence fee revenue, assuming that levels of television ownership remained unchanged.

 Under the public/private partnership for the Underground, London Underground will pay to the private sector a fee based on availability and performance of infrastructure. The work to date, to develop the contract structure and model the financial relationships, which is still being refined, suggests that, over the life of the concession, this fee and all the Underground's operating costs could be covered from London Underground revenues. Details of the estimated payments cannot be divulged, as to do so might compromise the public sector's ability to achieve value for money in the competition for the infrastructure contracts.

<P>
<a name="90111w10.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Calculations underlying the 1999-2000 social services standard spending assessment (SSA) for North Yorkshire are set out in the draft Local Government Finance Report (England) for 1999-2000. The 0.5 per cent. increase in the social services SSA reflects a 5.8 per cent. increase due to control totals, a 5.2 per cent. decrease due to changes in the method of calculation and a 0.1 per cent. decrease due to incorporating the latest data in the indicators used to calculate the SSA.
<P>

<a name="90111w10.html_para0">Changes to the method of calculation for 1999-2000 have been made, following research and discussion with local government, where we are satisfied that they are justified and lead to a fairer system overall. The main changes affecting North Yorkshire are the new method of calculating the SSA for children's social services and the exclusion of residents of institutions from the elderly residential formula. I will shortly be meeting a delegation from North Yorkshire County Council to discuss the proposed settlement.

<P>
<a name="90111w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Local authorities have complete discretion on whether to charge for non-residential social services provided for the elderly. They are also free to set the amount of any charge. The change was made because it is not fair to assume that each local authority can raise the same amount in charges irrespective of the ability of those receiving services to contribute towards their cost. This is supported by statistical evidence which shows that, the higher the proportion of pensioners receiving Income Support in an authority, the smaller the contribution that charges make to the cost of providing such services. In examining possible statistical evidence, the following indicators were also considered: pensioners living alone, pensioners in rented accommodation, elderly with a limiting long term illness and the needs index which was used in the Other Social Services standard spending assessment formula before 1998-99.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w10.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The formula was changed in response to three concerns. First, the previous formula penalised local authorities which placed people in accommodation beyond their boundaries. Such placements counted towards the standard spending assessment for the receiving authority rather than the placing authority. Secondly, the previous formula included people who are funding their own care and are no financial burden on the local authority. Thirdly, the change to the method of calculation makes the formula more consistent with the research on which it was based. That research examined the characteristics of people in private households who were on the point of admission to residential care.
<P>

<P>
<a name="90111w10.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) are measures of relative need rather than absolute need. The elderly residential services SSA involves estimating each authority's share of the national total of people requiring residential or nursing care. The change in the method of calculating SSAs and in the data used have led to changes in each authorities' share of the national total of potential elderly supported residents. A table showing these figures has been placed in the House Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the revised 1998-99 standard spending assessment base is for each local authority with responsibility for social services, taking into account the absorption of the special transitional grant for social services and the early years grant for education; what his policy is on publishing revised bases; and if he will recalculate for each such authority the published growth in standard spending assessment on the basis of the formula for carrying forward the special transitional grant for 1998-99 and previous years.  [64574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w10.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 When calculating growth in standard spending assessments for each authority, our policy has been to make adjustments to the base year where there are significant changes in responsibility and where funding amounts for changes in responsibility for each authority are available. To adjust in the manner requested for calculating growth between 1998/99 and 1999/2000, however, is not appropriate in the light of the Comprehensive Spending Review which started from a zero base, looking at expenditure needs afresh. The only fair comparison for social services is to look at total resources provided which, in aggregate, show a 6.1 per cent. cash increase or a 3.5 per cent. real terms increase between 1998/99 and 1999/2000. The increased resources we are making available will meet the costs of looking after existing and new community care clients, and enable local authorities to deliver real improvements in services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what criteria he used to select locations to be designated as special areas of conservation.  [64716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The criteria for the selection of Special Areas of Conservation are set out in Annexe III of the Habitats Directive. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee publication 'The Habitats Directive: Selection of Special Areas of Conservation in the UK' published last October sets out the way in which these criteria were applied in the UK. Copies of that document were placed in the Library of the House at that time.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what conditions will be imposed on water consumers who wish to change to a tariff-based system of charging.  [64542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Under present arrangements, the tariff and method of calculation of water charges and the choices offered to consumers are at the discretion of water undertakers.
<P>

<a name="90111w11.html_para0">The Government propose to introduce increased choice and consumer protection for domestic water customers through the Water Industry Bill, now in Committee. The Bill proposes to give all household consumers the right to change to a measured basis of charging free of initial costs for meter installation. The only restriction on this right would be in cases where it was not reasonably practicable or would involve unreasonable expense. As a further 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 44</I><P>
important consumer protection, customers exercising their new right to opt for a meter would have the option of reverting to unmeasured charging after a year.
<P>

<a name="90111w11.html_para1">The Bill also proposes to introduce a new right for consumers currently paying on an unmeasured basis to stay on an unmeasured charge in their present homes, except where they are consuming water for non-essential purposes.
<P>

<a name="90111w11.html_para2">It is proposed to use new powers under the Bill to protect vulnerable customers with high essential water use from measured bills that are higher than average.
<P>

<a name="90111w11.html_para3">The Government also wish to see water companies go beyond these new legal requirements to develop tariffs that offer greater customer choice and have regard both to social and environmental objectives. It will be for companies to introduce new tariffs, which would, under the provisions of the Bill, require the approval of the Director General of Water Services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government expect the problems arising from the eclipse to be overcome through effective planning and co-ordination in accordance with the principles of Integrated Emergency Management. We are aware that relevant public bodies are working hard locally to ensure that effective arrangements are in place. The Government will be keeping a close watch on developments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it is his policy to require the provision of automatic train protection.  [64668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We are currently considering formal proposals, submitted by the Health and Safety Commission just before Christmas, that would require train protection measures (to stop trains automatically in danger situations) to be fitted to all trains and to key signals by 1 January 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the adequacy of track maintenance carried out by Railtrack.  [64662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Railtrack and its contractors are required under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that risks to people's health and safety from their work activity are properly controlled. This includes the maintenance of its railway infrastructure. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) monitors Railtrack's compliance with the law.
<P>

<a name="90111w11.html_para4">HSE's Railway Inspectorate has identified some locations where track standards have fallen below an acceptable level. They have reminded Railtrack of its responsibilities and ensured that the appropriate action has been taken to maintain safety. HSE will not hesitate to take further action which they consider appropriate to ensure safety is not being compromised.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the numbers and locations of speed restrictions put in place by Railtrack for safety reasons at <i>(a)</i> 1 May 1996, <i>(b)</i> 1 May 1997 and <i>(c)</i> 1 May 1998 and those on the day responsibility was handed over from British Rail to Railtrack.  [64663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The information requested is not held by my Department or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). There is no specific legislation which requires Railtrack to report details of speed restriction it imposes to the HSE.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the respective roles of the Secretary of State, Rail Regulator and Franchise Director in resolving failures of co-ordination between Railtrack and rail franchisees.  [64929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The general duties of the Secretary of State, the Rail Regulator and the Franchising Director are set out in sections 4 and 5 of the Railways Act 1993.
<P>

<a name="90111w11.html_para5">The Rail Regulator has published a policy statement about the need for more effective consultation and better co-ordination between Railtrack and the train operating companies, and between train operators themselves, on timetable planning. Proposals to introduce a formal

<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what emergency powers he has to override Railtrack and rail franchisee managers where their activities pose a threat to safety and to the national economy.  [64930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive have powers under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 to ensure that safety risks to people at work are properly controlled, including the power to take enforcement action. Under section 118 of the Railways Act 1993, in time of "great national emergency" the Secretary of State may give directions to the Rail Regulator, the Franchising Director, the owner or operator of a railway asset, and any provider of railway services.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what penalties have been imposed on <i>(a)</i> Railtrack, <i>(b)</i> South West Trains and <i>(c)</i> other franchisees as a result of failures of co-ordination between Railtrack and franchisees.  [64928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Franchising Director does not have a contractual relationship with Railtrack. Railtrack has regulated commercial agreements with Train Operating Companies which include incentive arrangements. The Franchising Director's franchise agreement with South West Trains includes a performance regime that rewards and penalises improvements and deterioration in punctuality and reliability. Similar arrangements apply to other London commuter franchises and some regional and rural rail services. The cash flows under the regime are published in the OPRAF Quarterly Bulletins, which are in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Any changes to the frequency of service on the Heathrow Express would be a commercial matter for negotiation between the parties concerned, namely Heathrow Express Operating Company Limited (HEOCL) and Railtrack. Under current legislation, the Heathrow Express service is exempt from licence conditions relating to the level of fares that may be charged. Any modifications to the licence could be obtained only by agreement with HEOCL itself or by reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 47</I><P>
to the Vienna European Council. The report, copies of which have been placed in the House Library, sets out details of the progress that has been made to date and of further action that is needed. The European Council welcomed the report and invited the Transport Council to continue its work with a view to submitting a comprehensive strategy, including a timetable for further measures and a set of indicators, to the Helsinki European Council at the end of 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the implications for fair competition arising out of arrangements entered into by Railtrack and Virgin in respect of the West Coast main line.  [64667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w11.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The access agreement between Railtrack and Virgin Trains was approved by the Rail Regulator in June 1998. The regulator considered many public interest duties when approving these access rights, including the development of rail services and the protection of the interests of customers of other train operating companies using the line, both passenger and freight. The proposed Strategic Rail Authority will, when established, set the longer-term framework for competition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The adequacy of track and platform space at Paddington Station is a matter for the station operator, Railtrack. The number of platforms available for use at Paddington Station are stated in Railtrack's Railway Safety Case, under which the company is required to operate.
<P>

<a name="90111w12.html_para0">The Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate is satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place for managing congestion at Paddington Station.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government announced in September that secondary sewage treatment would be required for all significant coastal outfalls in England and Wales. In cases which were formerly potential derogations to a lower level of treatment, such as Yaverland, we are encouraging water and sewage companies to make as rapid progress as possible with installation of secondary treatment. The timing of improvements to coastal discharges is being discussed between the Environment Agency and individual companies and will be agreed by Ministers early this year, as part of an approved company investment programme.

[64703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 There has been no such assessment. The road safety of professional drivers is comprehensively covered by road traffic and other relevant legislation.

We have therefore supported the work of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, including the publication in 1998 of "Managing Occupational Road Risk", to help organisations develop an effective management approach to road safety.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to introduce regulations to reduce the risk of road accidents involving vehicles which are driven for work purposes.  [64702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce regulations specifically to reduce the risk of road accidents involving vehicles driven for work purposes. Existing legislation (the Road Traffic Act 1988, related Acts, and associated regulations) already govern driving behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the proportion of fatal and serious injuries which occurred in road traffic accidents involving one or more vehicles being driven for work purposes.  [64701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 I have made no such estimate. This information is not collected by the Police. There is no requirement to report traffic accidents involving work-related journeys to the health and safety enforcing authorities under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 There has been no such assessment because the road safety of professional drivers is comprehensively covered by road traffic and other

<a name="90111w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There is no evidence to suggest that long-haul travel poses particular health hazards for most passengers. However, elderly passengers and those with an existing medical condition may be vulnerable to the environmental and physiological stresses of flight and should seek appropriate advice from both the airline and their general practitioner before flying.

<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 As part of the Government's programme of regular five-yearly financial, management and policy reviews of non-departmental public bodies, my Department will conduct a thorough review of Groundwork beginning on Tuesday 12 January. The first stage of the review will take the form of a "prior options" study. This will assess the extent to which Groundwork's functions are necessary for the achievement of the Department's policies, and whether there is scope for changing the relationship between the Department and Groundwork to reflect more appropriately the Department's policies for promoting environmental regeneration.
<P>

<a name="90111w12.html_para1">The progress made by Groundwork since the previous review in 1994 will be examined and the results of that examination and of the prior options study will inform a detailed review of the possible mechanisms for funding Groundwork's outputs and, if appropriate, Groundwork's policy and financial management systems.
<P>

<a name="90111w12.html_para2">In carrying out the study, my Department will consult widely with those organisations with an interest in Groundwork's activities. I aim to ensure that any uncertainty caused by the review is kept to a minimum and I therefore expect the FMPR Advisory Group to report by early summer 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 In the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997, there are targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. Currently, businesses obligated under the Regulations must each achieve a minimum recycling target of 7 per cent. per material, including glass.




<P>

<P>

<a name="90111w12.html_para3">The recycling rate for glass packaging presently stands at 22 per cent. Although there is no target for the recycling of all glass, ie container and flatglass, present rates stand at 26 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90111w12.html_para4">Recycling rates for all glass have remained fairly constant since 1995. The capacity is available to increase these recycling rates further.

 As stated in my reply of 16 December 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns<i> 535-36</i>, some &#163;2 billion of the total cost of the Jubilee Line Extension is being directly funded by Government grant.
<P>

<a name="90111w12.html_para5">The developers of Canary Wharf agreed to make a &#163;400 million contribution, spread over a period ending 25 years after line opening.

All the appointments will be made on merit, with members selected on the basis of their knowledge of and expertise from sectors affected by transport policy and its impacts.

 I am unable to be precise about the duration of the re-opened inquiry, although, as the matters for discussion are restricted to new issues that have arisen since the closure of the original inquiry, an approximate estimate would be in the order of four to six weeks. Costs to my Department will involve only minor administrative sums: the larger portion of the costs being borne by the other parties.

 No decision has yet been taken with regard to the classes (which include considerations of flammability) which categorise the fire performance of floorings under the Construction Products Directive. The proposal for Euroclass B which is to be considered by the Standing Committee for Construction in March 1999 has now been amended, reducing the critical flux (heat flow rate) of materials in this class.

 London Underground are mid-way through a project to refurbish the entire fleet of 87 Piccadilly line trains. Refurbishment of 48 trains is already complete and London Underground expect that refurbishment of the whole fleet will be completed by December 2000.
<P>

<a name="90111w14.html_para2">Although London Underground are not planning to procure any new trains in the next three years for use on the Piccadilly line, there are proposals to refurbish 15 ex-Jubilee line trains and bring these into service on

the Piccadilly line. These additional trains will make it possible to run a higher frequency 30 trains per hour (tph) service. London Underground expect that 4 ex-Jubilee line trains will be refurbished by December 2000 and refurbishment of 15 trains will be completed by December 2001.
<P>

<a name="90111w14.html_para3">There are also proposals for the construction of additional platforms at Oakwood and Cockfosters stations and improved access for trains at Cockfosters Depot.

 The different property laws of the countries within the United Kingdom prevent an estimate of leasehold dwellings for the UK. The table, from the Department's Survey of English Housing, provides estimates <sup>1</sup>  of the number of dwellings in Greater London and England which are leasehold; how many of them are houses and flats. The Survey of English Housing cannot produce estimates for parliamentary constituencies.

 All applications for the release or marketing of genetically modified crops (GM crops) are reviewed in order to assess the potential effects of the GMOs on other species, before a decision is made whether or not to grant a consent. To date, no effects on non-target moths have been identified.
<P>

<a name="90111w14.html_para6">The European Corn Borer, a moth which is an important pest of maize, is susceptible to genetically modified maize varieties which have been modified to be resistant to this pest. Some varieties have been granted approval and are being grown in some European Community countries but, because this species is not a pest in the UK, it is unlikely to be grown here. The evidence suggests that other moths which do not consume the maize would be unlikely to be affected by this product.
<P>

<a name="90111w14.html_para7">The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), which advises the Government on releases and marketing of GMOs, has recently extended its remit to consider the wider biodiversity implications, so that any indirect effects of managing the GM crops on farmland wildlife would be assessed, as well as the effects of the GM crops themselves.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w15.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally in the form requested. Rail fares are set by individual Train Operating Companies (TOCs) subject only to limits on increases which the Franchising Director applies to the fares he regulates. The general limit on regulated fares from January 1999 is minus 1 per cent. on the movement in the Retail Prices Index (i.e. the maximum regulated fare increase is 2.5 per cent.). For London Commuter TOCs, the limit varies depending on performance and the average maximum regulated fare increase for 1999 for those is 1.9 per cent. (1.6 per cent. below inflation). There have been many instances of individual unregulated fares being increased above the rate of inflation. Nevertheless, research shows that the average price paid per mile by passengers in 1997-98 was 13.4 pence and this was an increase of 3 per cent. (1 per cent. below inflation) on 1996-97. The research is based on tickets actually sold so 1998-99 data are not yet available, but the Franchising Director will continue to monitor the situation.

 The current statutory definition of a house in multiple occupation may include some accommodation of this type. If so, it would be within the scope of our model registration schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the outcome of the Second London Oceans Workshop.  [65307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 With Dr. Bernardes, the Brazilian Deputy Minister of the Environment, I had the pleasure of chairing the Second London Oceans Workshop on 10-12 December. The Workshop was attended by representatives nominated by 40 national governments, 14 international agencies and 14 non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="90111w15.html_para6">The theme of the Workshop was the integration of the management of the oceans. The main conclusions started by emphasising the role of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Against this background, the two major problems for the conservation and sustainable use of the seas were seen as over-fishing and other unsustainable fishing practices together with pollution from land-based activities. Shipping, exploitation of sea-bed minerals (including oil and gas), coastal development, dumping of waste and climate change are also sources of problems that need to be addressed.
<P>

<a name="90111w15.html_para7">At the national level, Governments were called on to consider the social economic and environmental values of coastal and marine ecosystems, how to achieve the integrated approach as called for by Programme Area A of Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 (including the involvement of all stakeholders), how to join in international agreements already negotiated and how to report on the status of their seas. International organisations were requested to analyse what is hindering the wider acceptance of international agreements and to consider what can be done to remove the obstacles.
<P>

<a name="90111w15.html_para8">The workshop agreed that the regional level was where international co-operation was most needed. UNEP was called upon to revitalise the Regional Seas Programme and to ensure there was a clear focus for the related tasks. Regional fisheries organisations were requested to adopt clear targets for achieving sustainable catches and to develop indicators for over-fishing. Integrated coastal zone management needed support at the regional level. For shipping, more effective port-state control networks were needed, together with action on the regulation of fleets, alien species, anti-fouling agents and registers.
<P>

<a name="90111w15.html_para9">In the global context, the workshop called for immediate action to implement recent UN fisheries agreements. The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries was also crucial. Revitalising the Global Programme of Action on Land-Based Activities was essential. The environmental management of offshore oil and gas required further initiatives to follow up the success of the Noordwijk Workshop. Because of the range 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 61</I><P>
of interests and organisations necessarily involved, improved coordination is needed. The UN General Assembly should consider how the annual debate on the oceans and the law of the sea can be broadened and better prepared.

 Carers wishing to combine their caring role with employment will benefit from the new emphasis on helping those who can work to do so, whilst providing support for those who cannot. Carers in the same family as the disabled person for whom they provide care should also benefit from some of the proposed changes to the family income. The proposed changes to the contribution conditions for Incapacity Benefit will include specific protection for carers in receipt of Invalid Care Allowance.

 The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council is undertaking a review of the whole schedule of occupational diseases for which Industrial Injuries benefits are paid, except for a few diseases that they have recently examined. Their aim is to update and simplify the list of diseases, to ensure that they reflect current scientific knowledge.
<P>

<a name="90111w18.html_para0">The Council has set up a dedicated sub-group--the Occupational Deafness Working Group to examine occupational deafness. This is to examine all the criteria for awarding benefit for occupational deafness. The group issued a consultation paper in August 1998 to obtain views on the jobs included for benefit purposes.
<P>

<a name="90111w18.html_para1">When they have finished their consideration, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council will report their conclusions and recommendations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Due to the number of prescribed diseases, there is likely to be more than one report. The timing of the Council's report is a matter for them.

Diabetic retinopathy is also the cause of 8.2 per cent. of registrations for partial sight among this age group.

<P>
<a name="90111w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The UK government, in negotiations on the new Structural Funds programme, have proposed that Objective 2 status be based on a range of indicators which would allow Member States to use their own national and regional criteria to target funds at areas of greatest need. These indicators represent measures of deprivation, the degree of social cohesion, the level and type of unemployment and geographical issues.

 My right hon. Friend has made no such order. The Highway Authority for Holywell High Street, part of a non-trunk road, is the appropriate local authority, and, in 1992, the former Clwyd County Council made the County Council of Clwyd (High Street and adjoining roads, Holywell) (Traffic Regulation) Order 1992.

 It is the UK, as member state, which makes a contribution to the EU budget.

 The promotion of good government worldwide is a priority for the Government and a central feature in building an ethical dimension in foreign policy. The British Council makes a valuable contribution to this policy in its work overseas in areas such as the promotion of democratic institutions and procedures, the reform of public sector institutions, the role of the media, legal systems and conflict resolution.

<a name="90111w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 From 1979 the British Council's grant-in-aid fluctuated considerably with reductions in 1979-80, 1980-81, 1986-87 and 1992-93. The most recent reduction was in 1996-97 when the grant-in-aid decreased by 6 per cent. in real terms. As a result the Council reduced its headquarters staff by 26 per cent., relocated its Manchester office and restructured overseas directorates. In spite of these fluctuations, the Council expanded its overseas network from 70 countries in 1979 to 109 in 1996 in response to changes in the international environment and the opportunities these opened up.

 The British Council has received a good response to its recruitment campaign for a new Director General. The Nomination Sub-Committee of the Board of the British Council expects to draw up a short list of candidates this month and to conduct final interviews in February. Given normal notice periods the Council hopes to have a new Director General in place by June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The FCO's annual survey of the work of the British Council demonstrates that the Council's English language work is making an increasingly important contribution to the objectives of British missions abroad. This work increases respect for British values and creates export opportunities for the UK, while being welcomed by host countries as a valued contribution to their communities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The British Council, as the UK's principal agency for cultural relations overseas, will continue to contribute to the achievement of the Government's foreign policy objectives for the foreseeable future. Working in close consultation with the FCO and through its skill and expertise, it will provide essential support to our overall diplomatic effort.

 We have no immediate plans to set up a Committee on Human Rights. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office receives full information on human rights violations abroad, including from UK official sources diplomatic reporting, international organisations and from non-governmental organisations, academic institutions and the media, including the BBC Monitoring Service from Caversham. The FCO also receives relevant human rights reports by other governments, including the State Department's Annual Report. All this information is routinely available to all FCO officials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 EU Member States adopted the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports as a political commitment rather than as a Joint Action or Common Position, which would have been legally binding. It would not therefore be appropriate to incorporate the Code of Conduct in UK law, especially as our national arms export licensing criteria, which are similar to those in the Code of Conduct, are not thus incorporated.

<a name="90111w22.html_para1">Under Integrated Emergency Management arrangements, local emergency planners develop non-specific and flexible plans designed to produce a multi-agency response to the effects of an incident irrespective of the cause. This approach is ideal for an incident such as the Eclipse which is not an unforeseen emergency, but is an event for which there has been sufficient time for local services to plan. There are arrangements to seek mutual aid, if required, from services in other areas and ultimately from the military.

 We intend to introduce statutory regulation for the private security industry as soon as possible. We will not be able to bring forward early legislation, as we warned before the election, but we completed a consultation exercise with the industry and others last year on the best way to provide a comprehensive, effective and streamlined system. We are determined to develop practical proposals which protect the safety and rights of the public without introducing unnecessary bureaucracy. We hope to bring forward firm proposals shortly.

<P>
<a name="90111w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 does not specifically provide a role for the private security industry. However, the requirement for local authorities and police in every area to produce strategies to reduce crime and disorder gives all members of the community--including the private security industry--the opportunity to make a contribution to the development and implementation of those strategies.

Where there is information suggesting that the applicant's presence in the United Kingdom would not be conducive to the public good, including any information about criminal convictions, this will be taken into account when considering the application.

 All main series reports produced by the Home Office Policing and Reducing Crime Unit are circulated with a short briefing note summarising the main findings and points for action. Occasionally, the Unit prepares a stand alone briefing note which may be an extended summary of a piece of work which we do not justify a full report, or as an interim report on a project which is attracting interest. There have been two publications in this Briefing Note series since January 1997:

 The table relates to the maximum grant payable to each local education authority (LEA) in respect of the 1997-98 financial year, expressed as a percentage of the total maximum grant payable to LEAs. The figures refer to projects for various educational purposes, in schools and in other sectors. The types of project vary between authorities.
<P>

<a name="90111w24.html_para2">Information is not held centrally in the form requested in the second part of my hon. Friend's Question. Reports are received annually on each project, showing the numbers of pupils, or others, covered. But, because support provided to an individual may be separately counted under different headings, aggregation of the figures may produce a misleading result.

The process was in line with the Nolan principles, including the involvement of an independent member on the interview panel. The post was advertised in the national press attracting a very strong field of over 200 applicants. Of these, seven demonstrating the strongest evidence of the core skills for the job, were selected for interview. The interview panel appointed Mike Trace as deputy because his background and expertise provided a valuable supporting role to the Co-ordinator.

On the basis of assumptions by the Inland Revenue on the numbers of children whose parents will be in receipt of Working Families Tax Credit, we estimate the approximate cost of <i>(c)</i> to be some &#163;410 million and of <i>(d)</i> to be &#163;210 million.

 The Government have set in place a range of policies designed to raise standards in all schools in England, including the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies, Education Development Plans, measures to tackle school and LEA failure, Education Action Zones and target setting by schools. These approaches are backed by the significant additional resources for schools announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review and are based on a range of evidence about what raises standards drawn from across the UK and internationally. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans for research of the type suggested.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w25.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department does not issue detailed guidance on this matter. However, reserves held by schools should be used effectively, and to this end the Department has encouraged local education authorities to recycle reserves through loan schemes, while preserving the right of schools to draw on their reserves when needed. Authorities are also permitted to require schools to report on the intended use of reserves in excess of a certain level as determined by the authority, so as to encourage a planned approach to the holding of reserves.

 These figures are not available. Provisions in the Education Act 1981, now consolidated into the Education Act 1996, require schools to submit information on numbers of pupils with special educational needs. In accordance with the recommendation of the Warnock Committee, there is no requirement for them to record the nature of the disability or learning difficulty and we have no current intention to require them to do so.

 The Curriculum for teacher training ensures that all teachers must be able to address pupils' personal, moral and social development.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will change the rules for compensatory payments in lieu of notice in cases where a firm becomes insolvent so that the ex-employee is paid the full amount to which they would have been entitled if they had been made redundant by a firm which was not insolvent.  [64564]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w28.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Payments in lieu of notice constitute damages for breach of an employee's contract, and the courts have established (<i>Westwood -v- Secretary of State for Employment 1984)</i> that they are subject to the common law principle of mitigation. This means that they may be reduced by income which the employee received, or could have received, during what should have been the notice period. Compensatory notice payments made on behalf of insolvent employers by my Department, under the Employment Rights Act 1996, are therefore calculated on the same basis. They are also subject to a statutory limit (currently &#163;220 per week) which is reviewed annually. There are no plans to abolish the limit as the statutory scheme is intended to provide only a basic level of protection for former employees of insolvent companies. Amounts owed above the statutory limit stand as a debt in the insolvency proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All pesticides, including organophosphorus (OP) compounds for use in grain stores, are regulated under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 or the Plant Protection Products Regulations 1995. Applicants wishing to gain approval for the use, sale, supply, storage and advertisement of such products are required to submit a substantive data package which is then subject to a rigorous assessment for safety and efficacy.
<P>

<a name="90111w29.html_para1">Pesticide active ingredients are subject to review either for routine purposes or because there is a specific concern. In May 1998, I announced a UK review of anticholinesterase compounds (including OPs) which will re-assess the risk that the use of such products present to consumers, workers and the environment.
<P>

<a name="90111w29.html_para2">The regulatory process includes an assessment of the effectiveness for use against the target pests for which approval and thus use is sought. Approval is only recommended if effectiveness is demonstrated. MAFF funded R&D has provided useful data by providing information about resistance to specific pesticides in farm and commercial grain stores. In 1996 the Advisory Committee on Pesticides concluded that information on the prevalence and control of resistant strains should be added to the labels of pesticides used in, amongst other areas, grain stores. This recommendation has been accepted by Ministers and implemented.

<i>The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Review Group</i>
<BR>
To review existing policies and legislation in England and Wales concerning the management and conservation of salmon, trout, eels and freshwater fish and make recommendations. The review and recommendations should take particular account of:
<BR>
the need to maintain, and where appropriate enhance, biodiversity;
<BR>
the need to maximise the economic, social and recreational benefits derived from salmon and freshwater fisheries, taking account both of the interests of local communities and local factors and traditions;
<BR>
the need for management of fisheries to be on a fully sustainable basis, taking account of the precautionary approach.
<BR>
The review should also consider other factors that may affect the development and sustainability of these fisheries.
<BR>
The review should examine the institutional arrangements for the regulation and management of these fisheries (including the role of the public sector, the need to involve all interested parties, and arrangements in tidal and coastal waters) and how best such arrangements can be funded.

 Effective enforcement of measures to conserve fish stocks, applied consistently throughout the Community, is a high priority for this Government. It was one of the main issues we focused on during our Presidency and as a result of our initiative new measures 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 117</I><P>
were adopted at the Fisheries Council in December 1998 which will improve fisheries control and enforcement in all Member States.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since 1996 there have been some 20 occasions on which British Sea Fishery Officers employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland have made official visits to other Member States. There have been 6 visits to the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has for future decommissioning schemes for the British fishing fleet.  [64166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have already announced that, following our Comprehensive Spending Review, we will be making a total of &#163;10.5 million available over the three years from 1999-2000 for a limited decommissioning scheme aimed primarily at those fleet segments where effort control is not an option under MAGP IV. I hope to be able to bring detailed proposals before the House early in the New Year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment his Department has made of the impact of decommissioning schemes in the last three years on the British fleet in terms of its <i>(a)</i> average age, <i>(b)</i> numbers of vessels, <i>(c)</i> overall effort of fleet, <i>(d)</i> effort of fleet by sector and <i>(e)</i> number of vessels by port; and if he will make a statement.  [64165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the last 3 years, decommissioning schemes have removed 385 vessels, representing 11,802.28 tonnes, or approximately 5.5 per cent. of the fleet in capacity terms.
<P>

<a name="90111w30.html_para1">The effort of this on the average age of the fleet is difficult to determine because of other variables involved, for example vessels leaving the fleet through natural wastage, sales to third counties, licence aggregations resulting in replacement vessels entering the fleet etc.
<P>

<a name="90111w30.html_para2">There are similar issues in relation to the effect of decommissioning on fishing effort (which is the product of capacity, measured as vessel tonnage and engine power, and time spent at sea). In the absence of controls on time at sea under MAGP III, vessels remaining in the fleet were free to adjust their fishing patterns in response to circumstances and total fleet effort showed only a small decline in this period. Under MAGP IV arrangements, effective from the beginning of 1998, the UK has explicit fishing effort targets for most of the major fleet segments and is currently conforming with these. Full details of these targets, and of UK outturn by segment and in total against MAGP III capacity targets are set out in Commission Decision 98/124/EC.
<P>

<a name="90111w30.html_para3">Further information on the impact of the four decommissioning rounds in the period 1993-1996 is contained in the September 1997 Economic Evaluation of the Fishing Vessels (Decommissioning) Schemes commissioned by UK Fisheries Departments from 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 1999 : Column: 118</I><P>
Nautilus Consultants, copies of which are available in the House Library and on the internet. This includes specific information on vessel numbers by port, age and type of vessels decommissioned etc.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment his Department has made of the merits of individual transferable quotas; and what plans he has to introduce such quotas to the United Kingdom fishing fleet.  [64162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Experience elsewhere has so far suggested that individual transferable quotas (ITQs) work best in single species fisheries or where stocks are under the jurisdiction of a single authority, though even in these cases they can lead to significant increases in enforcement costs, which are often passed on to the fishermen concerned in the form of licence charges. I am not currently aware of their successful use in the kinds of mixed fisheries typical of EU waters, or in situations where vessels of many countries fish the same stocks.
<P>

<a name="90111w30.html_para4">I do not therefore have any plans to introduce ITQs for the UK fleet, but remain willing to consider any viable option for improving fisheries management.
<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on what basis <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his Department's fisheries scientists calculated the effect of the precautionary principle for the purposes of negotiating the setting of the total allowable catches for 1999.  [64157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Over the last two years the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has been developing a new precautionary framework to its annual advice on total allowable catches (TACs) for fish stocks. UK fisheries scientists have contributed to this work. Reflecting progress made, this year's advice contains explicit suggested precautionary reference points in terms of spawning stock biomass and fishing mortality. Further work is needed to refine and develop the application of the precautionary approach but UK Ministers have taken account of ICES' suggested reference points in developing the United Kingdom's approach to the setting of 1999 TACs.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 7 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>103</i>, what assessment he has made of the proposal from the European Commission to ban the use of four antibiotic growth promoters from 1 January 1999.  [64123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w30.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The proposal was put to the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 14 December 1998. We supported the proposal, which is designed to reduce the risk of the build up of microbial resistance to antibiotics in animals and man. It was possible that the abrupt introduction of the ban would adversely affect animal health and welfare, leading to an unnecessary increase in the use of therapeutic antibiotics. The ban will not therefore come into effect until 1 July 1999, giving livestock producers time to adapt to the loss of the four growth promoters. The proposal, as agreed, is in line with advice the Government have received from the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) and the Veterinary Products Committee that the use of antibiotics which may impair the efficacy of prescribed therapeutic antibiotics used in human medicine through the development of resistant strains of organisms should be phased out.

<a name="90111w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have not received any representations about the level of the EU import tariff on American sugar. The current level was set as part of the EU's obligations agreed under the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations concluded in 1994. Under these obligations the level of import tariff is reduced annually from 1995-2000 (a total reduction of 20 per cent.). In addition to this tariff the EU can, when the import price falls below an agreed level, apply an additional safeguard duty to protect EU producers. The most recent change in the safeguard duty for white sugar was on 2 December 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures gives members, including the European Community, the right to take measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health which are based on scientific principles and which do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between members where identical or similar conditions prevail. The Community's import requirements for animal products, which seek to ensure that imports are produced to at least the same standard as Community production, are an example of such measures.
<P>

<a name="90111w31.html_para1">In accordance with the provisions on recognition of equivalence in the WTO Agreement, the Community has entered into specific bilateral agreements with certain third countries which formally recognise that their respective systems of sanitary measures are intended to provide similar health assurances. These agreements, such as the Agreement between the European Community and the USA on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in trade in live animals and animal products, include provisions enabling both parties to verify compliance by way of on-site checks and inspections.

 This information is not available. However, figures provided by the European Commission on the checks carried out at Border Inspection Posts in 10 Member States in the first half of 1997 show that 3.69 per cent. of consignments of fresh meat, including offal, and meat products and 2.00 per cent. of poultry meat and poultry meat products were rejected on arrival. In the period 1 January to 30 September 1998, 1.5 per cent. of consignments of animal products of all types were rejected at UK Border Inspection Posts. Not all rejections are due to non-compliance with standards of production in the country of origin.

<P>

<a name="90111w32.html_para0">The Council agreed unanimously, with Italy abstaining, the total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas to apply in 1999 in Community waters. Details of the final TACs are in the following table. In some cases, there are significant reductions compared with 1998; in other cases, the final figures are higher than the Commission's proposals or the 1998 TACs; in all cases, the UK sought a balance between the need to be cautious in the management of stocks for their long-term benefit and the need to take account of the practical realities for fishermen and short-term socio-economic pressures on them. At the end of the negotiations, the total UK quotas agreed were some 57,000 tonnes higher in cod equivalent terms than the quotas being discussed at the start of the negotiations. This increase is worth some &#163;30 million to the industry, although overall there has been a net year-on-year reduction in fishing opportunities in order to conserve stocks for the future.
<P>

<a name="90111w32.html_para1">I invoked The Hague Preference on all the stocks where it was necessary to do so.

As a result of close co-operation with the Irish Republic, we secured an additional 2,400 tonnes of quota for UK Irish Sea fishermen which will be especially beneficial in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90111w32.html_para3">We were also very pleased to secure as part of the package the separation of the small Shetland coastal sandeel fishery from the North Sea sandeel TAC and helpful Commission statements on two UK initiatives: a Commission commitment to propose the introduction of a new TAC for dogfish and a commitment to respond to concern about the effects of sandeel fishing on birds and other wildlife.

<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The selective cull, which removes cattle which have been exposed to BSE through contaminated feed, has been operating since January 1997. Since maternal transmission was confirmed as a possibility, a further cull has been initiated to slaughter offspring born after 1 August 1996 to confirmed BSE cases. This has operated on a voluntary basis since August 1998 and became compulsory on 4 January 1999. It has been estimated that, at most, 10,000 animals might need to be slaughtered under the arrangements. Inevitably, this estimate rests on assumptions about the future course of

the epidemic and the number of offspring found to be already dead. The final number may well be considerably less.
<P>

<a name="90111w33.html_para0">Before beef exports can resume under the Date Based Export Scheme, the UK must slaughter all living offspring born between 1 August 1996 and the date of the EC Decision on the DBES (25 November 1998) to confirmed BSE cases. This is likely to be at least 3,500 animals.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to reduce the disincentives to tenants from moving from Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancies to farm business tenancies under the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995.  [64731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There are no plans to re-visit the agricultural holdings legislation. The Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 offers considerable flexibility for parties to negotiate farm business tenancies that best suit their respective interests.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many tenancies have been negotiated, in each year, since the coming into force of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995.  [64727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Precise information is not available. The Annual Survey of Tenanted Land is a sample survey and does not allow a definitive overall number of tenancies to be given. However, the results of a policy evaluation, conducted by the University of Plymouth in 1996 and published in January 1998, indicated that some 5,000 new tenancies had been created in the first year since the Act came into force.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what impact the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 has had on encouraging new entrants into the agricultural industry.  [64729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A policy evaluation was conducted by the University of Plymouth in 1996 and its findings published in January 1998. This showed that some 5,000 tenancies were created in the first year of the Act, covering about 200,000 hectares of land. A copy of the report was placed in the House Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will amend the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 to allow landlords and tenants to agree that the provisions of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 will apply to the agricultural holding.  [64732]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There are no plans to amend the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. The flexibility available under the Act enables parties to tailor their tenancy agreements according to their respective needs. If they wish to do so, many features of a tenancy under the 1986 Act could be included.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 An independent policy evaluation was carried out in 1996 by the University of Plymouth. A copy of the report was placed in the Library of the House in January 1998. There are no immediate plans to carry out a further review.

<a name="90111w33.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the research on the use of electric plates to purify air in hen houses; and what plans he has to introduce a similar system in the United Kingdom.  [64844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90111w33.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Ministry is aware of the research, most of which has been carried out in the United States over the last 15 years. The electric plate technique has some limitations and is not widely used in the UK. Other methods for controlling dust, such as misting systems, are beginning to be introduced into the UK broiler industry.
