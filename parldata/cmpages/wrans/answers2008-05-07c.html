<notus-date day="7" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>7 May 2008 : Column 886W</b><br>
the daytime index for aircraft noise. 57 dBA Leq (measured over 07.00-23.00 period) was adopted as representing the onset of annoyance, although the Government acknowledged that there can be no absolute measure of disturbance from aircraft noise given the variation in individual reactions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="80507w0001.htm_para2"><a name="08050784000078">This decision followed publication of the report &#147;United Kingdom Aircraft Noise Index Study&#148; (ANIS) in 1985 and subsequent consultation on its findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="80507w0001.htm_para3"><a name="08050784000079">In 2001 the Department commissioned the &#147;Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources&#148; (ANASE) study to update the ANIS research. The conclusions of this study (which were announced by the Secretary of State on 2 November 2007) indicated that whilst it is highly probable that annoyance with a particular level of aircraft noise is higher than found in the ANIS study, it showed no evidence of a particular threshold at which it becomes a serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="80507w0001.htm_para4"><a name="08050784000080">However, in terms of making quantitative comparisons between the results from ANASE and the earlier ANIS study, expert peer reviewers of the ANASE study advised that &#147;reliance on the detailed outcome of ANASE would be misplaced&#148; and that they would &#147;counsel against using the detailed results and conclusions from ANASE in the development of government policy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="80507w0001.htm_para5"><a name="08050784000081">Although the report does not provide evidence for replacing the figure of 57 dBA Leq (16 hours) with a lower or higher figure, we believe it is right to retain this figure as a safeguard for those who are most affected by aircraft noise. In the &#147;Future of Air Transport&#148; White Paper the Government gave a commitment that further development of Heathrow could only be considered if it resulted in no net increase in the total area of the 57 Leq dBA noise contour compared with summer 2002, an area of 127 sq km. That commitment stands and the ability to meet it is a key consideration, in the &#147;Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport&#148; consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="80507w0001.htm_para6"><a name="08050784000082">Additionally, as we announced when the ANASE study was released, pending the availability of a better alternative we will apply existing valuation for road and rail noise when assessing the economic impact of noise in the cost- benefit analysis of future aviation projects. We have taken this approach in the case of &#147;Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport&#148; consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="80507w0001.htm_para7"><a name="08050784000083">The Department is taking forward work to follow up the ANASE findings with the Aircraft Noise Monitoring Advisory Committee (ANMAC), whose role is to advise the Department on policy relating to aircraft noise at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.</p>

They would also need to take account of the extensive evidence in the level of over-valuation experienced under the previous system based on individual valuations. DEFRA held discussions with members of the Cattle Compensation Advisory Group about possible modifications to the new system without reaching any consensus. Discussions have also taken place with representatives from the organic farming sector to consider their view that system enhancements are needed for organically produced cattle.</p>

A number of national and local members of Wildlife Trusts are active members of different workstreams within the strategy and have the opportunity to offer their views on climate change and to influence the workstreams plans towards adaptation. In 2007 the UK Biodiversity Partnership Standing Committee published &#147;Conserving Biodiversity&#151;the UK Approach&#148; a new strategic framework for the UK biodiversity action plan, which identified shared priorities for action for priority species and habitats, acknowledging the need to help biodiversity respond to climate change.

Friend the Under Secretary of State will be writing soon, in response to an issue you raised during the recent debate on the commemorations of the 100<sup>(th)</sup> anniversary of the Territorial Army, to explain that the premiums for SLI are the same for the TA as for regulars and that RPAX will remain cheaper than PAX even when the premium increase has been applied.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not have responsibility for a departmental pension scheme. UK civil servants employed by the FCO are members of the central Principal Civil Service Pensions Scheme (PCSPS). The PCSPS has published details of unfunded liabilities in present value terms in its annual resource accounts since 2000-2001. Because the assumptions underlying estimates of unfunded liabilities, for example life expectancy, vary, they are not directly comparable from year to year.</p>

 The Taking Part survey is run by DCMS in partnership with four of our NDPBs&#151;Sport England, Arts Council England, English Heritage, and the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. Together, we have committed to running the survey for a further three years, beginning in July 2008.</p>

The survey methodology will therefore remain broadly similar to that of previous years, that is, continuous face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of adults aged 16 and above and children living in private households in England.</p>

 Multidimensional treatment foster care (MTFC) is an intervention for looked after children and young people with complex needs who are already displaying severe levels of challenging and antisocial behaviour or who are experiencing high levels of placement instability. The first grant-funded pilot programmes were developed for adolescents and have been followed by those for younger children. The programme for adolescents is being rigorously evaluated through a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This is a complex evaluation as it is one of the first such trials to be conducted in services for looked after children and will report early in 2010. It will help us establish whether this treatment intervention is more effective and cost-effective than services as usual for this very vulnerable group of looked after children. Depending on the findings we will consider what further capacity should be developed to meet the needs of looked after children and young people. While waiting for the evaluation results we are conducting an annual audit of progress to provide feedback to pilot sites and learn from experiences to date.</p>

 The Government accepted all the recommendations made in the Byron Review report &#145;Safer Children in a Digital World,&#146; published on 27 March 2008. In a written ministerial statement on the same date, we committed to producing a comprehensive action plan in response to the recommendations. In developing that plan, the cost of implementation, as well as lead responsibilities and key delivery milestones, will be given more detailed consideration. The action plan will be published in due course. Taking forward the Review&#146;s recommendations will not always involve new or discreet action. In many areas Dr. Byron recommended building e-safety into planned activities and services for which funding has already been agreed, for example, that existing information services for parents should include advice on e-safety.</p>

With four years to go, decisions are yet to be made on who will participate in the celebrations, but we want to make sure that they will be a spectacular showcase of Britain's best.

3. Graduates include anyone with educational and vocational degree level qualifications, in line with established definitions.<br>
4. Weekly income amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole pound.<br>
5. Median incomes have been presented. We have used median rather than mean as a measure of average incomes because they are less influenced by extreme values.<br>
6. Three year averages of median incomes are presented as single year estimates are considered too volatile. These figures have been adjusted to account for the effect of inflation. This is consistent with the presentation of median incomes in the Households Below Average Income Publication.<br>

5. Three year averages of median incomes are presented as single year estimates are considered too volatile. These figures have been adjusted to account for the effect of inflation. This is consistent with the presentation of median incomes in the Households Below Average Income publication.<br>

 The Government have no plans to review convictions involving the use of low template DNA evidence. A review of low template DNA techniques, commissioned by the Independent Forensic Science Regulator and led by Professor Brian Caddy, Emeritus Professor of Forensic Science at Strathclyde university, was published on 11 April. The overall finding of the review is that the science supporting the delivery of low template DNA profiling is sound. Any individual who alleges that he or she is the victim of a miscarriage of justice may apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body, for it to consider the case. The Commission has the power to refer any cases where there is a real possibility that the conviction or sentence will not be upheld to the appropriate court, which will treat the reference as a new appeal.</p>

 An audit of education in secure accommodation carried out by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) in 2002 identified the need for Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators (SENCOs), and funding was obtained by the YJB to ensure that each Young Offenders Institution has the support of a SENCO. This requirement is incorporated into the Offenders Learning Journey (Juvenile) which sets out the delivery of learning and skills services to young offenders in custody in England. The Learning and Skills Council are also currently undertaking a review process which will ascertain the level and range of educational need for offenders in each custodial and community setting, thus informing the range and types of provision to be commissioned. We expect the reviews to include an analysis of the level of need for learners with learning difficulties and disability.</p>

 While sentencing in any individual case is a matter entirely for the court, the Government believe that prison should be reserved for serious and dangerous offenders. Other offenders are normally better punished in the community. The Government introduced the generic community order for adults in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill currently going through Parliament will create the youth rehabilitation order, a broadly similar sentence for juveniles. Such orders enable the courts to choose from a wide range of requirements so as to effectively meet the circumstances of the offence and the offender. They should enable the courts to have greater confidence in community sentences and to use them instead of custody in all cases other than when custody really is the only punishment that will meet the circumstances of the offence.</p>

<sup>(2 )</sup>The large increases between 2002-03 and 2005-06 were as a result of positive action by the Metropolitan Police Service to increase the number of non-sanction detections. The issue of new rules from 1 April 2007, have severely limited the number of incidences when they can be applied. The Metropolitan police had anticipated these changes, issuing their own policy during 2006-07 that limited the use of non-sanction detections, this leading to a significant reduction in non-sanction detection numbers for that year.<br>
<sup>(3 )</sup>It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the percentage change in detection rates have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detections rates over time are not fully comparable. From April 1 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.<br>

 The response to the consultation that the Department published on 24 January is a summary of responses, and not a detailed work programme. This is made clear in the document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="80507w0029.htm_para0"><a name="08050811000737">The identification of five priority areas (mental health, community services, critical care, urgent and emergency care and long term conditions) for future work by the Payment by Results (PbR) team was based on responses received to the consultation and available development resources. The five areas referred to each received more than 24 responses identifying them as priorities. Sexual health services received only a fraction of this level of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="80507w0029.htm_para1"><a name="08050811000738">However, the Government set a target to offer everyone who needs it an appointment at a genito-urinary medicine clinic within 48 hours by March 2008. In February 2008, 97 per cent. of patients were offered an appointment to be seen, and 84 per cent. were seen within 48 hours. In May 2005, only 45 per cent. were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="80507w0029.htm_para2"><a name="08050811000739">Although sexual health was not highlighted as a national priority for PbR in the recent consultation exercise, this does not preclude local work being undertaken. The consultation encouraged local areas to apply to be development sites to pilot and evaluate local currencies for services outside the scope of the national tariff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_627"><a name="80507w0029.htm_para3"><a name="08050811000740">As a result, there are two developments sites looking at sexual health issues. One project, supported by the Department's sexual health team, is working to develop a tariff for HIV outpatients. The other project involves Portsmouth City Teaching Primary Care Trust investigating appropriate funding models for contraception services.</p>

 Since summer 2007, the three successful whole system demonstrator (WSD) sites (Kent, Cornwall and Newham), have been engaged with a consortium of leading United Kingdom research institutions in a period of detailed methodology and process planning in order to define the evaluation design for the programme. In addition, the sites have been working to finalise their detailed implementation and delivery plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="80507w0029.htm_para9"><a name="08050811000755">From April 2008, people have started to provide their consent to involvement in the trial and implementation is now under way. Following the consent of an individual there are several steps before mainstream service begins, e.g. eligibility confirmation, home visit, base-line evaluation interview, installation of equipment and training. The roll-out is planned to build month by month over the first year, with the lessons learned in the early phase helping to optimise the process.</p>

Each site however, has to work with a large number of stakeholder organisations. Age Concern, Breathe Easy and the Alzheimer's Society are also informing the roll-out. Similarly, a number of software suppliers provide the site legacy systems and are involved in the implementation.</p>

 I can confirm that the revision of the Prostate Cancer Risk Management programme (PCRMP) was discussed at my meeting with representatives of the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action on 7 November 2007.

This revision is ongoing, and an exercise seeking the views of key stakeholders will take place on the revised materials in May 2008 prior to the relaunch of the PCRMP in June 2008.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> Missing data.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. The England and regional totals are estimates based on the figures from 150 P1 proformas.<br>
2. Figures may not add up because of rounding.<br>
3. Regional and national totals may not be equal to the sum of the council level figures due to the use of estimates when the council did not fully complete the return.<br>
4. All figures presented are rounded to the nearest 10, 100 or 1,000. The precise rounding rules are:<br>
<i> For national and regional totals:</i><br>
Data: Rounding rule<br>
Over 10,000: Rounding to nearest 1,000<br>
Between 100 and 10,000: Rounded to nearest 100<br>
Under 50: Rounded to nearest 10.<br>
5. There are some issues to be aware of when comparing the data over time:<br>
Since 2002-03, clients who were formally in receipt of higher rates of income support under the Department for Work and Pensions preserved rights scheme and who transferred to council support on 8 April 2002 have been included in the referrals, assessments and packages of care return. Clients that were in receipt of preserved rights but who were already being partially supported by councils were previously included in the data and are not considered as clients formerly in receipt of preserved rights. This mainly effects clients in residential care.<br>
Guidance relating to clients receiving services was restated for 2004-05 to only include clients who are assessed by social services and have a care plan. In previous years, some councils included clients receiving services from grant-funded organisations without a community care assessment and therefore the 2004-05 data is not comparable to previous years. Additional clarification was also given on the recording of some types of services. These amendments mainly affect clients receiving community&#151;based services.<br>

 The primary responsibility for development control within an area rests with the local planning authority. It is for the authority to decide in the first instance, with particular regard to the provisions of the statutory Development Plan and any other material considerations, whether a particular development should take place. The Secretary of State rarely intervenes in the consideration of individual planning applications and then only when planning issues of national or regional significance are involved. To do so more often would be to undermine the responsibility of local authorities for planning in their area.</p>

Officers at the Government Office for the East of England (GO East) studied the Council&#146;s Planning Committee Report for this proposal and were satisfied that the decision to grant planning permission would be made in accordance with local plan policy and, in view of the fact that the planning issues raised were of no more than local significance, it was considered that the Secretary of State&#146;s intervention was not be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_686"><a name="80507w0034.htm_para6"><a name="08050827000267">Now that planning permission has been granted, there is no set procedure by which the Secretary of State can intervene.

In this instance, and for the reasons given above, such action would not be justified. It is now for Castle Point borough council to monitor the development to ensure that it is carried out in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.</p>
