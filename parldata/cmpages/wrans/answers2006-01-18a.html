It is this Department&#039;s policy to support any development proposals with the same level of background information that would be required under the statutory planning system.

The Government was aware of the existence of legitimate South African chemical and biological defence programmes from the 1980s.

More detailed evidence of previous offensive activities was received in the years leading up to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in 1998, when further details of the offensive activities emerged.

This comprehensive approach includes prevention, care and treatment as well as recognising the impact AIDS has on society, including increasing orphan rates. DFID&#039;s expenditure reporting reflects this comprehensive approach and given the aid instruments we use, it is not possible to disaggregate between moneys spent on treatment and those used for other AIDS related activities.

Parties at the meeting in March, this year, will consider a recommendation by the convention&#039;s subsidiary body for scientific technical and technological advice to reaffirm the previous decision. The subsidiary body&#039;s recommendation also encourages parties to continue to undertake further research on the impacts of GURTS and to share information from these studies and addresses capacity building for decision making in developing countries. Parties at the meeting will also consider a report on related matters from one of the convention&#039;s inter-sessional working groups before deciding what further decision is appropriate.

<a name="stpa_26">Our position at the meeting will take full account of these reports, as well as the EU&#039;s own regulatory regime which requires that no GM seed may be marketed in the EU unless it has been specifically approved by the member states. Decisions on applications to market GMOs are made on a case-by-case basis taking full account of a scientific assessment of the particular GMO and the risks associated with its use against the criteria in the EU legislation. An application for a GMO incorporating GURTs would be dealt with in the same way as any other GMO. Approval would only be granted if the evidence showed that a deliberate release of the GMO would not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60118w04.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department funds an extensive programme of research into the causes, effects and control of air pollution and air quality. Since 2001, the Department has operated between 50 (in 2000&#150;01) and 65 (in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05) individual research and non-research contracts. These are spread across five research programmes&#151;strategic policy analysis; eutrophication and acidification; photochemical pollution; toxic air pollutants; and ambient air&#151;with a total value of around &#163;10 million per year. Details of the individual contracts, including total value, lead contractor and final reports (where applicable), can be accessed via the UK National Air Quality Information Archive: http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/contracts/index.php; the majority of contracts span between three and five years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w04.html_para2">
In 2005, Defra developed a draft Evidence and Innovation strategy, in order to ensure that research programme continued to support and inform departmental priorities. The Department has undertaken a consultation process on its draft strategy, which closed on 12 January. The consultation document can be accessed via the internet (http://defraweb/science/how/strategy.htm). The strategy splits also the air pollution research programme into five categories:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">quantifying the exposure of human populations and/or ecosystems to pollutants through measurement and modelling</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">assessing the relative contributions to these exposures from source sectors both in the UK and elsewhere</p>
</ul>
<p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government are taking to encourage manufacturers and retailers to reduce packaging waste, with particular reference to supermarkets.  [41988]</p>




<p><a name="st_42"><a name="60118w06.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Last year the Government launched the Courtauld Commitment, a voluntary agreement between 13 major retailers and WRAP to reduce packaging waste. There are three broad objectives to meet, which are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">i. to design out packaging waste growth by 2008;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">ii. to deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">iii. to identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_41">The are also two sets of Regulations which cover packaging in the UK both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they use around their products. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w06.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_42">Although legislation is one way of reducing packaging consumers also have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought &#039;loose&#039; food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers would be more inclined to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.

 It is Government policy to focus on reducing the environmental impacts of pesticides rather than the total amount of pesticide used.

 The Department has not made these assessments and studies.

It is therefore for the regulator to set emission limits and other permit conditions according to the general principles of those Regulations that installations should be operated in such a way that <i>(a)</i> all the appropriate preventative measures are taken against pollution, in particular through application of the best available techniques; and <i>(b)</i> no significant pollution is caused. Those principles apply irrespective of the type of fuel and provide a high level of protection for the environment.

At the request of the Palestinian Authority, the Department for International Development, together with the World Bank, is providing technical assistance with the preparation of such a plan. It will be important that the plan is effectively implemented and that the international community lends its full support.

 The Home Secretary is today making a statement on the measures the Government are taking to address identity fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w10.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_63">But I want to inform the House of the detailed action HMRC is taking to identify and root out identity fraud and to work with banks to address a problem HMRC investigations have identified and about which they are in discussion with banks-that is, the use of stolen identities to set up bank accounts under false pretences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_64">As a result of investigations by HMRC and DWP, DWP was alerted to the false use of the names of a number of DWP staff in setting up bank accounts under false pretences and then making fraudulent claims. On 2 December 2005 DWP and HMRC announced that a criminal investigation had been launched. At the same time, HMRC suspended the internet service with immediate effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">Over the past six weeks DWP investigators and HMRC compliance officers have undertaken detailed inquiries. While one initial estimate was that up to 13,000 staff might have been affected by the identity theft, it is now established that some 8,800 staff identities may have been stolen in 2003&#150;04 and that of these 6,800 have been used in an attempt to defraud the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Jan 2006 : Column 1358W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
tax credits system in autumn 2005. Of the 6,800 fraudulent claims, around 4,100 were fully intercepted by HMRC before any payment, so that no payment was made. Of the remaining 2,700 claims where tax credit payments were made into multiple bank accounts using the stolen identities payments were suspended immediately they were discovered, and all payments were suspended by 16 December 2005. Swift action addressed the risk of higher losses, limiting the loss from this fraud to an estimated &#163;2.7 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_66">In a statement issued alongside National Statistics published on 23 December 2005, HMRC stated that a number of criminal investigations were under way. As a result of these investigations, which are ongoing, HMRC have uncovered evidence that banks have been the victims of multiple bank accounts opened under false pretences-using the names of individuals whose identities were stolen. With HMRC informing the banks of this fraud, the banks concerned will be addressing the issues we are raising with them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w10.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_67">As previously announced on 23 December 2005 we are subjecting around 30,000 claims to detailed further investigation, although not all of these are likely to be fraudulent. This includes the use of staff information stolen from Network Rail and which then led to bank accounts created for Network Rail employees under false pretences. Our detailed investigations have so far resulted in at least 16,000 claims being stopped, with information being referred to the National Criminal. Intelligence Service, which will form part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) on 1 April 2006. I will keep the House informed in a manner consistent with the ongoing criminal investigation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60118w10.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_68">New measures already announced in the pre-Budget report will result in a doubling of the number of pre-payment checks carried out on new claims. In addition, I have offered the banking sector and other financial institutions the help and expertise of HMRC in detecting such identity fraud, and ensuring that sufficient checks are in place to prevent fraudsters from opening bank accounts using stolen identities. We will continue to work with them to help tackle the problem. HMRC will also, seek to contact companies or individuals where it finds evidence that they might have been targeted by such fraudsters and work with them to assist in the investigation.

* Guide to quality:<br>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>

The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV eg for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent., we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

Key:<br>

CV &lt; = 5 per cent.<br>

* CV&gt;5 per cent. and&lt; = 10 per cent.<br>

** CV&gt; 10 per cent. and&lt; =20 per cent.<br>

X unreliable&#151;CV &gt; 20 per cent. or unavailable<br>

Background notes:<br>

(a) The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, (ASHE), carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees.<br>

(b) Average gross hourly earnings for All Employees whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.<br>

(c) The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

Increased support has been provided through the services of the Occupational Health Provider and Employee Assistance Programme.

Notes:<br>

1. Due to limitations with currently available management information, we are not able to disaggregate the information to the required geographical level following the introduction of the new child support IT system.<br>

2. The table only includes old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment. Those with a punitive interim maintenance assessment are excluded from this analysis, in line with the Agency&#039;s target definition.<br>

3. Case compliance is defined as all those cases which are open and have paid money via the collection service in Scotland over the preceding quarter, expressed as a percentage of all those (currently open) cases which are charged maintenance via the CSA collection service in Scotland (either regular maintenance and/or arrears) over the same quarter.<br>

4. Cash compliance is defined as the total sum of maintenance received via the CSA collection service in the preceding quarter expressed as a percentage of the total amount of maintenance due over the same period.<br>

<a name="stpa_82">In the new scheme, when a maintenance calculation is first calculated, the net weekly income of a non-resident parent consists only of the types of income specified in the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 (SI 2001/155). These are an employee&#039;s or self-employed person&#039;s earnings, tax credits and payments from occupational or personal pension schemes.

<a name="stpa_83">However, income from capital can be taken into account as a result of Regulations 18 and 19 of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000 (SI 2001/156). Under Regulation 18, where a non-resident parent has significant assets, a parent with care can apply to have them taken into account. This applies where the assets are worth more than &#163;65,000.

<p>
<a name="60118w12.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_84">In addition, from April 2005, Regulation 19 has been amended, so that in certain circumstances a variation can be made where a non-resident parent receives income from a business or company in a form which is normally ignored in the maintenance calculation. This applies where the non-resident parent receives such income of more than &#163;100 a week and has the ability to control their income, for example, as a company director receiving income in the form of dividends. So payments from such capital resources can be taken into account.

<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60118w15.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Fees and Charges Regulation, which came into force on 1 June 2005, requires that applications for a number of approvals and certificates can only be made to the European Civil Aviation Agency and that only the Agency can charge for the technical investigations needed to support the grant of such applications, even when a national authority carries out the work on its behalf. In such cases, the work is set up and paid for under the terms of agency/authority contracts. The manner of implementation of these processes has affected the Agency&#039;s ability to undertake their certification tasks in a timely and efficient way. There has also been some knock-on effect on other Agency activities as staff have been allocated to help deal with the demands of the fees and charges system.

 The financial and budgetary requirements governing the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) follow general Community principles as applied to Community Agencies. EASA&#039;s requirements are set down in Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 as subsequently amended by Regulation (EC) No. 1643/2003.

<a name="stpa_111">The Regulation provides that Agency revenues will comprise a contribution from Community funds, fees paid by certificate applicants and holders and charges for publications, training and any other services provided by the Agency. In principle the fees revenue should cover the full costs of delivering EASA&#039;s certification functions. However, the Regulation provided that until 31 December 2006 the contribution from Community funds might be used to cover expenditure related to the initial running phase of the Agency, including some of the cost of the Agency&#039;s certification functions.

The Agency concluded that its estimated income would fail to cover costs unless remedial measures were put in place. The Agency proposed cutting back and prioritising its certification tasks in line with the estimated income. The UK Civil Aviation Authority prepared for the UK member of the management board a detailed analysis of the Agency&#039;s assessment and proposals which agreed that the estimated income would not cover all the certification tasks which the Agency should carry out in 2006. The Authority advised that cutting back the certification tasks would cause major problems for industry and be unacceptable.

 The Regulation establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency came into force in September 2002 and the Agency assumed responsibility for its tasks 12 months thereafter. At that time the Agency relied almost entirely on the Commission and the aviation authorities of member states for the resources and data it needed to execute those responsibilities.

 Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) is allocated to Local Transport Authorities in England on the basis of population numbers living in rural areas. The grant is used by authorities to provide new and enhanced rural bus services and other services to improve rural accessibility, for example demand responsive transport or taxibus services. Decisions on which services to support are a matter for each authority. The Department does not collect information on the particular towns served as a result of these decisions. However, monitoring returns for 2003&#150;04 show that in that year RBSG was used to support a total of about 2,200 services on which over 29 million passenger journeys were made (data for 2004&#150;05 is currently being collected).

<sup>(23)</sup> Figures are reported using cash terms as submitted by the LEA on 13 January 2006.<br>





<sup>(24)</sup> Includes planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with statements and the provision for non-statemented pupils with SEN, support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad, educational psychology service, LA functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, assessment and co-ordination. Also included is the funding delegated to local authority maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget for special schools. The figures recorded against &quot;notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might by spent by schools on SEN. Not included is any budgeted SEN transport expenditure.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> The total number of pupils with SEN as at January 2005 is calculated as the combination of all pupils in special schools (maintained and non-maintained), all pupils in maintained schools with statements, SEN pupils without statements in maintained schools and pupils in independent schools and academies with statements. These figures are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census and Form 8B and are rounded to the nearest 10 pupils.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> The latest financial data available are Budget data for financial year 2005&#150;06 while the pupil numbers are as at January 2005. Consequently there is a mismatch between academic and financial year pupils with the denominator for the unit cost being the number of pupils with SEN on the census date in January of the 2005&#150;06 financial year.<br>

<sup>(27)</sup> The unit cost calculated by dividing planned expenditure on SEN by the number of pupils with SEN obscures a much larger range of costs and is a mixture of all the education costs for children in maintained special schools and just the SEN part of the education of children in other settings.<br>

<sup>(28)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and may not sum due to rounding.<br>

Note:<br>

Financial data are taken from local authorities&#039; 2005&#150;06 Section 52 Budget Statements submitted to the DfES while pupil numbers are drawn from the January 2005 DfES Annual Schools Census and Form 8b.<br>

 The Department has not received any formal representations on the effectiveness of personal dental services (PDS) agreements. The evidence of pilot PDS agreements, now covering 35 per cent. of dentists, is that when a dentist&#039;s national health service earnings are no longer directly related to individual treatments, he or she are able to plan to plan simpler and more appropriate courses of treatment. This frees up time and capacity that can be used to spend more time with patients, adopt a more preventive approach to dentistry, and improve management of workload.

Assessing cost-effectiveness depends on what criteria are used to measure outputs or outcomes. Any assessment based on measuring individual items of treatment would not take into account the benefits for patients of simpler and more appropriate courses of treatment and a greater focus on oral health promotion. In the future, the cost effectiveness of contracts could be assessed by comparing expenditure with courses of treatment, numbers of patients accessing services and improvements in oral health.

At our request, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a guideline, in 2004, on the most appropriate clinical treatment for people with fertility problems. That guideline did not refer to restricting in vitro fertilization treatment to women aged 30 and over. The primary responsibility for the provision of infertility services rests with the national health service at local level. We are discussing with Infertility Network UK, the leading voluntary organisation representing the interests of fertility patients, ways in which they can work with primary care trusts to help ensure that the patient&#039;s voice is heard when decisions about the provision of services are made at local level.

However, we do not believe that such licensing is a realistic solution to the problems of opium cultivation in Afghanistan, not least because it risks a high level of diversion of licit opium into illegal channels. It is clear from the feasibility study, as well as expert opinion, that Afghanistan currently does not meet the prerequisites necessary to control licit cultivation.

Proposals for changes to the IWC&#039;s Financial Regulation would (if made) not come into effect until after they had been agreed by IWC58 and cannot therefore affect the position of those countries who, but for outstanding debt, might attend IWC58 and seek to exercise voting rights at that meeting.
