 The decision to abolish the Overseas Price Mechanism was taken in the autumn of 2007 as part of the broader agreement for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the 2007 comprehensive spending review. The OPM protected the FCO from currency fluctuations but it did not provide the Department with the incentive to factor in medium-term changes in currency costs when it allocated its resources. As part of the CSR07 agreement, the Treasury allowed the FCO to engage in forward currency markets to better manage short-term currency risk.

 As part of the requirement for the Defence Training Review (DTR) Package 1, Metrix will transform and modernise existing training, which will involve the re-accreditation of any transformed modules. This re-accreditation will be led by Nord Anglia, the Open university and City and Guilds, who are all respected and leading accreditation specialists. For the Defence college of Aeronautical Engineering, and all the technical training under Package 1, any existing accreditation will remain in place until a re-designed package is approved by the Ministry of Defence, which includes any proposals for changes to apprenticeship training.</p>

 The capacity and capability of all three UK naval bases (Clyde, Devonport and Portsmouth) are regularly assessed to ensure that they individually and collectively meet the requirements of the Royal Navy. The most recent assessment was carried out as part of the Naval Base Review (NBR), which concluded in July 2007 that all three naval bases should be retained but optimised. This optimisation work has begun at each naval base and forms an integral part of the Maritime Change Programme (MCP). MCP is developing an enduring maritime enterprise, commensurate with the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS), that delivers affordable, sustainable and efficient Maritime build, equipment and through life support to meet the operational needs of the Royal Navy today and in the future.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 March 2009]:</i> Recreational beekeepers, who form a substantial majority of beekeepers in the UK, play an important role in helping to combat the decline in the honey bee population, both in terms of ensuring that they practice good husbandry to maintain and increase bee numbers, and through recognising the risks of spreading pests and diseases to other beekeepers if they fail to take action. The recent National Audit Office report highlighted the large numbers of recreational beekeepers who are unknown to the authorities and so who could be unaware of the risks of spread of pests and disease. An additional &#163;2.3 million funding was announced by the Secretary of State in January to support implementation of the initial phase of a 10 year plan to protect and improve the health of honey bees. This involves new work aimed at gaining a more accurate picture of the numbers and distribution of beekeepers and the status of the health of their colonies and increasing significantly the proportion of beekeepers registered on the National Bee Unit&#146;s Beebase database in England.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 March 2009]:</i> International trade in honeybees poses a risk of movements of pests and diseases. Consequently, imports are only allowed from a limited list of non-EC countries. Imports of honeybees into the UK are controlled by EC legislation which includes a requirement for each consignment to be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the relevant authorities in the exporting country. Imports from countries outside the Community are also subject to post import controls aimed at reducing the risk of introduction and spread of exotic bee pests, in particular, the small hive beetle and tropilaelaps mites, both of which are notifiable.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 March 2009]:</i><i> </i>Neither the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, nor the Traffic Management Act 2004, allows for a street works licence scheme. However part 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004, which came into force in April 2008, allows local authorities in England, with the consent of the Secretary of State, to operate a permit scheme, under which anyone carrying out works in the public highway must seek permission for those works before proceeding.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 March 2009]:</i> Exclusive of passenger capacity, and when compared to an Intercity 225 train, the Super Express train will consume just over 2 per cent. less energy on a typical journey between London and Edinburgh.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the answer to the hon. Member for Leeds West of 26 November 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1500-01W, on housing: low incomes, how many people in Wales have received assistance from each of the desks established in courts to provide free legal representation at repossession hearings in each month since the scheme's inception.

 Free legal representation at repossession hearings in Wales is available through Swansea county court, and details of the number of people who have received assistance in each month since it was first piloted in January 2002 are shown as follows.</p>

Since April 2007 this data has been submitted electronically and consequently the figures are more reliable.</p>

 The measure of reoffending used to provide National Statistics for England and Wales is not broken down by area. However, newly published data on local adult reoffending (a different measure of reoffending to the national statistics) is broken down by probation area and local authority (upper tier only).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="90311w0011.htm_para0"><a name="09031187001519">The number of offenders used to calculate the local reoffending rate for the Essex probation area between 1 October 2007 and 30 September 2008 is 20,810 and the reoffending rate is 8.19 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="90311w0011.htm_para2"><a name="09031187001521">The local measure measures the reoffending of all offenders on the probation caseload, aged 18 or over, at a certain point in time (a &#147;snapshot&#148;), while the national measure covers all offenders commencing a court order under probation supervision or released from custody during the first quarter of the year. Additionally, the local measure allows a three month period for reoffences to be committed, while the national measure allows a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="90311w0011.htm_para3"><a name="09031187001522">The local reoffending figures are produced by aggregating the data of four snapshots of the probation caseload.

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="90311w0011.htm_para10"><a name="09031187001537">Young people on red level participate in the whole range of purposeful activities and curriculum.

 The exact information is not held centrally. Hospital Episode Statistics show the dental procedure carried out, but not whether a general anaesthetic was administered. However, dental treatment under general anaesthesia may only take place in a hospital setting that has a critical-care facility. It is therefore very likely, though not absolutely, certain that a child admitted to hospital for extraction of teeth will have had general anaesthetic, and that was the reason for their admission to hospital. A table which contains the number of hospital episodes involving the extraction of teeth by age group and primary care trust has been placed in the Library.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
<i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis:</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
The ICD-10 codes used to identify heart attacks are as follows:<br>
I21&#151;acute myocardial infarction<br>
I22&#151;subsequent myocardial infarction<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis:</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a HES record.<br>
<i> Data quality:</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

In addition, 18 commercial gas storage projects are in different stages of development; if they were all to come forward they could give us storage capacity equivalent to some 20 per cent. of our current gas consumption by around 2020.</p>

1. A change in legislation in October 2008 removed the compulsion for parents with care on income based benefit (Income Support or Jobseeker&#146;s Allowance (Income Based)) to pursue a claim for child support through the Agency. After this date, it is expected that some parents with care will opt to end their child support claim with CSA. This can be seen as a fall in overall caseload after October 2008.<br>
2. In the run up to the change, a further legislative repeal in July 2008 means that single parents making a new claim for income based benefit will no longer be referred to CSA. Some will make direct arrangements with the Agency, but they are not compelled to do so. This change can be seen as a huge fall (to zero) in the numbers of potential new claims received directly from Jobcentre Plus from October 2008.<br>
3. All cases received from October 2008 were classed as private intake. Any cases that were received from this time will be classed as private intake regardless of benefit status.<br>
4. Jobcentre Plus applications include all applications originating from Jobcentre Plus where the parent with care is in receipt of Income Support or income based Jobseekers&#146; Allowance at the time of application. It is not possible to identify those on Income Support separately.<br>

 The funding of the Pension Protection Fund is a matter for the Board of the Pension Protection Fund, an independent statutory corporation. The PPF is funded through a pension protection levy that is charged to all eligible defined-benefit occupational pension schemes, assets from schemes that transfer in to the PPF and investment returns. The Board made a commitment in August 2007 to collect &#163;675 million a year for the next three years, indexed to earnings, so long as there was no significant change in risk. The Board intends to collect &#163;700 million in 2009-10, keeping to that commitment. A consultation on the future development of the pension protection levy for 2011-12 and beyond concluded on 13 February 2009 and the Board is currently considering the responses received.</p>

 There is a statutory requirement to review all social security benefits each year and to consider whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level of prices. (The standard minimum guarantee in pension credit must be reviewed against the general level of earnings). A further requirement calls for certain benefits, including the state pension, to be up-rated at least in line with the increase in prices from April of the following year.</p>

pension that will apply from this April will be &#163;95.25. This amounts to an increase in the current rate of &#163;4.55, which is in line with inflation as measured last September, when the Retail Prices Index was 5 per cent. This increase, against a backdrop of falling inflation, is in line with the highest increase in inflation last year and the biggest increase in the state pension since 2001. The increase in the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit to &#163;130 for single pensioners (&#163;198.45 for pensioner couples) from April more than keeps pace with earnings and represents the highest up-lift since it was introduced in 2003.</p>

In addition, for this year the Department has increased the Christmas bonus from &#163;10 to &#163;70 and increased the cold weather payment from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25.</p>

Couples are treated as a single unit in these benefits and if one member of a couple is in remunerative work of 24-hours or more, or has income which exceeds their entitlement, then they cannot receive the benefit. Only those couples who are not in remunerative work and who meet the other qualifying conditions of the benefit can receive support for mortgage interest.

There has been an improvement, however, in the management of the young people&#146;s behaviour and it is satisfactory overall in the settings inspected. The more effective institutions are successful in meeting the needs of a wide range of young people, many of whom have had little or no experience of educational success. A minority of settings have developed an appropriate range of vocational and academic courses. In these institutions, young people enjoy their education and often make good progress; many experience success for the first time in their lives. However, levels of accreditation remain low in too many institutions and opportunities for progression to more advanced courses are limited. This is particularly pertinent for young people aged 16 and over in young offender institutions. More able young people are often working below their capabilities and few gain GCSE qualifications.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev17"><a name="09031197002596"><ul><p class="tabletext">The range of vocational courses is narrow in too many institutions, restricting opportunities for young people to acquire the skills that will help them to gain employment or access to further training on their release from custody. Teaching of the basic skills of literacy and numeracy is often poor. Lessons fail to motivate or engage young people. In the more effective institutions, literacy and numeracy are linked successfully to vocational work and their life experiences.</p>

In the better settings, teaching is lively and engaging. Young people are given interesting and challenging tasks that they enjoy. They respond well to good teaching, make sound progress and are justifiably proud of their achievements. The collection of information about the young people&#146;s achievements, progress and attendance is improving and is now available to support teaching staff more effectively. However, this information is used effectively in only a small number of institutions. Young people&#146;s individual learning plans are not used successfully to plan their work or to monitor their progress.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev19"><a name="09031197002598"><ul><p class="tabletext">The more successful settings draw on a variety of resources and external partners to develop creative and interesting educational experiences for young people. External agencies are often effective in raising the young people&#146;s aspirations. Most institutions are successful in making the environment as attractive as possible, often in very difficult circumstances. Rewards and incentives are used effectively to motivate young people, but only in a minority of institutions.</p>

It is good in institutions where the behaviour policy is clearly understood and consistently applied. Relationships between prison and education staff in young offender institutions are generally good. Some aspects of prison life, however, continue to have a negative effect on teaching and learning. For example, movement from residential to education units is often delayed, adversely affecting both punctuality and young people&#146;s learning. There are too few opportunities for young people to share their opinions about the education and training they receive.</p>

Staff in most institutions overcome considerable difficulties to make the accommodation as pleasant as possible through, for example, the imaginative use of learners&#146; artwork. Incentives are generally used well to encourage the young people.</p>

However, little focus is given to the Every Child Matters agenda for children and young people in young offender institutions. Limited opportunities for release on temporary licence severely inhibit the preparation of young people to gain employment and so to achieve economic well-being on their return to the community.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev28"><a name="09031197002607"><ul><p class="tabletext">The management of unacceptable behaviour has improved further in the institutions inspected. Behaviour is good in institutions where the behaviour policy is understood clearly and applied consistently. In young offender institutions, there has been a marked reduction in the number of young people being returned to residential wings from education for poor behaviour. Relationships between prison and residential care staff and education staff across the range of secure accommodation are generally good. Progress in making sure that education and training are given priority within settings is variable.</p>

There remain some aspects of institutional life which have an adverse effect on the quality of educational provision. For example, moving the young people from residential accommodation to teaching areas often takes too long so that they arrive late and learning time is lost.</p>

Not enough is done to help them prepare for their release and there are not enough opportunities for them to access vocational learning or to develop independent living skills. Links between education and resettlement departments are often tenuous. The quality of careers guidance and education is often inadequate. The failure to provide suitable education and training to young people for the community element of their sentences, or upon release, remains a significant concern.</p>

of any kind. Behaviour is managed more successfully than in the past and improves quickly. Most behaviour is now good in the institutions inspected. This is achieved most effectively where care staff and teachers collaborate and manage behaviour consistently.</p>

Nearly all children and young people enter institutions with levels of literacy and numeracy well below those found nationally for their ages. There has been an appropriate emphasis on improving basic skills and children make very good progress when opportunities for improving literacy and numeracy are linked to subjects across the curriculum. Most young people leave custody with some form of accreditation in these essential skills and, more generally, levels of accreditation are now at least satisfactory in most of the institutions inspected.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev38"><a name="09031197002617"><ul><p class="tabletext">Teaching and learning are generally best in vocational and practical subjects, where they are consistently at least satisfactory. In the best classes, teachers have high expectations of learners and plan interesting and varied activities. Less successful lessons provide insufficient challenge, the pace is too slow and young people are bored and lose concentration.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev39"><a name="09031197002618"><ul><p class="tabletext">The range of vocational provision is too often narrow. Most children and young people have too few opportunities to gain work-related skills that will help them move on to further education, employment or additional training on release. Evening enrichment activities are available in most institutions and, in some cases, the skills gained by young people are accredited through external qualifications. Often, these activities add significantly to their enjoyment of education.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev40"><a name="09031197002619"><ul><p class="tabletext">Guidance and support are generally strengths of the sector. Most institutions have effective initial assessment procedures that identify any additional support needs quickly, although this information is not always used well to inform teaching and learning. Children and young people are helped to settle in quickly through good induction procedures. Target-setting and monitoring of progress have improved; they are now generally good and, in a few cases, outstanding. Some secure children&#146;s homes have developed a system of weekly tutorials which are used well to review progress. Teaching assistants generally provide effective support but, in a few cases, they are not appropriately qualified and are unsure of their role.</p>
</ul><a name="90311w0033.htm_brev41"><a name="09031197002620"><ul><p class="tabletext">The improvements seen in the last two years in leadership and management are now having a positive impact, especially in the areas of managing behaviour and in guidance and support. Institutions are now producing more evaluative self-assessment reports. Frequently, managers identify the key weaknesses and take decisive action that improves outcomes for young people. Lesson observations by managers are now well established and, in most cases, this has contributed to improvements in teaching and learning. Centres use data more effectively to measure learners&#146; progress and to set challenging targets. Increasingly, institutions are developing procedures to seek the views of the young people and staff, but this is not consistent across the sector. Relationships between care and education staff are generally good, and communication between groups of staff has improved significantly. There is great variation in the quality of resources, especially in terms of accommodation and facilities.</p>

 Girls have out-performed boys since GCSE examinations were introduced in 1988. In 2008 69.9 per cent. of girls and 60.9 per cent. of boys achieved 5+ A*-C grade GCSEs. Girls are ahead of boys at all stages of education. The gap in England has been broadly stable over two decades, and is in line with that in other OECD countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="90311w0034.htm_para0"><a name="09031197000178">The reasons are complex but appear mainly related to differences of biology, maturation, and attitudes to learning and reading at different ages. The Department&#146;s 2007 research paper &#147;Gender and education: the evidence on pupils in England&#148;, of which there is a copy in the Library of the House, sets out the research evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="90311w0034.htm_para1"><a name="09031197000179">Two points should be noted: first, boys&#146; GCSE attainment has improved sharply over the past decade, broadly keeping pace with that of girls; second, gender gaps can be minimised by good teaching practice and by the encouragement of reading, ensuring that pupils of both genders make good progress.</p>

Local authorities are responsible for planning provision for their areas. The Department allocates basic need capital to enable authorities to fund new places in response to pupil number growth. To ensure that local authorities can plan strategically, funding is fixed for three years at the beginning of each spending review period (the current period runs from April 2008 to March 2011). In determining basic need allocations, the Department uses local authorities&#146; own pupil number forecasts, expecting authorities themselves to take account of local factors that will influence future pupil numbers such as birth rate, new housing and population migration. The Department relies on the accuracy of local authority forecasts as it does not hold back funds to allow for future changes.</p>

 Religious education (RE) is a statutory part of the basic school curriculum. Schools must teach RE according to locally agreed syllabuses or in the case of voluntary aided schools with a religious character, according to the trust deed of the school. Local Standing Advisory Councils for RE (SACREs) have the responsibility to ensure that local syllabuses develop pupils&#146; knowledge, understanding and awareness of Christianity and the major religions represented in the country and reflect the values and traditions of the community. RE encourages respect for those holding different beliefs and helps promote pupils&#146; moral, cultural and spiritual development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_631"><a name="90311w0034.htm_para7"><a name="09031197000304">In 2004, the Department with the QCA published a non-statutory framework for RE which has been supported by all the main faith groups and the British Humanist Association. It says that pupils should learn about Christianity throughout each key stage and, by the end of Key Stage 3, pupils should have encountered the other five principal religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism) in sufficient depth. It also recommends that pupils have opportunities to study other religious traditions such as the Baha&#146;i faith, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and secular philosophies such as humanism.</p>

Bury, Essex, Lancashire and Redbridge local authorities have recorded zero for line 2.0.2. These LAs have recorded some elements of SEN administration assessment and co-ordination within other SEN lines in the data collection. Lines include 2.0.1 (Educational Psychology Service), 1.2.1 (Provision for pupils with SEN, (including assigned resources), 1.2.2 (Provision for pupils with SEN, provision not included in line 1.2.1) and 1.2.3 (Support for inclusion). Detailed guidance is provided by DCSF on how to complete various lines in the data collection. It is however for each local authority to determine how they eventually record these activities.<br>

<i> [holding answer 9 March 2009]:</i> The UK Government recognises that losing the individual's right to opt-out of the 48-hour working week as set by the Working Time Directive, would have a detrimental effect on the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full time for their primary employer. Many other workers also use this important flexibility and so and we remain firmly of the view that this right should remain. We, along with a majority of other member states are fighting for the retention of the opt-out as this dossier progresses through the European negotiation process.</p>
