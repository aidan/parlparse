 It has been the practice for many years to use the landing adjacent to the lower waiting hall to store furniture from the Members&#146; and Strangers&#146; dining rooms when they are both in use at the same time for functions sponsored by Members. These can take place between 4-6 pm each weekday, on Thursday evenings, and at times when the House is not sitting. The furniture has to be kept close to the dining rooms because there are only 30 minutes available to reset them for the evening service to Members.</p>

Until the Administration Committee has had an opportunity to consider the matter, arrangements are being made to advise the fire safety manager when both rooms are being used for functions.</p>

The circumstances of each individual case are considered including any representations of hardship from the non-resident parent as well as the size of the debt and any other relevant factors. Should the financial circumstances of the non-resident parent prevent immediate full repayment of the child maintenance debt then the Agency will attempt to negotiate the repayment of the child maintenance debt as quickly as possible to obtain the best possible outcome for the qualifying child and the parent with care while taking account of the circumstances of the non-resident parent.</p>

In a proportion of cases, this means that a repayment agreement of up to forty per cent of net earnings, which includes any regular maintenance liability and repayment of arrears, will be appropriate.</p>
</ul><a name="81006w0012.htm_brev8"><a name="0810071000749"><ul><p class="tabletext">Where negotiations fail to produce an acceptable repayment offer the Agency will consider recovery through the enforcement measures available. In many cases a Deduction from Earnings Order will be imposed which requires an employer to deduct child maintenance payments at source. These deductions will not exceed forty per cent of net earnings. In cases where this is not appropriate, the Agency can apply to the courts for a liability order confirming the debt, and allowing it to pursue other legal enforcement action.</p>
</ul><a name="81006w0012.htm_brev9"><a name="0810071000750"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Agency also has the power to contract debt collection agencies to recover outstanding debt on its behalf as this is an area where the expertise of private agencies can be particularly effective in helping to get more money to more children. The provisions authorising another person/organisation to carry out functions relating to child support came into force on 3 July 2006. Certain cases with outstanding debt were reviewed and where the non-resident parent failed to make an acceptable repayment offer referral was made to a debt collection agency.

1. Consistent and reliable records of the numbers of cases of possible fraud or misuse being recorded and investigated, and of the resulting numbers of customer contracts cancelled, are only available from 1999 onwards, after Motability established a centralised team to handle such matters in 1998.<br>
2. The fall in the number of contracts cancelled as a result of misuse between 2003 and 2005 resulted from an increase in the standard mileage allowance in 2003 (hence fewer customer contracts being cancelled for unpaid excess mileage bills) and from an improved approach to &#147;fair wear and tear&#148; standards, especially for damage associated with mobility aids (fewer contracts being cancelled for cars falling outside of the condition standards).<br>
3. The increase in customer contracts being cancelled since 2005 has resulted from a stronger focus on appropriate sanctions for customers using cars in any criminal activity or using cars outside of the insurance rules (e.g. allowing uninsured drivers).<br>

1. There are not separate budgets for crisis loans and budgeting loans, but rather a combined loans budget for both. The loans budget is managed centrally and re-allocations are made to Jobcentre Plus budget areas quarterly and towards the end of the year. Funds are taken from some of those budget areas with a projected end of year underspend and given to other budget areas.<br>
2. To provide comparable data, budgets are presented on the basis of the current budget area structure. In recent years, there have been many changes to the boundaries of Jobcentre Plus districts, which have led to adjustment of the budgets for the districts involved. In some cases, a district has been split and the parts merged with other districts. For the districts involved in such a situation it is not possible to give comparable budgets from April 2003. The last split took place in August 2006.<br>
3. Community Care Grants for 2006-07 were set before the boundary change in August 2006 involving a split district, and so are not given here. Community Care Grants budgets are not reallocated during the year. However, some allocations were made from the Contingency Reserve in 2007-08. These have not been included. The budgets for 2008-09 are the same as for 2007-08.<br>

 The Department for International Development's (DFID) work in the education sector in Africa is guided by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which call for the achievement of universal primary education and for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. We plan to spend some &#163;214 million bilaterally on education in Africa this year (2008-09). In addition, DFID provides core funding to a range of multilateral organisations who work to develop education in Africa. A large proportion of our bilateral support is routed through national budgets, notably in Nigeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya and Rwanda. This is in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness which calls for 50 per cent. of bilateral assistance to be channelled through country systems by means of long-term general budget or sector support. There is a particular emphasis throughout our education sector programmes on increasing school attendance, and a key part of this is getting more girls into school.</p>

We have also committed &#163;150 million to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative for 2006-8 to help countries speed up the implementation of their education plans. The Fast Track Initiative is supporting education work in 18 Africa countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="81006w0020.htm_para3"><a name="0810078000203">There is still a long way to go to achieve these MDGs in Africa, but there has been some worthwhile progress. Free primary education has brought millions of children into school: in Zambia and Tanzania, over 97 per cent. of children are now enrolled, with equal number of girls. In Lesotho, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi gender parity rates have reached 98 per cent. or more. In Ethiopia, our support helped one million more children to enter school in 2006. In Malawi, providing better toilet facilities in schools and support to teenage mothers has improved school attendance by girls.</p>

 Outside Southern Africa, the Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) work to facilitate cross-border trade is focused in East Africa (the East African Community (EAC)&#151;Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi). DFID is preparing a major new regional programme to facilitate trade by EAC member states. It will focus on expanding intra-regional trade through reducing the costs of trading across borders by supporting one stop border posts, customs reforms and the development of revenue sharing arrangements between countries.</p>

 The Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) 2006 White Paper stated that disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a crucial part of climate change adaptation. DFID&#146;s climate change implementation strategy incorporates DRR and recognises the need to draw on existing mechanisms to reduce risk when designing new programmes to adapt to climate change. The Bali Action Plan, which the UK signed up to last December, emphasises this when it refers to the importance of using</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="81006w0021.htm_para5"><a name="0810078000338">DFID has also commissioned a review to assess how DRR and adaptation programming could be better aligned to identify mechanisms for joint funding and programming; and to make recommendations for addressing remaining gaps in the system. This work is in progress, but initial recommendations include: supporting more visible engagement of the DRR community in climate negotiations; promoting stronger convergence of the DRR and adaptation teams within DFID and multilateral agencies; and supporting the generation of integrated knowledge and guidance, including by documenting success stories of where integration has worked.</p>

When responding to a DFID funded survey in the UK, almost a third of remittance senders said that their money would be used to buy food, a fifth said it would help with medical bills and one in six reported that the funds would help pay for schooling. 80 per cent. of those surveyed said the money would make a real difference to the lives of their relatives back home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="81006w0025.htm_para10"><a name="0810078001069">The Department for International Development (DFID) is aware of the importance of international cooperation as stated in Article 32 of the UN Convention. We understand the need to find ways to promote the inclusion of disabled people into mainstream development as well as looking for ways to build the capacity of representative organisations of disabled people. Our Civil Society Challenge Fund identifies disability as a cross-cutting issue so all applications need to demonstrate how they are engaging with disabled people. The latest round of applications saw a record number of projects with disability as the main focus (22 out of 145) which indicates that more international organisations are becoming aware of the need to promote the rights of disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="81006w0025.htm_para11"><a name="0810078001070">We are supporting several initiatives aimed at increasing the capacity of disabled people's organisations. We have a Programme Partnership Agreement (PPA) with UK- based Action on Disability and Development which is working directly with disabled people's organisations (DPOs) in eight countries across Africa and Asia. Recently we also committed to providing substantial support to a new Disability Rights Fund (DRF) set up to empower DPOs to participate effectively in the implementation and monitoring mechanisms set out in the UN Convention. This is one of the first foundations to support organisations run by disabled people in the developing world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="81006w0025.htm_para12"><a name="0810078001071">As suggested by Article 32 DFID is also looking at ways to increase the amount of disability related research. We are currently funding the Southern Africa Federation of Disabled People Research Project (SRP) which is an innovative project designed and run by disabled people in the region. This project is helping local DPOs to research issues linked to disability and poverty and is already starting to produce evidence of the kinds of barriers disabled people face when trying to access basic services.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) supports Sahrawi refugees through its share of the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office&#146;s (ECHO) budget, and contributions to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
