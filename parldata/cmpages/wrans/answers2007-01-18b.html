Nor is it possible to quantify what proportion of the activity, supported by the &#163;2.2 billion gross budget in 2005-06 for national health service primary dental care services, contributed to raising awareness of oral hygiene and the prevention of dental disease. One of the Government&#146;s objectives in introducing from April 2006 local commissioning arrangements for primary dental care services and changing the basis of remuneration for dental practices away from item of service fees was to give dentists more scope to focus on preventative care. Primary care trusts are also now required to provide oral health promotion programmes to the extent that they consider it necessary to meet all reasonable requirements within their areas. To assist them we published an oral health plan for England, &#147;Choosing Better Oral Health&#148;, in November 2005.</p>

This is designed to support dentists in carrying out simpler, more clinically appropriate courses of treatment without financial detriment. It also responds to long-standing representations from dentists and from the British Dental Association criticising the treadmill nature of the former fee-per-item system.</p>

As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 The FCO has nine strategic priorities, three of which are directly concerned with Home Office business: making the world safer from global terrorism; reducing the harm to the UK from international crime, including drug trafficking, people smuggling and money laundering; and managing migration and combating illegal immigration. In those countries of priority concern to the UK, officials from both Departments also work very closely in delivering UK justice and home affairs objectives. There are Home Office secondees in the British embassies in Washington DC and Madrid and a joint unit working on Afghan counter-narcotics. The Home Office has both intensive and extensive contact with the FCO on EU business and works closely on justice and home affairs issues within the G8 Lyon-Roma group.</p>

 The only target the Home Office sets directly for local authorities is an efficiency target which it sets for the police service. The main way in which the Home Office delivers national public service agreements is through setting targets for local partnerships such as crime and drugs partnerships and youth offending teams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="70118w0015.htm_para0"><a name="07011864001501">Targets which local authorities are expected to deliver on are contained in local area agreements (LAAs). The following Home Office mandatory outcomes are included in all LAAs: reduce crime; reassure the public, reducing the fear of crime; reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs; and build respect in communities and reduce antisocial behaviour. There is also a sub-set of best value performance indicators relating to community safety. Four of these are directly related to crime levels which local authorities report on, in consultation with the police.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which police forces in England and Wales have changed police injury pension payments so that payments are linked to national average earnings rather than police wages once injured officers reach compulsory retirement age <i> (a)</i> to all officers including those already receiving injury pensions who have reached compulsory retirement age, <i> (b)</i> to those receiving an injury pension but yet to reach compulsory retirement age and <i> (c)</i> only to those who were injured after the changes came into effect.

 The information requested is not held centrally. The decision on whether to review a police injury pension is for the police authority paying it. The size of an injury award is determined in the first instance by reference to the recipient&#146;s final pensionable salary and length of service as a police officer and his or her loss of earning capacity as a result of the injury. Where a police authority is reviewing the size of an injury pension the key question is whether the former officer&#146;s loss of earning capacity as a result of the injury has altered. When a former officer reaches what would have been his or her compulsory retirement age in the police service, Home Office guidance advises police authorities, in the absence of any cogent evidence to the contrary in a particular case, to assess the loss of earning capacity by reference not to police pay but to national average earnings.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings, in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is underway to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
 2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

Compared to 2004, numbers for 2006 entry were up by 12,000 or 4.3 per cent. It is as we expected, and is what happened when tuition fees were first introduced in 1998. Then, there was a small reduction, after which applications continued upwards.  <br>

This includes an on-line self assessment version of IFTS. This will help improve standards across the public sector in the field of re-use.</p>

 If a public sector information holder (PSIH) that is accredited under the Information Fair Trader Scheme (IFTS) does not comply with IFTS guidelines, the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) will notify the public sector information holder and identify those areas which need to be remedied. In doing so, OPSI will provide support and guidance to assist the PSIH to comply. This would involve regular meetings and reviews. A key aspect of the process is the development of an action plan which sets out the areas of non-compliance and target dates for meeting the necessary standards. If the PSIH does not resolve the problem, OPSI may consider the withdrawal of the PSIH&#146;s delegation of authority, in full or in part, until the issues are resolved. Potential withdrawal of a delegation of authority would only apply in those cases where the PSIH is a Crown body that operates under a delegation of authority from the controller of HMSO.</p>

 HM Revenue and Customs&#146; response to the increased threat from MTIC fraud has been proportionate, targeted and risk-based. In response to the rapid increase in MTIC activity last year, HM Revenue and Customs are actively checking a greater number of claims but as soon as they are satisfied that even part of a claim is properly payable, it is immediately repaid.

 6. For those entitled to MCA, it also is tapered at the rate of &#163;1 for every &#163;2 of income above the aged income limit, but only once an individual's personal allowance has been tapered to the level of the ordinary personal allowance. The MCA can only be withdrawn until it reaches the minimum MCA.<br>
