<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with reference to the consultation paper Proposals to Amend the Statutory Controls for the use of Agricultural Sludge, when the consultees listed in Annexe C of the paper received the paper; and what percentage of the consultees responded.  [109992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The consultation paper on the proposals to amend the statutory controls for the agricultural use of sludge was dispatched on 21 October 2002 to all those individuals and organisations listed at Annexe C of the paper, a total of 220. 32 (15 per cent.) of these consultees responded. A further 185 copies were requested from the Defra distribution centre and the paper was also available on the Defra website. The total number of responses received was 63.

<a name="30508w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the EU Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development.  [111272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) is available to the 10 EU new member states and candidate countries from central and eastern Europe <sup>1</sup> . Its objectives are similar to those of the rural development programmes in the 15 existing member states.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para0">The programme has provided a valuable opportunity to the candidates in the practical application of rural development policies and EU financial systems. The accreditation process for the newly established Paying Agencies in particular has enabled them to experience and satisfy EU audit procedures.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para1">Defra Ministers and officials have taken every opportunity to urge the applicants to make full use of the funds available. Defra is a strong supporter of rural development programmes as a mechanism for supporting rural and farming areas and very much welcomes this chance for the candidates to benefit from these systems in advance of their membership. Although we have not commissioned any specific assessment of the progress of SAPARD expenditure, my officials attend meetings of the European Commission Regulatory Committee, which reviews and approves the programmes of the countries concerned.

<a name="30508w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Animal By-products</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many furnaces fuelled from animal carcases and animal by-products are operational in <i>(a)</i> the North West of England and <i>(b)</i> England.  [111161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are not aware of any furnaces fuelled from animal carcases and unprocessed animal by-products.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para2">Prior to the introduction of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation on 1 May 2003, the Department was not responsible for the approval of animal carcase incinerators, with the exception of incinerators which dispose of Specified Risk Material. However, a central register of operators currently approved to operate specified risk material incinerators indicates that as at 1 May 2003 there were 306 approved incinerators in Great Britain. Strictly speaking these are not fuelled by animal carcases or unprocessed animal by-products. They use gas/oil as fuel to provide the heat to burn the carcases.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. James Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the EU Animal By-products Regulation will apply to the burial of <i>(a)</i> domestic cattle, <i>(b)</i> domestic pigs, <i>(c)</i> domestic sheep, <i>(d)</i> domestic poultry, <i>(e)</i> goats, <i>(f)</i> llamas, <i>(g)</i> ostriches, <i>(h)</i> members of the equine family, <i>(i)</i> dogs, <i>(j)</i> cats, <i>(k)</i> hamsters, <i>(l)</i> gerbils, <i>(m)</i> rabbits, <i>(n)</i> guinea pigs, <i>(o)</i> rodents, <i>(p)</i> farmed fish, <i>(q)</i> domestic fish and <i>(r)</i> wild animals killed on the road; and what advice the Department has given to owners of these animals.  [111352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The carcases, or parts of carcases, of wild animals are exempt from the scope of the Regulation unless they are thought to be diseased or are used to produce game trophies.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para3">The Regulation allows member states to apply for various derogations regarding the disposal of animal by-products, and, among others, we have applied for the derogation to permit the burial of dead pet animals.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para4">The definition of a pet animal given within the Regulation is: any animal belonging to species normally nourished and kept, but not consumed, by humans for purposes other than farming. Therefore, species such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and poultry etc would fall out-with this definition and would require disposal by an approved route other than burial.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para5">The situation with regard to equines is complicated. Although it can be argued that humans within the UK do not consume members of the equine family, the UK does export horses/ponies which may be used for human consumption. Under a strict interpretation the EU Regulation would, therefore, ban the burial of pet equines but we would expect local authorities, who enforce the legislation, to deal with such cases on an individual basis.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para6">Although no specific advice has been provided to pet owners, information on the disposal of animal carcases is available on the Defra website, at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/by-prods/default.htm., and from local Defra Animal Health Offices.

<a name="30508w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what advice she has given to Wiltshire county council about the disposal of TB infected badger carcases;  [111396]
<P>
<UL>(2) what advice she has given to local authorities in parts of the country where badgers may be infected with TB on the testing, collection and disposal of badger carcases.  [111394]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU Animal By-Products Regulation, which applied in member states from 1 May, requires, among other things, that wild animals suspected of being infected with diseases communicable to humans and animals, such as bovine TB, are disposed of at an approved plant using one of the following methods:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. incineration;
<P>

2. rendering followed by incineration; or
<P>
<BR>
3. pressure rendering followed by landfill
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30508w01.html_para7">Trading Standards, who enforce the Regulation, have received guidance notes and training on the new rules. In addition, information on the disposal of animal carcases is available on the Defra website, at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/by-prods/default.htm., and from local Defra Animal Health Offices.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn5"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the materials by type that will be included through her Department's national subscription collection and disposal scheme for fallen livestock under the Animal By-Products Regulation. [111116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Assuming that the scheme is viable, we would envisage that it would apply to the collection and disposal of carcases of all types of farmed livestock on agricultural holdings.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hendry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that schemes to collect animal carcases from farms will not result in the spread of disease.  [111185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Animal By-Products legislation already controls the collection, storage and transportation of animal by-products, including animal carcases, it also requires records to be kept of any consignment of animal by-products to assist in the auditing and traceability of this material.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para8">However, we would expect that only those collectors who follow biosecurity procedures yet to be agreed would be allowed to participate in a national carcase collection service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn7"><B> Lembit &#214;pik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 10 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 364W, on fallen stock, if she will list the alternative processes that the Commission is considering for approval; and what the timetable is for the consultation process.  [111408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 On the basis of information submitted, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) adopted an "Opinion on six alternative methods for safe disposal of animal by-products" on 10 to 11 April 2003. According 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 776W</I><P>
to this Opinion, five methods are regarded as safe for the disposal or use of Category 2 and 3 animal by-products. These five methods are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>high pressure high temperature hydrolysis;
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
combustion of Tallow in a thermal boiler.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30508w01.html_para9">The Commission will now analyse the SSC opinion and present a proposal approving the five methods listed above to the next Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.
<P>

<a name="30508w01.html_para10">On the basis of the SSC opinion, member states can allow the use of the methods listed for the disposal or use of Category 2 and 3 animal by-products, pending their approval by the Commission, provided that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. the alternative methods are approved by the competent authority following adequate validation procedures; and

<a name="30508w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of emissions from furnaces fuelled from animal carcases and animal by-products. [111590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of emissions from furnaces fuelled from animal carcases and animal by-products. However, Defra commissioned an independent report to measure and review atmospheric emissions from small carcase incinerators, which was published in August 2002. This is available on the Defra website at: http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project data/Default.asp under Project Code WA0806.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice her Department has given to those who undertake pest control on disposing of <i>(a)</i> foxes, <i>(b)</i> rodents and <i>(c)</i> mustelids. [111349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Animal By-Product Regulation, which applied in member states from 1 May, does not apply to foxes, rodents, mustelids or other wildlife. With regard to rodents, for those killed by rodenticides the Statutory Conditions of Use for each product will stipulate the method of carcass disposal. These conditions are set by either the Health and Safety Executive or the Pesticides Safety Directorate. Typically, the conditions require that rodent carcases are either burnt or buried. These conditions must be strictly adhered to. Defra has not given specific disposal advice for foxes and mustelids, but recommends that normal good practice is followed. Anyone requiring advice on appropriate disposal methods should contact their local authority.

<a name="30508w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what response she has made to the OECD Initiative on Biological Resources Centres; and what resources have been committed to the achievement in the UK of the objectives of the initiative.  [107922]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
<i> [holding answer 9 April 2003]:</i> The Government supports the broad objective of the OECD initiative on Biological Resource Centres, which is to seek to ensure the conservation of biological resources and associated information in an efficient and effective way through the creation of a global network of biological resource centres like seed banks or culture collections, and, through such a network, to provide improved access to biological resources of an appropriate quality to bona fide users in the fields of life sciences and biotechnology. Proposals on how this might be achieved are still under discussion in the OECD. Officials from my Department are actively involved in those talks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what is owed to Mr. and Mrs. T. McCoy of Dartmouth in relation to their 2001 bovine claim; and what the reasons are for the delay in payment, with reference to her Department's letter to the hon. Member for Totnes of 15 March 2003, ref 179375/JW.  [111859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 As stated in the letter of 15 March 2003, all Mr. And Mrs. McCoy's bovine claims for 2001 have been paid, and there are not outstanding payments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects the new rights of access under Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to commence in the Central Southern Region.  [111247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I announced in November last year that the new right for the public to walk on mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land will be rolled out on a region by region basis. This will give walkers the right to walk in open countryside and on registered common land as early as possible, rather than having to wait for the mapping process to be completed for the whole country. I intend to open the first two regions to public access during the summer of 2004. These are the south east and central southern England.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 778W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30508w02.html_para0">This is a demanding timetable as we will need to have in place not only the conclusive maps for those regions but also all necessary restrictions and exclusion on access. Guidance and codes of practice will also need to be available to walkers and landowners. These mechanisms are necessary under the CROW Act and it is important for them to be in force in each region before access land is made available to the public so that the interests of both land managers and walkers are safeguarded.We expect to meet the target of having all access land open by the end of 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list, broken down by Act, the criminal offences created in legislation sponsored by her Department and its predecessors since 1997.  [110988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w02.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 A number of criminal offences have been created in primary legislation, sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its predecessor Departments, since 1997. The following list contains only legislation concerning policy areas now administered by Defra. The Plant Varieties Act 1997 (c. 66) created two new criminal offences. The Food Standards Act 1999 (c. 28) created eight new criminal offences. The Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000 (c. 33) created four new criminal offences. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (c. 37) created 22 new criminal offences. The Animal Health 2002 Act (c. 42) created 14 new criminal offences.
<P>

<a name="30508w02.html_para1">No comprehensive records are kept by the Department of offences created in secondary legislation, and the cost of searching the many instruments in force for which the Department has responsibility would be disproportionate.

 The Government procurement policy on timber applies to all wood and products made from wood used in performing Government contracts.

<P>
<a name="30508w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The effectiveness of CAP Pillar Two funding in England is being assessed in several ways. The Mid-term Evaluation of the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) is currently in progress and aims to assess the implementation and impact of the Programme since its inception in 2000 to present. The evaluation will be completed in December 2003 and its findings will be reported to the European Commission. Similar evaluations are being produced on rural development programmes in other parts of the UK and in the other member states.
<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para2">There are also a number of recently completed or on-going studies on individual ERDP schemes and other reviews that will touch on the effectiveness of the Programme as a whole. The studies on individual ERDP schemes include a major review of agri-environment schemes, a Hill Farming Allowance review and reviews of the Farm Woodland Premium and Woodland Grant Schemes. With regard to project based schemes, an economic evaluation of the Processing and Marketing Grant scheme is in progress and various aspects of the impact the Rural Enterprise Scheme are being examined.
<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para3">Outside of these internal reviews and studies, Defra officials assess the effectiveness of CAP Pillar Two funding by analysing reports from other organisations and by using internal management information.

<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para5">The Department's predecessor, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), planned to move around 90 staff into the Government Office network in April 2001. The demands of the foot and mouth outbreak delayed some of these moves, but since summer 2001, the Rural Director's team in each region has been fully integrated into the Government office. They also work closely with the Regional Development Agency, the Regional Assembly and a range of regional and local partners. A 'sounding board' for rural communities in each region is provided by The Regional Rural Affairs Forum, which has direct representation on the Rural Affairs Forum for England which I chair. The network of Regional Forums is encouragement of Ministers and senior officials. The formation of Defra in June 2001 also meant that the pre-existing environment teams in the Government Offices contribute to the delivery of Defra's environmental and sustainable development objectives.
<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para6">Since then, the Department has provided an extra &#163;2.3 million to administer its policies in 2003&#150;04&#151;an increase of one hird from 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the pollutants regarded as volatile organic compounds; and if she will make a statement on the health risks associated with the pollutants regarded as volatile organic compounds.  [111139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w03.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include a very wide range of individual substances, such as hydrocarbons (for example benzene and toluene), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halocarbons and oxygenates. Hydrocarbon VOCs are usually grouped into methane and other non-methane VOCs. Non-methane VOCs are emitted to air as combustion products, as vapour arising from handling or use of petroleum distillates, solvents or chemicals, and from numerous other sources. The emissions of the 50 most significant non-methane VOCs in the UK (in terms of mass emissions), together with time trends and a 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 784W</I><P>
spatially disaggregated map of all sources are published annually in the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, available at www.naei.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para11">Some VOCs are harmful to human health, including benzene, PAHs and 1,3-butadiene. Benzene can cause leukaemia, if exposure is maintained over a long period of time. There are several hundred different forms of PAH, and sources can be both natural and man-made. Several of these PAHs can cause lung cancer. Sources of 1,3-butadiene include the manufacturing of synthetic rubbers, petrol driven vehicles and cigarette smoke. 1,3-butadiene exposure probably causes lymphomas or leukaemias. Other volatile organic compounds may, at high concentrations, affect the central nervous system (e.g. chloroform), cause liver damage (e.g. carbon tetrachloride) or show irritant effects (e.g. aldehydes). These effects will not necessarily be relevant at environmental levels of exposure.
<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para12">VOCs also contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone that can impair lung function and cause irritation to the respiratory tract. Ozone has also been associated with increases in respiratory hospital admissions and deaths in those already ill with respiratory disease.
<P>

<a name="30508w03.html_para13">Total emissions of methane and non-methane VOCs have reduced significantly in England since the late 1980s, particularly those from traffic and industrial processes, and are expected to continue to do so. The UK met the requirements of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution's 1991 Geneva Protocol, which required a 30 per cent. reduction in VOC emissions by 1999 using 1988 as a basis. The EU National Emission Ceilings Directive has set a further target of a reduction to 1200kT VOC annual emissions by 2010. Latest projections suggest the UK will meet this target. The Air Quality Strategy includes objectives for ambient levels of benzene, PAHs and 1,3-butadiene to protect human health. Latest monitoring indicates that we have already met the Air Quality Strategy objectives for some of these pollutants at most sites in the UK and that levels are generally declining for all these pollutants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the work being carried out with the support of her Department on Partners for Water and Sanitation.  [111857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since its inception in 2001, Partners for Water and Sanitation (PAWS) has brought together a forum of partners from Government, civil society and the private sector. The aim has been to contribute to the Millennium Development Goal for Water and the equivalent target for sanitation agreed at the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002.
<P>

<a name="30508w04.html_para0">PAWS currently focuses on three countries&#151;South Africa, Uganda and Nigeria. The current position in each of the partner countries is as follows.

<i>South Africa</i>
<P>

<a name="30508w04.html_para1">Preparatory meetings in February and May 2002 set the scene for the development of the partnership in South Africa. A further meeting took place the following August to set out the ways in which the partnership could contribute to meeting the needs of municipalities in South Africa. This meeting examined these needs, and agreement was reached on guiding criteria to decide which municipalities will enter into partnership with the UK. The meeting also considered an outline programme of work to include study visits to municipalities by partnership working groups. Partners attended an inception workshop with four nominated municipalities in November at which presentations were made by the partnership to explain the basis for the initiative and by municipalities to explain their assessment of needs and priorities. Scoping study visits were made to Hungulu, Matjhabeng, Nkomazi and Zululand between January and April 2003, from which a number of conclusions and specific recommendations for action were generated. A bi-national meeting is planned to take place in South Africa in early June 2003 to consider the outcome of the scoping studies and to develop a plan of action for each municipality.
<P>

<a name="30508w04.html_para2"><i>Nigeria</i>
<P>

<a name="30508w04.html_para3">Following a series of preparatory meetings in April 2002, PAWS agreed to partnership engagement with the State of Enugu. A further visit was made by a small partnership working party in late September 2002 to participate in meetings at State Government level and to consider a detailed assessment of needs and how these might be met from partnership resources. The group reported to the Partnership Steering Group late in 2002 setting out areas which had been identified for possible partnership involvement. The group are currently finalising a plan for action over the next year, which includes the appointment of an in-country co-ordinator.

<a name="30508w04.html_para5">The concept of Partners for Water and Sanitation was introduced to Uganda in May 2002. An exploratory visit took place the following June, which identified potential stakeholders and furthered the development of the initiative in Uganda. The partnership was represented at the annual sector review at the end of September 2002. Discussions are continuing on the scope for partnership involvement in and the Secretariat are examining the options for exchange programmes to allow Ugandan Government technical staff the opportunity to visit the UK.

<a name="30508w04.html_para6">The Secretary of State also welcomed the findings of the consultation carried out by Ofwat in the paper, "Flooding from Sewers", particularly the proposal that the worst cases of external sewer flooding should be included in sewerage undertakers' programmes. This should help to ensure that many more customers than at present benefit from sewer flooding prevention schemes.

In the 2002 Spending Review the Government set out their spending plans for the next three years up to 2005&#150;06 and have made substantial increases to the aid budget. The UK's level of official development assistance reached 0.32 per cent. in 2001 and will reach 0.40 per cent. by 2005&#150;06, up from 0.26 per cent. in 1997.

 The UK believes that where countries have had to contend with external shocks&#151;such as sharp falls in the price of key export commodities&#151;we should be generous in providing additional debt relief to promote a lasting exit from unsustainable debt.
<P>

<a name="30508w05.html_para2">Moreover, the UK is seeking agreement that this additional debt relief or topping-up that HIPCs can receive when completing the HIPC initiative should exclude additional bilateral voluntary debt relief, to ensure fairer burden sharing between creditors and provide truly additional relief to HIPCs. This important change in the rules could provide a further US $1 billion in debt relief.
<P>

<a name="30508w05.html_para3">The Government also believes we must be much more cautious about the forecasts we use to calculate debt sustainability. Optimistic assumptions about future growth and exports often do not reflect the reality many countries face&#151;and unnecessarily restrict the amount of debt relief we can provide.

 At the Spring Meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) on 12 April, ministers discussed the report of the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund on a Statutory Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism. The conclusion of that discussion is set out in the IMFC communique released on 12 April as:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Committee welcomes the work of the IMF in developing a concrete proposal for a statutory sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM) and expresses its appreciation for the IMF management and staffs efforts. The extensive analysis and consultation undertaken in developing the proposal have served to promote better understanding of the issues to be addressed in bringing about orderly resolution of crises. The Managing Director's report sets out the current position. The Committee, while recognizing that it is not feasible now to move forward to establish the SDRM, agrees that work should continue on issues raised in its development that are of general relevance to the orderly resolution of financial crises. These issues include inter-creditor equity considerations, enhancing transparency and disclosure, and aggregation issues. The IMF will report on progress at the Committee's next meeting."</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2003]:</i> Government policy is that UK public spending financed from the EC Budget is subject to normal public sector budgeting rules. This reflects the fact that UK taxpayers have an interest in spending on programmes funded from the EC Budget being spent in a way which is consistent with national priorities.
<P>

<a name="30508w07.html_para0">Departments have therefore in general needed budgetary cover for spending funded from the EC Budget, including spending on research and development. To improve incentives, however, a recent review has resulted in changes to the public sector budgeting rules, so that from 2003&#150;04 departments which receive income from the EC Budget for commercially- or competitively-let research contracts will be able to offset half of their income from qualifying programmes against spending within their departmental expenditure limit.

The Saving Gateway is currently being piloted and independent evaluation will assess its effect on saving behaviour. The Government are also committed to strengthening the saving habit of future generations.

<a name="30508w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The lease duty consultation after Budget 2002 was very helpful in informing the proposed new lease duty structure, which incorporates many consultees' views. The Chancellor announced in Budget 2003 that he is happy for further consultation to take place on the proposed new structure. In order to facilitate this, a time-limited regulatory power has been incorporated in Finance Bill 2003 to allow a suitable alternative proposal to be put in place for the implementation of Stamp Duty Land Tax in December 2003. However, any alternative will only replace the current proposals if it can be shown to be a better way of achieving the same objectives. The Inland Revenue will convene further discussions shortly with representative organisations and with businesses who have expressed a particular interest in the proposals.

 <i>[holding answer 6 May 2003]</i>: The US Government has let a number of contracts to US firms, mainly through US AID and the US Army Corps of Engineers. Information on these contracts is available on the Trade Partners UK website, with full details on US Government websites, including US AID. The main US AID reconstruction contract was awarded to Bechtel on 17 April. We are supporting efforts by UK companies to win sub-contracts but companies are not obliged to inform us if and when they win contracts.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2003]:</i> UK public spending financed from the EU's Budget is subject to normal public sector budgeting rules. This reflects the fact that UK taxpayers have an interest in spending on programmes funded from the EU's Budget being spent in a way which is consistent with national priorities.
<P>

<a name="30508w08.html_para2">Departments and their sponsored bodies, including PPARC, have therefore in general needed budgetary cover for spending funded from the EU's Budget, including spending on research and development. To improve incentives, however, a recent review has resulted in changes to the public sector budgeting rules, so that from 2003&#150;04 departments and their sponsored bodies including PPARC which receive income from the EU's Budget for commercially- or competitively-let research contracts will be able to offset half of their income from qualifying programmes against spending within their departmental expenditure limit.

 Disability Living Allowance (DLA) provides a contribution towards the extra costs that severely disabled people face as a result of their disabilities, and entitlement is based solely on a person's need for personal care and/or their walking difficulties. DLA is payable to people both in and out of work, and therefore does not disincentivise recipients wishing to take up work.
<P>

<a name="30508w08.html_para7">We recognise that, for many disabled people, work is made possible through receiving additional support and we make no assumptions that the severity of a person's disability has changed simply because they are undertaking work. Decision makers receive specific guidance that awards of DLA should only be altered where a person's care or mobility needs have changed.

<a name="30508w09.html_para1">In 2001, Newcastle upon Tyne was chosen as an Action Team for Jobs area because the local authority was one of the 30 with the lowest labour market participation in Britain.
<P>

<a name="30508w09.html_para2">The selection of wards within the area to be covered by the Newcastle Action Team was based on the proportion of the working age population not in employment. The wards targeted had a working age employment rate of 58.5 per cent. or below at the time of selection (April 2001).
<P>

<a name="30508w09.html_para3">The Office for National Statistics does not produce employment rates down to individual wards from the Labour Force Survey. For this specific purpose a one off exercise was carried out to calculate data at ward level in action team areas. At ward level there is a larger margin of error and so a combination of data&#151;including benefit recipient data&#151;was used to rank wards in Action Team LADs. The table shows the employment rates for wards in the City of Newcastle local authority area derived from this exercise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment his Department has made of whether in the <i>(a)</i> short, <i>(b)</i> medium and <i>(c)</i> long term the recent falls in equity performance will lead to consumers buying cash investments instead of equity investments.

<P>

<a name="30508w10.html_para0">Recent declines in equity prices have seen a fall in retail purchases of equity investments. The declines in equity prices should be viewed in the context of the historically higher return on equities over the longer term compared to other mainstream investments. Over time, stock market performance is likely to reflect the underlying performance of the economy. The fundamental drivers of a successful economy&#151;high employment, low inflation and low interest rates&#151;are in place.

These help to ensure that the work placement is running smoothly and that no discrepancies exist from that of the original notified vacancy including changes to duties, working hours, wage and expected duration and that the employee is receiving adequate supervision and mentoring.

 Specific data on the number of individuals contributing to stakeholder pensions, including a break down by region, will not be available until later this year. However, latest figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) covering the United Kingdom, indicate that 1.25 million stakeholder pensions had been sold up to the end of December 2002, of which an estimated 97 per cent. had been bought for individuals of working age (comprising 56 per cent. men and 44 per cent. women). ABI figures show the number of stakeholder pension policies sold, not the number of individuals who have taken out a stakeholder pension. People are allowed to hold more than one stakeholder pension.

 The parliamentary website has two search facilities.

The company has provided the service since it was first launched in 1996 and most recently was awarded a five-year contract, with the possibility of extension for up to a further two years, from 1 April 2000. This service was modified in July last year, as part of the redesign of the Parliamentary website, by the provision of a new front end search menu and the inclusion of the ability to search across the remainder of material on the parliamentary website.
<P>

<a name="30508w11.html_para3">The second relates to the more specialised searches that can be undertaken within the POLIS system. This system is due to be replaced by the end of 2004 and, as part of the tendering exercise that is already well under way, options for the replacement of the search facility will be evaluated. In both cases the search functions are part of a larger service and so it is not possible to identify the specific costs incurred in providing them. In any case, as a matter of policy, the House does not disclose the cost of individual contracts, which are commercially confidential.

 Families with children who are seeking asylum may be detained under the detention powers contained in paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. Detention in such cases would normally be used in the following circumstances: initially, while identity and basis of claim are being established; where there is a risk of failure to comply with the terms of temporary admission or release; or to effect removal from the United Kingdom. In addition, detention may be appropriate if it appears that the asylum claim is straightforward and capable of being decided quickly using fast-track procedures.

<P>

<a name="30508w12.html_para6">A detailed assessment of the status of the badger population was carried out by scientists at Bristol university and was published in 1997. This compared national surveys of badgers carried out before and after the introduction of the Protection of Badgers Act in 1992. The research showed a 77 per cent. increase in the badger population between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. The survey also reported a halving of the incidence of illegal digging of badger setts over the same period, and concluded that reduced persecution had allowed the badger population to recover.

 We have had no discussions with authorities on this specific matter.

In addition, London local authorities may use surplus on-street parking income for purposes specified in the London transport strategy, which include on-street measures to promote cycling.

 Under the contracts drawn up between Metronet and London Underground the work to upgrade and refurbish parts of the London Underground will be carried out as a rolling programme across the network. Metronet have already announced that in the first year of the contracts, enabling works will start on the upgrading of the Victoria Line, and the design for the new trains to be introduced on that line will also begin. Metronet will be spending around &#163;1 billion on maintenance and capital projects in each of the first three years. I understand that initiatives to improve asset availability are expected to improve the overall reliability of all assets by 10 per cent. by the end of the first year, and by around 30 per cent. on the sub-surface lines and 20 per cent. on their deep tube lines by the end of the third year. Metronet is committed to increasing the number of trains available for service on the Central Line in 2004 and again in 2005, and on the Bakerloo and Victoria Lines in 2005. Around 36 stations will have been refurbished and a further 10 modernised by the end of the third year of the contracts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has, in conjunction with HEFCE, for improving the sensitivity of the existing postcode premium in encouraging higher education institutions to improve access for disadvantaged students.  [110880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w15.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 From 2003&#150;04 HEFCE has reformed the widening participation allocation to take into account previous educational attainment and age of students together with where they live. This reform recognises the extra costs associated with recruiting and supporting undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds. As our higher education White Paper makes clear, we are working with HEFCE to explore more sensitive and appropriate measures, and HEFCE will consult further as data becomes available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w15.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We want the provision of higher education to be flexible to enable people to combine studies with work, where they wish. Our recent White Paper "The future of higher education" sets a 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 829W</I><P>
framework for some of this flexible provision. For example, we are improving support for those studying part-time. We have introduced foundation degrees, which offer flexible modes of study and can be combined with employment, reducing the barriers to learning. We are also supporting the development of the eUniversities project and welcome other flexible forms of provision, such as the online degrees recently announced by Ultralab. Through HEFCE we are trying to encourage a more widespread and consistent use of credit across higher education that will enable a more flexible approach to learning for students.

 Children's Centres will provide integrated care and education for young children, health services, family support, and a base for child minders. Managers of Children's Centres will need to have the leadership and management skills to co-ordinate a multi-disciplinary team.
<P>

<a name="30508w15.html_para0">Children's Centres will be required to have strong support for the teaching and learning offered. This should be secured by the employment of qualified teachers so that children using the centre have their activities planned and substantially led by a teacher with early years training or experience. After listening to representations from the teaching profession, the Sure Start Unit has identified that in most centres the employment of an early years teacher on a half-time basis would achieve this objective. However, we expect that this would be a minimum which many centres would exceed, and that others would build on over time.

on the Department of Health (DH) website. Schools are able to inform and reassure their pupils, which should reduce the tendency to victimise all those of Eastern origin. Any bullying or abuse which does take place should be dealt with in line with anti-bullying polices on which we have issued general advice which has recently been the subject of positive evaluation. This advice refers explicitly to racist bullying and schools are required to report all incidents of racist bullying, including name calling, to their LEA. We would expect schools' standard policies to ensure that no child is discriminated against and therefore have not issued any separate guidance to schools.

 Information on the occasions where my Department and non-departmental public bodies failed to pay valid invoices within 30 days or after the agreed credit period can be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, I am able to say that the percentage of bills which were paid by my Department within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice was 95 per cent. for the financial year 2001&#150;02. In addition, the percentage of bills paid by my Department's executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), where the information was available, is shown in the following table.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Energy consumption: this is weather-corrected in the usual manner, using annual degree days relative to the 20-year average for 1990&#150;91. The figures are those reported on for the Central Government Estate campaign, and generally include each Department's main estate plus all agencies, but not NDPBs.<P>

2. Energy expenditure: this is actual spend, and from April 2001, includes the Climate Change Levy.<P>

3. Energy/m2: this variable allows for changes in both weather and estate size on energy consumption. So annual changes will generally reflect efficiency changes.<P>

4. Savings over 1997&#150;98: these have been expressed as percentage savings relative to the first year quoted here, and are based on the figures in the preceding column.<P>

5. Energy efficiency spend: note that this is not necessarily a good measure of an effective energy efficiency policy. For example, when a new building is commissioned or an existing one refurbished, good design can actually reduce capital costs, e.g. by avoiding air conditioning. The costs of an effective energy management team may also not be included.<P>

<P>

<a name="30508w16.html_para1">The Energy White Paper, "Our Energy Future&#151;Creating a Low Carbon Economy", made clear the importance the Government attach to improving energy efficiency in their own estate. This is reflected in several targets. There is currently an interim target of a one per cent. per annum on-going reduction in weather-corrected carbon emissions, pending the development of new indicators and targets based on benchmarking the performance of each Department's largest buildings. These new targets are planned to be in place later this year. New targets for Government Departments' use of CHP generated electricity will also be established during 2003.
<P>

<a name="30508w16.html_para2">In addition, the review of Government procurement has identified areas where procurement could reinforce the achievement of these targets, and arrangements are being made centrally for Departments to purchase goods with high energy efficiency standards and which provide good value for money.

"All Departments will ensure that by 31 March 2003, at least five per cent. of their electricity comes from renewable sources that are exempt from the Climate Change Levy or from self generation, provided this does not entail excessive cost. This will rise to at least 10 per cent. supply from such sources by 31 March 2008, but will be reviewed after 31 March 2003 to take account of market conditions following the introduction of the renewables obligation. The review of 2003 will include consideration of increasing or bringing forward the target".

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what resources he has allocated to fund the Education Fast Track Initiative; and if he will make a statement.  [111577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Fast Track teaching programme is a programme of accelerated professional development, designed to attract, retain and rapidly develop transformational school leaders of the future. The total investment in the Fast Track programme in 2002&#150;03 was just over &#163;8 million. The total investment allocated for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;13.5 million, an increase which reflects the rapid growth in numbers on the Fast Track programme, from 249 teachers and trainee teachers in September 2002 to an estimated 600+ expected by September 2003.
<P>

<a name="30508w16.html_para4">This allocation funds all aspects of the programme, including the practical resources for teachers and schools: enhanced Initial Teacher Training; Fast Track bursaries; national professional development events; regional and local events; a network of Area Co-ordinators; in-school mentors; a facilitated on-line community; additional teachers' pay; laptops and associated software and hardware; and individualised support for professional development.

 Information was issued to all local education authorities on 15 January 2003, which outlined the changes to free school meal eligibility that would apply from April 2003. Further information, which dealt specifically with the new free school meal (tax credit) eligibility category, was issued to all local education authorities on 28 February 2003. From 6 April 2003, children whose parents receive the following 'support' payments are eligible to receive free school meals: income support; income based jobseeker's allowance; support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; and child tax credit, provided that they do not also receive working tax credit and have an annual income (as assessed by the Inland Revenue) that does not exceed &#163;13,230.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps he is taking to monitor and assess the quality of <i>(a)</i> selection of trainees, <i>(b)</i> in-school training and <i>(c)</i> overall outcome of the Graduate Teachers programme.  [111779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 All entrants to initial teacher training in England must satisfy the requirements that my right hon. Friend has laid down in "Qualifying to Teach: Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status and Requirements for Initial Teacher Training". The selection of individual candidates is, however, the responsibility of training providers themselves. The Teacher Training Agency's functions include the enhancement of quality of both conventional and employment-based training routes. In this context, measures taken by the Agency to promote high-quality employment-based training include the creation, from September 2002, of 80 Designated Recommending Bodies responsible for the allocation of most places on the Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) and the supervision of in-school training. The Agency also oversees the monitoring and peer review of candidates' training plans and an annual survey of employment-based trainees whose main focus is the level of their satisfaction with the training received.
<P>

<a name="30508w16.html_para5">Intense competition for places on the GTP has ensured a high standard of entrant to the programme. This is reflected in the fact that, since the programme was created in 1998, over 90 per cent. of GTP trainees have consistently succeeded in gaining Qualified Teacher Status.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Our National Languages Strategy document, published in December 2002, makes clear our intention to ensure that the opportunity to learn languages has a key place in the transformed secondary school of the future. At Key Stage 3, all pupils will continue to have an opportunity to learn at least one language and develop cultural understanding. We also want to raise standards and enrich the language learning experience.
<P>

<a name="30508w17.html_para0">The current National Curriculum requirements at Key Stage 4 include modern foreign languages. However, we do not believe that requiring schools to teach languages to every young person beyond the age of 14 is the best way forward. Around 36,000 pupils currently do not study a language at Key Stage 4 under the present disapplication arrangements. We therefore intend to amend the statutory requirement at Key Stage 4 so that schools will no longer be required to teach modern foreign languages to all pupils. However, every pupil has an entitlement to study a modern foreign language and are therefore required to ensure as a minimum that they are available to any pupil wishing to study them. Our ultimate goal is to move to a position where young people are motivated to study modern foreign languages, rather than being forced to do so.

<a name="30508w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In its first five years, 1998&#150;2003, the independent/state school partnerships grant scheme was allocated &#163;3.3 million of Departmental funding. Independent evaluation of the scheme has found that it is achieving its aims and objectives and provides good value for money. As a result, the scheme has been allocated a significant increase of funding over the next three years: &#163;1.25 million in 2003&#150;04 rising to &#163;2 million in 2005&#150;06. We expect to announce the outcome of the recent application round in June.
<P>

<a name="30508w17.html_para4">We believe the independent sector can and is making a substantial contribution to our education system, through a range of collaborative models and policy initiatives, such as joint professional development, sharing of ideas on curriculum development and classroom observation.

<a name="30508w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the average level of debt accumulated by university students and students in higher education at the end of their course of study was <i>(a)</i> in the most recent year for which figures are available and <i>(b)</i> in 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [106593]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w18.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Student loan borrowers are liable to repay their loans from the April after they finish or leave their course, depending on their income. They are described as "entering repayment status" from that date. Students that started their course from the 1998/99 academic year will repay income contingent loans. Loans for those who started their course before 1998/99 are repayable on a mortgage style basis. The table shows estimates of average student loan debt at the point at which they entered repayment status for borrowers who became liable to repay their loans in financial years 1998&#150;99 and 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30508w18.html_para1">New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998/99. Most new students in that year (apart from specified exceptions) received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (about 25 per cent. of the support available) and non-means-tested student loans (about 75 per cent. of the support). From 1999/2000, students who entered higher education after 1998/99 received support for maintenance expenditure through loans. About three quarters of the value of these loans is not subject to means-testing. The repayments on these loans are on an income contingent basis.

<P>

<a name="30508w18.html_para2">Students who started their course up to 1997/98, and those who entered in 1998/99 under the existing arrangements, are eligible for mortgage style loans. Students in this category received support for maintenance through non-means-tested loans (about 50 per cent. of the support available), and means-tested grants for those that qualify (about 50 per cent. of the support).
<P>

<a name="30508w18.html_para3">The first cohort of students on a three-year degree course who entered higher education under the new student support arrangements became liable for repayment in April 2002. That cohort includes a disproportionate number of students on shorter courses as well as those who have left higher education before completing their courses. Therefore the average level of debt will not be representative of the average debt experienced by those who complete their courses.

 As part of the ongoing training programme, the Ministry of Defence sponsors its personnel for qualifications and awards and seeks external accreditation within the National Qualifications Framework. These qualifications include Foundation and Advanced Modern Apprenticeships (MA) in a number of areas. These areas include: Agriculture; Business Administration; Construction; Engineering; Health, Care and Public Services; Hospitality; Leisure, Sport and Travel; Media and Design; Retailing and Customer Services; and

<P>
<a name="30508w19.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Aid agencies providing humanitarian assistance in Iraq are fully independent of coalition military forces. The Humanitarian Operations Centre in Kuwait City and the Humanitarian Aid Co-ordination Centre in the US Embassy in Amman encourage them to contact coalition forces in the area in which they will operate, in order to ensure they have up-to-date advice, but they are under no obligation to do so. The headquarters of the United Kingdom 1st Armoured Division in Basra includes two humanitarian advisors from the Department for International Development who provide advice on relief activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what percentage of food aid to Iraq the US and UK military aim to import via Umm Qasr.  [108054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w19.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The import of food aid into Iraq is largely the responsibility of a number of Agencies which are independent of the United Kingdom or other Governments. It is difficult to judge, therefore, what proportion of the aid will come through Umm Qasr. However, the rail link from Umm Qasr to the rest of the country is likely to make the port more viable for the import of bulk supplies than road routes. For this reason we believe that a substantial amount of aid will enter Iraq via Umm Qasr once the port is fully open to shipping.

<a name="30508w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Within the United Kingdom, terrorism is a crime and is therefore the responsibility of the police. The Home Office are the lead Government Department for terrorist matters and the Department for Transport for transport issues. The terrorist threat in UK waters, as in the UK itself, is kept under constant review. The Royal Navy has a number of graduated response options available to assist the civil authorities in the protection of merchant shipping in UK waters, 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 847W</I><P>
depending on the level of threat. These range from routine advice and guidance to merchant shipping to more proactive measures, including RN support to the Police, HM Customs and Excise or other civil power, if necessary. Forces available are drawn from those routinely tasked with the maintenance of the integrity of UK waters. In addition, specialist Ministry of Defence elements with dedicated maritime counter terrorist roles are kept at high readiness.

A series of meetings (which began in Nasiriyah and Baghdad) will draw together Iraqi consensus from a broad range of opinion in order to establish an Iraqi Interim Authority in four weeks time.

 We are seriously exploring the option of holding an Iraqi women's conference to produce representatives. The UK funded "Towards Freedom" television channel will soon be transmitting programmes to encourage women to participate in this process. Our military on the ground and our secondees in the Coalition's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) are aware of their responsibilities under Resolution 1325. A gender expert from the Women's Equality Unit at the Department for Trade and Industry will soon join ORHA to focus on these issues.

 There is no definitive figure for rough diamonds sold illegally to fund civil conflict.

With the establishment of peace in both countries, that estimate has been revised down to less than 2 per cent.

 Foreign Office officials attending the Kimberley Process plenary session in Johannesburg from 28&#150;30 April held extensive discussions with the head of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) delegation. DRC officials explained the problems their country continued to face, in view of the improving but still difficult internal situation and the activities of their immediate neighbours, in particular in relation to the removal of rough diamonds from the DRC. In response the UK delegation underlined the need to enhance the transparency and monitoring provisions of the Kimberley Process certification scheme in order to highlight trade anomalies and possible illegal practices.
<P>

<a name="30508w21.html_para2">The plenary session resulted in agreement on the detail of the regular exchange of statistical data and on the screening of all members and applicants to ensure their laws and regulations meet the minimum common standards required by the scheme, two helpful initiatives on transparency and monitoring.

 Foreign Office officials have had regular contact with their Belgian, French and European Commission counterparts over the situation in the Central African Republic following events there on 15 March. In particular, the European Community made it clear to other members of the Kimberley Process that in the immediate aftermath of the coup in Bangui the Kimberley Process should temporarily withdraw recognition of the CAR Kimberley certificate, thereby effectively suspending all exports of rough diamonds from that country.
<P>

<a name="30508w21.html_para3">The Kimberley Process has since agreed to lift the suspension, but only in exchange for agreement to send a monitoring mission to determine whether the controls exercised in the CAR meet the minimum common standards required by the Kimberley certification scheme. A member of the Foreign Office's Kimberly implementation unit will be part of that mission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Although there are no recent export figures available, we understand that the Central African Republic, before the change in government in mid-March, was reporting exports of rough diamonds worth approximately $ 100 million per year, most to Belgium. The authorities in Bangui have reportedly suspended the licences of diamond operators in the country, pending their review and re-issuing.
<P>

<a name="30508w21.html_para4">Meanwhile the Kimberley Process will send a monitoring mission to the Central African Republic in the near future to determine whether the internal controls regulating the diamond industry meet the minimum common standards set by the Kimberley certification scheme.

 FCO officials have made several representations in Washington about the need for a US legal base for implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for rough diamonds, the principal international tool for tackling conflict diamonds, and for effective interim domestic measures. We were pleased that President Bush signed into law, on 25 April the Clean Diamond Trade Act. This has strengthened compliance with the scheme and will encourage many other countries hoping to be part of the Kimberley Process to ensure their legislation, regulations, rules and procedures are completed as soon as possible.

issues. The meeting produced agreement in several areas, including the establishment of an internal committee to ensure that all current and future members of the Kimberley Process have adopted laws, regulations, rules and procedures that meet the minimum common standards set by the scheme.
<P>

<a name="30508w21.html_para5">The meeting also agreed to send a monitoring mission to the Central African Republic, following the coup d'etat on 15 March, to check that the internal controls required to meet the scheme's standards remain effective.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Kimberley Process certification scheme on the trade in rough diamonds is an international agreement adopted last November by 45 governments, the European Community, representatives of civil society and the World Diamond Council. It requires its members to ensure that it produces, exports and imports only rough stones certified by member governments as free of conflict diamonds. Since its adoption a further 25 countries have applied to join, making the Kimberley Process a truly inclusive scheme, embracing all diamond producers and major trading and processing states.
<P>

<a name="30508w21.html_para6">Implementation of the scheme began on 1 January 2003. At its first review meeting in Johannesburg from 28&#150;30 April, the members of the Kimberley Process agreed further measures to increase effective implementation and to ensure consistent compliance with the minimum common standards laid down in the scheme. Initial results are very encouraging, helped by peace processes in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone. A further more detailed assessment will take place at the next Kimberley meeting in October.

 Industry analysts estimate that, following the cessation of hostilities in Sierra Leone and in Angola, less than 2 per cent. of the world's trade in rough diamonds is made up of conflict diamonds, that is stones sold illegally to fund civil war.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the link between mercury in vaccines given to babies and <i>(a)</i> autism and <i>(b)</i> heart disease.  [109928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w23.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Thiomersal is an ethylmercury-containing compound that has played an important role either as a preservative or in the initial stages of the manufacture of some vaccines for over 60 years. As with all medicinal products, the Medicines and Healthcare Products RegulatoryAgency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) keep the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines under continual review. The CSM has reviewed the safety, including postulated neurological adverse effects, of thiomersal-containing vaccines on a number of occasions.
<P>

<a name="30508w23.html_para9">CSM has recently reviewed two UK-based epidemiological studies that have provided reassuring results regarding the safety of thiomersal in vaccines, in relation to neurodevelopmental disorders. One of these studies, which used the United Kingdom's general practice research database (GPRD), specifically investigated whether there is any link between early thiomersal exposure through immunisation and autism. This study concluded that administration of thiomersal through childhood immunisation in the UK was not associated with an increased risk of developing a neurological developmental disability, including autism.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 862W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30508w23.html_para10">The CSM has carefully considered the results of a recent study, by Geier and Geier, that suggests an association between thiomersal exposure through the United States childhood immunisation schedule and the development of autism and heart disease. CSM advised that the methodology in this publication had been inadequately described and that the authors conclusions regarding the association between thiomersal in vaccines and autism, speech disorders and heart disease are not justified. The CSM has advised that, with the exception of allergic reactions such as redness and swelling at the injection site, there is no evidence of harm from thiomersal contained in vaccines. The CSM has advised that the benefits of immunisation with thiomersal-containing vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w23.html_wqn9"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to phase out the use of mercury in vaccines given to babies.  [109929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w23.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The only vaccines used in the United Kingdom routine childhood immunisation programme that contain a mercury compound are diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis and diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. The mercury is present as ethylmercury in the excipient thiomersal.
<P>

<a name="30508w23.html_para11">While there is no evidence of harm caused by thiomersal in vaccines, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency recommended that it would be prudent to promote the use of vaccines without thiomersal as a precautionary measure. The Committee on Safety of Medicines has endorsed this recommendation and continues to do so. Manufacturers are actively developing research programmes to eliminate, substitute or reduce thiomersal in vaccines following these recommendations. This may take time because manufacturers are required to ensure that the reduction, replacement or elimination of thiomersal does not affect the safety, quality and efficacy of the final vaccine.
<P>

<a name="30508w23.html_para12">To date, a number of UK licensed vaccines have had levels of thiomersal reduced or removed completely from the manufacture of the component antigens or from the final vaccine. These developments are regularly reviewed and on 1 April 2003, a letter was sent from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to UK vaccine marketing authorisation holders, asking for an update on progress in reducing or removing thiomersal from vaccines.

 "Keeping the NHS Local&#151;A New Direction of Travel" highlighted the developing role of ambulatory care in the provision of local health services.

 Officials in the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills have worked closely with the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) on all aspects of their project on the educational attainment of looked after children, including on the development of the new targets.

 This information is not collected centrally. The Department does not advocate any one single model of maternity care in preference to others, but acknowledges that midwife-led units play important role in the local network of services available to women during pregnancy and labour and after birth.
<P>

<a name="30508w25.html_para1">The maternity records collected through the Hospital Episodes Statistics system are usually identified only to trust level, rather than to any specific unit within the trust. Some trusts provide information regarding the staff group with lead responsibility for care, for example, midwife-led or consultant-led, but this does not allow the identification of midwife-only units.

 Implementation of the national service framework (NSF) for older people is supported by the substantial additional investment that has been provided for the National Health Service since the NSF's publication in 2001. In 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, the NHS received average annual increases of 6.3 per cent, above inflation. Cash allocations to primary care trusts in the three years from 2003&#150;04 will provide an average increase over the three years of more than 30 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the number of NHS beds which could be released by programmes of earlier planned discharges.  [111180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w25.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There has been a continued reduction in delayed discharges in England since September 2001, freeing up national health service capacity. The latest figures show that in December 2002, there were 4,586 people delayed on any one day, compared to 7,065 in September 2001. The provisions of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc) Act 2003 will ensure that this reduction continues, to reach the target of minimal delays by 2006.

 There are five positron emission tomography (PET) scanners in National Health Service hospitals in England used for routine clinical assessments. They are situated at Guys, St. Thomas', 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 870W</I><P>
Middlesex, Mount Vernon and Hammersmith Hospitals. Four other PET scanners are used primarily for research and are located in dedicated research facilities in London, Cambridge and Manchester.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w25.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Data is not collected centrally on waiting times for positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be scanned.
<P>

<a name="30508w25.html_para4">Where a scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two months wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which will be in place for all cancers by the end of 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w26.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Mental health services at individual establishments are planned and delivered by local management and its national health service partners, drawing on jointly completed local health needs assessments and the more general guidance in "Changing the Outlook A Strategy for Developing and Modernising Health Services in Prisons" (December 2001). The strategy drew particular attention to the culturally diverse nature of the prison population and made it clear that prisons are expected to identify the needs of every element of their population and ensure that the mental health services provided are sensitive to them. This includes providing information in languages other than English and ensuring that, where necessary, prisoners have ready access to interpreters.

 School nurses work within schools and local communities.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2003]:</i> The Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1979 does provide the power to detain for examination any person leaving an aircraft where there are "reasonable grounds" for suspecting that they are suffering from or have been exposed to infection.

 If Level 2 specialised services commissioning groups wish to set up a national group for planning purposes they are free to do so. One such group, (severe) Burn Care Services has already been established.

 Primary care trusts are required to belong to collaborative commissioning groups for specialised services and agree the remit, powers and rules of engagement of these groups. Level 2 collaborative commissioning groups, which will generally cover the same or similar area to the former regional specialised commissioning groups, commission those specialised services with planning populations around three to six million.

<P>
<a name="30508w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 To ensure stability during 2002&#150;03, whilst primary care trusts (PCTs) assumed responsibility for commissioning specialised services, they were asked to honour previously agreed financial commitments and programmes of service reviews for specialised services. This commitment will not be extended to 2003&#150;04.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w26.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Berry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the preparedness of primary care trusts to assume responsibility for specialised commissioning has improved since the Department of Health conducted a review last year.  [111146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 In January 2002, the Department undertook a survey of commissioning arrangements for specialised services. At that time, health authorities were the bodies responsible for commissioning. The survey did not therefore consider the role of primary care trusts, which have been responsible for commissioning since April 2002.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w26.html_wqn11"><B> Dr. Richard Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how he will monitor and report the effectiveness of the new arrangements for specialised commissioning;  [111777]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether regional specialised commissioning groups will continue to commission specialised services where constituent primary care trusts so determine.  [111776]<P></UL>

 I refer the hon. Member to the responses I gave my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) above.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what mechanisms will be included in the Children's NSF to ensure that health and social services professionals consult young carers on their needs.  [109934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w26.html_spnew13"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The national service framework (NSF) will help to ensure that care is centred on the child or young person and that health and social services are designed and delivered around their needs. It will also ensure that young people and their families can take an active part in making decisions about their care.
<P>

<a name="30508w26.html_para2">An expert working group has been established to focus specifically on the needs of 'children in special circumstances', which is intended to include young carers. The NSF aims to narrow the gap in outcomes between children in special circumstances and their peers by putting in place systems to identify children such as child carers, offer them high quality, holistic assessment, and to promote and safeguard their health and wellbeing. The NSF will ensure that health and social care professionals are aware of the needs of young carers, and actively consult with them in planning any decisions which affect them. In support of this work, a wide-ranging series of consultations have been held with different groups of children in special circumstances, including one with a young carers group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps have been taken by the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment to <i>(a)</i> measure the decline of saltmarsh on the shores of Strangford Lough and <i>(b)</i> develop a strategy to prevent further declines in this habitat.  [111532]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w29.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) of the Department of the Environment has in place a monitoring programme covering Strangford Lough which assesses the condition of all the habitats and species of national and European importance. As part of this programme, the quality and quantity of saltmarsh is monitored. The information currently available to EHS does not indicate that there is any significant decline in the extent of saltmarsh around Strangford Lough.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para3">In September 2002, the Department launched a voluntary management scheme to maintain and enhance the habitats and species of Areas of Special Scientific Interest. This scheme is aimed at land managers and will play an important role in, among other things, helping to prevent any further decline of saltmarsh by ensuring that inappropriate management and potentially damaging activities are discouraged.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment has to designate special protection areas to conserve the habitat of the Hen Harrier.  [111538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w29.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 No sites have yet been selected in Northern Ireland for the Hen Harrier under the UK Special Protection Area (SPA) Review. There have been several reasons for this. There has been limited information until now about the geographical distribution and continuity of breeding site use in relation to the species. Moreover, much of the relevant nesting habitat is commercial forest, whereas the Department's policy has been to select as SPAs only areas of natural and semi-natural habitat. Nevertheless, some sites with habitat suitable for the Hen Harrier have been designated as Areas of Special Scientific Interest and/or Special Areas of Conservation, one such example being Slieve Beagh, although none of these sites lists the Hen Harrier as a selection feature.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 884W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para4">However, EHS now plans to review the position based on analysis of new data on geographical distribution and breeding site use. This will be used to determine whether any site merits designation for its breeding Hen Harrier population. In arriving at this decision, EHS will take into consideration a number of criteria, including the proportion of the all-island breeding population held at the site, the density of breeding birds and the history of occupation. The process will also take into account if the southern portion of sites that straddle the border that have been identified as significant for this species by the Republic of Ireland authorities.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para5">It is planned to complete the review during the current financial year and, depending on the findings, to undertake public consultation thereafter.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para6">In the meantime, Hen Harriers and their nests continue to be afforded fall protection under the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. Furthermore, they are listed as a Northern Ireland priority species of conservation concern, and EHS intends to publish a Species Action Plan in the near future to address their conservation needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment has taken to implement the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Areas of Special Scientific Interest.  [111533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w29.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment is still considering the Report on Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs), which was published by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 27 March 2003. However, the Department had already identified a number of the issues which that report addressed; and steps had been taken to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para7">Among these actions were, firstly, the introduction last year of the Management of Sensitive Sites scheme to provide financial incentives to landowners to encourage the proper management of ASSIs; secondly, the enactment in February this year of the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 to strengthen the Department's powers to protect and manage ASSIs; thirdly, the allocation of additional resources to the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department in the 2002 Northern Ireland Budget, for the designation, management and protection of ASSIs.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para8">These actions deal with key aspects of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. The remaining conclusions and recommendations of the report are under consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment has to eradicate the Ruddy Duck in Northern Ireland.  [111534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w29.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The establishment of the American Ruddy Duck as a breeding species in Europe has been widely acknowledged as a threat to the native European White-headed Duck. The UK Government accepts in principle that the Ruddy Duck should be eradicated as a wild species in the UK and the rest of Europe, in 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 885W</I><P>
accordance with Article 8 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In practice, the Government is investigating alternative methods of controlling the population.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para9">Great Britain, with around 5,800 birds, holds by far the largest population in Europe. Northern Ireland's population is thought to be about 125. The Ruddy Duck is currently protected under Northern Ireland legislation.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para10">As Ruddy Duck are known to be elusive, I have asked the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) to confirm the scale of the problem in Northern Ireland by undertaking a survey of small water bodies in the area where they are known to occur. I have also asked EHS to investigate and advise me on the possible need for a change in the legislative status of the species. As well as undertaking these studies, EHS will monitor research taking place into the most efficient and humane method of eradication, and advise me on how these findings might be applied in Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans the Environment and Heritage Service has to establish a formal enforcement policy for the protection of areas of special scientific interest as promised in the EHS Corporate Plan for 1996&#150;97.  [111535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w29.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 In November 2001, the Department of the Environment published for consultation proposals for legislative changes to strengthen the management and protection of ASSIs. These took account of comments received during earlier public consultation in March 2001. The proposals were given statutory effect in the Environment (NI) Order 2002.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para11">The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) of the Department already has in place a policy for addressing issues of compliance with the legislation on areas of special scientific interest by landowners and occupiers. The policy was ratified in November 2002 and implemented with immediate effect. I am arranging for a copy of the document, entitled "Compliance Policy and General Guidance" to be placed on the EHS website (www.ehsni.gov.uk), and it should be available by the end of May 2003.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w29.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 On 13 September 2000, the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) of the Department of the Environment declared a large

<P><I>8 May 2003 : Column 886W</I><P>
portion of Ballynahone Bog Area of Special Scientific Interest as a National Nature Reserve (NNR). Management as a NNR strengthens the protection of the nature conservation features of the site. It is managed jointly by the Ulster Wildlife Trust and Friends of Ballynahone Bog.
<P>

<a name="30508w29.html_para14">EHS owns some 70 per cent. of the land within the ASSI. It has also offered to acquire the interest of most of the other landowners within that area with the specific aim of extending the NNR.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the range of services provided under the NHS to patients with fibromyalgia in Northern Ireland.  [111329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Patients suffering from fibromyalgia may experience a wide range of symptoms such as pain, fatigue, a tingling sensation in arms and legs, swelling in the joints, headaches, depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome. There is no specific diagnostic test or cure for this illness and I fully appreciate how this may lead to great distress and frustration for sufferers.
<P>

<a name="30508w30.html_para2">As the symptoms in each sufferer vary greatly, patients receive treatment through a range of services in both the primary and secondary care settings. This may include access to rheumatology, neurology and mental health services. Management of the condition also involves self-help initiatives such as aerobic exercise programmes, relaxation therapy, and medication to treat symptoms such as painkillers or anti-depressants, and psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy.

 Maintenance and improvement of its stock is the Housing Executive's top priority and in the current financial year &#163;113 million has been allocated for this purpose. I will continue to seek the necessary funding to ensure that the Housing Executive has adequate resources to deal with its continuing needs and priorities in this regard. The Housing Executive is at present formulating a maintenance investment strategy to re-appraise expenditure priorities over the next 10 years.
<P>

<a name="30508w30.html_para3">Registered Housing Associations are responsible for maintenance and major repairs work to their own properties and fund the necessary works from their own resources. There is no backlog in these areas, but housing association maintenance/improvement activities are audited on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the Department's requirements which includes the Tenants' Guarantee and the Right to Repair Scheme.

 Information on the number of individuals awaiting speech therapy assessment is not collected centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, information is collected centrally on completed waiting times for a first outpatient appointment of an episode of care with a community speech and language therapist. In the quarter ending 31 December 2002, 2,480 persons attended their first out-patient appointment. Of these, 209 (8.4 per cent.) had waited for six months or more.

(3) what assessment he has made of the impact of the Office of Fair Trading report, The Control of Entry Regulations and Retail Pharmacy Services in the UK on the provision of health promotion and prevention services in Northern Ireland with special reference to the provision of primary care services and facilities, in line with DHSS&PS plans and priorities;  [105531]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30508w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 I announced on 26 March 2003 that I would not be accepting the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) report on retail pharmacies for Northern Ireland, and the Secretary of State fully endorsed that decision. I carefully considered the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) report, the comments received from a wide range of interested parties in Northern Ireland and the views expressed by MLAs and MPs from the political parties. I concluded that simple and complete deregulation, as set out in the OFT report, is not a realistic option and is not, therefore, the way forward for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30508w31.html_para7">I indicated that I planned to continue to develop Northern Ireland community pharmacy services within the context of the forthcoming Community Pharmacy Strategy. This will provide the opportunity to consider how pharmacy services, including health promotion and health protection policies, in the future can best respond to the interests and needs of patients and consumers in Northern Ireland, particularly in terms of quality and best value. I also intend to negotiate a new contract for community pharmacies. The main thrust of these negotiations will be the implementation of the new Strategy, but I will also consider how the existing regulatory arrangements can be improved to take account of changing health policies.
<P>

<a name="30508w31.html_para8">While I did not personally meet with representatives of the pharmaceutical profession here in regard to this matter, they provided very detailed submissions on the report which I took fully into account in reaching my decision. I have not had the opportunity to formally discuss this matter with the Secretary of State for Scotland, but the Department's officials have been working closely with their counterparts in Scotland, as well as with those in England and Wales, in the evaluation of the content of the OFT report.

 The Police Ombudsman has no power to suspend police officers. However where, during the course of an investigation, there are indications that the conduct of a police officer did not meet the appropriate standard, the Ombudsman is required to immediately notify the appropriate authority, and provide all relevant material, to enable that authority to consider suspension. In the case of a non-senior officer (up to Chief Superintendent) that authority is the Chief Constable and in the case of a senior officer the authority is the Northern Ireland Policing Board. The Chief Constable advises that since the appointment of the Police Ombudsman on 6 November 2000 a total of 15 police officers have been suspended, following such notifications, pending investigation by the Ombudsman's office.
