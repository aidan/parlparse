<a name="00706w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ruffley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when men aged between 60 and 64 years in the Bury St. Edmunds constituency will receive their Winter Fuel Allowance; and if he will make a statement on the reason for the delays.  [129021]<P>

 Retrospective payments for previous years Winter Fuel Payments started to be paid in the week commencing 26 June 2000 in line with Government's targets. The payments will be issued as claims are processed and are not defined in postcode areas. Some customers in Bury St. Edmunds may have already received their payment and the remainder will receive them over the coming months as claims are received and processed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to modify the benefit arrangements for claimants who have criminal convictions which will appear on criminal conviction certificates and other certificates issued under the Police Act 1997; what assessment he has made of the extent to which details displayed on certificates may result in claimants being unable to find suitable work easily; what plans he has to increase payments to claimants who are obliged to certificate on a regular basis; and if he will make a statement.  [129138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w01.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have no plans to modify the benefit arrangements for claimants who have criminal convictions which will appear on criminal conviction certificates and other certificates issued under the Police Act 1997.
<P>

<a name="00706w01.html_para0">The Home Office will be working closely with relevant organisations to ensure that guidance is provided to encourage employers not to reject applicants with a criminal record without careful consideration of all the relevant factors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Alan Williams: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list the PFI contracts entered into by his Department, indicating <i>(a)</i> their dates of commencement, <i>(b)</i> their value, <i>(c)</i> if they have been subject to refinancing and <i>(d)</i> if his Department has a claw-back entitlement to share in savings arising from refinancing.  [129057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The PRIME (Private Sector Resource Initiative for Management of the Estate) contract, commenced on 1 April 1998. It has an estimated private 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jul 2000 : Column: 240W</I><P>
sector capital spend value of &#163;350 million. It has not been subject to refinancing and has no specific refinancing share mechanism, but does provide for possible sharing of windfall gains and profits, including benefits from refinancing, made in the first five years.
<P>

<a name="00706w01.html_para1">The ACCORD (Access to Corporate Data) project has so far progressed to signature of four Services Agreements, which are contractual vehicles to enable the Department to award specific PFI/PPP contracts in future. None of the Service Agreements contains a monetary value, but the projects estimated private sector capital spend value is &#163;100 million. No contracts yet exist, and contract negotiations will include possibilities for sharing in future savings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, in respect of implementation of the Burns report on banning hunting with hounds, what estimate he has made of the total additional social security payments which will fall to be paid, broken down by type of benefit.  [129038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Burns Report (The Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and Wales) investigated the effects of banning hunting on employment. Its finding was that, in view of all the uncertainties, it is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of jobs that would be lost if hunting were banned. Consequently, it is not possible to estimate accurately the effects on Social Security expenditure.

Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) of 26 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 348-49W, on pensions, if he will re-present the figures assuming <i>(a)</i> the state second pension remains earnings related and <i>(b)</i> the minimum earnings guarantee is available to those who made no second pension provision and the Minimum Income Guarantee is uprated in line with earnings; if he will set out the assumptions about investment returns which underly his estimates of returns on stakeholder pensions; what assumption he has made about the level of contributions to stakeholder pensions; and if he will estimate the effects of these projections based on 75 per cent. of average earnings.

3. The estimates are based on a person beginning work at 16 and working for 49 years until age 65.<P>

4. The estimates are based on the Department's Lifepen model and the following assumptions:<P>

Stakeholder pensions start April 2001<P>

<a name="00706w01.html_para3">Projections for stakeholder pensions are based on National Insurance rebates only. They are estimated weekly amounts a person would receive if the investment return and other relevant factors affecting the amount of the stakeholder pension were the same as the assumptions underlying the calculation of the National Insurance rebates paid into a stakeholder pension. No allowance is made for voluntary contributions made by individuals or their employers.
<P>

<a name="00706w01.html_para4">The level of the rebates will be determined by the Secretary of State based on the advice of the Government Actuary. The assumptions which underlie the rebate, including investment return, will be the subject of a consultation exercise by the Government Actuary this summer, culminating in an Order to be laid before Parliament no later than April 2001. The Order will set the rebate rates for the period April 2002 to March 2007.

The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated.

 As all sub-post offices are privately owned and operated, there can be many different reasons leading to a decision to close and there is no accurate way of forecasting future closure levels.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2000]:</i> Small and medium-sized firms stand well placed to benefit from a number of the features of the climate change levy package, notably the reduction in employers' National Insurance Contributions, the enhanced capital allowances for energy savings investments and the &#163;50 million 'energy efficiency' fund. In particular, one of the specific aims of the &#163;50 million 'energy efficiency' fund is to provide energy efficiency advice/audits to small and medium sized firms. Furthermore, firms that are very small consumers of energy--as set out in Schedule 6 of the Finance Bill--will be covered by the exemption for the domestic sector, and will therefore not be subject to the climate change levy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government have developed the aggregates levy in an open and consultative way. HM Customs and Excise issued a consultation document in June 1998, which invited views from industry and other parties with a potential interest on the practical issues that would arise from a levy on aggregates. Draft legislation for the levy was then published for consultation on 30 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="00706w05.html_para0">During this process, the Government have received a number of representations from Scottish business, and these have been taken account of in the design of the levy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Ray Michie: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact of the proposed aggregates tax on Scottish industry; and if he will make statement.  [129040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The aggregates levy will bring about environmental benefits by making the price of aggregates better reflect their true environmental costs. This will provide an incentive for all business to use more recycled aggregates and to use all aggregates more efficiently.
<P>

<a name="00706w05.html_para1">All of the revenues raised will be recycled back through a cut in employer NICs and a new "Sustainability Fund" aimed at delivering local environmental benefits. It is not possible to say precisely what the effect will be on Scottish industry, since this will depend, among other things, on the degree to which firms switch to recycled materials.

<P>

<a name="00706w05.html_para3">English Nature is also an assessor on the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) and was party to the ACRE meeting on 25 May where members discussed this matter in full and further endorsed their recent advice.

<P>
<P><I>6 Jul 2000 : Column: 257W</I><P>
the Government have to introduce independent and comprehensive testing of incinerator emissions and ash.  [126471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> Incinerator emissions are already tightly regulated. Under the provisions of Part I the Environmental Protection Act 1990, regulators (for England and Wales, either the Environment Agency for larger plant and all hazardous waste incinerators, or local authorities for other plant) must include in an incineration plant's permit conditions to deliver BAT/BATNEEC (Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost). Guidance is published on what constitutes BATNEEC. The regulators have powers to require independent emissions testing where they consider it warranted.
<P>

<a name="00706w05.html_para4">Data on levels of dioxins in ash sent for disposal are not routinely held by the Agency or my Department. The operators of incineration plant are required by section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to provide sufficient information to those managing waste ash to ensure that it is disposed of appropriately, for example chemical and physical information. They are also required to ensure that ashes which contain hazardous substances above certain thresholds are disposed of in accordance with the Special Waste Regulations 1996 (as amended). Environment Agency powers enable it to monitor the operation of these controls. We have no plans at present to introduce further requirements for testing ash sent for disposal.
<P>

<a name="00706w05.html_para5">The Environment Agency requires that site-specific authorisation be sought for the use of ash in unbound construction applications and for ashes which have not been 'characterised' on the basis of various chemical properties. Where used in a construction application the processed ashes will normally be required to meet relevant technical specifications. We understand that the industry is working towards a quality control procedure to ensure that the ash consistently meets the 'fit for purpose' criteria required by these technical specifications. DETR, the Environment Agency and industry representative organisations are also developing a policy protocol for the use of Incineration Bottom Ash (IBA) in construction applications. A draft is currently under review. It will also require the 'characterisation' of ash for various chemical properties which, according to best practice, would be carried out in accordance with a robust quality control procedure.
<P>

<a name="00706w05.html_para6">The proposed waste incineration Directive (Common Position (EC) No 7/2000), which the Government have welcomed and which is now in the last stages of negotiations, will apply to virtually all types of incineration and co-incineration plant. It sets stringent standards for emissions to air and water, places controls on solid residues, and includes monitoring requirements for air and water emissions. Article 9 of the proposal also says:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"Prior to determining the routes for the disposal or recycling of the residues from incineration and co-incineration plants, appropriate tests shall be carried out to establish the physical and chemical characteristics and the polluting potential of the different incineration residues."
Similar wording is already included in Article 9(4) of the hazardous waste incineration Directive (94/67/EC). Subject to the remaining stages of negotiations, the proposed Directive is likely to apply to new plant from Autumn 2002 and to existing plant from Autumn 2005.

 My Department is aware of the difficulties being experienced by bus operators in recruiting and retaining bus drivers in some areas. The bus industry has drawn our attention to this issue, which has also been a matter considered as part of the Department's research on trends in the industry.
<P>

<a name="00706w06.html_para0">The responsibility for ensuring that they have sufficient drivers is primarily a matter for individual bus companies. However, my Department and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency are pursuing with the industry what steps can be taken to assist with the current problems.

 As the then Minister for Transport announced on 11 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 360-61W, the South East and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study will examine a wide range of options and has started from the position that nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out.
<P>

<a name="00706w06.html_para2">Options will be appraised through a process of successive sifts. A very large number of options will be considered during the sifting process, which is designed to reduce the options to a manageable number, so that those can be appraised in sufficient detail to support a meaningful public consultation at the end of the study.
<P>

<a name="00706w06.html_para3">Until then, it would be premature to comment on the scope or status of any option.

 The Housing Green Paper issued in April sets out a range of proposals for tackling housing problems, including our commitment to ensure that all social housing is of a decent standard within 10 years. The Department's Public Service Agreement (PSA) target on the council house repairs backlog agreed in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review is to deliver a reduction of 10 per cent. in the backlog by April 2002. Any further targets will be announced following the current spending review.

[129065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The table shows <i>(a)</i> the transfer rents of existing tenants and <i>(b)</i> the relet rents of new tenants for local authorities who have places on the 2000-01 housing stock transfer programme. These rents are guaranteed to rise by not more than RPI plus 1 per cent. for five years after transfer under the new landlord. We would expect rent increases to be kept below this level wherever possible. We have also set out in the Housing Green Paper, our proposals for achieving rent harmonisation over the next 10 years.

<P>
<a name="00706w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 While the Government have from time to time commissioned studies of the extent and nature of housing need to inform their views on the requirement for affordable housing in England, they believe that neither national nor regional estimates can adequately reflect the wide diversity of needs and priorities which exist at the local level. For these reasons, the Government believe that local authorities are best placed to carry out robust assessments of housing need in their areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The thresholds were in fact reduced by Circular 6/98.

We have no plans at present to revise the guidance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Sites are not classified in the manner suggested. The potential impact of contamination on any development will depend significantly on the nature and design of the specific development.

<a name="00706w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The current legislation authorising the collection of tolls at the Dartford river crossings is forecast to expire in June 2002. The cessation of tolling would be likely to have the effect of significantly increasing demand on the eastern sector of the M25 which would further

 Following reports in the French press last week that the French authorities had discovered low levels of GM presence in conventional maize seed imported into France, we contacted the French authorities, who confirmed on 30 June that they had indeed found some GM seed in conventional maize seed, which has been sown in South West France. Further information now indicates that they have found three different modifications in a number of varieties of forage maize imported into France by the company Golden Harvest. The French authorities have not yet confirmed which varieties of maize seed are involved, but have confirmed that sweetcorn varieties are not affected by their current investigations. We are seeking further information from them on the varieties concerned. However, as the varieties concerned are cultivated in Southern France, it is possible that they would be unsuitable for cultivation in UK conditions.
<P>

<a name="00706w07.html_para2">The GMs found in maize samples by the French authorities are BT 176 and BT 11, and one further, as yet unidentified, modification. BT 176 is insect resistant and has Part C consent within the EU under Directive 90/220 for import, food and feed use, and for cultivation. BT 11 is insect resistant and has Part C consent for import and use in animal feed.

<a name="00706w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Air Branch of the RNR has 13 trained Sea Harrier pilots. All of them are former regular RN Sea Harrier pilots.
<P>

<a name="00706w08.html_para2">Their RNR function is to maintain a close familiarity with current military fast jet operations so that, in the event of call-out, it would take a minimum period of training to bring them up to operational standard and permit them to be deployed alongside, or in support of, their RN counterparts.

<a name="00706w08.html_para3">The minimum annual training requirement which these pilots are required to achieve is 17 Operational Role Training days. In the period April 1999 to March 2000 they averaged 25 training days. The training is designed to maintain otherwise perishable skills. The cost of 25 days' training, in current individual pilot salary terms, is &#163;2,778.

Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, met Said Musa, the Prime Minister of Belize, during his recent visit to the United Kingdom. During our meeting we discussed the strong defence relationship between our two countries, and current levels of military assistance funding provided by the UK to Belize. Her Majesty's Government are giving further consideration to representations from Mr. Musa on this subject. I also took the opportunity to express our thanks to Mr. Musa for his country's continuing support for the British Army jungle training unit in Belize, BATSUB.

 The Personal Job Account is a radical and practical way of helping long-term unemployed people into work. Existing funds have been drawn together to make up the Personal Job Account, namely funds for Employment Service Support, training and benefits payments. There is no upper or lower limit to the amount allocated; it is dependent upon the needs of that participant and their most effective route back into work.

In the first two months since the national launch of New Deal 50 Plus, over 4,000 older people have returned to work and drawn on the Employment Credit. We are evaluating the impact of these initiatives. Overall, employment levels of older people rose by 2.4 per cent. and unemployment fell by 13.3 per cent. since last year.

 After rising for the previous 10 years, the size of the average class in primary schools has fallen from 27.7 in January 1998 to 27.1 in January 2000.

<a name="00706w09.html_para1">We are well on course to deliver our pledge to limit infant classes to 30 pupils. We have since January 1998 already reduced the number of children in infant classes of over 30 pupils by 300,000. &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge, and allocations so far to Sheffield LEA amount to some &#163;2.8 million. This has helped to reduce the size of the average Key Stage 1 class in Sheffield, Hillsborough to 25.6. The figure in January 1998 was 27.2. The number of children in infant classes of 31 or more pupils in the constituency has fallen from 1,250 in January 1998, to 230 in January 2000.

 Departmental officials approved in June the first Rapid Response Fund bid within the Yorkshire and the Humber Region. Up to &#163;236,177 will support the 300 workers being made redundant from RHP Bearings, Ferrybridge, Wakefield. Officials also expect to receive a bid to support those being made redundant from Corus, Rotherham (formerly British Steel). There is also a strong possibility of a bid being received for British Aerospace, Brough, Humberside.

 My right hon. Friend has regular discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister about these issues as part of the current review of local authority grant distribution. As you might expect, the future of education funding is an important part of the review, since education accounts for around 40 per cent. of local authority revenue expenditure. We expect to publish a Green Paper later this summer, which will set out a range of options for debate.

Parents may also choose to send their children to a school other than the city academy.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> At the moment, all local education authority (LEA) support services for children with special educational needs (SEN) receive "SPECTRUM" a monthly update of new DfEE publications from which support services can place orders for documentation. Each month all the publications DfEE has sent automatically to schools are posted on the EASEA website, where there is also a searchable archive of documents from past months. School and LEA staff can register with the service at www.easea.co.uk to receive a regular e-mail alert when new information fitting their personal profile of interest, is on-line. Work is in hand to automatically provide LEA support services for children with SEN with the monthly batch mailing to schools from September. Funding for the National Grid for Learning is made available to LEAs through the Standards Fund. A total of &#163;205 million has been made available for 2000-01 of which &#163;155 million has been provided specifically to allow LEAs to continue to equip schools in line with their ICT development plans. As such it is not available to LEA support services. Additionally, under the Standards Fund for 2000-01, &#163;26 million is being provided to support in-service training in special educational needs. LEA support services are eligible for this funding.

The Medicines Control Agency continuously monitors the safety of all medicines including Meningitis C vaccine.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2000]:</i> Cancer services in Merseyside and Cheshire are being developed as a network of cancer units linked to the Oncology Centre at Clatterbridge Hospital on the Wirral. This is in line with the Calman-Hine report on cancer services and the emerging recommendations of the National Cancer Director, Professor Mike Richards.
<P>

<a name="00706w13.html_para2">Merseyside and Cheshire have received &#163;3.5 million from the New Opportunities Fund to invest in cancer services. In addition to this, local health authorities have received identifiable shares of the &#163;9 million national gynaecological cancer moneys and, within their general allocations, a pro-rata share of &#163;30 million made available nationally to improve access to cancer services.

<P>
<a name="00706w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have already made good progress towards improving access to dental services in Yeovil, Somerset. Investing in dentistry grants amounting to nearly &#163;200,000 have been paid to dentists in the Somerset Health Authority area in return for promises of up to 17,000 new National Health Service registrations. The NHS Executive is also working with Somerset Health Authority and East Somerset NHS Trust on plans for a dental access centre. The centre would be based on a network of clinic sites, including one in Yeovil. Access centres provide a full range of NHS dental treatment, routine and urgent, to people who are not registered with a dentist.

<a name="00706w13.html_para3">The NHS Executive wrote on 16 May to all health authority chief executives and regional dental advisers asking them to tell us whether more needs to be done to improve NHS dentistry in their locality and inviting ideas for potential funding.

 The UK is in regular contact with all those with an interest in the Cyprus settlement process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 As part of the Government's Step Change initiative, all Departments have taken steps to increase contacts with EU member states and the applicants. It is impossible to quantify the precise number of initiatives and visits which have arisen from the process. Ministers and officials with an interest in EU business across all Departments have participated in the initiative.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Step Change initiative is designed to build on and extend Government-to-Government links. As such, it involves Ministers and officials in increasing contacts with EU member states and applicant countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w14.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 It is not possible to quantify the costs arising solely from the Step Change initiative since it is an integral part of the Government's European policy, which builds on and extends existing contacts.

<P>
<P>

 The Government have recently approved the export of demining equipment for operations in Armenia. These will be used by the HALO Trust during humanitarian landmine clearance operations. This licence was granted for humanitarian purposes. It also reflects the determination of the Government to eliminate the scourge of landmines.
<P>

<a name="00706w15.html_para0">The UK remains committed to the OSCE arms embargo against both Azerbaijan and Armenia, which the UK interprets as covering all goods and technology in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (commonly known as the military list).

<a name="00706w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many fraud cases were investigated in each police authority area in <i>(a)</i> 1979, <i>(b)</i> 1983, <i>(c)</i> 1987, <i>(d)</i> 1992 and <i>(e)</i> each year since 1995; what was the clear-up rate in each year; and what estimate he has made of the value of such fraud in each year since 1995.  [129129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Fraud offences comprise part of the offence group covering both fraud and forgery. The number of fraud and forgery offences recorded in the years requested in each police force, and the clear-up rate, are given in the tables.
<P>

<a name="00706w18.html_para0">The counting rules for recorded crime changed from 1 April 1998. The effect on the number of fraud and forgery offences recorded was substantial, resulting in an estimated increase of 61 per cent. due to counting rules changes in England and Wales as a whole.
<P>

<a name="00706w18.html_para1">The Economic Cost of Fraud, a report for the Home Office and the Serious Fraud Office, will be published by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) on Tuesday 11 July. The report will provide estimates of expenditure on investigations, court proceedings and preventative measures, and the amounts of money defrauded across all sectors of the economy, for the years 1997 and 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases of credit card fraud there have been in each year since 1995; what the clean up rate was in each year; and if he will make a statement on the outcome of his recent meeting with credit card systems and providers.  [129128]

 A separate recorded crime figure for cheque and credit card fraud has been collected since 1 April 1998. The number of offences in the year ending March 1999 was 141,948, with the clear-up rate for these offences being 31 per cent.

<a name="00706w18.html_para3">On 27 June, I chaired a constructive and positive meeting with cheque and credit card systems providers, retailers and law enforcement agencies. The discussion was wide- ranging: information-sharing, cross-border co-operation, the European and international dimension to fraud, the role of law enforcement agencies, hotspots, education and training were all given serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="00706w18.html_para4">It was agreed that, in addition to the work already being taken forward by the banking and retail industries on the development of new technologies, the Home Office would lead work on information sharing and the involvement of the relevant law enforcement agencies, with a particular remit to consider how to target and tackle hotspots. The group will reconvene in autumn to review progress.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to extend the use of restorative justice approaches for <i>(a)</i> young offenders and <i>(b)</i> adult offenders; and if he will make a statement.  [128541]<P>

<P>
<a name="00706w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 For young offenders the final warning scheme, reparation order and action plan order under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, were implemented across England and Wales on 1 June 2000; and the referral order under the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 is being piloted in seven areas from summer 2000 ahead of national implementation. These measures reflect the restorative justice principles of responsibility, reparation and reintegration in tackling offending and requiring offenders to make amends for their actions. The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales is funding and evaluating a number of local schemes in support of these measures. For adult offenders, community service orders provide the opportunity for offenders to undertake work for the benefit of the community. In addition, a review of best practice, focused on restorative justice schemes for adult offenders, is being undertaken under the Government's crime reduction programme, on the basis of which further schemes may be funded and evaluated.

 There are currently two pilots using voice verification technology being undertaken in England and Wales; the first is a pilot using VoiceTrack technology (which is licensed to Group 4 in the United Kingdom) and after an initial six month pilot in the Kent Probation Service region, they have been extended to cover the North Wales area. The Youth Justice Board is also undertaking pilots using a voice verification system developed by Group 4 with Kent and Medway Youth Offending Teams. The Board is currently in discussions about extending the pilots but there are no firm plans at present to extend either of them. Both of these pilots will be evaluated by the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate. No decision about whether to extend the pilots will be made until after they have been evaluated.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to reimburse local authorities for their expenditure on the Kosovan Humanitarian Evacuation programme during the current financial year.  [129759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00706w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The arrangements for reimbursement are set out in Special Grant Report Number 68, which I have laid before Parliament today. The Report explains the areas of expenditure that will be eligible for the grant and invites local authorities to submit interim claims by 30 September. This will ensure the prompt repayment of the bulk of the expenditure incurred by local authorities during 2000-01.
