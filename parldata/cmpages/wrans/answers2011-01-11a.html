 It is the aim of the proposals on the modernisation of the coastguard that local geographical knowledge will be retained and improved principally in the new management structure of the coastguard rescue service. The coastguard rescue teams will continue to be the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's (MCA) dynamic link to local coastal communities. The existing centres, which manage many hundreds of miles of coastline, already are increasing use of technology such as global mapping and information services as well as satellite imagery. In the proposed modernised coastguard service the MCA would maximise and standardise such innovation, provide a 24/7 provision from within coastal communities and provide appropriate training. The MCA will also maintain its current strong working relationships with partner search and rescue organisations such as the RNLI, in which considerable local knowledge and expertise reside.</p>

 The UK can already share the proceeds of transnational financial crime with other countries without the need for further legislation. Asset sharing and repatriation following confiscation can be made administratively on a case by case basis guided, where relevant, by provision in international agreement. Article 14 of the UN convention against transnational organized crime and article 57 of the UN convention against corruption provide that confiscated money can be paid to other countries as compensation or restitution to the victims of such crimes. Where necessary, prosecutors and the courts can also explore alternative methods of transferring money if confiscation following conviction is not an option in any individual case.</p>

 The United Kingdom relies on a well defined, independently regulated, competitive market to deliver the necessary energy infrastructure and competitive sources of energy. Market participants, rather than Government, are best placed to assess the complex range of factors affecting the profitability of storing and providing gas; and how these might evolve over time.</p>

The market has been working effectively to deliver sufficient supplies of gas to meet the country's needs. It has responded well, bringing forward sufficient supplies even in response to near record levels of demand during the cold spells earlier this winter. However, the Government are not complacent, and are seeking to refine the market framework through the measures contained in the Energy Bill 2010-11. A provision in the Bill will further improve gas security of supply by giving Ofgem a new power to amend the gas market's Uniform Network Code to sharpen commercial incentives on gas market participants to meet their contractual supply obligations and reduce the duration, likelihood or severity of a gas supply emergency. This will help underpin commercial demand for additional gas supply infrastructure such as storage and import facilities, as well as long-term contracts. Ofgem is now launching a "Significant Code Review" exercise to enhance gas market arrangements and believes that there is a reasonable prospect that the new power would enable it to implement these by the end of 2011.</p>

Tables 6-10 show figures for sentences given for indictable offences to offenders with 16 or more previous convictions or cautions, who received an immediate custodial sentence, by category of offence and ethnicity. These figures are derived from table 6.2 of "Sentencing Statistics: England and Wales 2009" which was published on 21 October 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="110111w0002.htm_para0"><a name="11011168000209">The figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the police national computer (PNC), which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. The figures are provisional and subject to change as more information is recorded by the police. The ethnicity information recorded on the PNC reflects the police officer's view of the offender's ethnicity.</p>

 The Social Impact Bond pilot scheme has generated significant new resource to rehabilitate offenders, through social investors paying upfront for intensive services and mentoring to reduce reconvictions in 3,000 short-sentence (less than 12 months) prisoners released from HMP Peterborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="110111w0003.htm_para1"><a name="11011168001865">The Government will pay only on the results the scheme delivers.

This approach will minimise the possibility that those in the scheme will be particularly sensitive to external factors such as prevailing economic conditions or changes in Government policy.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 December 2010]:</i> The Department has not made an estimate of the total amount of money which could be saved by phasing out the requirement for Sure Start Children's Centres to offer full day care in deprived areas. Early education and care services in children's centres are intended to be self-sustaining from parental fees, Government funding for free nursery education for two, three and four-year-olds, and other local authority sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="110111w0003.htm_para20"><a name="11011179000067">In the past, children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas were required to provide full day care, i.e. 10 hours a day, five hours a week, for 48 weeks a year. However, the National Audit Office Memorandum for the Children's Schools and Families Committee, December 2009, suggested that in some areas, when demand for full day care is low, money intended for other Sure Start services-like family support and outreach to vulnerable families-is subsidising the provision of early education and care. By removing the requirement for children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas to provide full day care where there is no demand, we are enabling local authorities and children's centres to use their money more flexibly to intervene early and reach the most vulnerable families more effectively.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 December 2010]:</i> The Government announced changes to employee pension contribution rates for public servants, including local government workers, at the spending review based on the rationale set out in the interim report of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission led by Lord Hutton of Furness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"><a name="110111w0003.htm_para37"><a name="11011179000184">The report shows that public service pensions have become more valuable, for example the value of a public service pension in 2003-04 is expected to be around a third higher than it would have been if life expectancy assumptions were the same as in 1955. The significant majority of the cost of these increases in value has fallen to local and national taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="110111w0003.htm_para38"><a name="11011179000185">The report goes on to say that there is a clear rationale for increasing member contributions to ensure a fairer distribution of costs between taxpayers and members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="110111w0003.htm_para39"><a name="11011179000186">While this policy will contribute to the sustainability of the LGPS it does not directly affect the long-term funding of the LGPS, which is dependent on the level of total contributions that is determined at triennial valuations. Factors such as those you have listed would be considered at these valuations.</p>

The children who died had complex conditions and were at a high risk for surgery.
