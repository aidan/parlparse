<a name="40309w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what brief the architects commissioned to produce designs for 21st century schools, as part of the Building Schools for the Future programme, were given with regard to sports and physical activity.  [159864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The exemplar designs allowed for a variety of sites and school sizes for 4 to 11 primary schools, 11 to 18 secondary schools and 4 to 18 all-through school.
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para0">The design briefs for the exemplar designs included:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>minimum indoor sports provision of a four-court sports hall, a main hall and an activity studio for secondary pupils;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>minimum outdoor facilities (even in the most constrained sites) of a hard surfaced multi-use games area, as well as pitches for summer and winter games and an all weather pitch where the site demanded it.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para1">Sports halls and multi-use games area were required to conform to the minimum dimensions and specifications required by Sports England for community use. All this provision and its ancillary accommodation was to be located appropriately to be available to the community outside the school day.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what consultations have been made with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport regarding the Building Schools for the Future programme to ensure that schools have the capacity to increase sporting activity.  [159865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 There have been a number of positive discussions both at official and ministerial level, about how we can ensure synergy of our capital resources in order to maximise them and to deliver the national strategy to improve schools' PE and Sports facilities. Our aim is that following BSF investment all secondary schools will have sports facilities suitable for wider community use.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what share of the &#163;5.1 billion capital investment for Building Schools for the Future is allocated for sports and physical activity resources.  [159868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 This Government gives great priority to the physical and recreational needs of our children as well as their academic needs.

<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para2">Central Government capital funding for school buildings in 2005&#150;06 is over &#163;5.1 billion, including over &#163;2 billion allocated to the first wave of Building Schools for the Future (BSF). BSF aims to transform secondary schools so that they are fit for the teaching and learning needs of the 21st century, including for sports and physical activity. Decisions on investment will be made locally by the authorities which have been allocated funding as they develop their projects, in line with their priorities which will reflect local need and government policies. In time, all secondary schools in England will benefit from BSF.
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para3">The balance of capital funding, of about &#163;3 billion in 2005&#150;06, is mainly allocated to schools and authorities by formula, so that they can make investment decisions locally, in line with the priorities of their asset management plan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_wqn3"><B> James Purnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, which schools which have benefited from the Building Schools for the Future programme open up their sports facilities to the wider community out-of-hours.  [159871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Building Schools for the Future programme aims to transform secondary provision over a 10&#150;15 year period starting in 2005&#150;06, subject to future spending decisions. Therefore no schools have yet benefited from the programme. Local authorities to be included in the first wave of projects were announced on 12&nbsp;February. Over the coming months they will be developing their plans in association with their schools and other local partners. Our aim is that following BSF investment all secondary schools will have sports facilities suitable for wider community use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_wqn4"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the total expenditure on communications for the Department has been in 2003&#150;04, broken down by expenditure on <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Government Information and Communication Service staff and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other staff, broken down by (i) press officers, (ii) special advisers and (iii) others.  [158157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The DFES estimates that Strategy and Communications Directorate will, in 2003&#150;04, expend around &#163;4.9&nbsp;million of its administrative budget on communications staff. &#163;2&nbsp;million of that will be on Government Information and Communication Service (GICs) staff. Press officers will make up approximately &#163;0.7&nbsp;million of the GICS cost. There are no press officer costs outside of this.
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para4">Additionally, policy directorates plan to spend &#163;3.5&nbsp;million on their communications staff in 2003&#150;04. It would be of disproportionate cost to identify any further GICs costs within this.
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para5">The Special Advisers' Code of Conduct sets out the sort of work a special adviser may undertake on behalf of their Minister. This includes communications activity. Details of the costs of special advisers are given on an annual basis. Information for the financial year 2003&#150;04 will be published in due course.

[158160]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The DFES Strategy and Communications Directorate (SCD) currently employ 159 staff on communication activities, 54 are members of the Government Information and Communication service (GICs), of whom 23 are press officers. There are no non-GICs press officers. In addition, policy directorates employ a further 121 'other' staff on communications activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of how much <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;schools, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;colleges and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;universities spent on recruitment advertising in each year since 1997.  [159846]<P>
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has made no such estimates.

<a name="40309w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what recent estimate he has made of whether the number of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;permanent and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;fixed term pupil exclusions related to possession or use of cannabis has been affected by the reclassification of cannabis.  [159995]<P>
<P>
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Advice on the requirements for accommodation in secondary schools, including sports provision, will be available on the web from 1&nbsp;April 2004 in Building Bulletin 98: Briefing Framework for Secondary School Projects. This will supersede the current Area Guidelines for Schools and enhance the current area recommendations.
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para7">The guidance sets out minimum recommended provision and also allows sufficient overall area to allow for further facilities, both indoor and outdoor, appropriate to the priorities of individual schools. Hence:
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para8"><i></i><i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the ideal provision will depend on the priorities of the school and its extended role in providing facilities for the wider community. For instance, while all schools would be able to offer community use outside school hours, sports colleges and other schools could provide facilities more appropriate to the regional demands of specific sports.
<P>

<a name="40309w01.html_para9"><i></i><i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the minimum provision recommended for new secondary schools, in line with current guidance, is a minimum indoor sports provision of a four-court sports hall, to Sport England minimum specifications and other large spaces (including the main hall and activity studios) that would be used for Physical Education and should be appropriate and sufficient to ensure that examinations and assemblies need not take place in the sports hall. Minimum recommended outdoor facilities include pitches for summer and winter games and a hard surfaced multi-use games area, again to Sport England minimum specifications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether he was consulted prior to the Government's announcement of support for proposals to change the school year; what assessment he has made of the overall impact on the economy of these proposals; and what assessment he has made of the impact on specific sectors of the economy, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;tourism and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;transport.  [159874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Proposals for a standard six-term school year have been developed by an independent commission on the school year which was established by the Local Government Association. The Commission included representation from the tourism industry. My right hon. Friend sees merit in the argument in favour of standardising the length of school terms. Decisions on school term dates and holidays however continue to be the responsibility of individual local education authorities or school governing bodies, depending on the category of school.

<a name="40309w02.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Specialist Schools</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;specialist schools and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;non-specialist schools are designated under section 100 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998; and how many and what percentage of pupils they have selected in each of the last six years.  [155621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Schools' admission arrangements are determined locally without central consultation or approval. The DfES therefore cannot provide figures on 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2004 : Column 1385W</I><P>
the number of schools which fall into this category (i.e. whose selective admission arrangements pre-dated the 1998 Act).
<P>

<a name="40309w02.html_para0">The evidence suggests that just under 6&nbsp;per cent. of the 685 schools that had specialist status in September 2001 used aptitude as part of their admission arrangements. The following table shows the latest collated information relating to partial selection by specialist schools. Most of these schools were selecting by aptitude 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2004 : Column 1386W</I><P>
prior to the 1998 Act, with some selecting more than 10&nbsp;per cent. of their pupils. The next time specialist schools will be asked to provide aptitude selection data will be this autumn.
<P>

<a name="40309w02.html_para1">The admissions framework for specialist schools is the same as for all other maintained schools. Applicants must be considered against the school's published admission arrangements, including, where applicable, selection.

 In February 2003, DCMS published Framework for the Future, the first-ever national public libraries strategy. "Framework" reflects a 10 year vision to improve public libraries, affirming that reading and learning are at the heart of libraries' modern mission. "Framework" identified many good practice examples in libraries and proposed a strategy to build on this excellence to improve services delivered by all libraries in England. DCMS and Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) are taking the strategy forward through a three-year action plan, which is on the MLA website: www.mla.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="40309w03.html_para0">Considerable work has been done in this area. Examples of some of the specific schemes to promote reading include: Bookstart, which DCMS has funded with &#163;500,000, over the last two financial years, which provides reading books and a libraries card for babies; a Quality Index fiction tool, that is being developed in conjunction with the Audit Commission and Arts Council England to help authorities identify the quality of their stock and a joint DCMS/Wolfson Foundation Fund to which DCMS has contributed &#163;4&nbsp;million, over two years, for reader development projects. Arts Council England also support a number of reader development programmes through public libraries.
<P>

<a name="40309w03.html_para1">Very nearly all of England's over 3,000 libraries have been connected to the internet through the &#163;100&nbsp;million lottery funded People's Network programme. The early indications are that the People's Network has increased the number and types of people that use our public libraries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many school sports grounds have been sold in each London borough since 1997.  [159169]<P>

<a name="40309w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40309w03.html_para2">There are no figures available until October 1998 when we introduced new legislation to stop the indiscriminate sell off of school playing fields. Before October 1998, there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. Local authorities and schools now must obtain the written consent of the Secretary of State before disposing, or changing the use, of school playing fields. Applications to sell school playing fields are approved only where it is clear that any proceeds will be used to improve school sports provision or education facilities.
<P>

<a name="40309w03.html_para3">The following table shows the number of approved applications from London boroughs to sell areas of school playing field capable of forming at least a small sports pitch.

 DFID gives the issue of staff safety in Nepal the highest priority. In 2002 we established a Risk Management Office (RMO) to provide risk assessment and crisis management expertise, as well as to provide training, support and advice to all staff associated with our programmes and projects. Since then the RMO has delivered training to over 300 field staff to help them to continue to work in remote and conflict affected parts of the country. The RMO undertakes risk assessments on a regular basis, the results of which are fed back to field managers. Field staff have also received assurances that DFID will support their decisions at any time to withdraw from an area because of concerns about their personal safety.

 The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that the North Korean food output falls short of need by 944,000 tonnes, but due to the environment of secrecy and restrictions on agencies operating there, it is difficult to be certain of figures regarding the situation in North Korea. It is the case that around a quarter of the population of 22&nbsp;million require food aid to meet the recommended daily calorie intake. This leaves many recipients, particularly children, the elderly and the sick, vulnerable to breaks in the supply of assistance.

 The depleted uranium (DU) information card F MED 1018 was introduced on 26&nbsp;March 2003. It is issued as a standard administrative procedure to those returning from Operation Telic in Iraq to confirm that they have been deployed in a theatre where DU munitions have been used and to remind them of their eligibility for a voluntary biological monitoring test to measure uranium in the urine. It is therefore not a warning card, but is intended to inform personnel about one of the tests available in line with the Ministry of Defence operational health policies.

 The evaluation of the 2-year pilot of the safety camera programme covering 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 concluded that in those participating areas there had been a 35&nbsp;per cent. reduction in those killed or seriously injured at camera sites. This equated to 280 fewer killed and seriously injured casualties. Information for 2002&#150;03 will be contained in the 3-year evaluation report which will be published shortly.

 The Government have supported a mandate for the European Commission to negotiate an open aviation area with the US on the basis that this will be an area where air carriers of both sides will be able to establish themselves and freely provide services according to commercial principles, competing on a fair and equal basis. The offer made by the US at the recent talks falls far short of this objective. We will continue to take every opportunity, including meetings of the Transport Council and our participation in the Special Committee of Member State representatives, to make the case for a fully liberalised EU/US aviation agreement, including the removal of restrictions in areas such as airline ownership, market access and aircraft leasing.

Wherever possible and practicable the exit of staff from the Department will be on a voluntary basis using redundancy and retirements to facilitate the process.

<a name="40309w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Legal aid is available for parties involved in contested proceedings involving children. In certain special cases under the Children Act 1989 funding is available free to people who have parental responsibility, without any means or merits tests. These cases are mostly to do with public authorities intervening in the relationship between parents (or those with parental responsibility) and children, such as care proceedings. All other grants of funding are subject to means and merits criteria. The means criteria are set out in the Community Legal Service Financial Regulations 2000 (as amended) and considered against the relevant merits criteria set out in the Funding Code determining income and capital thresholds above which legal aid is not available. The merits criteria are also set out in the 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2004 : Column 1418W</I><P>
Funding Code and aim to ensure that funding is only available in circumstances where a reasonable private paying client would be prepared to proceed.
<P>

<a name="40309w11.html_para6">Legal aid must also take into account the Legal Services Commission's (LSCs) published guidance which further encourages cost effective dispute resolution.

<P>

<a name="40309w11.html_para7">The LSC also funds family mediation services with a view to resolving cases amicably without contested proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Each application for legal aid is subject to the statutory tests of the applicant's means as set out in the Community Legal Service Financial Regulations 2000 (as amended) and considered against the relevant merits criteria set out in the Funding Code.
<P>

<a name="40309w11.html_para8">A funded client's liability for costs is limited to the amount, if any, which is reasonable for him to pay, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the means and conduct of both parties. The awarding of costs is a matter for the court, whether a party is publicly funded or not. Whether a cost order can be made is not taken into account in determining eligibility for legal aid.
<P>

<a name="40309w11.html_para9">Cost protection has always been a feature of the legal aid scheme; it provides that costs orders cannot be enforced against a funded client except to the extent that the court considers it reasonable. In limited circumstances a successful opponent may be entitled to costs from the Community Legal Service fund.

 The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has no buildings which currently require remedial work or removal of asbestos.

<a name="40309w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The company voluntary arrangement procedure was introduced in 1986 and allows a financially troubled company to reach a binding agreement with its creditors to pay them in full or in part over a period of time. However, the recession of the early 1990s showed it was not particularly effective for the small financially troubled company because there was no stay on creditors' actions in the period before an arrangement could be agreed. Therefore, in 2000, this Government introduced the option of a short stay on creditors' rights, into that procedure, to give the company's management a breathing space in which to put a rescue plan to creditors. Other technical amendments were also made to improve the procedure's efficiency and effectiveness.

 Under the Data Protection Act, companies who control data remain responsible for how data are processed overseas on their behalf. They remain bound by the requirements of the Act, in particular its requirement for data to be kept secure. The method of transfer must include measures to ensure the security of the processing and security against breaches of the Act. Companies must also be open with individuals about how information they collect on them is intended to be used.

 <i>[holding answer 8&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has no role in the appointment of the Chairman and/or Board of Elexon Ltd. The Elexon Chairman and Board are appointed in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC) in Section C4.1.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what progress has been made since the formal consultation about ground rents and the referral of rent to local rent officers under the proposed changes to housing benefit.  [157489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The first step in our reform of Housing Benefit has been the introduction from November 2003 of a flat rate Local Housing Allowance in the private rented sector in nine pathfinder local authorities; with flat rate allowances for same size properties in the same area. Early indications are that the shift away from making payments direct to landlords is going well.
<P>

<a name="40309w14.html_para5">In the pathfinders, Housing Benefit is no longer linked to individual rents, so there is no need for individual rents to be referred to the local rent officer. The local rent service will however continue to support the local authorities by calculating monthly Local Housing Allowance rates and setting the Broad Rental Market Areas.
<P>

<a name="40309w14.html_para6">We have also put a comprehensive evaluation strategy in place. This will include interviews with claimants, landlords, local authority staff and stakeholder organisations, as well as an analysis of administrative data.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate he has made of the number of landlords in pathfinder areas who have stopped taking on housing benefit tenants.  [158079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 We are making good progress in applying our ground-breaking Local Housing Allowance to tenants with mainstream tenancies in the private rented sector. All the nine pathfinder local authorities, who are taking this forward for us, have begun to implement the reforms. We have made an encouraging start: implementation has been smooth and early indications are that the shift away from making payments direct to landlords is going well. Initial concerns from landlords have now been addressed to a large extent and we are not aware of any landlords withdrawing from the market.
<P>

<a name="40309w14.html_para7">The reforms are intended to help landlords, as well as tenants, by creating a more transparent system that will be simpler for local authorities to administer, thereby speeding up overall processing times. Also, the safeguards we have built in regarding direct payment to landlords in particular circumstances are designed to protect the interests of both landlord and tenant.
<P>

<a name="40309w14.html_para8">It is too early to fully assess the response of tenants and landlords, but we have put a comprehensive evaluation strategy in place.

 The US administration has allocated $18.6 billion for the reconstruction process in Iraq. Because of the large number of different organisations involved and the fact that many are involved in partnerships with American, Iraqi and other companies, it has not been possible to maintain an overall picture of the total volume of contracts awarded on the basis of nationality, and the cumulative value of these contracts. There is no central organisation that collects, collates and publishes such information. However, British companies are active in the power, water, banking, ports, construction, telecoms, security, legal services and consultancy sectors.

<i>[holding answer 8&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> John Bourne served as the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Governorate Co-ordinator for Dhi Qar province from early September 2003 to 27&nbsp;February 2004. It was never intended that he should remain until the dissolution of the CPA. He served with distinction in the face of considerable difficulties, particularly after the attack on the Italian Carabinieri in Nassariya. His Italian replacement, Barbara Contini, has already been working in the CPA's Regional Office in Basra, and comes with strong experience of post-conflict reconstruction in the Balkans.

 The normal principles of company and company insolvency law apply to Arms Length Management Organisations (ALMOs). ALMOs are normally set up by local authorities as companies limited by guarantee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department has taken to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;scope, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;commission and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;disseminate research into the early detection of diabetes.  [158029]<P>

<P>
<a name="40309w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The National Screening Committee will, advise the Department by 2005 on the most effective policy for screening for Type 2 diabetes. It is generally accepted that screening of the whole population for Type 2 diabetes would not be cost-effective given the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease. However there is emerging evidence to suggest that it may be clinically and cost effective to offer screening to specific sub-groups of the population who are at high risk for diabetes. The Department and the National Screening Committee have commissioned research to define high-risk individuals and to evaluate pilot screening projects in primary care. The results of this research will be available to inform the advice of the National Screening Committee.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w20.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Sight tests under national health service arrangements are already available to certain priority groups. These include, children, those aged 16&#150;18 in full-time education, people on low incomes and defined categories of people at particular risk of developing eye disease. In April 1999 we extended sight tests to all people aged 60 and over.
<P>

<a name="40309w20.html_para0">Based on the most recent data available of the number of private sight tests, the cost of extending NHS sight tests to this group, at the 2002&#150;03 rate of &#163;16.72, would be an additional &#163;80&nbsp;million for England. The total cost would be increased if the change stimulated demand for more eye examinations. Costs could also be affected if 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2004 : Column 1453W</I><P>
the change in the scope of the NHS service was associated with any review of the sight test fee payable to optometrists.
<P>

<a name="40309w20.html_para1">About a quarter of dental examinations carried out on adults in the general dental service (GDS) involve patients who are exempt from charges or who qualify for a reduced charge.
<P>

<a name="40309w20.html_para2">If dental examinations were made free to all adults in England, patient charge revenue would be reduced by around &#163;85&nbsp;million per annum.

 The actual cost of falls to the national health service and to personal social services is not recorded centrally. Hip fractures are the most common serious injury resulting from falls in older people. The national service framework for older people estimated the cost to the NHS of hip fractures at around &#163;1.7 billion per annum for England.

 Funding to implement the guidance and recommendations of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is not separately identified in primary care trust (PCT) allocations. The national health service is currently receiving the largest sustained increase in funding in its history, so the question of affordability of NICE recommendations should not be an issue. The total of PCT allocations is &#163;45 billion for 2003&#150;04, &#163;49.3 billion for 2004&#150;05 and &#163;53.9 billion for 2005&#150;06.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of anti-social behaviour orders in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;reducing the frequency and seriousness of crimes by children and young people and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reassuring communities; and what plans he has to publish his findings.  [158841]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) are intended to address anti-social behaviour. In Home Office research study 236, January 2002 'A review of anti-social behaviour orders', Siobhan Campbell carried out some research into ASBOs shortly after they had been introduced. Campbell found that few areas managed to monitor ASBOs successfully, but just over one third of a sample of 40 individuals given ASBOs were known to have breached their order. Fewer (30&nbsp;per cent.) had committed further offences during that time. In only four cases had the individual been taken to court for both breach and a further offence.
<P>

<a name="40309w21.html_para1">Campbell also found that there was anecdotal evidence to suggest that ASBOs had been successful. The Home Office has not carried out further research to assess the impact of ASBOs in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;reducing the frequency and seriousness of crimes by children and young people and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reassuring communities.

 The Home Secretary has not asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of drugs (ACMD) to formally assess research carried out by Professor Robin Murray. Much of the research carried out by Professor Robin Murray was known to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) at the time it was producing its report on cannabis. The ACMD felt the research did not conclusively prove a causal link between cannabis and schizophrenia. The ACMD feel any new evidence produced since its cannabis report does not affect the overall weight of evidence or their conclusions that cannabis while still harmful, is less harmful than other drugs in Class B.

 It is important to focus our evaluation of the 2004 cannabis advertising campaign on 14 to 17-year-olds because they represent the priority audience for the Government in our overall aim to reduce drug misuse among young people. It is particularly important that under 18s understand the law because they will be arrested if found in possession of cannabis.

 De-toxification and rehabilitation are appropriate only for those with established drug-dependency, which is very rare in young people of school age.

 As a result of the measures we announced on 23&nbsp;February, nationals of the accession states (other than Cyprus and Malta) will be eligible for income-related benefits only if they have worked lawfully in the UK for a continuous period of 12 months. This restriction will apply for two years and may be extended. Those in work on a low income will be entitled to the normal work-related benefits.
<P>

<a name="40309w23.html_para0">From 1&nbsp;May EU-wide reciprocal health rules will apply to the accession states. Temporary visitors from these states can access immediately necessary treatment but their home state will have to pay the bill. There will be no automatic entitlement to free treatment for pre-existing conditions unless the home country authorises and pays for that care.
<P>

<a name="40309w23.html_para1">Anyone who is deemed to be "ordinarily resident" in the UK, that is to say that they are living lawfully here for settled purposes, is entitled to receive free NHS care.

 This information is not collected centrally.

The secure training centre/LASCH escort service is exclusively for 12 to 17-year-olds. Those sent to Young Offender Institutions may be carried in vehicles with older offenders, but there are requirements in the contract to achieve separation from over-18-year-olds.

<a name="40309w24.html_para2">A tender exercise is currently under way for the next round of Prison Service escort contracts, which are due to commence in August 2004.

 There are no national guidelines for answering and responding to 999 calls.

 The traditional police helmet is currently subject to investigation as to whether the design can be modified to provide a greater level of protection. Alternative headgear is necessary to ensure compliance with Health and Safety legislation and a prototype designed to meet operational requirements is being trialled in three police forces (Dyfed Powys, Greater Manchester and Wiltshire) from 1&nbsp;March for a period of three months.

<P>
<a name="40309w25.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what advice is issued by his Department to chief constables on policing vehicle cruise events.  [159162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w25.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 I recognise the problems that vehicle cruise events can generate and welcome the consideration given to the issue last year by the Association of Chief Police Officers' (ACPO) Road Policing Operations Forum. The ACPO policy is now to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>encourage forces to work on understanding the website community through which illegal cruising events are organised;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>apply robust public order tactics to constrain the activity of any illegal cruises, including via the arrest of attendees causing a public nuisance and the seizure of their vehicles;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>support pro-actively alternative functions organised in accordance with local authority requirements for a public event; and,</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meet organisers of illegal cruises who are keen to move their hobby into a legal arena.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40309w25.html_para0">I am pleased that police forces are now adopting this policy. With effect from 1&nbsp;January 2003, we have given police forces a power under the Police Reform Act to seize vehicles being driven either off-road without authority or on-road carelessly or inconsiderately, and in such a way as to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. We issued guidance at the time on this new provision, which a number of forces are using to tackle cruises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w25.html_spnew2"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 We believe the existing law is sufficient to deal with the problems to which vehicle cruise events give rise. We gave the police on 1&nbsp;January 2003 new powers under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002 to seize vehicles being used anti-socially. I know that a number of forces have been successfully using these to deal with the problems caused by cruises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w25.html_spnew3"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 I am aware that there has over several years been a developing youth culture of attending vehicle cruises. The activity has over 200 websites dedicated to it in the UK. I support the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) policy to encourage forces to work on understanding the website community through which cruising events are organised.

 Serious incidents of self-harm are investigated at senior managers' discretion to identify the cause and lessons to be learned. Preventing recurrence is tackled at the individual level through care plans and case reviews.
<P>

<a name="40309w25.html_para1">In 2003, 30 in-depth interviews were carried out with prisoners who had survived a severe self-harm incident requiring resuscitation or treatment in outside hospital. The findings included: the importance of staff talking and listening to prisoners, proactive care for prisoners who feel unable to ask for help; increased in- cell and out-of cell 'distraction' activities; specialist support for prisoners with a history of abuse; flexible peer support; and reliable delivery of medication for mental health problems. This learning has informed a number of initiatives: quotes from the interviews in the development of Key Messages cards, posters and an information booklet for prison staff; the training of new prison officers; and development of the second phase suicide prevention strategy planned to be introduced soon.
<P>

<a name="40309w25.html_para2">More accurate self-harm data recorded since December 2002 is enabling closer analysis of trends at local, area and national levels.

 <i>[holding answer 5&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Inland Revenue will ensure that information and guidance to support the new tax exemption on child care vouchers is available to all employers before the changes are introduced in April 2005.

<P>

<a name="40309w26.html_para0">And, of course, the Chancellor himself has publicised the exemption by writing to all MPs on 16&nbsp;December last year, and including an information sheet for Members to pass on to businesses in their constituencies.

 The tax credit award a family receives depends on a variety of factors relating to their particular circumstances, not just their level of income.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions he has held with <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;churches and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;church leaders on debt relief and the campaign for trade justice.  [159049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40309w26.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 On 16&nbsp;February, Lord Carey and Lord Griffiths hosted a conference on "Making Globalisation Work For All: The Challenge of Delivering the Monterrey Consensus" at the Treasury. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for International Development were among the keynote speakers at the conference which was attended by a number of church leaders and faith groups.
<P>

<a name="40309w26.html_para2">The conference brought together leaders from faith groups, NGOs, governments, businesses and universities to discuss how to make progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals and eliminating global poverty. Debt relief and trade justice are central to improving growth and reducing poverty in developing countries, and the UK continues to call for the full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and for a strengthened commitment to ensure that trade liberalisation delivers poverty reduction.
<P>

<a name="40309w26.html_para3">The conference also focused on the need for extra resources to provide further debt relief, and for additional aid to improve the investment climate and help the private sector in developing countries respond to the new opportunities and challenges created by trade liberalisation. The UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility would provide the much-needed substantial increase in resources that debt relief alone would not achieve and that could be disbursed byway of grants and additional debt relief.
