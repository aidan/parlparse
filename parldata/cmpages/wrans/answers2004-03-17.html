To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans her Department has to use combined heat and power to cut fuel poverty.  [160090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Community Energy programme is a three-year &#163;50&nbsp;million UK-wide grant programme promoting community heating largely through the use of CHP. One of the aims of the programme is to help 100,000 people to heat their homes affordably. We hope that it will be possible to extend the programme beyond March 2005, but this is subject to resources being available.
<P>

<a name="40317w01.html_para2">In the Energy White Paper we made a commitment to support field trials for micro-CHP. These trials, which are being conducted by the Carbon Trust, will help determine the fuel and carbon saving potential of micro-CHP in a range of applications. The results of the trials will help inform the development of any future support for the technology, including in fuel poor households.

<a name="40317w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At the end of 2002, installed CHP capacity stood at 4,742MWe. More up to date data will become available when the annual Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) is published in the summer by DTI. The measures to support CHP announced in the Energy White Paper, taken together with the measures we have previously introduced and detailed in the draft CHP Strategy, will significantly help CHP. We will set out the full range of support measures in the Government's Strategy for CHP to 2010, which we intend to publish after the Easter Recess.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since last year's Energy White Paper we have been progressing delivery of the support measures for CHP set out therein. Before Christmas I set an ambitious target to source at least 15&nbsp;per cent. of electricity for government use from Good Quality CHP by 2010. These Energy White Paper support measures, taken together with the measures we have previously introduced and detailed in the draft CHP Strategy, will significantly help CHP. We will set out the full range of support measures in the Government's Strategy for CHP to 2010, which we intend to publish after the Easter Recess.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the change in costs to local authorities of the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003.  [159012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Local authorities are making significant changes in their waste management practices to meet their current Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting and in anticipation of legally binding requirements under the Landfill Directive to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled. It is too early to tell whether the requirements of the Household Waste Recycling Act will impose costs in excess of those being incurred to meet the aforementioned targets.

<a name="40317w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State has not held any specific discussions with local government on local authority waste recycling performance recently.
<P>

<a name="40317w01.html_para3">I will follow up my predecessor's correspondence with local authorities whose progress towards meeting their recycling and composting targets was judged to be of most concern, once data on local authority recycling performance for 2003&#150;04 are available, in summer 2004, and those failing to meet those targets have been identified.
<P>

<a name="40317w01.html_para4">There is regular discussion on local authority waste management issues, including performance, between Defra and the Local Government Association (LGA) officials.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of local authority performance on <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;waste recycling and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;waste disposal.  [159010]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In December 2003 the Audit Commission published information on local authorities waste and recycling performance as part of its Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPI) data for 2002&#150;03. These data supplement local authorities own projections of their 2003&#150;04 performance and provide an indication of local authorities movement towards their statutory performance standards. It suggests that England is within reach of its 2003&#150;04 national target of 17&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40317w01.html_para5">Local authorities actual performance for 2003&#150;04 will be known when the BVPI figures are published in December 2004.
<P>

<a name="40317w01.html_para6">The Waste Implementation Programme, as part of its approach to targeted support, is identifying those authorities facing barriers to improved performance and how these might be overcome.

[161161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The European Commission undertook an Article 35 verification visit to Sellafield from 8&#150;12&nbsp;March. We understand the Commission is contemplating a visit to Dounreay within the next year or so, but no date has been fixed.
<P>

<a name="40317w01.html_para7">The arrangements for the Sellafield visit were made by the Department in co-operation with BNFL, the Environment Agency and the Food Standards Agency. The Scottish Executive would be responsible for the arrangements for a visit to Dounreay in co-operation with UKAEA, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and FSA.

 The severely disadvantaged areas are those areas of land within less favourable areas of the UK, which are handicapped, principally by reason of high altitude, harsh climate, short growing season, low fertility, difficult topography or remoteness. The Severely Disadvantaged Areas are defined on an England basis and are as such treated as one entity. There are approximately 7,400 agricultural holdings wholly within the SDA and another 7,300 that straddle the boundary. The SDA are defined in statutory maps and in England lie within the following constituencies:

 Eligible farmers in severely disadvantaged areas will receive the single farm payment, and will continue to be eligible for other schemes such as the Hill Farm Allowance and the agri-environment schemes (which are currently being reviewed).

 Minimum values rules apply to certain types of working horses if they are exported for work and to ponies, but not to the majority of horses. It has been confirmed by the Commission in response to an Opposition MEP that such a restriction on the free movement of horses is unacceptable and this is consistent with our own legal advice and the understanding of horse welfare organisations in the UK. That is why we have instead developed an equivalent, welfare based alternative in collaboration with equine organisations. Our wishes have been included in the draft welfare in transport regulation, now before the Council of Agriculture Ministers. We have no intention of relaxing the application of the minimum values rules until the new arrangements are in place. It should be noted that they will have wider application to the welfare of horses within the United Kingdom and across Europe including the accession states.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what evidence has been collated on localised effects on ground nesting bird populations of badger predation; and which localities have been affected.  [157944]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Evidence has been gathered on the effect of badgers on ground nesting birds as part of a Defra funded project investigating the ecological consequences of badger removal. Some of this work has been conducted in treatment areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Evidence collated so far includes an exhaustive review of the published literature, and experimental field research using artificial bird nests. The results of these studies will be presented to Defra in March 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether increased farm biosecurity in areas of high badger population <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;deprives badgers of a high value food source and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;increases predation on other wildlife.  [157952]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Cereal grains and many plant fibres pass through the badger's digestive system relatively unchanged, and may, therefore, often represent low-value food sources. Work by the Central Science Laboratory at Woodchester Park showed that badgers were significantly more likely to visit farm buildings, to exploit such foods, during periods of low rainfall when alternative natural food items such as earthworms were less available. Other mammals and birds form a relatively small part of the diet of badgers in the UK, and there is no evidence to suggest that increased farm biosecurity would result in increased badger predation on such wildlife.

<P>
<a name="40317w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In much of Great Britain, badgers live in social groups within defined territories which the groups defend. However, mixing between groups is common. Individuals make foraging and breeding forays into neighbouring territories. Temporary and permanent dispersal from one group to another also occurs regularly. Details of movement rates at the Central Science Laboratory's Woodchester Park study area can be found in Rogers, L. M., Delahay, R. J., Cheeseman, C. L., Langton, S., Smith, G. C. and Clifton-Hadley, R. (1998) Movement of badgers ("Meles males") in a high density population: Individual, population and disease effects.

 Although several methods have been discussed in the past, including bactericidal fumigants and napalm, there are no feasible measures to disinfect badger setts currently available. The size and complexity of sett structure, and the propensity of badgers to re-excavate setts soon after destruction, precludes the efficacy of any of these methods.

 Post mortem examination of naturally infected wild badgers suggests the aerogenic route is the primary route of infection. Currently, experimental infection studies in the Republic of Ireland are underway which may provide information about infective dose via the endobronchial route.
<P>

<a name="40317w02.html_para12">The other significant route of infection for wild badgers is via direct inoculation with infected saliva through bite wounding.

 Diseases are often natural components of ecosystems and, as such, may play an important role in ecological processes. Badgers, however, inhabit a largely artificial habitat consisting mainly of managed landscapes, particularly for pastoral agriculture. It is this close association with grazing cattle that may have first brought badgers into contact with bovine TB.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w02.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Typically, an infected badger may excrete <i>M. bovis</i> bacilli for 12&#150;15 months before death, although there are recorded cases of animals with TB living up to nine years. Litter size per sow varies from one to five with an average of three but, generally, only one or two sows per social group will breed each year. It cannot be assumed that an infected sow will infect all its progeny. Assuming, however, that a breeding sow gives birth each year, an animal excreting <i>M. bovis</i> for 12&#150;15 months could, theoretically, produce between one and ten infected cubs.

<a name="40317w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Ground nesting birds can be predated on by a variety of other species. There have been relatively few studies of the effectiveness of removing predators to protect bird populations. A recent review of studies (Cote, I. M. and Sutherland, W.J. 1997, The effectiveness of removing predators to protect bird populations Conservation Biology 11: 395&#150;405) concluded that the studies indicated that the removal of predators had a large, positive effect on the hatching success and post-breeding population sizes of target bird species but not on breeding population size, the effects on which varied considerably between studies. Whilst predator control may thus be a useful tool for game managers, it may not meet the requirements of those seeking to increase the size of bird breeding populations.

ACRE advised that they needed to see the full detail of the Belgian reassessment before coming to a final view and this has been requested from the Belgian Competent Authority.

The Committees concluded that there is no evidence from the broiler chicken feeding study that suggests that T25 maize grain fed to animals would pose an increased risk compared with conventional maize grain.

[160579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am not aware of any shortcomings of the farm-scale evaluation (FSE) maize trials, the results have been endorsed by both the Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the evaluations and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). Officials sent the results of the Farm Scale Evaluations, together with the non-specialist and scientific summaries, to the European Commission and the Competent Authorities of the member states for their information on 20 and 21&nbsp;October 2003. ACRE published its advice on the FSE results on 13&nbsp;January 2004, and this advice was also sent to the Commission and the Competent Authorities on that date. On 9&nbsp;March 2004 officials wrote to the French Competent Authority, which issued the relevant consent on behalf of all EU member states, seeking amendments to the consent for Bayer T25 GM maize (Chardon LL) to limit herbicide use with the crop in line with ACRE'S advice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she was informed that the dry matter content for Chardon LL averages 27.3&nbsp;per cent.  [160619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Secretary of State was made aware in March 2003 of a range of issues raised in the public hearing on Chardon, including its dry matter content. The lower than average dry matter content in the performance trials was taken into account, but the conclusion on overall value for cultivation and use rightly took the other important characteristics into consideration. These included better than average dry matter yield, early vigour and resistance to lodging.

I also understand that the consultation arrangements adopted in this case were consistent with those for other such transfers to Drigg from sites throughout the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what proportion of UK housing stock has been tested for radon gas;  [159891]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Since 1987 successive Governments have run a radon measurement programme to identify the extent of the radon problem in the UK. During that time 450&nbsp;thousand of the 25&nbsp;million UK homes have been tested. Over the last eight years Government-funded measurement programmes have mainly focused on homes likely to be at most risk. In England and Northern Ireland, for example, that has meant every home with a greater than 5&nbsp;per cent. probability of radon levels being at or above the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB) recommended radon "Action Level" (200 becquerels per cubic metre of air) has been offered a free radon test. In accordance with NRPB's recommendation, we advise that remedial action is taken to reduce radon levels in any home at or above the Action Level. It is estimated that over 100,000 homes in the UK are likely to be at or above the Action Level and, of those, around 43,000 have been found. Approximately 90&nbsp;per cent. of the homes above the Action Level are likely to be in England.
<P>

<a name="40317w04.html_para4">The following table sets out the number of homes tested by NRPB for radon gas in the UK since 1996 up to the present date. The figures from 1998 onwards include radon tests that have been offered to householders as part of pilot studies and a wider on-going programme where the Government are working in partnership with nearly 30 local authorities in England to help householders in radon-affected areas to take action to cut levels of radon in their homes. This supports the Government's policy of encouraging more radon remediation amongst householders in order to reduce the risk that high radon levels pose to their health. The pilot studies run between 1998 and 2000 showed that working at a local level worked well and could double the amount of radon remediation. This success led to the rolling out of the current programme based on the experiences and lessons learned from the pilot studies. We shall be reviewing the initiative before it ends in March 2005 to allow us to determine how successful it has been. We will then make a judgment on the future direction of the Government's radon programme.
<P>

<a name="40317w04.html_para5">In Northern Ireland, the Department of the Environment is continuing to make free radon tests available to householders in areas where radon concentrations in homes have a 1&nbsp;per cent. or greater probability of being at or above the Action Level. In addition, radon awareness campaigns will be conducted in selected areas of Northern Ireland in partnership with local authorities. These will target areas where there is a greater than 10&nbsp;per cent. probability of radon levels in a home exceeding the Action Level.

Our plans will deliver over &#163;180 billion of public and private money across all forms of transport over the 10 years to 2010, a 45&nbsp;per cent. real terms increase over the previous decade.

implementing the recommendations of the Burns report on post-primary education; and if he will make a statement.  [160830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Following extensive consultation on the Burns report, I established the Post-Primary Review Working Group to consider the responses to the consultation and provide advice about future post-primary arrangements. On 26&nbsp;January 2004, I announced that I had accepted the Working Group's recommendations, and work has started on implementing these recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_wqn1"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what legislation or regulations prevent diabetes sufferers from serving as ambulance drivers in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement.  [161349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996 (as amended) prescribes insulin-dependent diabetes as a relevant disability in respect of the issue of Group 2 licences (i.e. those that authorise the driving of passenger carrying vehicles and large goods vehicles).
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para0">In light of this, and in accordance with Article 9(3) of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 (as amended) the Department of the Environment must not grant such a licence to a person who suffers from such a disability.
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para1">In addition, it is the opinion of The Secretary of State for Transport's Medical Advisory Panel on Driving and Diabetes that drivers with insulin-treated diabetes should not drive emergency vehicles
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para2">A person whose diabetes is treated by diet alone or by diet and tablets are allowed to hold such a licence provided they are otherwise in good health.
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para3">In order to be employed as an Ambulance person within Northern Ireland Ambulance Service there is an essential requirement to hold a full and clean driving licence, which includes Categories C1 (to drive minibuses) and Dl (to drive vehicles over 3&#189; tonnes).
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para4">In the past where it has come to the attention of the NI Ambulance Service that an employee has developed diabetes, it has redeployed the employee from driving duties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what precautions have been taken to counter an outbreak of avian influenza in Northern Ireland.  [160617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Following the introduction of EU restrictions on imports of poultry meat and poultry products from Thailand on 23&nbsp;January, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), as a precautionary measure, suspended all imports of live poultry, poultry meat products, captive birds, pet birds and eggs for human consumption from Asian countries most affected by avian influenza. Equivalent action was 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2004 : Column 296W</I><P>
also taken following a further outbreak of avian influenza in the USA in February and the same action is currently under way for the outbreak in Canada.
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para5">As regards the animal health aspects, DARD has a contingency plan for dealing with an outbreak of avian influenza, which has been approved by the EU. This plan is currently being reviewed and updated to ensure that any outbreak could be dealt with quickly and effectively. Advice regarding biosecurity has been re-issued to the poultry industry and is available on the DARD website.
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para6">As regards the human health aspects, the Department of Health and Public Safety (DHSSPS) in conjunction with DARD and other UK Health Departments, is continuing to monitor international developments in relation to the transmission of avian influenza to humans. DHSSPS has placed information for travellers on their website and has been working with DARD and the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland to ensure protection of poultry workers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the outcome of his Department's meeting with representatives of Belfast City Airport on 10&nbsp;March.  [161347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The purpose of the meeting was to clarify the City Airport's request for a review of the existing Planning Agreement, to determine the issues involved in such a review and to discuss a possible way forward.
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para7">The City Airport representatives have agreed to submit details of their proposals and their possible implications for the current Planning Agreement to the Planning Service, probably within two months. A further meeting will then be arranged.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Information on all birth defects is not available. However, information is collected by the Chief Medical Officer on the number of children born each year suffering from a number of selected congenital malformations in Northern Ireland. This information for the years 1999 to 2003 is as follows.

<a name="40317w07.html_wqn5"><B> David Burnside: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answer of 2&nbsp;March 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2004 : Column 297W</I><P>
2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 836W, on ceasefire breaches, what criteria he uses to assess whether there has been a breach of a ceasefire by a paramilitary group; and how many times since January these criteria have been met by the actions of the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Provisional IRA, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;UDA and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;UVF.  [161469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Section 3(9) of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 sets out the criteria which the Secretary of State takes account of in making a judgement on the status of a ceasefire. The Secretary of State makes a judgement in the round. The ceasefires of the Provisional IRA and the UVF are recognised, the ceasefire of the UDA is not.

<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_wqn6"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether citizenship ceremonies taking place in Northern Ireland will follow exactly the same format as in the rest of the United Kingdom.  [161397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Home Office has set out a basic format for a citizenship ceremony but they will vary from place to place throughout the United Kingdom, both to account for numbers of applicants and the incorporation of local features.
<P>

<a name="40317w07.html_para9">In Northern Ireland, the ceremonies will be held in Hillsborough Castle and will be conducted by a Lord Lieutenant. The format of the ceremonies in Northern Ireland will be an introduction and welcome speech by the Lord Lieutenant. The new citizens will then take an oath and pledge&#151;the only parts of the ceremony which are mandatory throughout the UK. Following this, the Lord Lieutenant will present each of the applicants with their certificate of citizenship. There will then be a short congratulatory speech and the ceremony will end with the playing of the national anthem.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what discussions he has had with his colleagues in the Cabinet Office in relation to the Civil Contingencies Bill; and if he will make a statement.  [161292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w07.html_spnew7"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 There has been regular contact, both at Ministerial and official level, with Cabinet Office and other colleagues in relation to the Civil Contingencies Bill. The Bill will place civil protection on a modern, statutory footing and, together with associated administrative arrangements, will provide a uniform level of protection throughout the United Kingdom.

 Since the publication of the Costello Report, I have met with representatives of the UUP, DUP, SDLP, Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party and the Governing Bodies Association. I have received a request for a meeting with representatives of the Catholic Bishops of Northern Ireland and I hope to meet with them in the very near future. Officials have been involved in discussions with members of the Association of Head Teachers in Secondary Schools and with post-primary school principals in the Belfast and Southern Education and Library Boards and shortly with those in the South Eastern Education and Library Board.

<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps are being taken to facilitate urgent dental procedures in children with special needs.  [161686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department has been in discussion with the Belfast Dental Hospital (Royal Group of Hospitals Trust) and the Community Dental Service to urge identification of spare theatre capacity outside of the Royal site to facilitate treatment for children with special needs.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para0">A working group has also been set up to look at the development and long-term planning for the delivery of dental treatment to children with special needs, and the issues of dental treatment for children and adults with special needs will be addressed within the new Oral Health Strategy which is currently under consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps are being taken to ensure that young adults with complex medical needs have equality of access to dental care.  [161688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Chief Dental Officer has set up a working group to look at future development of dental services for young adults with complex medical needs. The group is chaired by the Dental Director of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and draws together both medical and dental staff involved in the care of these people.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para1">In addition the Chief Dental Officer is undertaking a new Oral Health Strategy (OHS) for Northern Ireland which will address the needs of the learning disabled and medically compromised children and adults.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on availability of dental services for young people aged 14 years and above with complex medical needs.  [161689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Dental services for young people over the age of 14 years who have complex medical needs are under considerable pressure at the moment. Currently there is only one consultant and one associate specialist in special needs at the Belfast Dental Hospital. They also provide services at outreach clinics throughout Northern Ireland. Most of these patients require their dental treatment carried out under general anaesthesia on an acute hospital site. A shortage of medical consultant anaesthetists and appropriate facilities have also increased the pressure on services over the past couple of years. Efforts are being made at present to address these difficulties.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the withdrawal of dental services for young people at Muckamore Abbey Hospital.  [161690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There was a reduction of dental services for young people at Muckamore Abbey Hospital following a review of the use of general anaesthesia and conscious sedation in primary dental care by the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Dental Officer of the NHS in England.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para2">The report and subsequent guidelines issued in July 2000 effectively limited the use of general anaesthesia to acute hospitals in the interests of patient safety. General anaesthetic sessions at Muckamore Abbey Hospital ceased in December 2000, although routine dental treatment continues to be provided there.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Dodds: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what measures he plans to tackle discrimination against people with disabilities in the areas of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;transport and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;access to public buildings.  [159557]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para3"><i></i><i>(a)</i>&nbsp;A number of measures in relation to transport will extend protection for people with disabilities. The Department of the Environment intends to begin consultation in May 2004 on proposals to implement the UK Government's commitment on making (public

hire) taxis accessible to people with disabilities. The Department also intends to extend provisions relating to the carrying of guide dogs, hearing dogs and other prescribed categories of dogs to licensed drivers of private hire vehicles in mid 2004.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para4">The Northern Ireland Executive agreed in principle to proceed to the removal of the transport exemption from Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) in Northern Ireland. It is proposed to issue a Northern Ireland consultation document by May 2004 on the removal of the exemption based on the consultation by the Department for Transport in Great Britain. It is also planned to amend Part V of the DDA in respect of Northern Ireland by taking powers to amend the rail Vehicle Accessibility (NI) Regulations 2001.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para5"><i></i><i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Additional duties on service providers will come into effect on 1&nbsp;October 2004. This is the last of three stages placing duties on service providers to help eliminate discrimination in the area of access to services for disabled people and means that service providers may have to make other "reasonable adjustments" in relation to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Dodds: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what quantities of hard drugs were seized by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the police, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Customs and Excise and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;other agencies in Northern Ireland in each year since 1997.  [159553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w08.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The amounts of cocaine, heroin and ecstasy seized by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, and the Northern Ireland Prison Service are detailed in the following tables.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para6">Customs efforts to protect Northern Ireland from drugs cannot be measured solely on results in Northern Ireland itself. In 2002&#150;03, Customs took out 11,549 kilos of Class A drugs, targeted on the UK, some of which would have been destined for Northern Ireland. We are unable to supply data on drug seizures by Customs, prior to 1999 as to do so would require a substantial manual exercise and would incur disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40317w08.html_para7">Data for drug finds in prison establishments prior to March 2001 was not collated centrally and is not available.

 I have not received any reports from consultants relating to the overall outcome performance of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Audit Office carries out an annual audit of the Commission's Accounts. Its opinion is included within the Financial Statement section of the Commission's Annual Report which is laid in Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. A copy of the Audit Office Management Letter relating to the Annual Accounts is also provided to Office of the First and the deputy First Minister. The Commission's Corporate Plan has been approved by Ministers and its performance against this Plan and its annual Business Plan is subject to on-going monitoring.

 The Food Benefit Schemes (Northern Ireland) Order provides for the establishment of a new Welfare Food Scheme or Schemes in Northern Ireland.

 The deadline for responses to the Government's consultation document on the Commission's Review of Powers submission was 16&nbsp;August 2002, but suspension of the Assembly then intervened.
<P>

<a name="40317w09.html_para3">The Joint Declaration committed the Government to bring the consultation on our draft response to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's Review of Powers to an end following restoration of devolution. This was subsequently brought forward to October 2003. However the election in November and an outstanding response from a key consultee made this impossible.
<P>

<a name="40317w09.html_para4">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is a key institution of the Belfast Agreement. The Government want it to succeed and are committed to helping it to do so. We are considering our response to the Review of Powers as part of a package of measures to ensure that we have a strong, independent and self-confident Commission, which draws support from all parts of the community. I intend to make an announcement in the near future.

Regular contact takes place with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport through an inter-departmental group on the Olympic bid. One of the issues discussed by this group is how the regions, including Northern Ireland, can benefit from the games.

<i>[holding answer 5&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The decision to offer no further evidence against Katharine Gun was made by the Crown Prosecution Service as an independent prosecuting authority. It was a decision taken solely on legal grounds and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. There was, in this case, a clear prima facie breach of section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. However Senior Treasury Counsel prosecuting this case gave advice, with which the Director of Public Prosecutions fully concurred, that there was no longer a realistic prospect of convicting Katharine Gun. The evidential deficiency related to the prosecution's inability, within the current statutory framework, to disprove the defence of necessity to be raised on the particular facts of this case.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the total value of tax reliefs and subsidies was in each year since 1990 for use in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;nuclear, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;oil, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;gas, <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;electricity and <i>(e)</i>&nbsp;renewable industries.  [157408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para8"><i>Tax relief</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para9">In arriving at the tax which companies pay on their profits, a range of reliefs apply, some of which are specific to particular taxes while others only apply under certain circumstances. The range of tax reliefs that can apply to oil, gas and generation of electricity (including through renewables) includes capital allowances; exemptions from the climate change levy; the R&D tax credit; and specific treatment for British Energy, and the North Sea oil and gas industry.
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para10">The main tax reliefs and their costs are listed in the December 2003 Tax Ready Reckoner and Tax Reliefs, which is available in the Library of the House and is published by HM Treasury at http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media//AAB24/pbr03&#95;trr.pdf. Aggregate figures for the economy-wide costs of the minor direct tax reliefs can be found on the Inland Revenue's website at http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/tax&#95;expenditures/ menu.htm.
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para11">Given the range of activities undertaken by companies, to collect figures for the costs of tax reliefs given to specific industries would be too burdensome on business. It is only possible to provide such figures where tax reliefs apply solely to a specific sector (such as reliefs against petroleum revenue tax which is granted only to the North Sea oil and gas companies).
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para12">The Government have made the following specific provisions for the nuclear, oil, gas, electricity and renewables industries:
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para13"><i>(a) Nuclear</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para14">The Government made provision in section 4 of the Electricity (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act for a tax disregard in respect of its proposed restructuring aid to British Energy. As the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said in her statement to the House on 3&nbsp;June 2003, the tax disregard, estimated at &#163;0.9 billion, will not result in any extra cost to the Government. It has been provided to avoid a large tax charge hitting British Energy as a result of the proposed aid and thus the need for the aid to be correspondingly higher to achieve the same effect.




<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2004 : Column 329W</I><P>

<i>(b) and (c) Oil and Gas</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para15">Information on reliefs against petroleum revenue tax granted to North Sea oil and gas companies for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 can be obtained from table 7 of the December 2003 Tax Ready Reckoner. Figures are published twice a year and figures for earlier years can be obtained from the Library of the House. These reliefs are given against PRT only. Information on the PRT payments made by oil and gas companies is contained in Table 11.12 of the Inland Revenue's corporate tax statistics, at http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/corporate&#95;tax/menu.htm.
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para16"><i>(d) Electricity</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para17">The climate change levy was introduced in April 2001. In view of their environmental benefits, the Government announced that electricity from good quality combined heat and power plants (CHP) sold via licensed electricity suppliers would be exempt from the climate change levy. This exemption took effect from 1&nbsp;April 2003. Electricity generated from coal mine methane (CMM) 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2004 : Column 330W</I><P>
was also exempted for the same reason in November 2003. The cost of the exemption for good quality CHP is estimated at &#163;15&nbsp;million per year from 2003&#150;04, and for CMM less than &#163;3&nbsp;million from November 2003 to April 2004 (recorded as a negligible cost to the Exchequer).
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para18"><i>(e) Renewables</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para19">From introduction of the Climate Change Levy in April 2001, there were exemptions for electricity generated by new renewables such as wind and solar energy. These exemptions are estimated to have cost the Exchequer around &#163;20&nbsp;million per year from 2001&#150;02 onwards.
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para20"><i>Subsidies</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w15.html_para21">Information about the total value of subsidies in each year since 1990 for use in nuclear, oil, gas, electricity and renewable industries are set out in the following table.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

<i>Column (a):</i><P>

Figures are based on the premium received by Nuclear Electric plc over and above the market price for electricity in the period 1990&#150;96.<P>

Grant in aid payments to UKAEA have not been included. These payments were to fund research and development in nuclear fusion which is likely to be many years from commercial exploitation, and to discharge UKAEA's own nuclear liabilities which arose from proving their technology rather than for commercial objectives. All UKAEA's reactors were experimental, and all are now closed.<P>

The Government are supporting the restructuring of British Energy on the terms set out in the Secretary of State's announcement of 28&nbsp;November 2002, including making available to the company a credit facility, up to a maximum of &#163;200&nbsp;million. There are currently no outstanding drawings on the facility.<P>

<i>Column (e):</i><P>

These figures show direct Government funding for capital grants, research and development on renewable energy through the DTIs Sustainable Energy programme and through Research Councils.<P>

<i>Column (f):</i><P>

This column shows expenditure through the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) for England and Wales.<P>

<i>Column (g):</i><P>

The figure of &#163;277.9&nbsp;million for 2002&#150;03 represents the value of the equivalent of the total Obligation on suppliers of 3&nbsp;per cent. of electricity supplied. This equals 9,261,568 Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) at the buy-out value of &#163;30 per MWh. This figure includes the value of NFFO ROCs for which there was a surplus of &#163;57.6&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03.<P>

 The regulation of gas and electricity supply, including any guidance or instruction to suppliers, is the responsibility of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem).

seek to avoid the disconnection of premises occupied by customers with payment difficulties. In addition, suppliers are required, so far as possible, to avoid the disconnection of pensionable, disabled or chronically sick customers with payment difficulties between October and March. I understand that Ofgem is in discussion with suppliers about improving disconnection arrangements, particularly as they apply to vulnerable customers. These discussions will cover a range of matters affecting disconnections, including arrangements for re-connection.

 <i>[holding answers 16&nbsp;March 2004]</i>: Discussions have been held between Post Office Ltd. and Tesco to determine what future plans Tesco has for its estate of stores containing post offices. Tesco is undertaking a site-by-site review, and in a minority of locations where they establish a Tesco Express format and the site is not consequently large enough also to operate a Post Office branch, they may wish to terminate the Post Office contract for the site in question.

<a name="40317w16.html_para4">The removal of a post office branch from a Tesco owned store is not a permanent closure and Post Office Ltd. has given assurances that, where there remains a need for post office provision, it will look to relocate, in the same vicinity, offices that Tesco want to remove from its stores.

 The Postal services Act 2000 enables Postcomm to take enforcement action against Royal Mail where it believes it is likely to breach its licence obligation.

<a name="40317w17.html_para2">I understand that with regard to performance in 2003&#150;04, the first six months showed an overall improvement.

Postcomm will consider what action should be taken against Royal Mail, which may include enforcement or imposition of financial penalties, once they have received Royal Mail's end of year results at the end of May 2004.

 A ban on the manufacture and sale of self-contained gas cartridge (SCGC) guns came into force on 20&nbsp;January 2004. A ban on the possession of the guns comes into force on 30&nbsp;April 2004. Anyone who possessed one on 20&nbsp;January has until 30&nbsp;April to apply for a firearms certificate if they wish to keep it. Unlawful possession of a SCGC gun carries a minimum sentence of five years and a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="40317w17.html_para3">We estimated in our Regulatory Impact Assessment for the ban that between 50,000 and 70,000 SCGC guns had been sold in the UK. This was based on discussions between the Home Office and Brocock Ltd., who were the main importer/distributor of SCGC guns and who manufacture the cartridges they use. Not all of this number will still be in circulation and it is not possible at this stage to say how many will be certificated or surrendered. However, we will be collecting this information from the police after the 30&nbsp;April deadline. SCGC guns were not previously subject to control and therefore none were certificated prior to the ban. It will not be possible therefore to say how many might have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of before the new laws came into effect.
<P>

<a name="40317w17.html_para4">We estimated in our RIA that there would be about 15 prosecutions for unlawful possession of SCGC guns. A Home Office circular was issued to the police on 14&nbsp;January giving guidance on the ban. No specific guidance was offered on prosecutions and we expect the police to consider each case on its merits.
<P>

<a name="40317w17.html_para5">The ban has been widely publicised. It was announced in a press release and other publicity material for the Anti-social Behaviour Act, and was mentioned in the national media. More detailed coverage was given by the shooting press. After discussion with the police and the Gun Trade Association (GTA), the Home Office produced a range of publicity material explaining what owners must do if they want to keep their guns. A total of 2,500 posters and 50,000 leaflets were sent to police forces for display and further distribution as they saw fit. Another 2,400 posters and 240,000 leaflets were sent to GTA members and to other retailers likely to have 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2004 : Column 338W</I><P>
stocked SCGC guns, together with 120,000 stickers to put on tins of air gun pellets. This was a national campaign and publicity material was not produced in Welsh. However, we are looking at what other publicity is necessary before the 30&nbsp;April deadline and will consider the need for producing material in Welsh if this cannot be dealt with locally.
<P>

<a name="40317w17.html_para6">In addition to money spent on publicising the new powers contained in the Anti-social Behaviour Act, we have so far spent 6,700 on the posters, leaflets and stickers related to the SCGC controls.
<P>

<a name="40317w17.html_para7">We have allowed over three months for owners to apply for a certificate or to surrender their guns and do not think it necessary to extend that period. Although the length of time to process applications will vary between forces, this will not affect applicants. Anyone who applies before 30&nbsp;April will not be liable for prosecution even if their application remains outstanding on that date or is the subject of an appeal.

<a name="40317w18.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There is nothing in the Bill which changes in any way the grounds on which children may be taken into care. The Bill simply provides that families, illegally resident in the UK once their claims have failed, would no longer be entitled to support at the expense of the taxpayer if they refuse to co-operate with efforts to return them home. If, by putting themselves in this position, parents put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of their children should be protected under existing child protection legislation. We do not believe, that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the contribution of situational crime prevention techniques to recent reductions in crime.  [160203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40317w18.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 It is not possible to quantify the contribution of situational crime prevention to the recent reduction in crime. This is because situational crime prevention encompasses a wide range of initiatives that aim to make crime more difficult, more risky and less rewarding. There is recent evidence on the effectiveness of some forms of situational crime prevention in this country (for example, alley-gating and CCTV). Results from the British Crime Survey also provide evidence that domestic households that own security measures have a lower chance of being a victim of burglary, even when factors that might be related to both risk and security are taken into account. Recent sweeps of the British Crime Survey have shown that household ownership of a range of security measures is increasing. It is therefore reasonable to think that this may have contributed to the reduction in property crimes over recent years.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para11"><i>Burglary</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para12">A major evaluation of some 300 of the local burglary reduction schemes in Phase I of the Safer Cities Programme (1988&#150;95) showed typically a 10&#150;30&nbsp;per cent. reduction in burglary. It was estimated (with results scaled up to the entire programme) that these, mainly situational, measures prevented some 56,000 burglaries, whose cost to victims and the state would have been &#163;62&nbsp;million, for expenditure of under &#163;7&nbsp;million. An evaluation in West Yorkshire of housing incorporating Secured By Design standards (a national police-led certification scheme) showed a crime rate that was 56&nbsp;per cent. lower, and there is evidence that as well as being effective, this approach is now becoming cost-effective.

<a name="40317w18.html_para13">One of the most extensive and recent uses of situational crime prevention techniques has been under the Home Office's Reducing Burglary Initiative. Such techniques were employed in the majority of the 247 projects funded between 1999 and 2002. 63 of these projects were subject to a full independent evaluation under Phase I of the initiative. The interim report on these evaluations (Home Office Findings 204, 'Reducing Burglary Initiative, early findings on burglary reduction', published in 2003) reported that 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2004 : Column 343W</I><P>
situational crime prevention techniques&#151;when planned, targeted, and implemented successfully&#151;were an effective crime reduction measure. The report highlighted that in the 55 evaluated projects where figures were available, domestic burglary fell by 20&nbsp;per cent. compared with a pre-project period. This represented a net reduction of 7&nbsp;per cent. when taking into account the downward trend in burglary found in selected comparison areas.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para14">Four illustrative case studies drawn from the evaluations were published as appendices to the interim report. In all four of these case studies situational crime prevention techniques were considered to have contributed to the observed crime reduction impact. Net burglary reduction in these projects ranged from -12&nbsp;per cent. to -47&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para15">However, the interim findings also highlighted the fact that burglary reduction projects were often most effective when they were based&#151;not just on a single approach (such as situational crime prevention)&#151;but on a package of coherent and complementary approaches, including short and long-term measures.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para16"><i>Vehicle crime</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para17">Home Office Research Study 266, 'An evaluation of the secured car park award scheme', was also published in 2003, this being an evaluation of a scheme established by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in September 1992. It was designed to encourage car park operators to improve security as a means of reducing criminal activity and the fear of crime in car parks and vehicle retention areas. Results showed that there is evidence that the scheme can help reduce the level of vehicle crime and fear of crime in car parks, when targeted at high crime car parks. The key measures that impact both on crime levels and fear of crime appear to be formal surveillance (including patrols), lighting, access control and the physical appearance of the car park.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para18">Security improvements by manufacturers of new cars are also thought to have been a key factor in reduced levels of car thefts, with compulsory fitting of electronic immobilisers since October 1998, together with other design improvements such as central-locking.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para19"><i>CCTV</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para20">A systematic review of the impact of CCTV (Home Office Research Study 252, 'Crime prevention effects of closed circuit television: a systematic review') was published in 2002. This indicated that CCTV was associated with a 41&nbsp;per cent. reduction in crime in car parks, but provided little evidence of an effect in other settings. Other evaluations show CCTV is most effective when used as part of a wider local crime reduction strategy.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para21">A Home Office funded National Evaluation of CCTV is on-going. Initial findings on implementation from this evaluation were published in 2003 in Home Office Development and Practice Report 7 'National Evaluation of CCTV: early findings on scheme implementation&#151;effective practice guide'. Results relating to the impact of CCTV on crime are not yet available from this evaluation but are expected towards the end of 2004.

<i>Robbery</i>
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para22">The Street Crime Initiative was launched in April 2002 to address rises in street crime in 2001&#150;02. It covers the 10 police force areas which together account for the great majority of street crime. Intelligence-led policing in hotspots in the 10 police force areas contributed to a 17&nbsp;per cent. reduction in robbery in those 10 areas in 2002&#150;03, which means 17,000 fewer offences in those areas.
<P>

<a name="40317w18.html_para23">A pilot scheme is being run by Greater Manchester Police to address crime at automated teller machines (ATMs), by creating defensible spaces around ATMs, to demarcate the area of personal space of the person using the ATM. This makes the potential victim of street crime more spatially aware, and increases the risk to the offender by alerting the ATM user to invasion of defensible space by the offender. Initial findings from the pilot indicate that robbery and theft from the person has fallen at the sites where the scheme is being piloted. There was a 34&nbsp;per cent. reduction in robbery and theft from the person across the 21 sites in Manchester where the defensible space pilot is running, comparing the six months from 21&nbsp;December 2002 to 30&nbsp;June 2003 with the same period in the previous year.

The potential benefit in both cases was determination of the toxicity of certain compounds and risks they might pose to man and the environment. Decisions on whether and on what terms to license such studies are informed by professional assessments made by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate in accordance with relevant parts of section five of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The aim has been to ensure that animal use only occurs when justified, and that in those circumstances animal suffering in such studies is minimised, consistent with satisfactorily achieving the scientific purpose.

Some fixed penalty income from speed limit enforcement by camera can be netted off, but its use is very strictly ring-fenced for the purposes of meeting expenditure incurred in the prevention or detection of speeding, or red light, offences or in the enforcement of or proceedings in respect of such offences. The netting-off provides for cost-recovery only and furnishes no income for other purposes.

 Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill takes a differentiated approach toward human rights challenges against removal to safe third countries by providing for three lists. Part 6 of the Schedule provides for the removal of a State from lists at Parts 3 and 4 by Order subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament. The Government does not consider it necessary to provide a similar Order&#151;making power in relation to removal of a State from the list at Part 2. We intend that this list should be limited to European Union Member States which are party to the "Dublin" arrangements for determining the State responsible for examining an asylum application and other states such as Norway and Iceland, which are associated with those arrangements.

 Part 5 of the Police Act 1997, under which the Criminal Records Bureau has been established, imposes no requirement for checks to be carried out, but sets out eligibility for a Disclosure. Eligibility criteria for a Standard Disclosure include all persons whose duties include caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children. Those whose duties regularly involve such elements are eligible for an Enhanced Disclosure. In some instances, checks have been made mandatory under other legislation. Where Checks are not mandatory, it is open to the employer to require that checks are carried out. Consideration is being given to the issue of guidance by the Department for Education and Skills as regards school transport arrangements. The activities, including employment, of a convicted sex offender who is on the sex offenders register would be monitored by the police who, if a risk is identified, would take appropriate action.

 The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has statutory responsibility for setting safety limits on exposure to electromagnetic field radiation in the UK. The recent NRPB consultation document included sections on the application of the precautionary principle to the determination of guidelines for exposure to electromagnetic radiation from 0 to 300 GHz. No specific mention of Tetra is made in those sections.

 The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) is responsible for setting safety limits for radiation hazards in the UK. In 2001, The Home Office asked the Board of NRPB to provide advice on any health implications of Tetra technology. The Board of NRPB subsequently asked its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (Agnir) to examine the issue.
<P>

<a name="40317w21.html_para0">The Agnir report on "Possible health effects from Tetra" was published in June 2001. The report concluded that "although areas of uncertainty remain about the biological effects of low level radiofrequency electromagnetic fields in general, including modulated signals, current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the special features of the signals from Tetra mobile terminals pose a hazard to health". Agnir also noted that the signals from Tetra base stations are not pulsed whereas those from mobile terminals and repeaters are. Hence there is no reason to believe that exposure to the signals from Tetra base stations should be treated any differently to the exposure to signals from other base

 In the UK, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) is responsible for setting safety limits on exposure to electromagnetic fields. Safety limits are not technology-specific.
<P>

<a name="40317w21.html_para1">The NRPB has recently carried out a comprehensive review of exposure guidelines and a consultation document was published in May 2003.

 The Home Office has had no representations from the Scottish Executive on this issue, which is a matter for the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). The NRPB is currently reviewing its advice to Government on non-ionising radiation at frequencies from 0 to 300 GHz, which includes Tetra radiation.

 In 2001, the Home Office asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) for advice on the health aspects of Tetra technology. The NRPB's independent Advisory Board on Non-ionising Radiation (Agnir) published its report on "Possible health effects from Tetra" in June 2001. The conclusions of the Agnir experts were upheld in their recently published follow-up to the Stewart report, "Health effects from radiofrequency electromagnetic fields". In particular they confirm that "there is no reason to believe that signals from Tetra base stations should be treated differently to those from other base stations". There are no plans to commission any further reviews.

 On the recommendation of independent experts, the Home Office set up a comprehensive programme of work on Tetra health issues. The Home Office also funds Tetra-related research as an adjunct to the Mobile Telecommunications Research Programme co-ordinated by the Department of Health. No adverse effects of Tetra have been found. Biological studies carried out by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory have shown that Tetra has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells&#151;the main concern raised about this type of technology. Longer-term human volunteer studies are under way. Further information is available on the Home Office website at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html.

 Measures to intercept passengers with inadequate documents on their arrival in the UK include risk-assessing all incoming flights, conducting intelligence-led document checks, observing passengers as they disembark from aircraft and ad hoc special exercises sometimes involving other agencies and at certain locations using CCTV.
<P>

<a name="40317w22.html_para0">At the main arrivals control, passengers are interviewed and their documents examined to detect impostors and to identify forged or counterfeit passports or passengers without the requisite entry clearance.

 In view of the large number of different organisations involved in letting reconstruction contracts in Iraq, it has become difficult to maintain a definitive picture of the total volume of contracts awarded, and the cumulative value of these contracts. In addition a number of British companies have been awarded contracts and sub-contracts for the reconstruction process in Iraq, but some have asked us not to publicise their success because of issues of commercial confidentiality. Those companies that have advised us of their success are not recorded by region, and so we are therefore unable to assess the success or

<P>
<a name="40317w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Navy works closely with other Government Departments on the need to protect shipping and employs a worldwide Maritime Trade Operations (MTO) policy, which enables it to offer a number of options to support merchant shipping. They range from provision of routine advice and guidance, through to Naval supervision of merchant vessels. Decisions about the timing and type of support offered are informed by the threat level in a region or area. The global threat to merchant shipping is kept under constant review, and if necessary, additional MTO measures can be implemented quickly. Decisions over future safeguards or levels of protection will always reflect the level of threat that is present.

 On 1&nbsp;March 2004 I announced to the House that there will be a national celebration and commemoration of the end of the Second World War on Sunday 10&nbsp;July 2005. The main event will be in London. However, I very much hope that other towns and cities 



<P>

across the United Kingdom will stage their own events on that day. Planning is at an early stage and I expect to be able to inform the House further about progress later in the year.

<a name="40317w24.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many children at Condover Hall School have been found alternative school places for when the school closes.  [161552]<P>

<P>
<a name="40317w24.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Condover Hall is proposed for closure in July this year. Of the 30 pupils currently on roll at the School, two pupils will be entering post-16 provision in the Summer term, four have received written confirmation of an alternative place and the remainder have either had conditional offers, subject to assessment, or parents are still considering various options. RNIB is confident that all the pupils will have an alternative school place before Condover closes on 16&nbsp;July 2004.

<a name="40317w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many spare places have been available at the beginning of each school year since 1997&#150;98 at each school in the Ribble Valley constituency.  [161809]<P>

<P>
<a name="40317w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The number of spare places at each school in the Ribble Valley constituency since 1997&#150;98 provided by the Department's annual surplus places survey is set out in the following tables. The figures state the position as at January each year, adjusted for the summer term intake. We do not have figures for 2001&#150;02 as there was no surplus places survey in that year.

 The Learning and Skills Act 2000 requires local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) to consult relevant local authorities and regional development agencies in drawing up their plans for the provision of education and training, including further education. The Secretary of State's remit letter for the LSC also emphasised the Council could only succeed if it worked in partnership with a wide range of stakeholder organisations. I would expect local LSCs to involve a wide range of interested parties, including hon. Members, when developing their plans to meet the needs of local businesses and communities.

 Information on the number of new child care places created in an individual constituency is available only from 1999. Lancashire local authority reported that between April 1999 and December 2003, the latest date for which information is currently available, 1,306 new child care places opened in Chorley constituency. A place typically helps more than one child, as not all children take up places full-time, and we estimate these places will help some 2,300 children. During the same period, Lancashire reported that 620 child care places closed in Chorley, so that the stock of child care places rose by 686.

 Under the Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative both revenue and capital funding has been made available to local authorities to support the development and delivery of new, affordable child care places in the 20&nbsp;per cent. most disadvantaged wards. Revenue funding of up to &#163;5,400 for each new child care place created is awarded from when the nursery opens and is paid over a three year period. Capital funding is being provided through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and DfES to assist in the creation of new nurseries.

<a name="40317w25.html_para0">The total budget (revenue and capital) which was set in 2003&#150;04 and current indicative allocations for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 for neighbourhood nurseries by English region is given in the table. NOF capital grant is allocated to individual projects and annual spend is determined by the progress in building the nurseries. The figures therefore represent the total NOF capital grant by English region up to the period 2005&#150;06.

 About a third of West Bank communities still depend on local springs and harvesting cisterns to get their water. It is often not suitable for drinking. Per capita, consumption is decreasing, from 95 cubic metres per year per capita in 1997 to 67 cubic metres per year per capita in year 2000. Figures for subsequent years are not available but the impact of the intifada has increased problems with access to clean water for many families.

 The security fence is causing severe problems in access to water for Palestinian civilians and farmers, which is damaging the Palestinian agricultural economy. Once the western section of the Wall is completed, it is estimated that the annual value of agricultural production in the West Bank will decrease by 22.8&nbsp;per cent. In Qalqilya alone 15 of the city's 39 wells have been confiscated or isolated, representing over one-third of the city's water supply.

 There is an internationally agreed process through which the Government of Zimbabwe and the Office of the United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator agree annually a "Consolidated Appeal" in consultation with all other humanitarian stakeholders. The humanitarian appeal takes account of what the Government of Zimbabwe plans and is reasonably expected to do within its own resources. But we have not held back our assistance because of clearly poor policies of the Government of Zimbabwe, including on budget

<a name="40317w26.html_para6">DFID has supported those elements of the Consolidated Appeal that provide humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable members of Zimbabwean society.

 It is not possible to give a meaningful value for the total additional revenue support grant that has been allocated to Durham as a result of the council tax base reduction because of the number of student exemptions.
<P>

<a name="40317w27.html_para4">That is because, to do so, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would first need to calculate a taxbase that included the properties currently excluded because of student exemptions for all authorities. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have any information about whether these properties would have otherwise been subject to different discounts or exemptions (e.g. single-person discount).
<P>

<a name="40317w27.html_para5">This new taxbase would then need to be used to recalculate Revenue Support Grant (RSG). This is likely to result in a different distribution of grant before floors and ceilings to authorities.

<P>

<a name="40317w27.html_para6">The number of properties covered by student exemptions is no longer collected by band of property. The latest year for which this information was available was 2002&#150;03. In 2002&#150;03 Durham City had one class K exemptions (an empty dwelling owned by a student who last lived in the dwelling as their main home), 129 class M exemptions (for halls of residence) and 728 class N exemptions (for dwellings occupied only by students, the foreign spouses of students, or school and college leavers). This is the equivalent of about 828 Band D properties. The Standard Tax Element for shire districts for 2002&#150;03 was &#163;97.2073276605. Therefore under the assumptions specified in the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2002&#150;03, Durham City would have been able to raise a further &#163;80,444.46 had these properties not had student exemptions. An equivalent amount of RSG before floors and ceilings was therefore provided to Durham City with respect to the properties with student exemptions.

<a name="40317w28.html_para5">That is because, to do so, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would first need to calculate a tax base that included the properties currently excluded because of student exemptions for all authorities. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have any information about whether these properties would have otherwise been subject to different discounts or exemptions (e.g. single-person discount).
<P>

<a name="40317w28.html_para6">This new tax base would then need to be used to recalculate Revenue Support Grant. This is likely to result in a different distribution of grant before floors and ceilings to authorities. The existing levels of floors and ceilings may then be inappropriate with this new distribution; it would certainly change the scaling factors on grant increases above the floor published in the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="40317w28.html_para7">However, for 2002&#150;03 an approximate calculation is shown as follows. The number of properties covered by student exemptions is no longer collected by band of property. The latest year for which this information was available was 2002&#150;03. In 2002&#150;03 Charnwood had 512 class N exemptions (for dwellings occupied only by students, the foreign spouses of students, or school and college leavers). This is the equivalent of about 400 Band D properties. The Standard Tax Element for shire districts for 2002&#150;03 was &#163;97.2073276605. Therefore under the assumptions specified in the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2002&#150;03, Charnwood would have been able to raise a further &#163;38,904.53 had these properties not had student exemptions. An equivalent amount of RSG before

<P>

<a name="40317w29.html_para1">Biomedical scientists will usually have attended a non-NHS vocational degree course where the funding for the course and student support arrangements fall under the Department for Education and Skills' general arrangements for students.

<a name="40317w29.html_para2">Training for the paramedical services is not usually undertaken by means of undergraduate or equivalent courses, instead it is usually done through employment-based training and short vocational courses.

The pilot services will offer genetic assessment to appropriate individuals, but this is not a trial of genetic risk assessment per se. The pilots will, rather, test out ways to provide an integrated service for individuals who are, or are concerned that they may be, at increased risk of cancer due to genetic factors. The pilot sites will run for up to three years and will be evaluated to ensure lessons about how best to deliver this type of service can be shared by the wider National Health Service.

<a name="40317w29.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 It is not unusual for service providers to charge different prices, nor to offer discounts for bulk purchasing, for example when councils block contract for a number of places.

 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has acknowledged the complexity and changing nature of the care home market, but has also found evidence that the challenges this throws up can and is being met at local level. This confirms the Government's view that local problems are most amenable to local solutions. I am particularly heartened by the OFT's decision to focus in some depth on issues that have a particular bearing on information and choice for consumers. I look forward to reading the findings when they are produced, especially any recommendations for making the market work better for consumers.

 Three pilot projects on the electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP) ran from mid-2002 to mid-2003 and were independently evaluated by the Sowerby Centre for Health Informatics at the University of Newcastle.

 It is estimated that, each year, more than 17,000 children under five years are admitted to United Kingdom hospitals because of respiratory illness caused by the exposure to other people's cigarette smoke.
<P>

<a name="40317w31.html_para5">The Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) Report published in 1998 reported that:

<P>

<a name="40317w31.html_para6">The World Health Organisation has found that children are especially vulnerable to secondhand smoke. This is because their lungs are smaller and their immune systems less developed, rendering them more susceptible to respiratory and ear infections triggered by passive smoking; children are smaller and breathe faster than adults and so take in more harmful chemicals per kg of weight than adults; and children often have less choice than adults to leave a smoke-filled room.
<P>

<a name="40317w31.html_para7">The Department has taken action to increase the public's awareness of the dangers from secondhand smoke. The "smoking kids" television advertisement launched last summer was this country's first ever-substantial campaign on secondhand smoke. This has been followed up by major billboard and press adverts. Focusing on children, the television advertisement says:

<a name="40317w31.html_para9">Evaluation results show that awareness of the messages had been raised. Spontaneous awareness of advertising or publicity of smoking around children rose from 30&nbsp;per cent. at the pre stage to 74&nbsp;per cent. at the post stage. Furthermore; there was 78&nbsp;per cent. spontaneous awareness in households where there were children and at least one of the parents smoked. 55&nbsp;per cent. of respondents were able to spontaneously recall an element from the campaign, with 49&nbsp;per cent. of respondents recalling the image of smoke coming from the children's mouths or noses. Prompted recognition of the television advertisement was 79&nbsp;per cent. The advertising had significant impact amongst non-smokers, with 69&nbsp;per cent. at the post stage agreeing that the advertisements made them feel that they should encourage their partners and friends that they should not smoke around children.

 Decisions on the future funding of the Cancer Research UK's SunSmart sun awareness campaign will be taken in due course.
<P>

<a name="40317w32.html_para0">We have no plans to subsidise the cost of high factor suncream. Research evidence supports our view and that of key stakeholders that shade and clothing (including eyewear) are safer and more reliable means of protecting people against the harmful effects of ultra violet (UV) rays. The Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign reinforces this message by saying that sunscreen is one element in the SunSmart campaign's advice on protection against the risk of skin cancer, and should be used if seeking shade (especially between 11.00 and 15.00) and covering skin with clothing is not possible. If sunscreen is used, it should be factor 15 or above and should be regularly applied. In practice, only minimal additional benefit is gained by using factors higher than 15. A Sun Protection Factor 15 sunscreen blocks more than 92 per cent, of the UVB rays.
