 The Government Equalities Office was established on 12 October 2007. Prior to this date the Discrimination Law Review Project was the responsibility of the women and equality unit in the Department of Communities and Local Government. Since 2005, Ministers for women and equality have met the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England on two occasions; one of those meetings was attended by a group of young people. In late 2006, the women and equality unit hosted a roundtable discussion on children and young people, which was attended by non-governmental organisations and the children&#146;s commissioners for England and Scotland. During the consultation period for the Equality Bill, the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England organised a consultation event on behalf of the women and equality unit. Officials also met the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England in August 2007 and the children&#146;s commissioners for England and Scotland in March 2008.</p>

 The consultation paper on proposals for the Equality Bill, &#147;A Framework for Fairness&#148;, signalled that the Government was considering the case for prohibiting age discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services and for a single public sector duty extended to cover age. Over 4,000 organisations and individuals responded to the consultation, of which over 700 addressed the issue of prohibiting age discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services and over 50 of these responded specifically on the issue of children. The list of organisations that responded to the consultation is available on the Government Equalities Office website.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 July 2008]:</i> The Government Equalities Office was established on 12 October 2007. It has taken over responsibility for equality issues from a number of different teams and Departments, including: the Disability Rights Commission Sponsorship team, based in 2006-07 in the Department for Work and Pensions; the Commission for Racial Equality Sponsorship Team, based in the Home Office in the first part of 2006-07, then transferred to the Department of Communities and Local Government; the Women and Equality Unit, based in the Department for Trade and Industry until May 2006, then in Communities and Local Government; and lawyers from DTI and HO, who transferred to CLG in May 2006. To answer the question accurately would therefore require investigation of records that are widely dispersed in a number of different Departments and locations and this could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Until the Government Equalities Office agrees its own set of terms and conditions its staff are on loan from other Departments and they, therefore, work under the terms and conditions they agreed with in their parent Departments. However the majority of GEO staff are drawn from the Departments for Communities and Local Government and Work and Pensions both of which have removed the retirement age for all staff below senior civil servant (SCS) grade. At present the latter can continue to work until they reach the age of 65 but this age limit is due to be reviewed in 2011.

<i> [holding answer 15 September 2008]: </i>The Airwave service is already being used operationally throughout both City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police Service. Migration to Airwave from the previous radio systems was completed by September 2007.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 September 2008]:</i> The Airwave service is provided by Airwave Solutions Ltd. (ASL) and is paid for by the National Policing Improvement Agency and police authorities by means of a service charge. The responsibility for aerials and any associated preventative maintenance rests with ASL. The Airwave contract does not make specific reference to either aerial life or aerial maintenance but ASL are obliged to maintain service levels as specified in the Airwave contract.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 September 2008]:</i> There is no legal requirement for Airwave to be installed within large construction projects and the service is usually provided on a bespoke basis at the behest of the local force under a provision in the Airwave contract for Special Coverage Solutions. In such situations, the cost is borne by the appropriate police authority. We are not aware of any discussions that have been held on this issue with the construction industry.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> The term &#147;business crime&#148; is not specifically used within the recorded crime offence series. The offences that may be attributed to business crime are: robbery of business property, theft by an employee, shoplifting, and fraud by a company director. The available statistics are given in the following table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80929w0005.htm_para1"><a name="0809294000460">Our strategy is to encourage business to work closely in partnership with the police and local authorities through the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) to inform local crime reduction strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80929w0005.htm_para2"><a name="0809294000461">Partnership working is perhaps the single biggest success in tackling crime over the past 10 years. We funded the Action Against Business Crime Group to set up and maintain 200 business crime reduction partnerships in towns and cities across England and Wales. These partnerships have proved remarkably successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80929w0005.htm_para3"><a name="0809294000462">The Home Office is committed to working with our retail partners to ensure that we find effective solutions and responses to retail crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80929w0005.htm_para4"><a name="0809294000463">Shops and stores are at the heart of most of our communities and crime against those outlets affects us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80929w0005.htm_para5"><a name="0809294000464">A key strand of the work to address business crime is to ensure that partnerships and stakeholders have the right &#147;tools&#148; and knowledge to deal with retail crime effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80929w0005.htm_para6"><a name="0809294000465">As an example of this, the Home Office has funded the Perpetuity Group, which is led by Professor Gill, to devise an audit tool which retailers can apply to their stores and significantly lower the opportunities for shop thieves to operate.</p>

 Updated figures for the projected growth in the number of individuals on the National DNA Database are not yet available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80929w0010.htm_para0"><a name="0809294001486">Work on revising the figures is in progress. It will also take account of the judgment in the S and Marper case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the proportionality of retaining biometric data for those charged but not convicted of an offence. The ECtHR judgment is expected later this year. Revised projections should be available in early 2009.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of people with DNA profiles held on the national DNA database living in <i> (a)</i> Leeds West constituency, <i> (b)</i> Leeds Metropolitan District and <i> (c)</i> the UK are of (i) Asian, (ii) Black and (iii) Eastern European ethnic origin and are under 18 years old.

 Information held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is available on the basis of the police force which added the DNA profile, not the residence of the person sampled. Information is, therefore, not available on the number of residents of Leeds, West constituency or Leeds metropolitan district who have had a DNA profile added to the NDNAD, but is available on the number of profiles loaded by West Yorkshire police. The people from whom these profiles were taken may not be resident in the area where they were sampled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80929w0010.htm_para1"><a name="0809294001489">The NDNAD holds records on the ethnic appearance of persons who have DNA taken, based on the judgment of the police officer completing the record about which of six broad ethnic categories the person belongs to. These categories are white&#151;north European; white&#151;south European; middle eastern; Asian; black; and Chinese, Japanese or other south east Asian. There is no separate category for eastern Europeans. If the police officer does not make an entry for ethnic appearance, this is recorded as 'unknown'.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80929w0010.htm_para2"><a name="0809294001490">It is not, therefore, possible to provide the information requested. However, it is possible to provide information on the number of profiles added to the NDNAD by West Yorkshire police, and by all English and Welsh police forces, broken down by age and the ethnic appearance categories used. The age shown is the person's current age, not the age they were when the DNA sample was taken. This is shown in the following table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80929w0010.htm_para3"><a name="0809294001491">The number of profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80929w0010.htm_para4"><a name="0809294001492">At present, the national replication rate is 13.3 per cent., that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent. fewer than the number of profiles. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals whose profiles have been loaded are not given for specific forces.</p>

The quoted probability of a match between full SGM Plus DNA profiles of unrelated individuals is one in one billion (i.e. one in a thousand million). The NDNAD Custodian carefully monitors replicate DNA profiles loaded to the NDNAD, and a key reason for doing this is to identify potential adventitious matches between SGM Plus DNA profiles derived from unrelated individuals. To date, no such adventitious match has been found. This indicates the SGM Plus match probability to be significantly lower than the figure quoted&#151;it is probably better than one in one trillion (that is, one in a million million).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80929w0016.htm_para5"><a name="08092925000219">Energy efficiency is incentivised within the PFI arrangement and is incorporated also within the Department&#146;s Estate Strategy. Specific measures to improve efficiency are detailed within the Department&#146;s three year Sustainable Development Action Plan, which is incorporated within its Sustainable Development Annual Report for 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80929w0016.htm_para6"><a name="08092925000220">While the Department&#146;s increased use of IT and extended opening hours, to provide a better service to customers and improved facilities for staff, has impacted on our energy efficiency, a planned programme of work is in place to meet the carbon from offices and energy efficiency targets. The Department has secured investment for 41,000 &#145;spend-to-save&#146; measures through its PFI arrangements and is installing Smart Meters in its largest 700 buildings to improve reporting and energy management. These measures, together with an intensive energy efficiency and communications campaign, have resulted in absolute carbon emission reductions of 10.8 per cent. in 2007-08. Their ongoing implementation, together with improved governance and a review of site plant and equipment, mean that the Department predicts a further reduction of 15 per cent. by 2011, meeting the Sustainable Operations target.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="5"><sup>(1)</sup><i> Pension Transformation Project (PTP):</i><br>
The apparent increase over the original stated costs can be attributed to a fundamental change in delivery approach.<br>
When PTP started in April 2002, costs were early high level estimates based on delivery via a private supplier (who would recover development costs of the system through an operating contract).<br>
Policy later changed and it was decided DWP would fund the capital costs of PTP itself.<br>
As a result, development costs went up but operating costs went down.<br>
Overall, this actually means an improved return* on the total investment, although development costs appear higher than the very early estimate provided in 2002.<br>
* Net present value of the programme has increased by 40 per cent. to &#163;585 million, compared to &#163;350 million in the initial business case. HM Treasury guidance states the NPV is the primary criteria for deciding whether government action can be taken. This is arrived at by converting all costs and benefits to present values so that they can be compared.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup><i> Customer Information System (CIS):</i><br>
The original cost estimate of &#163;40 million was based on the original scope of the project. There has subsequently been significant extension of the scope as the CIS Programme has responded to changes in the Departmental Modernisation Programme.<br>
The costs originally submitted for CIS in July 2003 assumed that CIS would be developed as a back-end system supporting the Customer Account Managements (CAM) systems intended for deployment in each of the Client Groups. It also assumed that the Standard Enquiry Function (SEF) would be developed to support a very small number of users who would not have access to CAM.<br>
Plans evolved with the result that the only Client Group to deliver a CAM system in line with this earlier specification was the Pension Service.<br>
The additional costs result from requirements to service both the &#145;old&#146; Legacy applications and the &#145;new&#146; PTP CAM, as well as developing and implementing architectural changes in a seamless way. In addition, the absence of CAM functionality meant that the SEF has been rolled out to in excess of 124,000 users.<br>
CIS scope was increased to deliver desktop access to approximately 19,000 staff in 408 local authorities for the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit replacing remote access terminals, which were provided to only a very limited number of users in each of these local authorities.<br>
The increased investment together with the delivery of enhanced requirements has resulted in CIS benefits increasing from &#163;155 million to &#163;533 million which includes direct benefits of &#163;130 million and enabled benefits of &#163;403 million. During this period, the introduction of CIS has led to the decommissioning of two major benefit systems (the Departmental Central Index and Personal Details Computer System) as CIS is now the master of personal details across all of DWP.<br>
Additional work has also been carried out with other Government Departments and further work is planned in this area.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup><i> Central Payments System (CPS):</i><br>
The figure of &#163;90 million relates to the outline business case produced during the feasibility phase in 2004. This related to a scope that is significantly smaller than the current programme. The original scope was for the replacement of existing payment processing software and excluded an integrated accounting solution. Furthermore, the integration scope of CPS has increased from four entitlement management systems to nine.<br>
The NPV figure of &#163;154 million relates to the full business case approved in March 2006. The figure of &#163;169 million relates to the latest outline business case approved in May 2008.<br>
<i> Note</i>:<br>
The costs in the table represent the investment costs of implementing the particular project and programme. Costs of running the solutions implemented by the projects and programmes are not included in the table as in the vast majority of cases, they are more than compensated for by the financial and non-financial benefits they generate. These savings are demonstrated in the NAO report &#147;The Efficiency programme: A Second Review of Progress&#148;.<br>

1. All figures are consistent with Budget 2008, as well as expenditure information published on the internet at:<br>
www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp<br>
2. Winter fuel payments are rounded to the nearest million pounds, but cold weather payments have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds.<br>
3. The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997. Annual payments are made to most people aged 60 or over. The current rate is &#163;200 per household with someone eligible and aged between 60 and 79 and &#163;300 per household containing someone eligible and aged 80 or over. At present over 8 million households benefit each year.<br>
4. From 2000-01, winter fuel payments were extended to include people aged 60 to 64 years and also include the over 80 payments.<br>
5. Winter fuel payment expenditure is forecast to increase significantly in 2008-09 following the announcement at Budget 2008 of an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &#163;50 for eligible households with someone aged between 60 and 79 and &#163;100 for households with someone aged 80 or over.<br>
6. Customers eligible for cold weather payments are those awarded pension credit or those awarded income support or income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance who have a pensioner or disability premium or have a child who is disabled or under the age of five. Following the introduction of employment and support allowance in October of this year eligible customers will also include those in receipt of income related employment and support allowance that includes a work or support component, any disability premium, or who have a child who is disabled or under the age of five. A payment is made when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the eligible customer&#146;s postcode.<br>
7. Up to and including the winter of 2007-08, a cold weather payment was &#163;8.50 for each week of very cold weather. The Prime Minister has announced that for the winter 2008-09 a cold weather payment will be increased to &#163;25 for each week of very cold weather.<br>
8. Cold weather payment expenditure for 2008-09 cannot be forecast because the number of payments will be dependent on the severity of the winter. However, a notional figure of &#163;24 million is included in the forecasts for the Social Fund, provided to HM Treasury.<br>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br>
2. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. &#145;&#151;&#146; denotes less than 50,000 children.<br>
4. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures is single financial years. Three sample years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
6. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
7. Regional median incomes are presented in 2006-07 prices.<br>
 8. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.<br>
9. This response includes a lower income threshold of 40 per cent. of the contemporary median income. The data for households with an income lower than 50 per cent. of median are not considered to be accurate as an indicator of living standards. Many of these households whilst having very low incomes would not be considered poor, but do genuinely have few sources of income in the short-run. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards.<br>
10. Regional median incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling, while numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children.<br>

 Lone parents who participate in new deal for lone parents can voluntarily access work-related training which is tailored to their individual requirements and takes into account their previous experiences, skills and the type of work they are looking for.</p>

These included requiring lone parents to take part in a skills health check when their youngest child turns five, pilots to evaluate mandating them to relevant skills training to address any identified skills gaps as well as encouraging lone parents with younger children to voluntarily develop the skills they need to find work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80929w0021.htm_para7"><a name="08092925001062">From late 2010, lone parents with a youngest child aged seven or more will no longer be eligible for income support. They will instead be able to apply for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) or employment and support allowance if they have a disability or health condition. Those who receive JSA for six months or more will be able to take part in full-time employment-related training for up to eight weeks while receiving a training allowance. Lone parents will still be able to access new deal for lone parents for the first 12 months of their JSA claim.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 June 2008]:</i> Since its launch in 1998 the New Deal has led a major transformation in employment support for people in Britain. Since its introduction New Deal has helped 1.97 million people into work. Benefit recipients participating in New Deal more than once are more likely to enter employment from their second spell on the programme than their first, and from their third spell than their second.

<i> Notes:  </i>1. Three-survey year averages are given for each of the regions as robust single-year estimates cannot be produced because of the sample sizes for individual regions.  2. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or "equivalised") for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.  3. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
 4. Figures are based on survey data and as such are subject to a degree of sampling and non-sampling error.  5. The government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. As part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17 three indicators of low income poverty will be monitored: the percentage of pensioners below 60 per cent. contemporary median income, 50 per cent. median income and 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices.  <i> Source:</i>  Family Resources Survey<br>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> In 1997 the poorest pensioners lived on &#163;68.80. Today no pensioner need live on less than &#163;124.05. The Government have introduced a number of measures to reduce the levels of poverty in older people. The number of pensioners in poverty in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07 (as measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs). Once housing costs are accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> There is a statutory requirement to review all social security benefits each year and to increase certain benefits from April each year. The increase applied to most contributory and non-contributory benefits is calculated using the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the 12 months ending in the preceding September. This ensures that benefits keep their value in broad terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80929w0024.htm_para6"><a name="08092925001715">The inflation figures are based on a year-on-year comparison of prices. Therefore any recent fluctuations in inflation will be taken into account in the benefit increases that will take effect from the following April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80929w0024.htm_para7"><a name="08092925001716">In addition to the annual uprating, the Chancellor also announced in his Budget 2008 speech that for winter 2008-09 an additional payment will be made alongside the winter fuel payment. Households with someone aged 60 to 79 will receive an additional &#163;50 and households with someone aged 80 or over will receive an additional &#163;100.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80929w0024.htm_para8"><a name="08092925001717">On 11 September 2008, the Government also announced a new &#163;1 billion package of measures to help people cut their energy bills. Measures on offer deliver significant energy savings&#151;e.g. cavity wall and loft insulation&#151;and 11 million lower income and pensioner households are eligible for these free of charge. Also for winter 2008-09 cold weather payments will increase in value from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25.00. Cold weather payments are made to vulnerable people in receipt of qualifying benefits, including  pension credit, if there is a period of very cold weather in their area.</p>

Customer compliance deals with low level fraud and customer error allowing the criminal compliance teams to focus on the more serious and complex fraud cases which are likely to result in a criminal sanction. The focus of customer compliance on low level fraud allows for earlier intervention resulting in a shorter period of overpayment and smaller cash value.</p>

3. Expenditure on State Pension, Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Christmas Bonus are defined as benefits paid to women over 60 and men over 65.<br>
4. Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Winter Fuel Payments expenditure refers to benefit units or households where at least one person is aged 60 or over.<br>
5. The average per pensioner is estimated by dividing the total pensioner benefits by the state pension caseload. Those claiming Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Winter Fuel Payments between the ages of 60-64 are not included in this caseload, but are included in expenditure.

Compliance with minimum wage legislation is one of the criteria which a labour provider must meet to be issued with a licence by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA).

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> Coccidiosis is not a notifiable disease hence reporting of coccidia diagnoses is voluntary. The levels of endemic diseases, such as coccidiosis, in the cattle and sheep population of Great Britain (GB) are monitored through the Veterinary Laboratories Agency's (VLA) Endemic Disease Surveillance Programme. This is performed by analysis of test results from clinical diagnostic samples submitted by veterinary surgeons to the VLA regional laboratories and to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) disease surveillance centres for investigation. The figures shown in Table 1 correspond to the number of coccidiosis incidents recorded by the VLA's Veterinary Investigation Diagnosis Analysis (VIDA) database for the years 2003 to 2008. Incidents in this setting are defined as farm holdings reporting a case of coccidiosis, affecting one or more animals, either for the first time or after a four-week period from the last reported incident of coccidiosis diagnosed on that farm. Note therefore that holdings can be recorded as having cases more than once within the same year.</p>

Many factors may influence the likelihood of a farmer/his veterinarian submitting a clinical sample for diagnosis: general economic situation within the sheep and cattle industry, awareness of the disease and its perceived importance, other concurrent priorities, the particular clinical presentation of the suspected disease etc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80929w0028.htm_para1"><a name="08092925002316">All these factors need to be taken into account when interpreting the figures. Changes over time of any of these factors will impact on the observed trends, so caution needs to be exercised when comparing annual figures. Furthermore, and within these limitations, figures in Table 1 only represent incidents where clinical disease was present and could be confirmed with the current testing procedures. The figures therefore are likely to represent a fraction of the total number of animals and farm holdings infected with coccidiosis in GB.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> Rural priority groups in remote areas have the same access to the offers under the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) as others. With CERT aiming some &#163;1.5 billion energy supplier investment in carbon reduction measures at a priority group of low income and age 70-plus households, we expect to see rural priority group households see significant benefits. CERT also includes measures which deliver specific benefits to rural households. For example, we expect some 90,000 priority group households to benefit from fuel switching, e.g. moving to gas central heating from electric or oil heating. We have also established a &#145;flexibility&#146; option under CERT, whereby suppliers get a significant uplift in carbon credits for installing more expensive measures, such as solid wall insulation and heat pumps in off gas grid properties. They can utilise this flexibility option for up to 5 per cent. of their 40 per cent. priority  group target.</p>

 Hospitality is intended to cover occasions where there is a need to provide hospitality for others. Hospitality may therefore be provided if it is in the public interest only and necessary for the conduct of departmental business to do so. As a general rule, expenditure on alcohol for hospitality purposes is not allowed. The core-Department&#146;s catering services provider does not hold a licence to serve alcohol. Were alcohol to be purchased for hospitality purposes it should be acquired through formal purchase order, or through the Government Procurement Card, both of which methods are subject to formal authorisation procedures.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 September 2008]: </i>The information is not available in the form requested. The precise number of moorings (residential and non-residential) depends on the lengths of the canals (which can be split into a higher or lower number of berths) and the lengths of the boats which moor alongside the canal. British Waterways estimate that they have around 4,600 moorings of which approximately 7 per cent. will become available for tender by the end of this year's trail.</p>

Employees included in the table may only have accumulated three working days absence so the figures may appear artificially high. MOD offers guidance and training to line managers on managing absence. It actively encourages the use of Return to Work Interviews and has trigger points in place for the commencement of formal management action.</p>

I am withholding further information as its release would, or would be likely to, prejudice national security.</p>
