 The independent ‘Making Automatic Enrolment Work’<sup>(1)</sup> review, which reported last October, recognised that facilitating transfers is critical to success of reforms. The review concluded that these issues are not restricted to how transfer rules apply to NEST, but apply across the pensions market. The review also recognised the importance of the transfer restrictions on NEST during the roll-out of the reforms and recommended that the Government address the issue of transfers with a view to relaxing the restrictions on NEST once the reforms were fully rolled out.</p>

We will publish proposals on how issues arising from short service refunds rules, small pots and transfers might be addressed in the autumn.</p>

 Parliamentary constituency, local authority and regional expenditure data are not available for all benefits. Details of benefits included in the per capita calculations in the following tables can be found in the footnotes. DWP is not responsible for Northern Ireland spending therefore we are unable to show expenditure per capita for the UK. We have shown per capita expenditure for Great Britain.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. Family Resources Survey figures are for Great Britain up to 1997-98, and for the United Kingdom from 1998-99 onwards.
2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.
3. Figures have been presented on an After Housing Cost basis. For After Housing Costs, housing costs are deducted from income.
4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year.
6. Numbers of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 pensioners.
7. Proportions of pensioners in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has recently developed an online (e-learning) course on supporting victims and witnesses with mental health issues (as well as learning disabilities and autism). The course was launched in August 2011 and is mandatory for all prosecutors. In addition to this training, there is detailed guidance that sets out the practice and procedure to be followed when dealing with victims and witnesses with mental health issues. There is separate guidance to assist prosecutors when deciding whether to charge an offender who has a mental disorder.</p>

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) does not carry out its own assessment of the mental health of a suspect but may receive such information from a mental health liaison and diversion schemes based at police stations or courts or from other sources such as the police, relatives or offenders' solicitors. When there is sufficient reliable information about an offender's mental health, the CPS will take this into account when making the decision whether to charge. Evidence that the defendant has a significant physical or mental illness is a factor that the CPS will take into account when deciding if a prosecution is required in the public interest. However, the defendant's health must always be balanced with the seriousness of the offence and the need to safeguard the public.</p>

 The vehicle entrance at Derby Gate is scheduled to close from November for a period of about six months while works are carried out to install the perimeter security measures. The Curtis Green entrance offers the most practical solution for vehicles access and egress during the work. As the principal vehicle entry point, improvements to the existing entrance were needed. While upgrading the entrance, the opportunity was identified to improve traffic management in the long-term when Derby Gate re-opens by establishing a one-way traffic flow system. This one-way system has been in operation since the new facility was completed in August to resolve any problems in advance of Derby Gate's temporary closure. Planning consent was required, which included an assurance that there would not be disruption to the public road network. The business case for the Curtis Green entrance improvement works was approved in accordance with set procedures. Decisions on the authorisations of works and operations are made under delegations given by the House of Commons Commission, and in line with criteria set by Member committees where appropriate. It is not the Commission's practice to publish names of individual staff who took particular decisions.</p>

 It is expected that the level of spending on trade union activities will fall because we have reduced the budget available for funding facility time in 2011-12. This is in line with other cost efficiencies we are making and reflects decreasing staff numbers in the Department. It has resulted in a reduction of full-time trade union representatives from 12 to six in core DEFRA. Further work is planned both in core DEFRA and the Executive Agencies to reduce further the number of full-time trade union representatives, and the consequential cost.</p>

I know that some local authorities have already decided to do this and as business rates are a significant aspect of a businesses operating costs, this should make a real difference to businesses.</p>

 This Government are committed to ensuring that consumers are treated fairly. At the same time, we do not want to swamp business in red tape which would force up rents and reduced the choice of accommodation for tenants. The private rented sector is an excellent example of how our approach can secure improvements in consumer protection without excessive regulatory burdens. Recent initiatives include support for the industry led SAFEagent campaign; the publication of clear, accurate fact sheets on rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants; and coupled with legislation, in the Localism Bill, to safeguard tenancy deposit protection.</p>

 The Government believe that local communities should determine their own vision for the future development of their area, setting out in their local plan which sites are most appropriate for development. The draft National Planning Policy Framework makes clear that councils should make effective use of land, allocating for development land with the least environmental and amenity value where practical. We are removing the national brownfield target, as this had a distorting effect in some areas, driving up land prices and resulting in high density, unpopular development.</p>

 It is a general principle of this Government that we will not rush into regulation where voluntary approaches to ensuring safeguards for consumers have not been properly tested and where there is little evidence to suggest that such an approach is needed. Therefore, given the paucity of evidence to suggest any problems with inventory companies that might be remedied by regulation, we have no plans to regulate this sector. Excessive regulation would push up rents and reduce the choice of accommodation for tenants.</p>

 Following the abolition in 2010-11 of local area agreements and the National Indicator Set there is no longer any general centralised collection of performance data from local authorities. The Single list of central Government data requirements from local government (the "Single Data List") published by my Department on 14 July 2011 lists all data returns that central Government expects from local government. Central Government does not distinguish between data provided to it for performance or other purposes.</p>

The Government have sought views on their proposals and, on 19 August, published eight technical papers which provide further details on the proposals, together with an interactive calculator. The calculator enables users to explore the possible effects of certain scheme design options based upon their own assumptions about local circumstances.</p>

Throughout this process the BOA's primary purpose has been to ensure that the allocations made are fair given the limited number of accreditations available.

The BOA has also agreed that regional written and photographic press who applied for accreditation should benefit from a small number of passes to be allocated on a pool basis. The distribution of these will be decided by the BOA with guidance from the Newspaper Society, in consultation with regional publishers. The  <br/>

 Local authorities have a duty (under Section 6 of the Childcare Act 2006) to ensure that there is sufficient childcare locally to meet the needs of working parents and particularly families with disabled children. We want to improve the way in which local authorities keep parents informed about what they are doing to deliver this duty.

               <a name="110913123001005"> Local authorities have told us that the requirement (under Section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006) to publish nationally prescribed sufficiency assessments every three years is burdensome. The Government considers that a local annual report would be a more effective way of enabling parents to hold their local authority to account. The Government have therefore also decided to consult on bringing forward legislation to repeal the Section 11 duty. This consultation will be published on the Department for Education's website later in the autumn.</p>

 The English Baccalaureate is designed to recognise the success of those pupils who attain GCSEs or established iGCSEs at grade A*-C across a core of academic subjects: English, maths, the sciences, a language and either history or geography.

 The Cancer Drugs Fund was launched on 1 April 2011. Over three years, the Fund is providing £200 million a year to help thousands of cancer patients access the drugs their clinicians believe will help them. As an interim measure, an additional £50 million was made available to strategic health authorities in 2010-11 to support improved access to cancer drugs. The funding we have made available since October 2010 has so far helped over 5,000 cancer patients in England to access the cancer drugs their clinicians recommended.</p>

1. The National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) collects information on the number of people receiving substitute prescribing interventions for substance misuse in England, but does not distinguish between methadone and other drugs such as buprenorphine which are also recommended for the treatment of drug misuse by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).
2. The National Treatment Agency took over full responsibility for managing NDTMS in 2004-05. Only the annual data from 2005-06 onwards are considered robust enough to provide detailed information about individual treatment journeys. This means that 2009-10 was the first year that robust data for those in treatment for four years or more are available.

 Departments are responsible for spending money wisely and for delivering excellent public services, and they are already delivering substantial reform programmes within their delivery chains. However, in many areas departments are unable to secure maximum value for money, and unable to reform services in the most effective manner by working in isolation.</p>

We have also established Crown Commercial Representatives, who saved over £800 million last year by renegotiating deals with some of our largest suppliers on a cross-Government basis. We are also promoting centres of excellence in departments where others are best placed to lead for the Crown. This includes the Next Generation HR shared service which DWP are delivering, and the Government's ICT strategy where elements of the implementation programme are being led by different departments.</p>

 The Reducing Bureaucracy Programme Board, chaired by Chief Constable Chris Sims, commenced its work in October 2010. The board is currently looking at the crime recording process, challenging forces to simplify their own practice. However, it is for individual forces to determine which recommendations to take forward. The board is currently evaluating the uptake of a number of its recommendations at a local level. This will be completed in October 2011.</p>

 The Prevent strategy identifies three main areas of funding: Policing and Domestic Prevent expenditure, both funded by the Home Office and Overseas Prevent expenditure, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). In 2011-12, the Home Office has allocated approximately £36 million for policing and domestic Prevent activity, and the FCO has allocated approximately £10 million for overseas activity. As delivery of the new Prevent strategy progresses, the balance of funding will be reviewed to ensure it remains proportionate to the threats we face, is targeted to deliver Prevent objectives, reaches people who are most vulnerable to radicalisation and provides value for money. We will publish an annual report on our counter-terrorism work, which will include delivery of the Prevent strategy.</p>

 We do not comment on the payment made to individual service personnel. However, the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) was reviewed by Admiral the Lord Boyce in 2010.

 After HMS Polar Circle was leased by the Ministry of Defence in November 1991 and prior to the ship's first deployment, modifications were made to the Ship's aviation, communications and hydrographic systems utilising equipment from the previous HMS Endurance where feasible. This included putting non-slip surfaces on the Ship's hangar deck, improved flight aids, improved aviation fuelling systems, encrypted satellite communication and a new echo sounder.</p>

Until its flooding in 2008, all other maintenance or refit work conducted on HMS Endurance had been anticipated and was conducted as part of the ship's routine programme.</p>

 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) set statutory requirements for firefighting standards for those employed in the merchant navy. In addition to the mandatory training provided at the merchant navy training establishment the operational role of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) is such that enhanced training is provided by the Royal Navy firefighting training facility, in order to deal with the situations they may encounter whilst deploying with our armed forces.</p>

 I and my colleagues fully recognise that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) continues to be widely acknowledged as being among the leading naval logistic support organisations in the world, integral to the Royal Navy's deployments and global presence and an important element of the wider naval service. The RFA continues to operate in the Gulf, in both the North and South Atlantic, as well as in UK waters in vital support of the UK national interests. In addition they continue to play a role in support of disaster relief operations, such as in February 2010 when RFA LARGS BAY was deployed to Haiti, delivering vital relief supplies and providing specialist capabilities to assist with the wider United Nations-led relief effort.</p>

 There is currently a wide range of incentives and regulations in place to encourage UK manufacturers to be more energy and carbon efficient. These include the EU Emissions Trading System, which is a market-based approach based on the emissions associated with historical production, Climate Change Agreements, which offer reduced levels of tax in return for meeting energy efficiency targets related to product output, and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, which uses a range of measures to drive behaviour change including robust reporting, a competitive league table and attaching a price to the carbon that businesses emit. In addition the Green Deal will enable businesses to carry out energy efficiency improvements to their buildings at no upfront cost, through a framework established by Government. This innovative financing mechanism will allow businesses to repay costs through a charge in instalments on their energy bill.</p>

The larger energy suppliers have voluntarily agreed to provide factual and neutral information on the Green Deal to their customers at key trigger points, for example when they change supplier or move into a new property. This will increase the likelihood that consumers will explore the option of installing energy efficiency measures via the Green Deal when they are making other improvements to their homes and businesses.
