 It is not possible to supply information about Prison Service spending on transporting prisoners to hospitals in London, without it being at a disproportionate cost. This is because the cost of transporting prisoners to hospital is not calculated discretely but forms part of wider costs for hospital escorts and bedwatches which are divided between the relevant prison and the relevant primary care trust. These costs consist of both the actual vehicle cost (a taxi, ambulance or prison vehicle) and staffing costs (staffing levels for escorts to hospital are determined based on the risk posed by the prisoner).</p>

As the details of these arrangements are being discussed with partners, we have made no assessment of the number of small businesses likely to engage in reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="110207w0001.htm_para13"><a name="11020713000241">The Government are also committed to wider measures to address the barriers that women face in the workplace, including women working for small businesses. These include making pay secrecy clauses unenforceable, extending the right to request flexible working to all employees and consulting on a new system of parental leave. We are also taking strong action where there is evidence of discrimination, for example on equal pay.</p>

The individual may request the discontinuance of these proceedings, but otherwise the hearing under section 3(10) of the PTA will proceed.

These include the fact the figure (25) does not include cases where the section 3(10) hearing has yet to be heard, cases where the controlled individual either discontinued their proceedings or absconded from the control order before the hearing took place or cases where the Secretary of State conceded that she could not make sufficient disclosure to comply with her obligations under article 6 and so revoked the control order.</p>

The numbers given refer only to the final outcome of a review, so, for example, if a control order was upheld by the High Court but revoked on appeal, it is recorded as having been revoked. Where a High Court decision has been made and that decision is subject to an appeal (which has yet to be heard), the decision of the High Court is reflected in the figures.</p>

The Secretary of State has revoked a small number of historical control orders rather than make damaging disclosure required under article 6 (right to a fair trial), and these have not been included as having been upheld or rejected by the courts because the reviews were not completed. (The figures also exclude interim procedural hearings that have taken place, such as case management and disclosure hearings-at which no substantive decision on the control order was made).</p>

 Immigration Act powers of detention are not time limited.

The length of those periods will vary between individual cases depending on their particular circumstances. Where a person seeks to frustrate their removal from the UK their detention may be prolonged as a consequence; the courts have upheld this position.</p>

2011. A copy has been placed in the House Library and is available on the Home Office website. The review found that pre-charge police bail was unlikely to be a substitute for extended pre-charge detention. While the review considered that there could be merit in granting bail to terrorist suspects before charge, there would be risks for public safety in releasing terrorist suspects when the nature and extent of their involvement in terrorism was still being investigated. We are not, therefore, intending to enable bail to be granted to terrorist suspects before charge.</p>

The Government's trade policy unit will be supporting WTO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to prepare for the Global Aid for Trade Review in July 2011.

This follows a similar exercise undertaken over the Christmas period which resulted in a saving of 31% (43 tonnes of CO2) over a similar period in December in the Department's offices at Marsham street. We also continue to work with our facilities management providers to identify any further opportunities to make carbon savings within the target window. It is also our intention to use Climate Week to trial different ways of controlling the heating and cooling of our main buildings, to demonstrate what savings can be made if we change the way buildings are operated. Any additional initiatives will concentrate primarily on behavioural change due to the close proximity of the target end date.</p>

 The WCA is a functional assessment-it is not based on someone's diagnosis or health condition but on their functional capability.

Constituencies used are for the Westminster Parliament of May 2010.  3. Percentage population figures have been calculated using General Register Office for Scotland population estimates as at 2008 for working age claimants, i.e. males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59.  4. State pension age: The age at which women reach state pension age will gradually increase from 60 to 65 between April 2010 and April 2020. This will introduce a small increase to the number of working age benefit recipients and a small reduction to the number of pension age recipients. As percentages were required this table has been prepared using males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59 and will therefore not match published figures.  5. Statistical group is a hierarchical variable. A person who fits into more than one category will appear only in the top-most one for which they are eligible. For example a claimant of disability living allowance and jobseeker's allowance would appear in "Job seeker", not in "Disabled".  6. Lone parents are defined as claimants on income support with child under 16 and no partner. Lone parent obligations were introduced from 24 November 2008 affecting the age of the youngest child.  7. From November 2008 the "incapacity benefits group" includes employment and support allowance (ESA). ESA replaced incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008. Prior to this the "incapacity benefits group" referred to claimants of incapacity benefit (including credits only) or severe disablement allowance including people claiming IS on the grounds of incapacity.  8. Caseload figures used for AA, CA and DLA include those cases with entitlement but where payment is currently suspended (for example, because of an extended stay in hospital or an overlapping benefit).  9. The key benefits which are currently included in the working-age client group data are: Bereavement benefit Carer's allowance Disability living allowance Incapacity benefit Severe disablement allowance Income support (including pension credit for males aged 60 to 64) Jobseeker's allowance Widow's benefit.  <i> Source:</i>  DWP Information Directorate 100% WPLS.

 Entry to university is and should be competitive. Universities offer places on the basis of merit. Inevitably, not all applicants will gain a place. Many of these applicants will, however, be successful in subsequent years. A strong demand for places was expected this year so universities will be able to recruit the same number of new students in 2011 as in 2010. In addition, this Government have already expanded the alternatives to university, by providing 50,000 new places on apprenticeships, for which there is rising employer demand. Our reforms will also make part-time university study more accessible.</p>

 Latest emissions projections, published in June 2010, show that the UK is on track to meet its 2020 target, and has already reduced emissions by over 26% against 1990 levels, taking into account the effects of emissions trading. Additional policies to be implemented by the Government, such as the Green Deal, support for the world's first commercial scale CCS demonstration, and the roll-out of smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress.
