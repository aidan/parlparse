<a name="11030w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the cost of the retrospective recognition of pre-1975 military service for pension purposes.  [10433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Before 1975, and currently, pensions were awarded to Service personnel who completed at least 22 years' reckonable service (or 16 years' reckonable service in the case of officers). Gratuities were awarded to those who did not qualify for a pension but had completed 12 years' reckonable service (or nine years in the case of officers).
<P>

<a name="11030w01.html_para0">It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that changes to improve benefits from public service pension schemes should normally be implemented from a current date for future service only.
<P>

<a name="11030w01.html_para1">In the case of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, in order to calculate the precise cost of awarding pension rights retrospectively, my Department would have to identify and assess the potential entitlements of all service men who left service before April 1975 without completing enough service to qualify for a pension. There are probably several hundred thousand if not more than a million former service men in this category. An accurate estimate could, therefore, be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="11030w01.html_para2">None the less, we can be clear that the cost of awarding pensions retrospectively would be considerable. In addition, such a retrospection could not be applied solely to former service men, and would require a change for all public service pension schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recent assessment he has made of the overall standard of Single Living Accommodation.  [9796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The condition of Single Living Accommodation has been examined in detail to underpin decisions on the major investment programme announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 14 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 600W, in particular the Single Living Accommodation Modernisation prime contract which we plan to award by the end of 2002. Recent surveys indicate that roughly half of the Single Living Accommodation is sub-standard. The Ministry of Defence's objective is to improve all Single Living Accommodation to single bedrooms with en suite shower, wash hand basin and toilet facilities. To this end, an additional &#163;1 billion worth of investment is planned over the next 10 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress he has made in publicising and demonstrating assistance offered to veterans of the armed services by central and local government.  [10215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since my appointment as Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 14 March significant progress has been made in publicising and demonstrating the aims of the Veterans' Initiative. The Ministry of Defence has established a Veterans' Affairs Secretariat and I have chaired two meetings of the Veterans' Forum comprising the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations (COBSEO) executive committee members, and officials from Government Departments with an interest in veterans' affairs. I also chaired the first meeting of the Forum in Plenary session on 16 October, which was attended by 158 delegates from veterans' organisations, welfare providers and pressure groups. The Plenary programme included a presentation from the DTLR's National Housing Federation which gave veterans advice on how to get the most out of the "Supporting People" initiative currently being taken forward by local government. The Veterans' Forum has fully endorsed the Strategic Action Plan to take forward the Veterans' Initiative and I will now present the plan to my ministerial colleagues at the Veterans' Task Force on 6 November.
<P>

<a name="11030w01.html_para3">A short press release was issued after each forum meeting and minutes of forum and task force meetings, including a copy of the Strategic Action Plan, have been widely circulated among the veterans' community and are available on the MOD website: http://www.mod.uk/vau

 At approximately 7.15 am local time on Friday 19 October, a HIND helicopter belonging to the Sierra Leone armed forces crashed about fives miles south west of Kenema, Sierra Leone. Regrettably, a British Army Officer, Major Vanessa Lang, sustained head injuries in the crash, and subsequently died of her injuries in hospital in Kenema. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I extend our deep condolences to Major Lang's family.
<P>

<a name="11030w02.html_para2">Major Lang was working from the British Military Headquarters in Freetown as a media adviser to the Sierra Leone armed forces. She was travelling in the helicopter to provide advice to the Sierra Leone Army on their information strategy in relation to a planned border security operation. The other five occupants of the helicopter included a British Non-Commissioned Officer and an Australian Major: none received serious injuries in the accident. British accident investigators are assisting the Government of Sierra Leone in the investigation into the precise cause of the accident.

 Firearms licensing in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Chief Constable under the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 and is generally more restrictive than in Great Britain. For example, all firearms, including shotguns and air guns, require a firearm certificate. The Chief Constable shall not permit a person to hold a firearm certificate unless he is satisfied of certain statutory criteria&#151;that a person is not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm and that the requirements in respect of fitness, good reason and public safety have been met.

 Part three of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 applies to services to the public provided by local authorities. Where access to a service is impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled person, a local authority will be under a duty to make a reasonable adjustment to the way the service is provided. This might involve providing British Sign Language interpretation for a deaf person.

 The World Food Programme's monthly target for food delivery into Afghanistan is 52,000 metric tonnes. WFP is trucking food to Afghanistan by land routes from neighbouring countries. It continues to make progress on increasing the supply of food to Afghanistan, but obstacles do remain.
<P>

<a name="11030w04.html_para11">In addition to the physical challenges of distributing food to distant villages on poor roads, obstacles include: a lack of hauliers willing to undertake the work; local NGO staff unable to show up for work to oversee secondary distribution; limited communication with local staff; and the fact that case load lists are becoming outdated due to further population displacement. The fear of harassment and looting of supplies by some elements of the Taliban is further compounding an already difficult situation.
<P>

<a name="11030w04.html_para12">We are doing all we can to support WFP in overcoming these obstacles, so that food delivery can continue to increase now and over the winter.

 The Department for International Development did not make any contribution to the World Food Programme (WFP) for North Korea in the last financial year.

This included &#163;200,000 through World Vision for restoring the food production capacity of six co-operative farms under the United Nations Development Programme's Agricultural Recovery and Environmental Protection Programme.

 The World Food Programme (WFP) is the only multilateral agency involved in the distribution of food aid in North Korea, apart from a small input through UNICEF. WFP's food aid programme is targeted at vulnerable groups including children under five, primary and secondary school children, orphans and children in other health institutions, pregnant women and the elderly. WFP work only in provinces to which they have access (currently 167 out of a total of 211). This is essential for carrying out assessments of need, and to undertake monitoring.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2001]:</i> The Government strongly support Enterprise Insight, a 10-year private sector-led national campaign for enterprise. The campaign is led jointly by the British Chambers of Commerce, Confederation of British Industry and Institute of Directors in partnership with enterprise programme providers including Young Enterprise, Shell LiveWIRE and the Prince's Trust. Its aim is to promote enterprise by fostering an entrepreneurial spirit across the UK through four key initiatives: Enterprising Education, Enterprising Communities, Enterprising Media and Enterprising Business.
<P>

<a name="11030w05.html_para11">The first step started with the launch of the Enterprising Education campaign in July 2001. Since its launch, 246 businesses have registered their interest in promoting enterprise within schools. A further 750 are expected to 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2001 : Column: 583W</I><P>
do so by 2002. The aim over the next two years is to get 40,000 more young people engaged in enterprise learning in schools and 5,000 new business people to support its delivery. This will be achieved through a number of activities including roadshows and the development of a website enabling businesses to register their interest online. In addition, the Entrepreneurs in Residence scheme, which matches businesses to local enterprise projects, is under way and the first five matches have already been made.
<P>

<a name="11030w05.html_para12">Enterprise Insight also aims to promote enterprise positively across society and, in particular, plans to work with the media, using case studies and role models, to help spread knowledge about entrepreneurship and business.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry by what date she expects Norway will be unable to meet further UK demand for gas; and if she will make a statement.  [9052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Demand for gas is dependent on a number of factors, including energy prices, GDP growth and the impact of other measures such as the Climate Change Programme. Future demand levels are therefore uncertain and, consequently, the extent to which the UK will need to import gas from Norway or elsewhere cannot be accurately predicted. Against that background, current best estimates are that the UK is likely to become a net importer from around 2005&#150;06 with the possibility of 90 per cent. of the UK's gas being imported by 2020.
<P>

<a name="11030w06.html_para8">Figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate show that Norway has about 2,100bcm of remaining discovered gas resources in the North Sea and expects to be able to produce at least 90bcm of gas a year until 2050. The extent to which those resources might be available to meet further UK demand will depend on a number of variable factors, including movements in gas and oil prices, which may affect the anticipated level of production; any growth in Norway's domestic demand for gas; competition for Norway's gas from other purchasers in Europe and elsewhere; and the availability of capacity in infrastructure linking Norwegian supplies to the UK. Although there will be a point at which Norwegian gas will be unable to meet further UK demand, it is difficult to give a meaningful estimate of when that might be.
<P>

<a name="11030w06.html_para9">I am, however, fully aware of the need to secure longer term security of supply from a range of sources and this is one of the issues under consideration as part of the Performance and Innovation Unit's current review of energy policy.

 Universal banking services consist of two elements, namely access to the financial institutions' basic bank accounts at post offices and a Post Office Card Account (POCA) for the encashment of benefit and tax credits for those unable or unwilling to use even a basic bank account. The banking industry will meet the costs of providing post office access to their own accounts. The cost of the POCA, which will be met by Government, together with a fixed contribution from the financial institutions, is subject to commercial negotiations between Consignia and the Paying Departments and between Consignia and the potential supplier of the banking engine for POCA. The estimate of costs are confidential under

<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department does not collate statistics on fly tipping. The Government's review of the tax in March 1998, led by HM Customs and Excise, showed that out of 530 local authorities, only 78 felt that there had been an increase in fly tipping since the introduction of the tax.
<P>

<a name="11030w08.html_para1">In addition, a Tidy Britain group report, "Effects of the Landfill Tax on Flytipping" (published in 1998), did not establish a clear link between the tax and increased fly tipping. The report showed for 1997&#150;98 that domestic waste was, overall, the type of fly-tipped waste most frequently collected by local authorities. The landfill tax would not make a difference to such waste as householders do not directly meet increases in the cost of the tax.

 The regulations will be introduced as soon as possible once the necessary preparatory work has been completed. New sections 118B (special extinguishment order) and 119B (special diversion order) of the Highways Act 1980, to be inserted by schedule 6 to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, require an order to be made by the Secretary of State prior to commencement. The order must designate the areas where the power to make special extinguishment and special diversion orders, for the purposes of crime prevention, will be available to local highway authorities. The exercise of the power in relation to school security will apply throughout England.

 DEFRA is funding a great deal of work in relation to BSE in sheep. This includes experiments to assess susceptibility, infectivity and possible transmission in sheep, particularly in relation to different genotypes and breeds. This work will underpin the national scrapie plan.
<P>

<a name="11030w08.html_para3">At their meeting in September 2001, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee reviewed the latest data from the current programme of strain typing work to assess whether BSE is present in the current sheep flock. To date, about 180 individual scrapie brains have been inoculated into mice. Results for 163 brains have reached a point where the mice might have been expected to display signs characteristic of BSE, if the disease was present. This has not happened. However, it is too soon to draw firm conclusions from these on-going experiments. Work is also in hand to develop molecular methods of differentiating BSE from scrapie to enable many more brains to be screened rapidly.
<P>

<a name="11030w08.html_para4">During the development of a molecular method at Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), 460 sheep brains have been screened. None has indicated the presence of BSE, but the test is not yet fully validated and it is therefore too early to draw firm conclusions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The England rural development programme already allocates funding for conversion to organic farming, which would triple the organic area by 2006. We intend to produce a strategy for the future direction of organic farming when we have the report of the Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, taking account of any recommendations it makes for this sector. The strategy will assess potential growth both for UK production and for the organic market, and will need to take account of the large variation between different products. It is likely, for example, that UK production of organic fruit and vegetables can take a significantly higher share of the market for these products, while the scope for increasing organic milk production will be much more limited given the relatively slow growth of this market.

 The new statutory right of access to open countryside will open up new areas of land close to where people live.

We are also encouraging local authorities to develop and promote public transport links for people wishing to go to the countryside.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action has been taken in respect of allegations made by the "Newsnight" programme on 3 July concerning the dioxin content of ash used for construction from the Edmonton incinerator; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="11030w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify the answers I gave on 11 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 496&#150;97W, and on 27 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 565W. Until August 2000, the Edmonton incinerator mixed bottom ash and precipitator ash. From August 1998 to May 1999, this mixed ash was reprocessed and used in the production of concrete building blocks. This ash has also been used as an aggregate.
<P>

<a name="11030w09.html_para0">As the reply to the first of these two questions said, neither the Department nor the Environment Agency routinely held information on the dioxin content of ash from incinerators. However, in July 1998 the Environment Agency was given an estimate of the dioxin content of the mixed ash, based on a 1997 analysis of the fly ash. I was not advised about this when I replied to the second of these questions and regret any consequent inaccuracy in my answer. I have written to both Members and have placed a copy of the letter and the analysis in the fax in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="11030w09.html_para1">The Environment Agency is currently carrying out a full and thorough investigation into the destination of ash from incinerators, the environmental implications of its use and what steps may be needed in the light of these findings.

<P>
<a name="11030w09.html_wqn5"><B> Adam Price: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the economic state of the tourism sectors in <i>(a)</i> Wales, <i>(b)</i> Scotland, <i>(c)</i> Northern Ireland and <i>(d)</i> England; and what measures she is proposing to assist the tourism industry.  [9848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w09.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 According to the most recent estimates, total tourism expenditure in the UK is worth some &#163;75 billion and the value added by tourism in the UK is now estimated to be 5 per cent. of GDP.
<P>

<a name="11030w09.html_para9">For the English tourism industry, our best estimate to date is that the loss of revenue in 2001&#150;02 is likely to be about &#163;3.3 billion in 'value added' terms over the eight month period consideration (March to October) of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. Further losses are expected as a result of the terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September. Individual tourism assessments for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are matters for the devolved Administrations.

<P>

<a name="11030w09.html_para10">Government and the industry recognise that the challenges facing tourism both for the short and long term must be tackled. Ministers have worked hard with the industry in particular to lessen the impact of foot and mouth disease and the terrorist attacks on the United States, and to attract visitors to Britain. The Government have provided additional funding to help the recovery of domestic tourism and to promote Britain overseas. The industry is taking the lead in improving the quality of product and service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w10.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 In 2000&#150;01 the Government provided &#163;24.9 million in grant-in-aid for the Tate Gallery of which &#163;5 million was to cover the first 10 months of free admission at Tate Modern. In 2001&#150;02 we increased this to &#163;26.9 million of which &#163;6 million is to enable free admission to continue at Tate Modern.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to encourage concessionary admission for pensioners to galleries and museums in the UK.  [10267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Our policy is to encourage all museums and galleries to offer the widest possible access to their collections but it is for their governing bodies to offer concessionary admission for pensioners.
<P>

<a name="11030w10.html_para0">In the case of the national museums and galleries funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport that currently charge, funds have been made available to permit free access for people over 60 since April 2000. However, decisions on admission charges rest with the Trustees. Attendances by people over 60 have risen by 40 per cent. in the first year since free admission was introduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 For the financial year 2000&#150;01, the Television Licensing Authority sent 16,602,766 mail items to households that were not recorded as holding television licences. This does not include reminder letters which were sent to households where the licence was about to expire or had just expired.
<P>

<a name="11030w10.html_para1">The cost of this type of mailing is not readily available. The Corporation finds direct mailing the most cost- effective way of contacting television licence fee payers and seeks to maximise, wherever possible, bulk discounts with Royal Mail.

 Since 1 January 1997 the Heritage Lottery Fund has received 28 funding applications relating to projects within the Stoke-on-Trent unitary authority area. 15 of these were made by the authority itself, of which 14 were approved and one withdrawn.

 The international consensus is strong and deep. The United Nations, OIC, the G8, NATO and the European Union have all condemned the terrorist attacks. We have encountered an unprecedented level of solidarity and commitment to work together against terrorism.

<a name="11030w10.html_para5">This is not simply a military campaign.

To ask the Prime Minister further to his reply of 15 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 818&#150;19W, on the Prime Minister's powers, if he will list the 50 specific references in statute to Prime Ministerial powers.  [10546]<P>

<a name="11030w13.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I am in close contact with the US on all aspects of the response to the 11 September attacks, including at the military planning level.
<P>

<a name="11030w13.html_para2">The cluster bombs used in Afghanistan do not contain anti-personnel landmines and are therefore legitimate weapons which have not been prohibited by any treaty or convention. They are used with discretion and proportionality as international law requires, and against legitimate and appropriate terrorist and military targets that are selected with great care.

<P>

<a name="11030w13.html_para3">The Immigration Appellate Authority allowed five appeals (to nearest five) from Afghan nationals in 1998. Data on appeal outcomes by nationality are not available for 1999, 2000, or 2001. Mechanisms are now in place to enable the production of such statistics for 2001, but their publication is pending data quality checks to guarantee their reliability.

 Mr. Tuysug's outstanding application was not considered, as unfortunately his Home Office file could not be located despite an exhaustive search.

 In the light of evidence that some asylum applicants are falsely posing as nationals from countries with high grants rates of asylum or exceptional leave, we have decided to undertake a language analysis pilot at the start of November 2001.
<P>

<a name="11030w15.html_para1">The purpose of language analysis is to provide expert evidence which helps to identify the place of origin of asylum seekers. Language analysis is used in a number of European countries and the results are generally successful. We will be piloting the scheme to see how well language analysis works in the United Kingdom, and for the purposes of the pilot we will be covering asylum seekers of three nationalities where we believe the problem of false nationality claims to be most pronounced. Those nationalities are Afghanistan, Somalia and Sri Lanka.
<P>

<a name="11030w15.html_para2">The authorisation made by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Rooker will enable staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, where there are objective reasons for doubting the nationality of a person claiming to be from one of these three countries, to request them to undertake a further interview which will be taped and sent to a language expert for analysis. Individuals may refuse to consent to this further interview, but this refusal can be taken into account when determining whether the applicant has established the facts of their case. This may lead to their claim being refused.
<P>

<a name="11030w15.html_para3">We will review the need for this authorisation once the pilot has been completed. In addition, the race monitor to be appointed under section 19E of the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) will report to Parliament via the Secretary of State on the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and on how they are operated in practice by officials.
<P>

<a name="11030w15.html_para4">A copy of the additional authorisation has been placed in the Library. Any future additional or amended authorisations will also be placed in the Library.

 To date, the police have undertaken suspected fraud investigations into three providers resulting in a total of 29 arrests. They are also investigating one other provider's ILA activities following their arrest in connection with a suspected fraud on an unrelated matter. In addition, the Department's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) continues to investigate a further 29 providers. Police are in the early stages of investigating suspected fraud by two of these and have expressed an initial interest in another nine providers.

 Our investigations into the practices of some learning providers have revealed low-quality learning provision and poor value for money as well as a number of marketing practices which are unacceptable. Individual Learning Account holders have reported many of these instances to us and to Trading Standards Officers, as have other learning providers who did not want to see an innovative, progressive and successful initiative being exploited.

 We are working closely with individuals, learning providers, local Trading standards Officers, the Individual Learning Account (ILA) Centre and the police to identify and fully investigate all potential abuses of the ILA scheme. We are also writing to all 2.5 million individual learning account holders to inform them of the withdrawal of the scheme, and any additional allegations of abuse we receive as a result will be investigated.

 In July of this year, the Department started to receive increasing numbers of complaints from individuals and local Trading Standards Officers. In response the Department took action to tighten up the ILA system to address these problems. We re-registered all learning providers, withdrew blank application forms, suspended all new provider registrations, introduced a revised learning provider agreement that made it harder for providers to act against the ethos of the programme, and made changes to the applications process, for the same purpose. Everyone who opened an ILA received a copy of 'Choosing Your Learning', explaining the full range of options in using their ILA. However, it became clear that these changes were not sufficient by themselves to prevent the mis-selling of ILAs. At that point we decided we had no option other than to withdraw the programme.

 The White Paper "Schools achieving success" said that we wish to welcome faith schools, with their distinctive ethos and character, into the maintained sector where there is clear local agreement. Local education authorities cannot establish schools with a religious character. Current guidance to School Organisation Committees (which decide proposals and on which the local education authority is represented) will be revised to ensure that proposals from promoters of new faith schools are given the same consideration as other proposals for new schools. Guidance on the factors to be considered in deciding whether there is a need for a new school more generally is given in the Guidance on Statutory Proposals which will be updated as necessary. We will also issue guidance to local education authorities about the new arrangements for inviting proposals when they consider that a new secondary school is required that is not to replace existing provision. Such proposals will be decided by the Secretary of State and may include proposals for church and other faith schools.

 There is no rule on the permitted level of surplus places. The focus of all our policies is raising educational standards. In planning school provision, local education authorities should look for opportunities for removing surplus capacity, with a view to bringing supply and demand for school places into better balance. Their initial focus should be on those schools with 25 per cent. or more of their places unfilled, having particular regard to standards at those schools. The overall aim should be to maximise parental preference and to provide good quality education in the most cost-effective way. The Department's annual survey of surplus places allows us to monitor how local education authorities are meeting this challenge.

 The climate change levy will raise an estimated &#163;1 billion a year, all of which will be recycled back to business through cuts in employers' national insurance contributions and support for energy efficiency. While the levy is broadly revenue neutral across manufacturing and service sectors, it is not possible to say exactly what effect the levy will have on any specific sector or industry.

It will be charged at &#163;1.60 per tonne on the commercial exploitation of primary aggregates in the UK, including those imported from abroad. Aggregates exported from the UK will be exempt.
<P>

<a name="11030w18.html_para0">A full regulatory impact assessment was published at the time of Budget 2000.
<P>

<a name="11030w18.html_para1">It is envisaged that a higher price of primary aggregate will provide an incentive to make better use of recycled aggregates and other alternatives, and more efficient use of primary aggregate. The impact on the actual costs to the end user will be dependent on the commercial decisions of those in the supply chain.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question on local area estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head (10789). I am replying in his absence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not produce estimates of GDP per head for the geographical breakdown requested. Instead, estimates are produced by Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS) areas. There are five levels of NUTS in the UK and GDP estimates are produced for the first three. NUTS level 3 is the geography that is most closely aligned to county councils, unitary authority and metropolitan areas and is also the lowest geographical level that data are available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>GDP is a workplace measure of economic activity in a given area regardless of whether the persons engaged in the activity live in that area. GDP per head is calculated by using the resident population in the area. In the absence of another indicator this has been used as a measure of well being at the sub-regional and local area level. However, a better measure would be household income per head as this would be a truly residence based measure. This is not currently available but the ONS is planning to produce estimates of household disposable income for sub-region and local area in early 2002.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates of GDP per head and GDP per head as a proportion of the NUTS level 3 area with the highest GDP per head (Inner London-West) are shown in the following table. The GDP per head for Inner London - West is much larger than any other area due to the high amount of commerce in the area and a fairly small resident population in comparison, which makes proportionate comparisons on this basis more difficult. For this reason, I have additionally provided a third column, showing the same data on our more usual basis of comparison, GDP per head expressed as a ratio to the UK average. Some NUTS level 3 areas correspond exactly to county council boundaries and these are marked with the letters cc.</FONT></UL>

These estimates are based on the results of regular sample surveys of employers which count the number of employee jobs. Data on self-employment are obtained from the Labour Force Survey. An individual with two jobs would count twice in these figures: in order to avoid double-counting, the percentages are related to total workforce jobs rather than the UK population.

 The Banking Code sets standards of banking practice for banks and building societies when they are dealing with all personal customers, including pensioners. The Chancellor set up the independent Banking Services Consumer Codes Review Group last year. As part of its work the group examined how banks treat individuals in financial difficulties. The group reported in May 2001 and recommended revisions to the Code to ensure consumers in financial difficulty are dealt with appropriately. The financial services industry is already taking forward work to revise this part of the Code.

 Article 9 of the Council Decision, of 29 September 2000, on the system of the European Communities' own resources replaces Article 10 of the Decision of 28 October 1994. Like the Article it replaces, this simply allows the European Commission to undertake a review of their own resources system and to put forward proposals for modifying the system if necessary. What modifications the European Commission will choose to consider at the time is, of course, a matter for them. However, it will remain the case that any proposals for modifying the system of own resources which they decide to put forward would then have to be considered, and agreed, by all member states unanimously.

 <i>[holding answer 16 October 2001]:</i> Where an overpayment has arisen as a result of a claimant's misrepresentation or failure to disclose a change of circumstances, section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 allows recovery of that overpayment. This covers most of the overpayments we seek to recover. However, there are also other regulations permitting recovery of overpayments, for example, where means-tested benefits are overpaid due to the late payment of income or other benefits.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para2">The Department's policy is to obtain recovery of the sum overpaid as quickly as possible, and by the most cost-effective method, without causing hardship.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para3">Where the person overpaid receives benefit, deductions can be made from future payments of that benefit. The Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1998 place restrictions on those deductions, including limits on the amount which can be deducted from certain benefits. The regulations allow higher rates of recovery to be made in cases of fraud.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para4">For those not in receipt of benefit, voluntary arrangements are sought in the first instance. Where voluntary arrangements are unsuccessful or break down, civil proceedings will be considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Government believe that all those who are unable to work, for whatever reason, should have the opportunity to play as full a part in the community as possible. In "Towards Inclusion", our response to the Disability Rights Task Force, we set out proposals for improving disabled people's lives&#151;whether or not they can work&#151;in areas including education, transport, health and social services. Taken together, these measures will create a much fairer and inclusive society for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para5">From April 2001, we introduced a package of changes, providing extra help for disabled people in greatest need. For severely disabled people who cannot work and are receiving Income Support, the Disability Income Guarantee ensures an income of at least &#163;142 a week for a single person aged 25 or over and &#163;186.80 for a couple. It also benefits families on low incomes who are caring for a severely disabled child. In addition, from last April, we increased the disabled child premium in income- related benefits to &#163;30 a week&#151;substantially more than the normal uprating.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para6">Sick or disabled young people who have never been able to work and pay National Insurance contributions will in future be able to receive a higher level of support from access to Incapacity Benefit. Those aged under 20 on 6 April 2001 and receiving Severe Disablement Allowance will transfer to the long-term rate of Incapacity Benefit from April 2002, providing an increase of &#163;27.60 a week at current rates.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para7">We are also introducing changes to the Vaccine Damage Payments Act 1979, by means of a Regulatory Reform Order, to extend significantly the time limit for making a claim, and to reduce the level of disability necessary for a claim to succeed. Those severely disabled people whose claims were previously disallowed for being over the current time limit and under the disability threshold will be able to make a fresh claim.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para8">On 28 February 2001 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced that a National Service Framework would be developed for long-term conditions, and that this would have a particular focus on the needs of people disabled by neurological disease and brain and spinal injuries.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para9">Last year, the Government announced a package of measures to enhance the current social security provision for carers, worth more than &#163;500 million over a three-year period. From April 2001, we increased the carer premium in the income-related benefits by &#163;10 a week above the normal uprating. We also helped those carers who can

<P><I>30 Oct 2001 : Column: 646W</I><P>
undertake some work, by increasing the earnings limit in Invalid Care Allowance from &#163;50 to &#163;72 a week: in future the carers' earnings limit will be increased in line with the lower earnings level for National Insurance contributions. We plan to amend the law, by means of a Regulatory Reform Order, to allow people aged 65 and over to claim Invalid Care Allowance, and to extend entitlement for up to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para10">For those who may have difficulties with child care, the Government have already introduced a new child care tax credit in Working Families Tax Credit, and will continue to help working families meet the costs of child care.
<P>

<a name="11030w21.html_para11">The Government are committed to providing an accessible public transport system in which disabled people will have the same opportunities to travel as everyone else. Accessibility regulations for new trains, buses and coaches have been introduced under Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Similar regulations for taxis are planned. The 10-Year Transport Plan introduced a new commitment to ensuring that access for disabled people is a condition of all new public investment in transport.

 The Equitable Life Assurance Society and the Scottish Widows' Fund and Life Assurance Society were appointed as AVC providers for the civil service by the Treasury in December 1988. Responsibility for the civil service additional voluntary contribution scheme transferred to the Cabinet Office on 1 April 1995 under the Transfer of Functions (Treasury and the Minister for the Civil Service) Order 1995, SI 1995/269. The continuing suitability of both providers for investment under the civil service AVC scheme is subject to regular review by the Cabinet Office taking account of expert professional advice. Bacon and Woodrow are the appointed civil service AVC scheme advisers to the Cabinet Office.
<P>

<a name="11030w22.html_para0">Member of the civil service pension scheme are provided with a wide choice of AVC investments. Both providers offered a with-profits investment route; a deposit based fund; and unit linked investment through a wide range of investment funds. There are approximately 6,800 active contributing civil service AVC members with Equitable Life and 8,800 members with Scottish Widows.

 We are implementing a range of measures to improve recruitment and retention in the National Health Service for all staff, including in London. Examples include investing in fair pay, encouraging the NHS to become a better employer, increasing training commissions for all professional groups, providing additional funding to support those undertaking a return to practice programme, and supporting more effective, collaborative international recruitment where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="11030w22.html_para3">For example, between April 2001 and the end of September 2001, 138 mental health and learning disabilities nurses returned to the NHS, 18 of these were in London.

 In the financial year 2000&#150;01, the Department spent &#163;573,000 on the mind out for mental health campaign. &#163;900,000 is allocated to the campaign in the year 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="11030w22.html_para7">The mind out for mental health campaign is a sustained programme of activity with partners in the voluntary sector, the media and business working together to change attitudes and behaviour surrounding mental health. Through such partnerships (both on a national and local level), and through high profile communications and events, mind out for mental health is reaching out to key audiences. For example, mind out for mental health is working with UK Youth, the Guides and the Scouts to develop an activity pack to help groups explore mental health issues. It is also working with journalist colleges in the development of training seminars and packs for student journalists. In addition, a stop the stigma information pack has been developed for individuals or local groups&#151;a step by step guide to planning effective action to help change attitudes towards those with mental health problems. A copy of this action pack has been placed in the Library.

<a name="11030w22.html_para8">"Working Minds" is the employer programme of mind out for mental health. This part of the campaign works in partnership with employers to create positive shifts in workplace attitudes and behaviour surrounding mental health. Its objectives are far greater than helping people with mental health problems to find employment; the programme seeks to bring about a fundamental, long-term change in employers' policy and practice so that people with mental health problems are able to participate fully in the workplace.

There is, however, marked variation in use with some authorities being more proactive. The reasons for variation in use of the order and further exploration of the outcome and satisfaction with the use of guardianship is being explored in the second phase of the study. We expect to receive a report on the second phase work in the next month.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what has been <i>(a)</i> the total cost to the NHS of treatment under 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2001 : Column: 655W</I><P>
the concordat with the private sector, <i>(b)</i> the average cost of treatment per patient and <i>(c)</i> the average cost of similar treatment as in (b) above in the NHS.  [10635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Contracts agreed under the concordat are signed at the local level and the Department does not have complete information on expenditure. &#163;20 million was made available to the national health service to purchase treatment in the private sector last winter, which funded just over 10,500 cases, for example an average cost per case of approximately &#163;1,900. However, in the absence of information on the mix of cases this figure is not particularly meaningful.
<P>

<a name="11030w24.html_para6">The Department has recently surveyed NHS health authorities and trusts on their use of the private sector. Analysis is not yet complete.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact on delayed discharges in acute hospitals of treatment under the concordat with the private sector.  [10490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Treatments provided under concordat arrangements will generally take patients off existing national health service waiting lists for elective surgery. I am not aware of any adverse impact on delayed discharges in acute hospitals as a result of patients receiving treatment under the concordat.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Burns: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many patients have been treated under the concordat with the private sector since its implementation.  [10492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Between 1 November 2000 and 30 September 2001 there were 64,136 national health service funded elective cases in the private sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w24.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what was the extent of bed blocking in each health authority and trust at the most recent available date; what was the basis on which the social services authorities with the most serious bed blocking problem, requiring extra priority allocations were identified; and for what reason the Newcastle city and North Tyneside borough social services authorities were not on the priority list.  [10933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11030w24.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The latest figures on delayed discharges for each health authority and National Health Service trust are shown in the table. The decision on which councils should receive extra help was taken on the basis of the councils with the highest rate of delayed discharge and also councils, which the Department has identified as needing extra help through our performance monitoring arrangements. Newcastle city and North Tyneside borough social services did not meet these criteria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has received from the National Blood Service of the effect on the number of blood donors of testing for vCJD; and what plans he has to ensure the supply of blood to non-emergency patients who require transfusions as part of their treatments.

 The Department is currently working with the National Blood Service on contingency plans related to the screening of blood donors for vCJD and the impact this could have on the blood supply.

<a name="11030w24.html_para7">In parallel with the four United Kingdom Health Departments alongside the National Audit Office and the National Blood Transfusion Services, the UK Chief Medical Officers sponsored a conference on better blood transfusion on 29 October. The aim of the conference is to help set the priorities for blood transfusion in the national health service for the coming three to five years including the more efficient and effective use of blood so that we ensure the supply of blood to all patients who require transfusions as part of their treatment.
