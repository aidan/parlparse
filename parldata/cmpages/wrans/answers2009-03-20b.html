 The Ministry of Justice collects statistics on the number of finds under the Treasure Act 1996 reported to coroners in England and Wales during each calendar year, the number of treasure inquests concluded during the year and, of these, the number of verdicts of treasure returned. Information is not collected on the time taken to conduct treasure inquests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90320w0001.htm_para0"><a name="09032041000188">Informal figures are collated by the British Museum, which record the time between the inquest being requested by the British Museum and a verdict being returned. However, these figures only relate to treasure inquests which have been requested since 2006. The figures do not include inquests which were requested in earlier years, and so they do not reveal the longest time taken for treasure inquests which were concluded in each of the last three years. The British Museum figures show that the current longest-running ongoing treasure inquest was requested by them in March 2007.</p>

 Get Safe Online is a joint public and private sector initiative to raise awareness of internet safety. Its work includes not only a website but community events, educational publicity campaigns, roundtable discussions and conferences as well as general PR and marketing activity to reach a broad audience and help inform general internet users of how to go online safely and with confidence. Research carried out in November 2008 showed that 22 per cent. of people were spontaneously aware of Get Safe Online. www.getsafeonline.org currently has over 291,000 links on the Internet compared to its US counterpart www.staysafeonline.info which has 11,000 links. The research also highlights an improvement in steps people are taking to prevent themselves falling victim to online crime such as a decrease in the number of people opening e-mail attachments from unknown sources and an increase in those updating their software, although it is difficult to directly attribute this to the campaign activity.</p>

Medical practitioners are required to complete the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) to the best of their knowledge and belief. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to death to be recorded, and medical practitioners and coroners are not supposed to record all of the diseases or conditions present at or before death. Whether a condition contributed is a matter for their clinical judgment. The MCCD is not designed to collect information on risk factors or exposures related to the development of disease, such as smoking behaviour.</p>

 The General Dental Council (GDC) has introduced a requirement for dentists and dental care professionals to undertake regular continuing professional development (CPD) to maintain their registration. We have not commissioned research in respect of CPD, but we expect the GDC's requirement to develop into a revalidation scheme where by health professionals would be required to keep up to date with advances in medical and dental science. The White Paper Trust Assurance and Safety&#151;The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century stated:</p>

Public and professional opinion has moved on in the course of this debate, from a position where trust alone was sufficient guarantee of fitness to practise, to one where that trust needs to be underpinned by objective assurance. Public opinion surveys suggest that people expect health professionals to participate in the revalidation of their registration and that many believe this takes place every year."</p>

 Primary care trusts' (PCTs) target revenue allocations are made on the basis of a fair funding formula, recommended by the independent Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, that directs funding towards areas of greatest need.</p>

At the start of 2009-10, the most under-target PCT will be 10.6 per cent. below its target allocation. Over the next two years, that PCTs' allocation will grow by more than 17 per cent. and it will end 2010-11 only 6.2 per cent. below target. This is a significant achievement by historic standards: in 2003-04, the most under-target PCT was 22 per cent. below target.</p>

It would effectively mean re-opening those allocation rounds, which would undermine stability of NHS funding and so long-term planning. Further, it could be funded only by reducing resources for other PCTs, which may result in painful cuts to services.</p>

 It is for schools and local authorities to support children with medical conditions at schools. The Department has issued guidance to schools to help them support their pupils. Our guidance to schools, &#147;Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings&#148;, issued jointly with the Department of Health in 2005, specifically addresses what schools can do to support pupils with medical needs such as diabetes. It encourages schools and local authorities to develop policies on the management of pupil&#146;s medicines and on supporting pupils with medical needs, taking account of local resources and their various responsibilities.

<i> [holding answer 11 March 2009]:</i> The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains in the grip of a severe and prolonged humanitarian crisis, with 1.2 million people displaced by conflict in the east of the country, millions remaining food insecure and vulnerable to disease and natural disasters. However, the overall security situation in eastern DRC has improved over recent months. The end of hostilities and the integration into the national army of the CNDP militia (predominantly Rwandan militia group) since January has reduced barriers to humanitarian access in large areas of North Kivu, in turn allowing aid to reach those most in need. The longer-term humanitarian impact of joint DRC and Rwandan army operations against another militia group, the FDLR (former Rwandan Hutu forces) remains uncertain and the humanitarian community remains prepared to deal with any consequences that arise.</p>

 The Department for International Development funded a study tour to South Africa, for 13 government of Pakistan officials between 25 February and 4 March 2007, to review South Africa's social protection programmes. The purpose of the visit was to allow the officials, working on social protection programmes in Pakistan to see at first hand, how programmes of this type have been designed and implemented in a country, which has a recognised and effective social protection system. The tour was organised by South Africa's Economic Policy Research Institute and included a field visit to Soweto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="90320w0013.htm_para0"><a name="09032041002001">Following the visit, Pakistan finalised a national social protection strategy, which was published as government policy in the middle of 2007. This strategy is now being used as the framework for rolling out wider social protection programmes in Pakistan. These include the Benazir Income Support Programme, which is now one of the cornerstones of the government's efforts to  protect poor people, especially in the current period of economic instability.</p>

 The Department for International Development's (DFID) Country Plan for Pakistan, which the Secretary of State launched in July 2008 during his visit to Pakistan, sets out how we will distribute UK aid to Pakistan over the five-year period 2008-13. The plan was discussed in detail with the Government as it was being prepared and the Secretary of State personally discussed details with Pakistan's Minister of Finance at the time of the launch. The priorities set out in the plan are to: give people access to better health and education, make government more effective, make growth work for everyone, and ensure the international community works better together.</p>

 Statutory off road notification (SORN) is an integrated part of effective vehicle excise duty (VED) compliance. The measure of its effectiveness is in reducing the level of non-compliance.

There is currently no scope within Annex III of Directive 2006/112/EC for a reduced VAT rate for school uniforms or children&#146;s clothing.
