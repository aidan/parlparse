<a name="90215w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will list the mileage rates currently applicable to staff, indicating what changes have been made to encourage staff to switch from cars to public transport and other less polluting forms of travel.  [70961]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Catering Committee what facilities will be available for hon. Members and their staff during the period of closure of the Commons kitchens; and for how long the kitchens will be closed.  [70382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dennis Turner: </B> 
 The final phase (Phase F) of the House of Commons Refreshment Department Modernisation Programme, which was approved by the House in July 1994, will necessitate closure of the Department's main kitchens, (which service the Members' and the Strangers' Dining Rooms, the private dining rooms and the banqueting facilities), from the end of July 1999 until the end of February 2000.
<P>

<a name="90215w01.html_para0">During this period, normal services will be maintained throughout the Refreshment Department's cafeterias and in the Members' Tea Room. The Members' Dining Room will continue to offer a Strangers' lunch service and a Members' evening service, although the menu will have to be considerably reduced to enable catering staff to transfer food from temporary kitchens which will be sited in Peers' Court. The Churchill Room will also remain available to Members and their guests for both lunch and dinner. It is hoped that the Pugin Room will continue to operate a normal service, although a final decision on this has yet to be made. All other bar services, including the Smoking Room will operate as normal.
<P>

<a name="90215w01.html_para1">I do have to advice my hon. Friend that, unfortunately, the following services will not be available from the end of July until the new kitchens are operational in March 2000: the Strangers' Dining Rooms A, B, C and D. The Chess Room will also be closed. The Terrace Pavilion will not be available for any functions requiring food service, but its possible use for "drinks only" receptions remains under consideration.




<P>

<P>

<a name="90215w01.html_para2">Once the exact range of facilities that will be available has been finalised, I will write to all hon. Members to advise them of the services that it will be possible to provide.

To ask the Attorney-General if he will list the total number of staff <i>(a)</i> in his Department and <i>(b)</i> in each of the agencies for which he is responsible and their location in (i) London, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) each of the English regions.  [70475]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 For the details regarding my Departments (The Crown Prosecution Service, Treasury Solicitor's Department, including the Government Property Lawyers Agency, the Serious Fraud Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers) my hon. Friend is referred to the "Civil Service Statistics 1998", a copy of which is placed in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what steps he has taken to relocate staff in <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the agencies for which he is responsible to the regions of the United Kingdom with the highest levels of unemployment; and what plans he has further to decentralise the location of his Department and its agencies.  [70461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service acts as the prosecuting authority for England and Wales. At present, its staff are based at CPS Headquarters, with premises in London and York, and at 13 Area Headquarters with 90 Branches throughout England and Wales. From 1 April 1999, following the recommendations in the Glidewell Report, the CPS is to be restructured into 42 Areas, aligned with police force areas. The 90 branches will remain in their present locations, subject to review in due course. There are no plans at present to relocate the Headquarters offices in London and York. Location of individual CPS offices is determined by reference to operational needs, including proximity to the courts and police served by that office.
<P>

<a name="90215w01.html_para3">The Treasury Solicitor's Department has no current plans to relocate or decentralise staff.
<P>

<a name="90215w01.html_para4">The Serious Fraud Office has no current plans to decentralise or relocate. It is considered that its strategic objectives are best served by working close by the other major organisations in the Criminal Justice System and the major financial institutions in the City of London.
<P>

<a name="90215w01.html_para5">The small Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers operates as my private office and as such is required to be based in London.

 Genetically modified crops which have been approved for commercial production in one or more countries and which could be grown in developing countries include soybean, cotton, oilseed rape, maize, potato, tomato and tobacco.

 No staff of the Privy Council Office currently claim car mileage allowances. Any such claims would be payable at a flat rate of 40 pence per mile for the first 4,000 miles in any year and 22.5 pence per mile thereafter. The policy of the department is not to provide higher differential rates for larger capacity engines.

The rate at which incidents involving serious injury occur on the roads for which the Highways Agency is responsible is thought to be up to three per annum in recent years according to the historic evidence of such incidents. None of these is believed to have resulted in fatalities. In some years there have been no reported injury accidents.

<P>

damaged due to missiles being thrown (not specifically from bridges) have been reportable under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR). During 1996-97 the total number of incidents was 468, of which 408 were malicious; during 1997-98 the totals were 619 and 512 respectively. Figures for previous years were not kept.

<a name="90215w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what engineering measures he proposes to protect the travelling public from missiles being thrown from parapets of bridges over <i>(a)</i> motorways, <i>(b)</i> other roads and <i>(c)</i> railways.  [70272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Departmental standard for the design of highway bridge parapets requires that they are 1.2 m high on road bridges over other roads and 1.5 m high on road bridges over railways. Parapets on bridges over railways are normally clad with a close mesh or steel panelling. Missiles thrown from bridges are usually isolated incidences that it is impossible to prevent completely.
<P>

<a name="90215w03.html_para3">Where there is a repeated problem at a particular location then local measures such as raising the parapet height and using a solid infill to the parapet may help. The provision of CCTV cameras and police patrols may also be used in addition to these engineering measures.
<P>

<a name="90215w03.html_para4">The Health and Safety Executive has published "Railway Safety Principles and Guidance" for the promoters of new railways of bridges which gives specific guidance on the height of bridge parapets. The guidance also states:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
"Where vandalism may be a problem, Parapets at least 1.8 m high or a totally enclosed structure may be necessary".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90215w03.html_para5">With regard existing bridges, many may not meet these guidelines. In such cases, the Health and Safety Executive would expect railway infrastructure owners to assess each bridge on its own merits, and, where a problem with vandalism may exist, take reasonable practicable measures to help prevent such incidents from occurring.
<P>

<a name="90215w03.html_para6">Road bridges not on the trunk road system are the responsibility of the appropriate highway authority.

<P>
<a name="90215w04.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Existing franchises include a clause requiring Train Operators to provide, where practical, for the transport of bicycles on trains at reasonable charges (if any). The Objectives, Instructions and Guidance we issued to the Franchising Director in November 1997 (a copy is in the House Library) require him to discuss the provision of facilities for bicycles when operators are planning to order new rolling stock.

<P>
<a name="90215w04.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Accurate and timely timetable information is essential to encouraging greater use of the rail network. I look to Railtrack and train operators to ensure that information about Easter 1999 services is made available to the public accordingly in a timely and accurate manner. The Rail Regulator has recently published proposals to amend train operators' and Railtrack's licences to place an enforceable obligation on them to ensure passengers receive timely and accurate timetable information. Failure to comply could then result in enforcement action.

 I do not expect authorities to spend above their guideline, but I have today placed in the Library of the House tables showing the reduction in council tax benefit subsidy on the assumptions specified, expressed both in cash and as a proportion of the authority's yield from council tax for standard spending. The tables also give the budgeted proportion of council tax yield accounted for by council tax benefit in 1998-99, and the data are provided in electronic form to enable any desired grouping of authorities.

 I am not aware that the School Travel Advisory Group has received evidence from Staffordshire County Council. The group's work will involve the collection of information and advice from a wide range of sources and I am sure that it would welcome evidence from Staffordshire County Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the current number of people sleeping on the streets in <i>(a)</i> London, <i>(b)</i> the south east of England and <i>(c)</i> other major cities in England.  [70724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The most reliable method of establishing the number of people sleeping rough is by undertaking a night time head count. In 1996 my Department published guidance to local authorities on how to conduct head counts of people sleeping rough using a standard methodology developed in partnership with experts from the voluntary sector and local authorities. DETR officials have worked in conjunction with the voluntary sector to encourage areas which consider they have a rough sleeping problem to conduct counts. Since 1996 local authorities have provided details of street counts which have been undertaken in their area within the Housing Investment Programme (HIP) returns.
<P>

<a name="90215w04.html_para3"><i>(a) London</i>--Street counts in central London are co-ordinated by Homeless Network, the umbrella group representing homeless organisations in London, and have been undertaken on a regular basis since 1992. The most recent count in June 1998 found 373 people sleeping rough. Several other London boroughs have also undertaken counts, finding a total of 132 rough sleepers.

 This information is not held centrally. The London Hostels Directory produced by Resource Information Services (RIS) provides details of over 26,000 bed spaces in a wide variety of hostels, shared houses and flats and other accommodation schemes. Some of these hostel schemes have a maximum age limit of 30 or under. Many other hostels in London will accept single homeless people from 18 to 65 years of age.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will amend the guidelines on avicultural purposes in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to ensure that birds bred or reared in captivity cannot be <i>(a)</i> sold for profit or personal gain, <i>(b)</i> used for medical experimentation and <i>(c)</i> used for any other purpose except the propagation of the species under English Nature approved conditions.  [70906]<P>

 Licences to take birds for Avicultural purposes are issued only after consultation with English Nature.

There are no plans to amend the current procedure.

 Yes. It is currently an offence for any person to act as a member of an aircraft's crew while under the influence of drink or drugs. However, there is no power for the police to require samples from someone suspected of committing an offence. While there is no evidence to suggest that alcohol or drug abuse by aircraft crew is a problem, it is our long-term intention to introduce legislation to set an alcohol limit for aircraft crew and to give the Police the power to require suspected offenders to provide samples for testing.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> Draft guidance on the Groundwater Regulations 1998 will be published for consultation as soon as possible, and I will inform the House when it is available. Subject to resolving points which arise in consultation, a final version of the guidance is expected to be published in July. Later this month the Environment Agency will issue interim guidance dealing with making applications for authorisations under the Regulations. This will cover transitional arrangements which allow applications to be made prior to 1 April (when the main provisions come into force) and, in the case of activities conducted by the same person which are substantially the same as those previously undertaken, deemed approved until otherwise disposed of by the Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w05.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Advice from the Jubilee line was that, by implementing passenger flow control (in essence restricting the numbers of people entering the station) in accordance with the Swiss Cottage Station Emergency Plans, it was considered both safe and feasible to keep stations open and the train service operating. Trains were held at Finchley Road southbound to ensure that trains were not delayed in tunnels, and train operators were accompanied by managers to enable a quicker response should problems arise.

<a name="90215w05.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The full facts of the incident have yet to be totally established. As is usual, a formal London Underground Incident Investigation Report is to be carried out.
<P>

<a name="90215w05.html_para2">However, London Underground Limited (LUL) believe that a 150 mm diameter Thames Water water main burst above the LUL network. It is believed this burst occurred around 1600 hrs on 7 February 1999.
<P>

<a name="90215w05.html_para3">Water entered over time into both the Jubilee and Metropolitan Lines. The major water ingress was on to the Metropolitan Line Southbound in the Finchley Road area. A maximum depth of approximately 1.2 m was evident along a length of tunnel of some 5 m. This depth of flooding lasted some 13 hours in total during Sunday 7 February and Monday 8 February 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w05.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 LUL has significant procedures in place to deal with water penetration. Permanent pumping arrangements consist of in situ sumps, pumps and drains for clearing normal day to day ingress with sufficient additional design capacity to cover additional storm flows. In addition, research is ongoing to improve the technical knowledge required to deal with rising groundwater under London and various courses of action are being taken to deal with this.
<P>

<a name="90215w05.html_para4">As regards flooding from burst water mains etc., remote sensing from permanent pump locations give automatic warnings to local control rooms and in many cases this is also linked direct to the specialist internal pumps contractor located with key emergency resource at Griffith House in the Edgware Road area. As these alarms are raised, together with any visual reports from operational staff, the incident becomes identified and logged at Line Control Centre. The Line Controller will alert the line's engineering services help desk (or line service centre)

 The Secretary of State was not consulted on the planning merits of this case.

Applicants would, however, be referred to him only where the local planning authority was minded to approve the proposal. In this case I understand the application was refused. The Highways Agency was consulted and raised no objection but

 Shortly after taking office, the Government made regulations which require local housing authorities to give reasonable preference in the allocation of permanent social tenancies to people who are owed a main homelessness duty, that is, those who have been found to be unintentionally homeless and in priority need. We have also made an order which requires that, where authorities discharge this duty by assisting applicants to secure alternative accommodation for themselves, the authority must be satisfied that the accommodation will be available for at least 2 years. These measures have strengthened the position of homeless people and the Government are presently considering what other steps should be taken to ensure that they get the assistance and protection that they need.

<P>
<a name="90215w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We wish to ensure that Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) can fully engage in the government's wider social regeneration agenda. My Department is therefore consulting interested bodies on a draft of an Order which would extend the permissible additional purposes or objects of RSLs in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="90215w07.html_para4">The Order's broad purpose is to enable an RSL to provide services and amenities to people who are not resident in the RSL's property, so long as some of its own tenants benefit; and in certain circumstances to engage in regeneration activities such as the New Deal for Communities.
<P>

<a name="90215w07.html_para5">Section 2 of the Housing Act 1996 specifies the bodies that are eligible for registration as non charitable social landlords. For two categories of body (a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 and a company registered under the Companies Act 1985) the section sets out conditions that must be satisfied for registration. In addition to the core purposes or objects, there are permissible additional purposes or objects.
<P>

<a name="90215w07.html_para6">The draft Order proposes further permissible additional purposes or objects that such a body may have, namely:

 Expenditure on fuel duty rebate for Great Britain as a whole is expected to be &#163;270 million in the current financial year. Expenditure in future years will depend on the total of fuel consumed in operating eligible routes for which bus operators make claims for rebate, and on decisions still to be taken on the proportion of duty paid to be rebated in each year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency currently compiles an inventory of polluting substances emitted from processes subject to Integrated Pollution Control in England and Wales, the Chemical Release Inventory. Following an extended period of consultation, the Agency announced on 27 November 1998 that it was varying the authorisations of all IPC processes to require the provision of data on a more consistent basis. The Agency, in consultation with stakeholders, has developed a standard list of pollutants and reporting thresholds. All operations with processes subject to IPC will now have to report on their emissions of these substances where they exceed the thresholds. The Agency is also planning at a future date to extend the inventory to require other processes it regulates, such as landfill sites and sewage treatment works, to report on their emissions in the same way.
<P>

<a name="90215w07.html_para11">The Agency has varied IPC authorisations to require information about emissions during 1998 to be provided in the new format. Where measured data are not available operators will be able to calculate or estimate their emissions. The Agency hopes to make the new emission database available in a searchable form on the Internet during the first half of 1999. The Agency has also announced that it is forming an advisory committee to advise on the development of the new database and keep the pollutants reported and thresholds under review.
<P>

<a name="90215w07.html_para12">I welcome the improvements the Agency is making to the Chemical Release Inventory. The timely provision of comprehensive emissions data in a readily accessible format is necessary to secure the public's right to know about environmental pollution. I particularly welcome the fact that emissions data will be collected on a consistent basis from all 2,000 IPC processes and that the Agency has made an early start by collecting this data for 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the extent of current UK involvement in US and EU space research and programmes.  [70199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The UK pursues its space programme primarily in collaboration with the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA). In addition, researchers collaborate extensively, both directly and through ESA, with the United States and the EU.
<P>

<a name="90215w08.html_para4">Collaboration with the European Union focuses on the Framework research programme into which Member States contribute. The four year Framework IV concluded in 1998. UK firms won some 16-17 per cent. of the available funding with a major part played by our strong academic community; small and medium-sized enterprises have been particularly successful. The UK space sector has especially benefited from the Centre for Earth Observation (CEO) and environment and climate programmes. For example, British firms took part in a project to determine how satellite technology can be used to complement Earth Observation and other sources of information on agriculture and forestry. There will be considerable opportunities under the Framework V programme and my officials are working to ensure that British companies are fully involved.
<P>

<a name="90215w08.html_para5">Collaboration with the United States takes place in fields such as environmental science, space-based astronomy and planetary science.
<P>

<a name="90215w08.html_para6">The UK also collaborates with the US through ESA programmes and through EUMETSAT, which provides operational weather systems. There is also strong collaboration between British and American scientists in the global change programme and participation in major NASA field experiments. The UK has provided instruments for several missions carried out as a partnership between ESA and NASA. Missions active at the moment are Ulysses, Cassini-Huygens and SOHO. The UK is also a strong contributor to the future missions FIRST, Planck Surveyor and the Next Generation Space Telescope, which will involve ESA partnership with NASA. The UK is the leading European user of the Hubble Space Telescope.

 My Department has today agreed to provide funding of up to &#163;175,000 p.a. for three years, with the possibility of support for a further two years thereafter subject to satisfactory progress, towards support for the promotion of engineering. This includes up to &#163;425,000 p.a. specifically for the work being planned by Quinco, subject to individual projects satisfying my Department's approval procedures. The largest single item in the Quinco allocation is a sum of &#163;250,000 p.a. towards the Engineering Image Campaign on which the Engineering Council has been working in partnership with EEF and EMTA. &#163;75,000 p.a. is being set aside for existing projects established under the Action for Engineering initiative, of which the most notable of these is the Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics Network (SETNET).
<P>

<a name="90215w09.html_para0">I have also agreed today to provide &#163;34,000 to the Engineering Council towards the costs of producing an updated version of their Environmental Guidelines for Engineers, which highlight the importance of sustainable development.

 Both my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and DTI officials have been maintaining close contact with BMW over the situation at Longbridge. Following last week's Board changes we understand that BMW's investment review of their medium car strategy is still underway and the company continues to look closely at Longbridge as a possible location. No immediate decision is expected.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recognises that the plant plays a major role, though no specific estimate of its direct importance has been made. Longbridge currently employs around 14,000 people and a considerably larger number of jobs in the UK's component supply industry are likely to be reliant on the plant.

<P>
<a name="90215w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today granted consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 for a 70 MW gas-fired Combined Heat and Power station at the British Sugar factory in York. The station has also today been given planning permission and clearance (as a gas-fired station) under Section 14 of the Energy Act 1976. The decisions have been taken in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee" (Cm 4071).
<P>

<a name="90215w09.html_para3">The Government's recent White Paper set out a stricter consents policy towards applications for new gas-fired power stations but indicated that the Government's concerns might be outweighed by the environmental and other benefits of CHP. The Government are of the view that this project falls within the description of CHP identified in the White Paper and the granting of Section 36 consent is consistent with the policy set out in it.

<P>

<a name="90215w09.html_para4">Since 1976 all new contracts for reprocessing of overseas spent fuel have contained options for return of wastes. The government intend that such options should be exercised and that wastes arising from reprocessing be returned to the country of origin.

Negotiations are under way to develop an international instrument (the Biosafety Protocol to the convention on Biological Diversity) which will cover transboundary movement of living modified organisms. It has been the Government's position throughout these negotiations that the protocol should contain clear provision allowing countries to withhold agreement to the importing, into their country, of genetically modified organisms where they consider such a measure is necessary. This must be based on sound scientific grounds, assessing the risk to the environment or to human health of environmental release.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor and I have made it clear on a number of occasions that we see many benefits accruing from the greater alignment of magistrates' courts committees with criminal justice agency boundaries.

<P>

<a name="90215w10.html_para1">In particular, alignment will lead to an increased familiarity with each other's policies; improved co-ordination in the implementation of national and regional policies; improved relations between the chief officers of each agency; and the removal of duplication of effort and the speeding up of decision making at a strategic level. This is in addition to financial benefits which can be realised by the magistrates' courts committees concerned, all of which are likely to lead to a more effective, and more efficient, service.

 Magistrates' courts are locally managed by magistrates' courts committees under the provisions of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. Decisions concerning the location and number of magistrates' courts in their area are for the relevant MCC to determine. A local authority that contributes financially may appeal to the Lord Chancellor against a proposed closure. In the event of an appeal, costs are only one factor to be considered. Other common themes are accessibility and facilities for all court users, workload, and the extra time and distance users may have to travel. In the absence of an appeal, however, the Lord Chancellor plays no part in the process.

(28) The British Museum say that all their Board Members are visitors and users. Those Trustees that sit on the External Relations and Public Services Committee have particular responsibility for consumer interests including disability issues.<P>





(29) The Imperial War Museum say that none of its Board is a museum professional: all are "lay" and may ask questions as consumers.<P>

<P>

(30) The NMGM have agreed in principle to hold one open meeting a year beginning in 1999<P>

<P>

(31) The National Portrait Gallery do not allow non-Trustees to attend Board meetings.<P>

<P>

(32) English Heritage advise that one Commissioner has been a recipient of a grant and can be described as a "consumer". As not all Commissioners are experts in the fields they represent they can be described as lay members.<P>

<P>

(33) The Museum of London say that its Board is made up of people from a wide number of backgrounds who include people with lay or consumer representation.<P>

<P>

(34) The National Museum of Science and Industry say that the Board is composed of individuals appointed by Government selected from those with interests and expertise which will assist and advise the Museum both with regard to visitors and care of the collections. These unpaid individuals provide a wide range of scientific, visitor, management and educational experience.<P>

<P>

(35) The English Tourist Board holds three public meetings with Regional Tourist Boards annually which are also open to the industry and public.<P>

<P>

(36) Members of the public who are complainants on fairness in broadcasting are invited to attend Commission hearings in which their complaint is being considered. However, meetings of Commission members are not usually open to the general public.<P>

<a name="90215w14.html_para0">At the Trust's meeting of 25 January, the Trustees agreed to amend Trust grant aid policy to include further specific requirements for clubs to provide access and facilities for disabled people, as recommended in the Task Force report. I welcome this development.

come into force from October when service providers will have to take reasonable steps to change any practice, policy or procedure which makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service; provide an auxiliary aid or service which would enable disabled people to use a service; and overcome physical barriers which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service by providing the service by a reasonable alternative method. From 2004, service providers will also have to consider tackling physical barriers by taking reasonable steps to remove them; alter them, or provide a reasonable means of avoiding them.
<P>

<a name="90215w14.html_para1">In addition, I have taken steps to implement the practical recommendations made in the Football Task Force's Report on Improving Facilities for Disabled Supporters, published last July, which fall to Government. These relate to amending the Approved document (AD) for Part M of the Building Regulations to require all new stadia, new stands and extensions to existing facilities to provide wheelchair spaces in accordance with the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds; to drawing up a sliding scale for the numbers of designated seats for people who are ambulant disabled or visually/hearing impaired within new stands and stadia, and amending Part M accordingly; and to extending the future role of the Football Trust to improve disabled facilities at grounds.




<P>
<P><I>15 Feb 1999 : Column: 473</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90215w14.html_para2">Any changes to the Building Regulations require statutory consultation and will be based on the advice of the Building Regulations Advisory Committee. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions intends to use the comprehensive review of British Standard BS 5810 Code of Practice for access for the disabled to buildings and its supporting research, once it has been completed, as a basis for developing proposals through the Building Regulations Advisory Committee to revise the AD for Part M. In the interim, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has taken the immediate step of including references to the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds in the current revision to the AD to extend Part M to new housing. This will draw the guidance to the attention of interested parties. The review of BS 5810 includes access for the ambulant disabled and when the Green Guide is next updated the standard will be taken on board.
<P>

<a name="90215w14.html_para3">I fully support all the practical recommendations made in the Task Force's report. These include proposals concerning seating arrangement, parking and access at football grounds. In November, I wrote to the bodies identified in the report as having a role to play in implementing the recommendations. I have been encouraged by the positive responses I have received.
<P>

<a name="90215w14.html_para4">The Task Force's recommendations provide an excellent assessment of what has been achieved in the provision of facilities for disabled supporters at football grounds, and where improvement can still be made. They are equally applicable to other sports stadia and I commend them to all those involved in sports stadia management in this country.

The Government's White Paper "Smoking Kills", published last December, was accompanied by a consultation document which invites comments on the possible impact of legislation. The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts has been invited to make representations on behalf of its members, and arts organisations may also do so on an individual basis.

 The Northern Ireland Housing Executive holds responsibility for housing those people who claim to be homeless as a result of intimidation, and assesses entitlement to housing under the homelessness legislation. Its Chief Executive has advised me that, from 1 May 1998 to 31 December 1998, a total of 1,358 applicants have been awarded A1 (I) priority status by the Housing Executive as a result of intimidation.

It includes only those prisoners whose perceived affiliation is to organisations which have not been specified under Section 3 of the 1998 Act. This is drawn from information received by the Secretary of State as at 5 February 1999 from the Sentence Review Commissioners, to whom prisoners apply for early release. The 1998 Act also provides that, if circumstances permit, prisoners with release dates falling after the second anniversary of the coming into force of that Act (on 28 July 1998) who have served two years or more in prison will be released on that anniversary. Those prisoners are not shown in Table B.

The working group will also have to consider to what extent enhanced public confidence in the new system will encourage more complaints.

<a name="90215w17.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Government have decided that, subject to Parliamentary approval of the Spring Supplementary Estimates, an addition of &#163;310,104,000 should be made to the Defence budget in the current year. This will cover increased costs in 1998-99 due to slippage out of 1997-98 and costs of unprogrammed overseas operations, including those in the Former Yugoslavia, including the United Kingdom's contribution to the OSCE-led Verification Mission in Kosovo (KVM), the supporting KVM Extraction Force based in Macedonia, and on-going air operations over Iraq, including the United Kingdom's contribution to Operation Desert Fox. The figure includes full take up of the Ministry of Defence's entitlement to End Year Flexibility of &#163;225,104,000 in respect of the Defence budget underspend in 1997-98. This figure is &#163;56,617,000 lower than the figure announced by the Chief Secretary on 14 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>132-36</i>, under the Operating Costs and Capital equipment schemes which had been assessed on the provisional outturn for the Defence budget at the time. In the event, the final outturn for 1997-98 was higher than forecast.
<P>

<a name="90215w17.html_para2">The Supplementary Estimate will also provide for changes in the general pattern of expenditure, including adjustments between the PE equipment and Defence Operating Costs programmes; for the transfer of provision to the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in respect of MOD's contribution to jointly funded programmes; and the withdrawal of net accounting arrangements for the recovery of VAT on Contracted Out services.
<P>

<a name="90215w17.html_para3">Because of the adjustment between the equipment and operating costs programmes and the incidence of costs in respect of ongoing military operations in the Former Yugoslavia and Iraq, the additional funding will be drawn onto Class 1, Vote 1 and Class 1, Vote 2, with only a token Estimate being taken on Class 1, Vote 3 to reflect a realignment of Estimates provision within the Vote.

<P>

<a name="90215w18.html_para0">The Under-Secretary of State carried out a comprehensive review of all extant historical documents on the subject in 1998 and concluded that he could find no grounds for reopening the case to award a medal for service in the Canal Zone between 1951 and 1954. Ministers have seen no new evidence that would enable them to recommend to the Honours and Decorations Committee that they overturn their policy of non-retrospection or any of the decisions made at the time and in subsequent reviews, several of which have taken place since 1990.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> Like us, the US Defense Department is managing a vigorous programme to eliminate any effects of the Y2k problem from its systems. Specifically, the mission critical sub-systems of the Trident II (D5) Strategic Weapon System, as operated by the Royal Navy, have already been certified as Y2k compliant; the UK was notified of this in December 1998.

 The Ministry of Defence holds many thousands of official papers, documents, maps and charts concerning Gibraltar. A review to determine whether they refer to the Bay of Gibraltar or the Bay of Algeciras could be carried out only at disproportionate cost. I understand that both terms have been used in official papers, documents, maps and charts from my Department.

 It is the policy of the MOD to make information widely available to the public in an accessible form, subject to necessary security restrictions. As part of this policy, the Ministry of Defence maintain a number of publicly accessible internet web sites. Topics covered range across the full business activities of the Department, including defence policy and operations, defence research, meteorological and hydrographic information, defence standards, and Service recruitment. We do not hold figures for the average monthly number of accesses, or "hits", to MOD web sites. However, the most recent month's figures are given for each site for which this information is available centrally.

HMS Cumberland then docked in Mombasa on 16 January and sailed on 22 January 1999. Unfortunately 15 bags of mail, dispatched to the Ship via Nairobi failed to arrive before she sailed from Mombasa, due to security problems in Nairobi and transport problems between Nairobi and Mombasa. The mail caught up with the ship in Bahrain when she docked there on 1 February.

 We will tackle the problem of illegal immigration. We are developing increased European and international co-operation to crack down on traffickers. Increased liaison between British and French border authorities is already paying dividends in preventing 2,000 illegal immigrants in the last six months from embarking for Dover. Seven traffickers are being prosecuted by the French as a direct result of information provided by the Immigration Service. The Immigration and Asylum Bill contains several important provisions, including a civil penalty which will apply to drivers of vehicles found transporting clandestine entrants to Britain.

 As a result of court decisions arising out of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, Local Councils have faced an unacceptable burden in dealing with asylum seekers. Councils like Dover and Kent deserve great praise for their handling of these issues. Next year, the new Immigration and Asylum Bill will place responsibility on a Government Agency to provide for asylum seekers and to end the disproportionate pressure on Dover and other areas of Kent, as well as London. In the meantime, the Local Government Association is setting up a non-statutory dispersal scheme and the Government have provided extra funding for it.

 Voluntary organisations have an important role to play in crime prevention and reduction work.

Additionally, my Department funded the work of Crime Concern to produce and publish "Reducing Neighbourhood Crime--A Manual for Action".

<a name="90215w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Consultation with magistrates, including through the Magistrates' Association, is an important element in taking forward implementation of the youth justice provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act. Through the White Paper "No More Excuses" and a range of draft guidance documents, the Government have sought views on the timing and process of implementation. Through the participation of the courts in 15 areas in pilots of new court orders for dealing with young offenders and of measures to reduce delay, magistrates are also playing a key role in helping to identify effective practice under the new provisions ahead of national implementation.

<P>

 The disciplinary arrangements for officers of the Metropolitan Police are set out in the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985, which apply to officers throughout England and Wales. Officers who breach any part of the Disciplinary Code, which appears as Schedule 1 to the Regulations, are likely to face disciplinary proceedings.

 The primary responsibility for countering smuggling and the evasion of duty rests with Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, but there are well established arrangements to ensure close co-operation between the police service and Her Majesty's Customs to combat these and other criminal activities.

 The United Kingdom Passport Agency does not keep figures for representations received on passport fees. However, the number of complaints received is minimal. The United Kingdom passport fee is one of the lowest in the world and represents good value for money.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government's plans allow police spending to increase in 1999-2000 by &#163;186 million (2.7 per cent.) to over &#163;7.1 billion. Police authorities will be able to increase their spending power by achieving the 2 per cent. efficiency target which has been set and re-investing the savings in front-line policing. It is the Government's general expectation that the additional costs arising from millennium celebrations should be met from within police budgets.
<P>

<a name="90215w21.html_para0">Central Government revenue support for the fire service in England is provided through the revenue support grant system. Funding pressures for the fire service in England and Wales, including those which may result from the Millennium, were identified by the local authorities' Fire Service Expenditure Forecasting Group under the Central Local Partnership arrangements. These pressures were taken into account in the Comprehensive Spending Review.

<a name="90215w22.html_para13">The Government have embarked upon a radical restructuring of the youth justice system, including reforms to the youth court and range of new sentencing options. The system as a whole has been given a new statutory aim--to prevent offending by children and young persons. The new court disposals that have been introduced, including the action plan and reparation orders and the new custodial sentence, the detention and training order will all have a clear focus on rehabilitation and preventing future offending and re-offending.

<P>
<a name="90215w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The pledge to halve the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders is aimed at reducing unnecessary delay and improving efficiency. Experience in those areas running fast tracking schemes indicates that the initiatives are generally cost neutral and, in some cases, have already resulted in savings through increased efficiency.
<P>

<a name="90215w22.html_para14">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced a range of measures which will help to deliver the pledge by strengthening the ability of the court to manage cases and making procedural changes to ensure delays are avoided. The costs or savings of these measures--which cover both youth and adult cases--will be assessed following the pilots which are now in progress.

<P>
<a name="90215w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We are in regular contact on this issue with practitioners from all of the youth justice agencies, including the courts, through correspondence and attendance at youth justice seminars and conferences. The responses to a Home Office survey of all youth court areas in England and Wales conducted in April 1998 indicated that 160 youth court areas now have a fast tracking scheme. A further survey this year has yet to be completed, but is already confirming that the number of schemes continues to grow.

<a name="90215w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The sentencing decisions in respect of persistent young offenders (as defined in joint Home Office/Lord Chancellor's Department Circular "Measuring Performance to reduce delays in the youth court system") have not been routinely identified in the past, but plans are in place to do so in future. Information is collected about all young people aged 10-17 sentenced for indictable offences by type of sentence or order. The following table contains a breakdown for each of the last three years for which figures are available.

 Following the coming into force of section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 on 1 October 1997, the release on compassionate grounds of life prisoners is considered under that Act. Section 36(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 now applies only to determinate sentence prisoners.

<a name="90215w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 None. A pilot scheme was conducted in Dorset between 1991 and 1993 whereby special constables who performed 125 hours duty in a six month period qualified for a bounty payment of &#163;200. The results of the scheme were inconclusive and the Police Service did not consider that a bounty should be mandatory for special constables.
<P>

<a name="90215w23.html_para17">During its review of 1995-96, the Special Constabulary Working Group received evidence suggesting that the overwhelming majority of special constables valued their voluntary status highly and did not want this to be changed. As a result, the Group concluded that a bounty should not be paid to special constables and recommended that the regulation enabling the discretionary payment of a limited bounty should be repealed. We agree with this recommendation and the relevant regulation will be repealed later this year.

 We support the police forces' recruitment campaigns by holding a Specials Week during which I and a number of my ministerial colleagues attend events held by forces around the country to highlight and promote the service provided by special constables.

 Decisions to serve a notice of intention to deport are taken by trained staff at the appropriate grade, depending on the complexity of the issues raised. This will normally be either executive officer, or administrative officer for the most straightforward cases, although more complex cases may be dealt with by senior caseworkers at senior or higher executive officer grades. Where a notice is served by the Immigration Service under delegated authority, authorisation is given at Inspector level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Airline liaison officers do not provide direct assistance to other governments on cases involving individual passengers who are not adequately documented for travel to the United Kingdom. They do provide information to the appropriate authorities on the activities of facilitators and racketeers involved in human smuggling and records are kept of the outcome when it is known.

<P>
<a name="90215w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Since 27 July 1998, airline liaison officers have been posted to Bahrain, Bangkok, Dubai, Istanbul and Pretoria. An officer will be posted to Moscow towards the end of April. By the end of 1999 we plan to have posted up to nine more officers. Final decisions on the exact locations of these additional posts have yet to be made.

<P>
<a name="90215w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In 1998, airlines operating from the five locations where airline liaison officers were based refused carriage to 2,095 prospective passengers who were not adequately documented for travel to the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In April 1998, the Policing and Reducing Crime Unit at the Home Office supported an application under the Police Research Award Scheme from Essex Police to purchase and train two Bloodhound and two German Shepherd puppies. The proposal was to train the puppies in an alternative tracking method known as scent discrimination. This method depends on the dog tracking the individual scent of the person rather than the scent of the ground disturbance they have left.

 Funding of Essex Police in 1999-2000 will increase by &#163;4.6 million (2.9 per cent.) to &#163;163 million. This increase is above the national average. The allocation of resources within the Essex Police is a matter for the Chief Constable and the police authority, as are the use of motorcycles and the mounted section.
<P>

<a name="90215w24.html_para1">I received one representation from the Essex Police Authority about the proposed funding settlement for 1999-2000, which included reference to the consequences of the settlement for the mounted section and the future use of motorcycles by the Essex Police. I understand from the Chief Constable that his proposal to disband the mounted section is based upon their limited operational contribution to the modern day to day policing of Essex. Similarly, the continued use of motorcycles is under consideration as part of the force's drive for improved efficiency.

 Several assessments have been made recently of this vital area of policing.
<P>

<a name="90215w25.html_para4">The Home Office Police Research Group's report "Policing Racially Motivated Incidents", published in November 1997, found variations in recording and processing procedures between forces, difficulties in applying the concept of racial motivation and poor understanding of relevant legislation. Of the cases where there was potential for further action, only just over a third resulted in a charge or caution.
<P>

<a name="90215w25.html_para5">The thematic report of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) on police/community and race relations, "Winning the Race", which was published in October 1997, also registered concerns about levels of awareness within forces of what constituted a racial incident, about recording practices and procedures and about the quality of the police response to racial incidents. HMIC are currently completing their report of a follow-up inspection to assess progress.

<a name="90215w25.html_para6">Findings from the British Crime Survey published in April 1998--"Ethnicity and Victimisation: Findings from the 1996 British Crime Survey"--showed a considerable gap between crime incidents perceived to be racially motivated by victims and the number of incidents recorded by the police. While various factors mean that an exact match between the two sets of figures could not be expected, under-recording by the police appears to be a significant factor.
<P>

<a name="90215w25.html_para7">The Association of Chief Police Officers issued a good practice guide on the police response to racial incidents in April 1998 responding to those concerns and have set up a working group to consider further improvements, including standardising core recording requirements. A protocol has been agreed with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure consistency in identifying cases with a racial motivation. We welcome the setting up of the Racial and Violent Crime Task Force in the Metropolitan Police Service.
<P>

<a name="90215w25.html_para8">The report of the Inquiry into matters arising from the death of Stephen Lawrence is expected shortly.

 I believe that voluntary organisations have a vital role to play in tackling crime and disorder. This view is reflected in the fact that a wide range of voluntary bodies must be invited to participate in the work of the local crime and disorder reduction partnerships established by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Furthermore, guidance issued by the Home Office emphasises the importance of the voluntary sector's contribution to the crime and disorder audits and strategies which the local partnerships are currently engaged in producing.

<a name="90215w26.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons the upper limit to nullify the effects of unusually lengthy cases used in the time intervals surveys conducted by the Lord Chancellor's Department was not used in the calculation of his benchmark figure of 142 days from arrest to sentencing for persistent young offenders; and if he will estimate the impact on that figure of using such a limit.  [70811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The benchmark figure of 142 days from arrest to sentence in persistent young offender cases was calculated on the basis of a special exercise, which drew a sample of cases from the Police National Computer (Phoenix). Phoenix does not exclude cases on the basis of their length. The Government's pledge is to halve the time from arrest to sentence for all persistent young offenders. A minority of cases may be protracted for reasons outside the control of case management, such as the illness of the defendant or a key witness. However, it is essential that unnecessary delay should be removed from all cases, regardless of their complexity or the exceptional circumstances that may arise. For that reason, the Government consider it appropriate for the benchmark figure to be based on all cases.

<a name="90215w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 All non-domestic animals in private ownership are protected by the Protection of Animals Act 1911, under which it is a criminal offence to ill-treat or cause any unnecessary suffering to any captive animal.

 Special Advisers are appointed under terms and conditions set out in the "Model Contract for Special Advisers".

As is the case with appointments under the previous Administration, special advisers will often have worked with or have been known to the appointing Minister before appointment. Their appointment terminates automatically when there is a change of Government.

 None. The Department funds research and development to support its work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The Department also manages the National Health Service research and development levy which is used to support research and development of relevance to the National Health Service in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology in the Department of Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base. The MRC also funds basic research including the study of molecules and cells, genetics and infections and immunity (&#163;158 millions per annum) which will inform research in this area.

<P>
<a name="90215w27.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 In England, the financial provision for the promotion of breastfeeding during 1998-99 is &#163;140,000. This includes publicity expenditure on promoting breastfeeding and grants awarded under Section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 to voluntary organisations concerned with promoting breastfeeding. It does not include the incidental expenditure of those attending meetings to discuss the promotion of breastfeeding either within the Department or the National Health Service.

<a name="90215w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Ministers and officials have received written and oral representations from many individuals, organisations and trust managers about National Health Service consultants. Departmental officials have also talked to a range of individuals and organisations in preparing to open negotiations with the British Medical Association on a new consultant contract, and these discussions have generated a variety of ideas and opinions. Negotiations opened in December.
<P>

<a name="90215w28.html_para0">Some representations have expressed concern about the time consultants spend on private practice and questioned their commitment to the NHS. Others have emphasised their hard work and dedication. Most consultants work very hard for the NHS. We are alert, however, to the possibility of conflicts of interest where consultants work outside the NHS. We want to modernise their contracts to ensure that the skills and commitment of consultants are priorities and goals of the NHS and through this to resolve any apparent conflict of interest between private and NHS work.

 The use of human tissue in drug research can provide valuable information, in combination with information from other studies, when assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. The use of human tissue in drug research, along with other screening tests, may also help pharmaceutical companies to select a drug from a range of developmental drugs for further development.

 It is likely that each National Health Service provider, medical school, and some universities and other research institutes in receipt of research funding or research support funding will be undertaking research using human tissue (including blood and cells).

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w28.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The introduction of Health Improvement Programmes, through the White Paper "The new NHS", will bring all local players together to develop cross cutting plans to tackle the whole range of factors that cause ill health, of which cold and damp conditions in the home is one. These proposals encourage health authorities to take an overarching approach to addressing the health needs of their populations and are designed to produce overall improvements in health and reductions in inequalities.
<P>

<a name="90215w28.html_para5">The Government recognise that cold and damp housing and poor housing conditions generally can contribute to ill health. However, poor health can be influenced by a large number of causes other than housing. Poverty, unemployment and unhealthy lifestyles are examples of interacting factors that can have at least as great an effect. Therefore, it is not possible to establish or quantify links between specific housing conditions and ill health. As a result, nor is it possible to make estimates of National Health Service expenditure on ill health related to specific housing conditions.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We acknowledge that cases where the non-resident parent is self employed can be more difficult to progress, especially where the non-resident parent does not wish to co-operate.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have recently completed a pilot study in the South Western Business Unit, looking at how best to process self employed cases. Trials using dedicated staff dealing exclusively with the self employed have shown a marked reduction in processing time and an increase in the collection of maintenance.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures are given to the nearest 10,000 pensioner benefit units, although not necessarily accurate to that degree.<P>

2. Figures of less than 5,000 pensioners are denoted by '*'.<P>

3. Figures should be treated with caution since taxpaying status is not directly measured by the Family Resources Survey, but has been modelled to the 1997-98 tax system.<P>

4. Pensioner benefit units are defined as single people aged 60 or over and couples (married or cohabiting) where at least one partner is aged 60 or over.<P>

5. Taxpaying pensioner benefit units are defined as those where at least one individual in the benefit unit is modelled as liable to income tax.<P>

<i>Source:</i><P>

The estimates are based on the 1995-96 Family Resources Survey and replicate those given in the answer of 5 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>249-50</i>. We anticipate that estimates based on the 



1996-97 Family Resources Survey will be available after February 1999, as stated in the answer of 8 February 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>68</i>. <P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Departmental special payment arrangements were reviewed in 1996, and new categories of consolatory payments were introduced from April 1997. Data have been provided for 1997-98, which is the only complete financial year since the change.<P>

2. Previous statistical data did not separately identify different categories of ex-gratia payments.<P>

3. The number of claims made for financial redress for maladministration for previous years is unknown. Details are held only of those which were successful. However, fuller information is now being collected and will be available for the 1998-99 financial year, and future years.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The special medical boarding centre at Sheffield transferred to Leeds in 1996.<P>

2. Figures are not available separately for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, because they are prescribed as one disease (PD D12) for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.<P>

3. Claim figures for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for chronic bronchitis and emphysema are not available for each of the boarding centres but are provided for Great Britain and for the Benefits Agency (BA) Area Directorate. These areas changed boundaries at April 1996 and this is reflected in the tables.<P>

4. Details of special medical boards are not available for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit claims data and are available only for awards data until 30 September 1997.<P>

[70459]<P>

 Over many years this Department has had a policy of locating offices in the regions of the United Kingdom with the highest levels of unemployment. The Benefits Agency has relocated work from London to three processing centres in Glasgow, Makerfield and Belfast; and when the Child Support Agency was set up, its six processing centres were located in areas of high unemployment.

<a name="90215w34.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The current average delay in hearing all appeals, including those on Incapacity Benefit, is seven months. This is clearly unacceptable and we are committed to improvements. Changes will be introduced in the second half of this year, under the provisions of the Social Security Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="90215w34.html_para4">One change will be to move away from the rigid requirement of a three person tribunal in every case to a more flexible approach, where the tribunal will be made up of people with the expertise to consider the issues in each appeal. Appeals on Incapacity Benefit will be heard by a lawyer and a doctor.
<P>

<P>

<a name="90215w34.html_para6">During the passage of the Social Security Bill through the Lords, we introduced an amendment at the request of the President of the Independent Tribunal Service, His Honour Judge Michael Harris, to allow the early introduction of flexible tribunal composition in Social Security appeal tribunals. Judge Harris has used this power to allow appeals on Incapacity Benefit to be heard by a lawyer, assisted by a doctor. This has allowed him to test out the arrangements for more flexible tribunal composition.
<P>

<a name="90215w34.html_para7">Early indications are that the new flexibility appears to be working well. Tribunal chairmen operating the new arrangements are reporting overall improvements in service as a result of the change. There is no evidence to suggest that the percentage of appeals upheld has been affected by the introduction of the new arrangements.

 The estimates made of the proportion of pensioner units likely to be receiving Income Support in 2050 have been based on 1992-based population projections by marital status in 2022, from the Government Actuary's Department (GAD).

[71157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w35.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our aim is that the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) should move in line with earnings over the long-term, as resources allow, but not necessarily in each single year. Consequently, it is not possible to answer the question with any precision.

 The decision to allow 11.5 tonne drive axle vehicles unrestricted access to UK highways prompted the major programme of assessment and strengthening of structures which started in 1989.
<P>

<a name="90215w36.html_para5">All structures not known to be capable of safely carrying 11.5 tonne drive axle vehicles have been assessed and those needing immediate attention have already been strengthened at a total cost of about &#163;25 million. The remaining trunk road supporting structures that still require strengthening will be strengthened over the next 5 years. In the meantime, they will be allowed to remain in unrestricted use but subject to an enhanced regime of regular inspection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w36.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 In accordance with statutory requirements, the Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales (ACCAC) consulted the headteacher and the governing body of Monmouth Comprehensive School on the proposal to lift the exemption from teaching Welsh to pupils at Key Stage 4 from September 1999. ACCAC considered the case put forward by the school and concluded that there were not sufficient grounds to warrant the further extension of the exemption granted in 1990. Accordingly, ACCAC recommended, in January 1998, that the exemption be lifted and that Welsh should be made a compulsory subject at Key Stage 4 from 1999.
<P>

<a name="90215w36.html_para12">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave careful consideration to ACCAC's report and the case put forward by the school. He accepted ACCAC's recommendation and published, for comment, a draft Order giving effect to it. A copy of the draft Order was sent to the headteachers and governing body of Monmouth Comprehensive School. After careful consideration of the points made to him in response to the publication of the draft Order, my right hon. Friend concluded that no matters of substance arose which were not dealt with in ACCAC's report. An Order giving effect to ACCAC's recommendation came into force on 20 November 1998. This will bring Monmouth Comprehensive School into line with all other non- Welsh-speaking schools in Wales as regards the teaching of Welsh to pupils at Key Stage 4 from September 1999.

<a name="90215w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I am laying before the House today a draft of the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 1999; a draft will similarly be laid in another place. An earlier draft was subject to extensive consultation with political parties and other interested groups last year. Powers to make the Order are derived from section 11 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. It is subject to Affirmative Resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="90215w37.html_para0">The draft Order makes comprehensive provision for elections to the National Assembly--my intention has been to produce an instrument which can be read without requiring reference to provisions in earlier legislation. The draft therefore incorporates, with modifications to fit the circumstances of the Assembly, provisions from the Representation of the People Acts 1983 and 1985, together with statutory instruments made under those Acts and other legislation, among the matters dealt with in this way are registration of voters, polling and counting arrangements, absent voting, voting offences, campaign offences and election petitions. The draft Order also, however, takes account of the new requirements of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 in relation to party nomination procedures and the use of party emblems on ballot papers, and the recommendations of the Neill Committee on the limitation of political parties' campaign expenditure at the all-Wales level.
<P>

<a name="90215w37.html_para1">For the assistance of the House I am making arrangements for a summary guide to the draft Order to be placed in the Libraries as soon as possible. Copies of illustrative examples of the ballot papers proposed for use in both the constituency and the regional elections have today been placed in the Libraries of the House. The format of the ballot papers takes account of comments received from focus groups of voters who were consulted on various designs; the ballot paper for the regional elections will contain the names of the candidates on each registered party's list, in accordance with undertakings given during the passage of the Government of Wales Act.
<P>

<a name="90215w37.html_para2">I propose, if both Houses of Parliament are content with the draft, to make this Order next month. The first formal stage of the elections process under the Order is publication of notices of elections. This is scheduled to take place no later than 26 March 1999.

 Until 31 March 1999, responsibility for the progress of basic need capital projects in grant-maintained schools remains the responsibility of the Funding Agency for Schools (FAS). I have written to the Chairman of the FAS, asking him to write to my hon. Friend, and will arrange for a copy of the reply to be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90215w38.html_para6">In a recent letter to all grant-maintained schools, which was prepared jointly by the Funding Agency for Schools and the DfEE officials, the FAS explained that, between 1 April 1999 and 31 August 1999, the Department will assume responsibility for the payment of capital grant in respect of such projects. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State intends later this year to lay Regulations under Schedule 32 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which will give him the powers to pay grant after 31 August 1999 to foundation schools and other former grant-maintained schools for capital projects committed before 1 September 1999. That letter also explained that where the Department agrees to pay grant on work which attracts VAT which cannot be reclaimed, the level of grant allowed will reflect this. Liability for VAT will depend on the nature and purpose of the building works.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps the Government have taken to prevent the patenting of genes used for manufacture of food products.  [69011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w40.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90215w40.html_para0">The Patents Act 1977 sets down the requirements which must be met to obtain patents for inventions in all fields of technology. Under this Act it is possible to patent genes for use in any manufacturing sector; the food sector included. However, the mere discovery that a gene exists in nature, when there has been no technical step, is not patentable. During negotiations on a recently adopted EC Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions (98/44/EC), the United Kingdom Government ensured that the Directive does not extend what is patentable in this area.
<P>

<a name="90215w40.html_para1">The Directive also confirms that patent rights are granted without prejudice to other legislation. Thus, if a patented gene is used in the manufacture of food products, its use is subject to all other legislation which controls such acts, including those laws protecting human and animal health and the environment.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> As I explained during the Fisheries debate on 15 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 829, a first meeting with the industry was held earlier that day on possible modifications to the beam trawl effort allocation arrangements introduced last year. During those discussions the industry raised a number of points with us and asked for certain illustrative figures to be prepared as the basis for further talks. This work involves updating the fleet segmentation and looking at other detailed technical issues. The Producer Organisations concerned understand what is involved and that it is not possible to provide definitive figures at the start of the fishing year. We will convene a further meeting soon.

(63) The buildings at Crosby Road which were erected at Government expense in the 1950s, were in need of replacement. Various options were considered including a new build by Government, a Private Finance Initiative arrangement, and a private developer scheme. A variation of the last of these options involving the sale of the site to the developer and a lease back after modern replacement buildings had been erected, offered best value for money for the Exchequer. <P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the current procedures for approving genetically engineered animal feeds; if ACRE has sole responsibility for assessing applications; and who will take such decisions in <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> the European Union.  [70347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w40.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In addition to meeting requirements applicable to all animal feeds, a GM feeding stuff requires approval for commercial use following the procedures set out in Directive 90/220/EEC. This Directive has the objective of ensuring that the product does not cause harm to animals, human health or the environment. The applicant must submit a dossier of the required information to one Member State who takes the lead for that product, and assesses the information and the potential risks. Once content, the lead Member State forwards the dossier to the Commission with an opinion. Other Member States then consider the dossier and are free to require further information. A collective decision on whether to give EU wide approval for the product is then decided by qualified majority voting.
<P>

<a name="90215w40.html_para6">In the United Kingdom, the dossiers are considered by DETR in consultation with MAFF and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 requires that formal advice on the safety of GM animal feed is sought from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). In addition, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) also advises MAFF Ministers on implications for the safety of food. In the near future, there will be an important role for the new Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, liaising as necessary with ACRE and the ACNFP. Advice is also sought from interests in other Departments and English Nature. The final decision is made by the Secretaries of State and the Minister of Agriculture acting jointly.

 We reached an understanding with the Spanish Government in October on the situation that prevailed from 1991 to 1997, when fishing in British waters around Gibraltar took place in moderation and the fishermen respected the authority of the Gibraltar law enforcement agencies. We agreed with the Spanish Government that we should revert to that situation. We nevertheless faced continuing difficulties on the water. On 27 January a Spanish fishing vessel was arrested. Fishermen demonstrated at the border on 29 January, preventing movement through it. We protested to the Spanish authorities about this. The fishermen and the Chief Minister of Gibraltar reached agreement on 3 February that satisfied them both, building on the understanding we had reached with Spain. These new arrangements have been working well in practice. We hope that they succeed in sorting out a problem that was causing difficulties in the region and in relations with Spain. We have always taken the view that any lasting solution to this problem must involve dialogue and cooperation at the local level.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary spoke on the telephone to the Spanish Foreign Minister on this subject on 11 February. The Embassy in Madrid has also raised it on several occasions recently with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have made it clear to the Spanish authorities that such delays are unjustifiable and unacceptable and that we look to them to allow movement across the border in conformity with EU obligations. We have also drawn the situation to the attention of the President of the European Commission.

<a name="90215w43.html_para2">According to the European Parliament, the cost of the new Parliamentary building in Strasbourg is currently estimated to be some 400 million euros. The European Parliament will have the option to purchase the new building under the terms of its lease and I understand it does

<P><I>15 Feb 1999 : Column: 588</I><P>
intend to exercise this option. This cost of purchase would be borne by the European Parliament's administrative budget, within the limit on annual resources set by the EC budget. The UK's contribution to the new Parliament building, after taking account of the effect of the abatement, will be around 5 per cent. of the total, i.e. broadly around 20 million euros.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The UK Government are discussing harmful tax competition issues with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and expect that they will play a full and constructive part in international initiatives on this subject.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> Total spending to combat fraud and financial mismanagement is not separately identified in the EC budget. For example, administration spending is classified according to its type (pay, stationery etc.) rather than aim (anti-fraud etc.). However, payment appropriations for a number of budget lines that relate primarily to the fight against fraud and financial mismanagement are given in the following table. In addition, the entire budget of the European Court of Auditors--amounting to some 66 million euros in 1999--is directed at cutting out fraud and financial mismanagement in the EC budget.

 As part of the Bank of England's involvement in various aspects of Euro preparatory work, they are participating in a pre-production trial for Euro notes. The printing trials of the Euro 5 and 20 are complete and the printing trial for the 50 is under way. There are no other Euro notes planned for trialing in the UK. Notes printed as part of the trial are for analytical and comparative purposes only and will not be issued.

 First, I must make it clear that only those traders whose taxable turnover exceeds &#163;50,000 are required to register for VAT.

<a name="90215w44.html_para4">The Government are very concerned about those traders who under-declare their true takings to avoid paying VAT or to avoid VAT registrations. Additional staff are being devoted to this work to counter fraud, avoidance and non-compliance. Within the UK there are now 135 outfield staff deployed regionally in Shadow Economy Teams whose prime function is to tackle traders fraudulently avoiding paying VAT, including failing to register for VAT. An additional objective of this activity is to provide a level playing field for the legitimate trade. The teams also liaise with and work closely with other Government Departments.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the annual average levy on a private healthcare insurance scheme as a result of the extension of insurance premium tax to such schemes in the 1997 Budget.  [70678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w45.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Insurance Premium Tax has applied to private medical insurance since the tax was introduced in 1994. The current rate is 4 per cent. In 1997, the legislation was amended to apply IPT again to a few insurance schemes that had been repackaged to benefit from the exemption for long-term policies. This protected &#163;70 million tax revenue potentially at risk and removed a distortion of competition.

<P>
<a name="90215w45.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many businesses have been affected, and by what average amount, as a result of the reduction in the <i>(a)</i> main and <i>(b)</i> small firms rate of corporation tax in the 1997 and 1998 budgets.  [70674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90215w45.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The reductions in the main rate of corporation tax will benefit some 40,000 companies and the reductions in the small companies' rate will benefit some 360,000 companies. The full effect of the April 1997 rate cuts will occur only in payments made in 1999-2000 and similarly the full effect of the small companies' rate cut in April 1999 will occur only in payments made in 2000-01. The 1 per cent. cut in the main rate in April 1999 will start to have an effect from 1999-2000 as these companies will by then be partly paying tax in quarterly instalments.
