 An assessment of the economic impact of the Single Payment Scheme in England has been placed in the House of Commons&#039; Library (and is available on the Defra website). Data are not available to enable an assessment to be made specifically of impacts within the National Park, but the report contains analysis relating to cattle and sheep farms in the Less Favoured Areas, which is the predominant farm type in National Parks.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make it his policy to continue carer&#039;s allowance payments to those entitled upon their take-up of state pension; and if he will make a statement. [200328]</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="41130w07.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 No. It is a basic principle of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for the same purpose. Even though the circumstances which give rise to entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance and state pension are different, they are both designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or foregone income. Carer&#039;s allowance replaces income where the carer is over working age or has to give up the chance of working to look after a severely disabled person, while state pension replaces income in retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41130w07.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_32">Carer&#039;s allowance is therefore not payable, or not payable in full, in addition to state pension. As the contributory benefit, the payment of state pension takes precedence, either extinguishing or reducing the payment of carer&#039;s allowance. Nevertheless, the income of a person in these circumstances will be at least as high as the rate of carer&#039;s allowance, and is usually higher. In addition, where the benefit cannot be paid, the person will keep underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance, which gives them access to the carer premium in housing benefit and council tax benefit and the additional amount for carers in state pension credit.

<a name="41130w07.html_para1">

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question asking how the calculations of the RPI and CPI made by the Office for National Statistics take into account changes in the standard quantities of the representative commodities contained in the indices.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84">Within each year, the RPI and CPI are fixed quantity consumer price indices. That is, changes in prices as measured by both indices are calculated as the change in the total cost to the average consumer of a basket of goods and services of fixed composition, quantity and quality.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85">In practice, this is achieved by <i>(a)</i> holding constant each year the sample of representative goods and services for which prices are collected each month in estimating price changes more generally; and <i>(b)</i> applying a fixed set of weights to price changes for each of the items such that their influence on the overall index reflects their importance in the typical household budget. In this way, changes in the RPI and CPI indices from month to month reflect only changes in prices, and not ongoing variations in consumer purchasing patterns.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_86">However, the contents of the RPI and CPI baskets of goods and services and associated expenditure weights are updated annually so that the indices remain representative of consumer spending patterns over time. This is important in helping to avoid potential biases in consumer price indices that might otherwise arise, for example, due to the development of entirely new goods and 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>30 Nov 2004 : Column 97W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>services, or the tendency for consumers to substitute purchases away from those particular goods and services for which prices have risen relatively rapidly.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87">For the RPI, changes to the items and weights are introduced in February each year, but with an overlapping collection of prices in January. This means that the figures for each year can be &#039;chain linked&#039; together to form a long-run price index spanning many years. This procedure ensures that the annual changes to the basket and weights have no impact on estimated changes in prices as measured by the RPI. The same basic approach is likewise adopted in the CPI although, for technical reasons, it is necessary to chain link the published index twice each year rather than only once as in the RPI.</p>

This assessment includes a consideration of all age groups within the population. There is some concern on the effects of some food additives on the behaviour of children but the assessment of the results of studies have shown that there is still significant scientific uncertainty. The FSA has commissioned a study into the effects of some colourings and preservatives on children&#039;s behaviour, and results are expected in spring 2007.

The approval process of flavourings is different. All flavourings and indeed, each constituent of a flavouring blend, must be safe under the terms of the Food Safety Act 1990.

The advice applies in all healthcare settings and to all age ranges. Trusts should regularly audit their control and restraint procedures consistent with the framework of clinical governance.
