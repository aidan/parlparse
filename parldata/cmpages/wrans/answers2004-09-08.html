 Records may at present be kept closed to public access longer than 30 years under s5(1) of the Public Records Act or specifically to prevent a breach of good faith under s5(2). S3(4) allows for retention in Departments beyond the 30 year period. In all these cases the approval of the relevant Minister and the Lord Chancellor, who takes account of the views of his

The 1993 Open Government White Paper set out the criteria against which applications for extended closure have been assessed.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if she will make a statement on the Hunting Bill.  [188252]</p>








<p><a name="40908w02.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government intends to fulfil its manifesto commitment to enable Parliament to deal with the issue of hunting with dogs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para8">
Some opponents of hunting want this issue to be dealt with as a matter of great urgency, while supporters of hunting want nothing to change and many other people regard it as being less important than many other policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para9">
The Government has made it clear that the issue does not have as high a priority as issues like jobs and schools and hospitals and transport, to name a few. But it is an issue that has absorbed an enormous amount of valuable Parliamentary time, over several years, and before the last election we acknowledged that it was time to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para10">
The Government has made efforts to find a constructive way forward, based on the evidence, through the Burns Committee Report and my own work which culminated in public hearings in Portcullis House in 2002. The proposals put to the House last year would have banned hunting except where a particular activity could be proved&#151;to the satisfaction of an independent tribunal&#151;to be necessary for pest control and to involve less suffering than available alternatives. The House decided by a substantial majority on a free vote to go further and require a complete ban apart from a few very restricted statutory exceptions.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Sept 2004 : Column 1248W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para11">
The Other Place then considered the Bill but failed to return it to this House before the end of the Session last November. That was disappointing and the only way the Government can be sure to fulfil its manifesto commitment is now to reintroduce the Bill in the form it left this House last year. I am therefore giving notice of the Bill&#039;s re-introduction in this House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para12">
It will be a matter for this House to decide, but the Government believes that the provisions of the Parliament Acts will be available if an unaltered Bill is sent to the Other Place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para13">
In addition to the Bill, I shall ask the House to agree a motion to commence the Bill&#039;s provisions in relation to hunting, but not hare-coursing events, two years after its enactment. Special procedures exist under the Parliament Act 1911 for changes to be made if agreed to by both Houses. This period will give those involved in hunting more than adequate time to cease the activities which are to be banned, for humane arrangements like the dispersal or re-homing of dogs, and for re-focusing any business activities on alternatives like drag-hunting or disposal of fallen stock if they wish to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w02.html_para14">
These welfare considerations do not apply to hare coursing events. Violence and intimidation associated with illegal coursing events is a real and pressing problem in many areas of the countryside today. We have received many representations asking us to take firm and speedy action to enable the police to tackle these associated evils. That can only be done if the nature of the relevant offences is changed from that of trespassing to the activity of hare-coursing itself, which is a clear provision of the Bill. There can be no justification for delaying further in giving the police the powers they need to crack down on the criminals involved. So the offences in the Bill banning hare-coursing events should continue to come into force three months after the Bill is passed.
</p>


<p>

The Government has condemned threats of illegal action by some supporters of hunting and believes that most people involved are law-abiding people who are prepared to respect the will of Parliament. Extra time for implementation will make it even clearer that illegal actions and threats or intimidation are totally unjustified. If people wish to continue their opposition to legislation, they have the option of the ballot box through which to express their views.

<a name="40908w02.html_para16">
Animal welfare is also a major consideration for the Government&#151;in terms of dogs and horses as well as the wild animals which are hunted. Dogs used for hunting are normally shot when they are no longer needed but the extra time for implementation will mean that there is even less reason for any suffering to be caused to them because of the ban. The RSPCA has offered to help with re-homing hounds&#151;an offer for which I am very grateful&#151;based on its experience of re-homing a considerable number of greyhounds each year. Drag-hunting offers alternative activities for those who have to give up hunting. And the horse industry in this country is buoyant, with increasing activity in a variety of leisure and sporting activities.

Older people are often among the poorest. The problems they face are therefore included in the policy analyses currently being carried out by DFID on chronic poverty and on social exclusion.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the use of speed limiters in lorries has been assessed to determine efficiency in preventing traffic accidents.  [187404]</p>








<p><a name="40908w04.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The accident involvement rate on motorways (per hundred million vehicle kms) fell from 6.4 for all HGVs in 1991 (before the mandatory fitting of speed limiters was introduced) to 4.3 in 2002&#151;which is a 34 per cent. decrease. This is significant, particularly as traffic volume increased by 33 per cent. over the same period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w04.html_para0">
The above figures include accidents involving currently non-speed limited HGVs between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes. However, the reduction in accidents for exclusively speed limited vehicles may be even more significant. Almost all articulated HGVs are speed limited and the accident involvement rate for that class of vehicle fell from 6.7 in 1991 to 3.9 in 2002&#151;a 42 per cent. decrease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w04.html_para1">
Other contributing factors may also have influenced that decline but speed limiters have clearly played a part.

Although it has been a requirement to fit speed limiters to vehicles over 7.5 tonnes since 1992, we have only been recording HGVs over 7.5 tonnes on our database as a separate category of vehicles since 1999. All of the accidents from 1999 onwards quoted above involved HGVs fitted with a speed limiter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w04.html_para3">
The rise in the number of accidents involving HGVs can largely be attributed to the increase in traffic&#151;indeed, the number of accidents involving all categories of vehicle has increased over the last 10 years. However, the accident rate per vehicle kilometres has changed little during the same time period and, in the case of HGVs, the accident rate per vehicle kilometres has actually fallen quite substantially since the introduction of speed limiters (a decrease of 34 per cent. between 1991 and 2002).

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister receives representations about the Supporting People programme from a wide variety of stakeholders, including local authorities, MPs, provider organisations and people who receive housing related support, including those with learning disabilities.

<p>
<a name="40908w06.html_para1">
The Independent Review was commissioned by the Government to look at value for money and the variation in dwelling costs and services across local authorities. The Review found wide variations in dwelling costs between authorities and that &#163;1.8 billion is too much to pay for the legacy services. Following this report, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertook a comprehensive programme of work on Supporting People programme to inform the Spending Review 2004. On this basis it was recently announced that the settlement for Supporting People is &#163;1.72 billion in 2005&#150;06 and around &#163;1.7 billion in each of the following two years. This is the first time that there has been a three-year settlement in the Supporting People programme. It will create stability for the programme and offer Administering Authorities and providers the opportunity to plan strategically and deliver good quality, value for money services over the next three years and beyond.

<p><a name="40908w07.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I am not familiar with the Issuing Section Service to which the right hon. Member refers. However the UK Immigration Service is committed to clearing bona fide passengers with minimal delay, and has set standards for passenger processing times, which comply with the international standards. These standards, which are embedded in the UK Immigration Service&#039;s annual business objectives and are kept under regular review, are to clear:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">100 per cent. of non-EEA passengers in 45 minutes;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">90 per cent. of non-EEA passengers in 30 minutes;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">EEA passengers with minimal delay.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w07.html_para3">
The UK Immigration Service currently clear 99 per cent. of non-EEA passengers in less than 45 minutes, and 98 per cent. of non-EEA passengers in less than 30 minutes. Although there is no specific measurement of the time taken to process EEA passengers, close monitoring of passenger flows and effective deployment of staff ensure EEA passengers are cleared with minimal delay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w07.html_para4">
The UK Immigration Service&#039;s performance is also measured independently against the British Airports Authority (BAA) quality of service standards, which includes queuing times. The Immigration Service continues to score well against this measure.

 The UK enjoys a constructive relationship with Moldova and has a strong interest in its security and development.

The United States amended its border security legislation on 9 August, extending the deadline by one year to 26 October 2005 for countries in the VWP to introduce a biometric identifier in new passports.

The UK&#039;s biometric passport programme, on which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is working closely under the Home Office&#039;s lead, involves the introduction of cutting edge technology.

<p><a name="40908w11.html_wqn8"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the differences between the interventions that can be made by a general practitioner when dealing with a patient and a prison doctor when dealing with a prisoner.  [187376]</p>








<p><a name="40908w11.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 It would not be practicable to attempt to do so. The Prison Service&#039;s standard, &quot;Health Services for Prisoners&quot;, has as its overall objective to provide prisoners with access to the same range and quality of services as the general public receives from the national health service. The prison health team is leading and managing a programme of work to develop health services for prisoners that are in line with NHS practice. However, the reality of the prison environment means that it may not always be possible exactly to replicate in prisons every treatment intervention that is available in the community.

<p><a name="40908w11.html_wqn9"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what rights a prisoner has to access needle exchange schemes in prison.  [187377]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Sept 2004 : Column 1282W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40908w11.html_spnew9"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 There are no present plans to introduce needle exchange schemes in prisons, although the position is kept under review.


</p>







<p><a name="40908w11.html_wqn10"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health in what circumstances a prison doctor may order <i>(a)</i> physical restraints and <i>(b)</i> detention of a prisoner in a special cell.  [187378]</p>








<p><a name="40908w11.html_spnew10"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Prison Service&#039;s standard, &quot;Health Services for Prisoners&quot;, provides that treatment and emergency care of patients who withhold consent is to be managed in accordance with Prison Service Instruction 38/2002, &quot;Guidance on Consent to Medical Treatment&quot;. The associated Prison Service Information and Practice Note 3/2002 sets out the requirements and procedures for dealing with prisoners when there are restraint and control implications alongside health needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w11.html_para3">
Prison Service Order 1600, &quot;Use of Force&quot;, states that a prisoner may be placed in a special cell only on the prior authority of the governor or controller in charge of the establishment. If he/she cannot be contacted, the decision may be taken by the officer for the time being in charge of the establishment. A prison doctor must be notified as soon as possible and must examine the prisoner as soon as practicable for any clinical contra-indications.


</p>







<p><a name="40908w11.html_wqn11"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what rights a prisoner has to medical confidentiality.  [187585]</p>









<p><a name="40908w11.html_spnew11"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The duty of confidentiality arising from the common law of confidentiality, professional obligations and contracts of employment owed by all healthcare professionals to their patients extends to people in prison. The Prison Service&#039;s standard, &quot;Health Services for Prisoners&quot;, stipulates that medical information on prisoners must be managed in accordance with relevant legislation, principally the Data Protection Act 1998, and the National Health Service Code of Practice on confidentiality.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what right a homosexual prisoner has to <i>(a)</i> HIV tests and <i>(b)</i> access to condoms.  [187586]</p>








<p><a name="40908w11.html_spnew12"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Prisoners have access to HIV-test counselling and where appropriate, testing in the same way as members of the public. Prison doctors have been advised that they should make condoms available to any prisoner, on application, if in their clinical judgment there is a risk of infection from HIV.


</p>







<p><a name="40908w11.html_wqn13"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what right a prisoner has to see <i>(a)</i> a doctor, <i>(b)</i> a dentist, <i>(c)</i> a chiropodist, <i>(d)</i> a gynaecologist and <i>(e)</i> a specialist or surgeon.  [187587]</p>








<p><a name="40908w11.html_spnew13"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The overall objective of the Prison Service&#039;s standard, &quot;Health Services for Prisoners&quot;, is to provide prisoners with access to the same range and quality of services as the general public receives from the national health service. Establishments are required to develop needs-based health services in partnership with local primary care trusts and other NHS agencies which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Sept 2004 : Column 1283W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
deliver effective, evidence-based care to individual prisoners and the prison population as a whole. Each establishment must have a clear and observed policy statement about what primary care, dental and other specialist services are available to prisoners, and who is responsible for providing them.

<p><a name="40908w12.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Part one of the national service framework for renal services sets out the steps the national health service can take to support delivery of the standards and markers of good practice. A separate delivery strategy is therefore unnecessary as it is integral to the document.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health who will have responsibility for monitoring the progress made by primary care trusts in implementing the five steps that need to be taken by 2006 which were outlined in the recently published first two modules of the Renal Services national service framework; and what action will be taken in the event that primary care trusts do not implement those five steps.  [187590]</p>








<p><a name="40908w12.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Primary care trusts are accountable to strategic health authorities for monitoring and managing progress against the national service framework (NSF) for renal services.

Notes:<br>

1. An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Periods of care ongoing at the end of the data year (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>





3. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. All operations count of episodes: these figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002&#150;03) operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br>

The information in this table relates to individual taxpayers, not households, who are aged 65 and above. This table does not include female taxpaying pensioners aged between 60 and 65. It shows there were about 4.1 million pensioners taxpayers aged 65 or over in the UK in 2001&#150;02, with income tax liability of &#163;8.2 billion.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are weekly amounts in 2004&#150;05 price terms and are rounded to the nearest &#163;1. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2. The weekly level of guarantee credit when this individual reaches state pension age in 2045 is estimated at &#163;236, and at &#163;287 10 years later when the man would be 75. Actual pension credit entitlement depends on both state and private income, savings as well as household circumstances.<br>

3. Currently basic and additional state pension are uprated in line with a minimum of prices and therefore remain constant in real terms.<br>

4. Future policy on calculation and uprating of benefits is for future Parliaments to determine. For the purposes of these projections, it has been assumed that (except where stated) all elements of state pension are uprated in line with prices once in payment and the guarantee credit rises in line with average earnings. Long term assumptions are in line with those for Budget 2004.<br>

5. It is assumed that a man starts paying Class 1 national insurance contributions at age 25 following nine years without any credits and contributes for 40 years.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Where the current state second pension accrual rate is sufficient to ensure the combined value of basic state pension and state second pension exceeds the value of the guarantee credit, this has been denoted as &quot;Current&quot;.<br>

2. The current underlying rate of accrual is 20 per cent. however state second pension is accrued at different rates for different bands of earnings. The rate shown here is the underlying rate that determines the rate in different bands. For example, the person earning &#163;10,000 per year has an accrual rate in state second pension of 40 per cent., which is twice the underlying rate of 20 per cent.<br>

3. Future policy on calculation and uprating of benefits is for future Parliaments to determine.

<p><a name="40908w14.html_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The new member states have been integrated into the Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the member states and the Community, for the period 2003&#150;05 (BEPGs).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w14.html_para3">
The 2004 BEPG update highlighted country specific economic measures and priorities that each member state should undertake. Under &quot;economic reforms to raise Europe&#039;s growth&quot; potential, the Commission also suggested that the existing guidelines aiming at &#039;more and better jobs&#039; and at &#039;increasing productivity and business dynamism&#039; be implemented in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way by the new member states. Given the labour market situation is considerably worse in the new member states, the BEPGs recommend that policy efforts concentrate on a small number of priority areas that are likely to have the largest impact on labour market performances: ensuring that real wage developments reflect productivity growth; improving the financial incentives to work by reforming tax/benefit systems; improving skills and training, through the

provisions of lifelong learning facilities; and undertaking appropriate reforms of labour market regulations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w14.html_para4">
The BEPGs also indicate that R and D diffusion and technology transfers will be as important as R and D investment in accelerating the transition towards higher value-added activities. Sustaining a high level of foreign direct investment is essential, as is an increased responsiveness of the education and training systems to the changing needs of the labour market.

<p><a name="40908w15.html_spnew6"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I believe the hon. Gentleman is referring to the removal of payable tax credits on dividends. This was one element of a package of measures, including lower corporation tax rates and increased capital allowances, designed to encourage investment and economic growth. Therefore it would be misleading to assess the impact of one measure in isolation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w15.html_para2">
Furthermore, the Government has introduced a number of measures to encourage saving since 1999, such as reducing the rate of tax on dividends from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. for starting and basic rate taxpayers; introducing the lower rate of tax for savings of 10 per cent. and the Individual Savings Account. The ISA has been very successful, with around 15 million savers&#151;one in three adults&#151;subscribing around &#163;140 billion into their ISAs since they came into effect in April 1999.

 ISAs form one part of the Governments approach to savings linking with policies such as the new Child Trust Fund, reductions in the tax on Capital Gains for business assets from 40 per cent. to 10 per cent. and radical simplification of pensions with a lifetime limit of &#163;1.5m.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w15.html_para3">
A reduction from &#163;7,000 to &#163;5,000 a year may affect the allocation of savings between savings products for those currently investing more than &#163;5,000 a year in an ISA. The overall effect on such savers behaviour is uncertain. We shall continue to keep the approach to savings policy under review.

The Government are committed to a waste management strategy which makes use of a range of policies, including spending, regulation and taxation. The standard rate of landfill tax is due to increase by &#163;3/tonne next year and by at least &#163;3/tonne in subsequent years on the way to a medium to long-term rate of &#163;35/tonne. Any decisions about the rate of increases in the landfill tax will be made as part of the Budget process, taking account of all relevant policy measures and a range of social, environmental and economic factors.

 The level of pension contributions in the economic forecast underlying the Budget 2004 non-North Sea corporation tax forecasts is circumscribed by the assumption made about the factor income shares of GDP. The assumption used is that in the medium-term, when GDP grows at the underlying trend rate, the factor shares of GDP are broadly constant. This assumption was re-examined by the National Audit Office for Budget 2004, and their conclusion was that it remained a reasonable one.

The information in this table relates to individual taxpayers, not households, who are aged 65 and above. This table does not include female taxpaying pensioners aged between 60 and 65. It shows there were about 4.1 million pensioners taxpayers aged 65 or over in the UK in 2001&#150;02, with income tax liability of &#163;8.2 billion.

The &#163;1.5 million lifetime allowance to be introduced from April 2006 broadly replicates the maximum fund an individual can accrue under the current occupational pension rules. The exchequer impact of introducing a lower allowance would depend upon uncertain changes in the pensions savings of individuals at or approaching the lower lifetime allowance and any consequent changes to other parts of the new regime resulting from a lower allowance. Due to the uncertainty of estimating the size and direction of these behavioural effects no estimates are available.

The Ministry of Defence keeps the size and location of its bases under constant review. Building on initial work that has been done to identify the MOD&#039;s core sites, the Department is undertaking further work to examine where estate rationalisation may be possible. This work is consistent with the Department&#039;s contribution to the Government&#039;s Independent Review of Public Sector Rationalisation&#151;the &quot;Lyons Review&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w18.html_para5">
On 21 July we announced a number of specific reviews. These were: a review of the Defence Logistics Organisation&#039;s locations; a review of Defence Airfields; and a review of Royal Marines Basing, each of which may result in the relocation of civilian personnel. In addition, a number of relocations relating to the RAF&#039;s review of Air Combat Service Units and other minor units were announced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w18.html_para6">
The MOD submitted a significant package of relocation proposals to the Lyons Review, which would result in around 3,900 service and civilian personnel relocating out of London and the South East by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w18.html_para7">
The proposals consist of the closure of Woolwich Station in Greenwich, the closure of the Army Technical Foundation College (ATFC) at Arborfield, relocation of the Disposal Services Agency (DSA) to the West Country, collocation of Defence Medical Services Training Centre (DMSTC) facilities and rationalisation of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories (DSTL).

The manpower released from the reduction of four infantry battalions equates to approximately 2,500 posts, all of which will be reinvested back in to the Army. While a proportion of these will be reallocated back into the infantry itself to develop more robust and resilient establishments, others will be reinvested in the most heavily committed specialists such as logisticians, engineers, signallers and intelligence. Exact details in terms of the numbers allocated to each individual Arms and Service have yet to be fully worked through and finalised.

 Dissident republicans are a threat, although many of their activities have been thwarted, intercepted or nullified by the security forces. We remain concerned at the level of paramilitary activity and control exercised within communities by both Republican and Loyalist paramilitary organisations. The Independent Monitoring Commission will report again on this area next month.

<p><a name="40908w20.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 In 1998 the Loyalist Volunteer Force carried out an act of decommissioning in Northern Ireland. The IRA have carried out three acts of decommissioning (2001, 2002 and 2003). In the latest act of decommissioning by the IRA (2003) the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported that the arms comprised light, medium and heavy ordnance and associated munitions. They included automatic weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive material.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w20.html_para2">
These acts of decommissioning have put arms beyond use which otherwise could have been used in acts of terrorism. This is the start of a process that will ultimately result in all paramilitary weaponry being put beyond use and return Northern Ireland to a normal democratic society.

The licences are granted by district councils and are subject to certain terms, conditions and restrictions that councils may specify. Councils do not have powers under the 1985 Order to refuse entertainments licences in respect of places where circuses are to be held simply because they involve animals. However, like all landowners, councils can decide whether circuses, or other types of public entertainment, may be held on their properties.

 Intensive negotiations took place in July between officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel and trade union representatives.

The trade union also met with the Secretary of State on 23 July. On 3 August management tabled two offers to the trade union&#151;a 12-month offer worth 3.49 per cent. and a 16-month offer worth 4.65 per cent. Both offers were quickly rejected and further negotiations took place on 4, 11 and 13 August. Following these further negotiations two final offers were made to the trade union on 16 August that took account of the trade unions views&#151;the previous 12 month offer worth 3.49 per cent. and a revised 16-month offer worth 4.65 per cent. The revised offer included an increase in rates of pay of 2 per cent. plus a non-consolidated payment of &#163;150 for all staff. These offers are now being considered by the trade union.

<p><a name="40908w22.html_spnew3"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The Department of Health&#039;s performance assessment framework applies only to the NHS in England. Northern Ireland has its own system of integrated health and social care&#151;the HPSS (Health and Personal Social Services). Under current arrangements, key service development priorities are set annually for the HPSS. Progress towards their achievement is formally managed and monitored by the Department, and work is now in hand to further develop the approach to HPSS performance assessment and reporting. While basing itself on the integrated nature of services in Northern Ireland, that work has been informed by the various performance assessment models that operate elsewhere in the UK.

<p><a name="40908w24.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 The report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland recommended that &quot;an immediate and substantial investment should be made in a research programme to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative to the Plastic Baton Round&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w24.html_para0">
In response, a Northern Ireland Office led steering group was set up. The fourth report of the steering group, published on 29 January this year, concluded that there was no commercially available product that met these criteria and that the focus should be on the development of two distinct new projectiles: the Attenuating Energy Projectile (AEP) and the Discriminating Irritant Projectile (DIP). Detailed research has concluded that both of these rounds represent a less potentially lethal alternative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w24.html_para1">
The Government remains committed to developing an effective, less potentially lethal alternative and, as announced, it is hoped that the AEP will be ready for operational deployment before summer 2005. The Government are also committed to equipping the PSNI with a broader range of public order equipment that might reduce the need to resort to the use of this new projectile.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40908w24.html_para2">
The ACPO guidance on the use of baton rounds published on 8 December 2003 makes clear that baton rounds should only be used in a public order situation where other policing methods to restore or sustain public order have failed or must be unlikely to succeed, and where the use of the round is judged necessary to reduce a serious risk of loss of life or serious injury. It also states that baton rounds are designed to provide a less lethal option in dealing with threats of serious violence and provide an effective means by which individuals armed with petrol bombs or other weapons can be kept at a distance, contained or dispersed.

 The responses to the consultation on the recommendations of the Burns Report showed a diversity of views on the issue of academic selection. Of the 16 per cent. of the population who responded to the household response forms, 64 per cent. were opposed to the abolition of academic selection, as were 37 per cent. of the schools that responded, the Governing Bodies Association, the Institute of Directors, Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party and the Secondary Heads Association. Those in favour of abolishing academic selection included 36 per cent. of the respondents to the household response forms, 73% of the schools that responded, the five education and library boards, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Fein, the Progressive Unionist Party, the Women&#039;s Coalition, the Workers Party, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the five main teachers&#039; unions. There was conditional support for ending academic selection from the Northern Catholic Bishops, the Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment, the Confederation of British Industry, and the Catholic Heads Association.

The Costello Working Group took account of all the consultation responses and the Government have accepted that Group&#039;s recommendations that it is educationally unsound to select pupils and commit them to particular pathways at age 11 and also unsound to believe that the more able should follow only academic courses.

 Information on the number of people who have stopped smoking is not available for each of the last five years. However, an indication on the number of people who have stopped smoking in Northern Ireland is available from the Continuous Household Survey (CHS), which biennially includes questions about smoking. Estimates of the number of people who have stopped smoking in Northern Ireland are as follows:

These percentages have been applied to the mid-year estimate population numbers to produce an estimated figure for the number of people in Northern Ireland who stopped smoking in the previous year.<br>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 500.<br>
