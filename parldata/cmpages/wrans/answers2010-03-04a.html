 The Government provided a range of additional support to pensioners through the recent economic downturn and continues to provide support during the early stages of economic recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="100304w0003.htm_para10"><a name="10030461000292">In his pre-Budget report statement on 24 November 2008 the Chancellor announced the intention to give every pensioner a one-off payment of £60 on top of the regular £10 Christmas bonus received in December 2008. This was paid as a one-off increase to the Christmas bonus for 2008 only and was paid to all qualifying recipients of the Christmas bonus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="100304w0003.htm_para11"><a name="10030461000293">The payment provided additional direct financial support to help vulnerable groups through the economic downturn. In total the additional £60 payments cost around £900 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="100304w0003.htm_para12"><a name="10030461000294">The Government made an additional payment alongside the winter fuel payment for winters 2008-09 and 2009-10 of £50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and £100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. This means the winter fuel payments have been £250 and £400 respectively which provides a significant contribution towards an older person's winter fuel bill. Cold weather payments for the winter of 2008-09 and 2009-10 have also been increased from £8.50 to £25.00 providing additional support to the most vulnerable. With the exception of those living in certain accommodation such as care homes, all pensioners on pension credit will qualify for a cold weather payment when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be 0° C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the eligible customer's postcode.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="100304w0003.htm_para13"><a name="10030461000295">In April 2010, the Government have committed to increase the basic state pension by 2.5 per cent. This commitment, first given in 2001, was confirmed in the Chancellor's 2009 pre-Budget report, despite the negative growth for the September 2009 retail prices index, providing a real-terms boost to basic state pension. This means that in 2010-11, pensioners will have seen a long-term real increase of 12 per cent. in their basic state pension, which is over £10 per week, since 1997.</p>

That is a real terms increase of more than a third for the poorest pensioners since 1997. The 2 per cent. increase ensures that the vast majority of the poorest pensioners will be able to see the full benefit of the 2.5 per cent. increase in the basic state pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="100304w0003.htm_para16"><a name="10030461000298">This change will benefit around 500,000 pensioners and will mean around 88 per cent. of pension credit recipients will have all of their capital ignored in their pension credit assessment.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has not commissioned specific research into the means by which illicit mobile phones are brought into prisons. However, phones enter prisons by the same routes as other contraband: visitors; over the wall; post and parcels; reception; and remand prisoners and staff.</p>

He recognised the link between the availability of phones in prisons and the smuggling of illicit drugs. NOMS is determined to address the risks that mobile phones present to security and to the safety of the public. Our strategy is to: minimise the number of mobile phones entering prisons; find mobile phones that are smuggled into prisons; and disrupt mobile phones that we cannot find.</p>

 Crowding levels are set and managed carefully by the National Offender Management Service. Prison crowding occurs when the number of prisoners in an accommodation unit exceeds the certified normal capacity (CNA) of that unit. A prison's "certified normal accommodation" (CNA) is therefore its agreed capacity when there is no crowding. A prison's "operational capacity" is the maximum number of prisoners it is allowed to hold over and above CNA taking into account control, security and the proper operation of regimes. In addition operational managers must ensure that each cell used for the confinement of prisoners has sufficient heating, lighting and ventilation and is of adequate size for the number of prisoners to be held in it. Operational capacity in prisons is set by Directors of Offender Management on behalf of the Secretary of State in both publicly managed and contracted establishments.</p>

 EU rules for organic production (contained in Council Regulation 834/2007 and Commission Regulation 889/2008) require organic livestock to be fed entirely on organically produced feed. However, until 1 January 2012, they also permit 5 per cent. of the feed for organic pigs and poultry to be composed of conventionally produced materials when sufficient organic feed cannot be obtained. This concession currently allows for difficulties with sourcing protein ingredients for organic pig and poultry feed to be accommodated. DEFRA's Advisory Committee on Organic Standards is investigating the role that fishmeal can play, as a protein source for organic pig and poultry feed, when the requirement for these animals to be given 100 per cent. organic feed begins on 1 January 2012.</p>

 Industrial fishing is the term applied to fishing activity where the catch is intended for processing into fish meal and oil rather than for human consumption. Industrial fishing uses smaller meshed nets than human consumption fisheries as they are targeting fish which are small even when fully grown and this will inevitably lead to the capture of small, often immature, individuals of other species.</p>

Local studies of cod, haddock and whiting predation on sandeels before and after the closure was introduced in 2000, found no evidence of an effect, although the reduction in fishing mortality did lead to an increase in the abundance of age one and older sandeels. The lack of a fishing effect probably had more to do with the difference in the age of sandeel taken by these predators and the fishery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100304w0011.htm_para6"><a name="10030461001042">The cod, haddock and whiting in this study mostly fed on young sandeels of the year, whereas the fishery targeted age one and older sandeels. The local abundance of cod and haddock in the study-region reflected wider North sea wide trends, suggesting that local conditions were not determining abundance. Had there been significant numbers of large cod and haddock in the region, then competition between the sandeel fishery and these species may have been more important, since the size and age of sandeels taken is limited by predator size.</p>

 Government policy is to manage waste as far up the waste hierarchy as possible-with energy from waste ranking higher than landfill but below waste prevention, re-use, and recycling. The Government's view of incineration and similar technologies is that they form just one among several approaches, all of which are needed for sustainable and effective waste management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="100304w0011.htm_para8"><a name="10030461001048">It is recognised that there will always be some waste streams that cannot be re-used, recycled or composted and recovering energy from that waste, including by incineration, results in less greenhouse gas emissions compared to the alternative of landfill. Producing energy from this waste, which would otherwise have gone to landfill, not only contributes to reducing carbon emissions, but also counts towards our renewable energy targets by displacing fossil fuel power generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="100304w0011.htm_para9"><a name="10030461001049">The choice in technology needs to reflect local circumstances, with reference to the relevant waste strategies and plans, so that proposed waste incineration plants are of an appropriate type and scale and do not prejudice the achievement of local, regional or national waste management targets.</p>

The UK responded to both sets of comments on 15 February 2010.

 Our policies and legislation since 1997 have provided a new framework benefitting all local transport authorities. The framework gives greater certainty of funding, while encouraging more strategic transport planning with local consultation, and increasing local flexibility and discretion over resources. It has been accompanied by a significant increase in capital funding: support from the Department for transport investment in North East Lincolnshire, within which transport authority Great Grimsby falls, has more than doubled over the last decade.</p>

The £523,000 award facilitated the introduction of high-frequency services on routes 13 and 14, linking the area's main residential estates with Grimsby and Cleethorpes town centres. It was accompanied by an investment of almost £2 million by Stagecoach in 23 new low-floor buses for the service.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 February 2010]:</i> All foreign nationals subject to removal will be considered by National Offender Management Service under the early removals scheme (ERS), which allows for early removal up to a maximum of 270 days prior to the halfway point of the sentence, subject to the serving of a requisite period. Since 2008, the UKBA has removed approximately 11,000 foreign national prisoners. Of these, approximately a quarter were removed before the end of the sentence under the ERS and approximately 30 per cent. were removed under the facilitated returns scheme.</p>

 Information on time spent on patrol and paperwork was collected between 2003-04 and 2007-08 as part of the frontline policing measure and is set out in the following table. Information was not collected on time spent on patrol in cars and on foot. To reduce paperwork burdens on police officers the collection of data about time spent by officers on police activities ceased after 2007-08 in response to the recommendations by Sir David Normington in his review of data burdens placed by the Government on the police service published in February 2009.</p>

It only measures the time an officer is engaged on no other activity but patrol, for example as soon as they respond to an incident they are counted against that activity and not patrol. It is therefore inappropriate to look at the patrol element in isolation from the rest of the frontline policing measure.</p>

 The Department invested additional funds in contraception services in April 2008 (£12.8 million), September 2008 (£10 million) and April 2009 (£11.6 million). In each of the last five quarters (July 2008 to September 2009), the abortion rate was lower than the corresponding quarter in the preceding year. As these decreases in the abortion rate coincide with the period in which the additional investment was available, we believe that the additional investment, and other measures we have taken, has made a contribution towards the decreases in the abortion rate.</p>

Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), <i> Official Report</i>, 23 February 2010, column 466W which gave estimates for the amount of biomass needed for new power stations. For existing heat and power installations, the Department's Digest of UK Energy Statistics shows that in 2008 3.23 million tonnes (oil equivalent) of biomass were used to generate electricity and 0.74 million tonnes (oil equivalent) of biomass were used to generate heat. Assuming an average energy value of 18 gigajoules per tonne of biomass, this gives a total of 7.5 million tonnes of biomass for electricity generation and 1.7 million tonnes of biomass for heat generation.</p>

We already require sustainability reporting under the renewables obligation. This requirement was introduced in April 2009 and the first reporting cycle is due later this year.

 The principal funding mechanism for demonstrating low carbon and energy efficiency technologies in 2008-09 was the Environmental Transformation Fund (ETF). In 2008-09 it spent £92 million.

In addition to the ETF, in Budget 2009, we announced up to £90 million for FEED studies in support of the first CCS demonstration competition, and a further £45 million for microgeneration. Budget 2009 also announced £155 million for low carbon technologies in 2009-10 and 2010-11.

 Data for earnings are not available at the constituency level because of small sample sizes at these levels in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="100304w0022.htm_para6"><a name="10030476000092">Due to rounding in the conversion of payroll data into hourly wage rates and small sample sizes for 18 to 21-year-olds in ASHE, it is not possible at the regional level to infer the number of employees earning exactly at the National Minimum Wage (NMW) with sufficient certainty. However it is possible to estimate the number who were paid at or below the NMW.</p>

The number of jobholders aged 22 and over who were paid at or below the NMW in Scotland was 51,000.</p>
