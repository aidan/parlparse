 I take a close interest in energy prices in Wales.

In its initial findings Ofgem concluded that people in Wales did pay more for their electricity due to a number of factors. I understand that Ofgem will be publishing new licensing conditions to help tackle some of these issues next month with a view to introducing them by the autumn.</p>

 The Government recognise the negative impacts of stacking on operational efficiency and the environment. The &#145;Future of Air Transport&#146; White Paper encourages making better use of existing airport capacity and supports the delivery of two new runways in the south-east. Implementing that policy should reduce the need for stacking. In particular, the Government's recent confirmation of its support for a third runway at Heathrow should help to reduce the need for stacking at that airport where lack of runway capacity is a significant contributory factor. However, runway capacity is not the only relevant factor, and that is why the UK also strongly supports optimising the use of airspace, including through implementation of the Single European Sky.</p>

 The Government have made funding available to enable the Environment Agency to develop an end-of-waste protocol for waste cooking oils. Waste cooking oil which is treated to the standards set out in the protocol is accepted by the agency to have been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste. The protocol applies to the production of biodiesel for use in automotive engines. The question of whether waste cooking oil has been fully recovered so that it ceases to be waste before it is used as fuel in other circumstances is one that must be determined on the facts of each case and taking into account relevant case law on the definition of waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="90325w0003.htm_para1"><a name="09032544000587">This funding has been devolved to regional development agencies to decide how it is spent in their regions to create a sustainable countryside and communities where people want to live, work and visit, now and in the future. The funding will help business to make use of the natural and cultural resources in England&#146;s rural areas to attract visitors and create new employment opportunities through the development of the tourism sector. Around &#163;5.8 million has already been committed by the regional development agencies to projects and programmes of investment that support rural tourism.</p>

This was because the information was deemed by the Tote to be commercially sensitive as it would allow its competitors to benchmark machine performance and inform their choices. That position has not altered and the Tote remains of the view that machine revenue is commercially sensitive information.</p>

However, the validation processes relate to quarterly rather than monthly data and therefore quarterly data for detection rates for violence against the person are given in the table.

 The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains critical. The expulsion of 13 international NGOs and the closure of three national NGOs risks having a devastating impact. The UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs initially estimated that up to 1 million people could lose access to drinking water and sanitation, and up to 1.5 million will lose access to healthcare. We believe the Government of Sudan should reconsider this decision for the sake of their own people.</p>

Special dedicated antisocial behaviour response courts have been established in magistrates' courts sitting in their civil capacity to ensure that witness issues are addressed.

More importantly, the first nation to benefit from the initiative, the Czech Republic, deploys three helicopters to Afghanistan this year. Since the summit three other nations have also made a commitment to deploy helicopters and projects launched through the Helicopter Initiative will make a substantial and essential contribution to their theatre-entry equipment upgrades  <br>

 The UK commitment to the EU Battlegroup roster for January to July 2010 will be met by forces from the Small Scale Contingency Battlegroup element of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF). As this is a national high readiness contingency which is already on stand-by during the relevant period, there is no additional cost to the UK of providing an EU Battlegroup on stand-by. The Small Scale Contingency Battlegroup will consist of forces drawn from the longstanding UK-Netherlands Amphibious Landing Force. As with all NATO activities, the principle of funding for the UK-Netherlands Amphibious Landing Force is that costs lie where they fall; each nation therefore pays its own costs.</p>

The cost to the UK of deploying an EU Battlegroup would depend on the nature and length of any deployment.</p>

 Order dates (when build contracts were let) are provided in the following table for the Queen Elizabeth Class carriers, the Astute Class submarines and the Type 45 destroyers. As there is no requirement to keep contractual information for Royal Navy and Royal Auxiliary vessels beyond seven years, order dates for all other vessels built since 1979 are no longer held. The table does, however, include details of when building work commenced on these other vessels as this is the next significant milestone following the order date.</p>

 The information is in the following table, and provides separate data for unfilled and notified vacancies to give the fullest picture of the number of Jobcentre Plus vacancies in any particular constituency. The labour market is dynamic and many new vacancies are filled so quickly they do not appear in the statistics for live unfilled vacancies, which are based on a snapshot of the vacancies available on a particular day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="90325w0021.htm_para11"><a name="09032563002941">The coverage of these figures relates only to Jobcentre Plus notified and unfilled vacancies. Many vacancies come up through other recruitment channels and the proportion accounted for by Jobcentre Plus is likely to vary over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Estimates of the number of unfilled job vacancies across the economy as a whole are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.</p>

1. Data are unrounded.<br>
2. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre and post May 2006. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. Notified vacancies. Monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br>
4. The median duration (in days) is calculated by ranking all the vacancies in order of ascending duration and taking the middle value. Half the vacancies will have a duration greater than the median, and half will have a duration less than the median. For most purposes, the median will give a more representative measure of the average duration; a mean figure tends to be distorted by a small number of vacancies that have very long durations.<br>

1. Data are unrounded.<br>
2. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre and post May 2006. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
4. Notified vacancies. Monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br>
5. The stocks of Live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open.<br>
6. To provide a geographic breakdown, in most cases the postcode of the vacancy is used to allocate the vacancy to a local area. Where this is missing or invalid, the employers' postcode or the postcode of the local Jobcentre Plus office is used.<br>
7. These figures are published at<br>
www.nomisweb.co.uk<br>
8. Parliamentary constituencies and local authority areas are often a poor match for local labour markets. The number and range of jobs available to people within normal travel to work distances often extend well beyond immediate constituency and local authority boundaries.<br>

 We are still consulting on the shortlisted locations, so at this stage in the process we have not undertaken detailed assessments. However, the Financial Viability Study, which we published on 5 March 2009, provides an initial high level assessment on whether an eco-town could be economically viable and as part of this looks at transport costs. We will consider this along with consultation responses and the further assessment work that has been undertaken when we take decisions on the final shortlist of locations with potential to be an eco-town.</p>

 We do not hold this information centrally. Empty dwelling management orders (EDMOs) are part of a wider range of powers available to local authorities to tackle empty homes in their area. We want to encourage voluntary reoccupation of empty homes but this can only work where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy. We are confident that the legislation is beginning to work well and local authorities claim that in many cases the threat of an EDMO has been sufficient to make owners take action to bring long-term empty homes back into use.</p>

 The Government are committed to addressing overcrowding and to updating the statutory standards.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government how much was paid per home to each local authority which has opted for large-scale voluntary transfer of their housing stock in each year since 1997. [264996]</p>

 The following table incorporates information the Department holds on gross transfer values and dwelling numbers where local authorities received payment from the receiving local authority following the transfer of social housing under large scale voluntary transfer arrangements since 1997. Exact information on payments received by a local authority from the registered social landlord for a particular transfer would need to be ascertained from the local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_584"><a name="90325w0027.htm_para14"><a name="09032563004608">The values shown in the table are in respect of the gross transfer price for all positive value stock transfer where local authorities should have received a payment. In arriving at such values the Department and local authorities use a model agreed with HM Treasury to establish a 30 year tenanted market value (TMV) of the dwellings to be transferred. The TMV reflects the intended continued use of the properties for social housing: it is always less than the open market value. The TMV is calculated as the net present value of the RSL&#146;s projected stream of income from renting out the transferred stock, less its planned expenditure (including investment) stream. The precise details of payments received by LAs would need to be requested from LAS themselves.</p>

 The Tenant Services Authority has no responsibilities in respect of leaseholders who own 100 per cent. of the interest in their homes. Leaseholders already have access to a wide range of protections and rights. The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 limits the Tenant Services Authority&#146;s future regulatory remit to &#145;social housing&#146;, which includes low cost rental and low cost home ownership accommodation as defined in sections 69-70 of the Act (including some types of &#147;shared ownership&#148; agreement), but not other owner-occupied homes or the private rented sector. However the Tenant Services Authority is likely to be interested in how registered providers deliver management across their stock.</p>

 The ELQ policy fundamentally addresses the perennial need of employers for a greater proportion of the population to acquire higher level skills because it represents a redistribution of funding from those who have already benefited from higher education to first time entrants. The policy also seeks to supply employers with more of the graduates they need most. Students co-funded by employers and those studying for foundation degrees are exempt from the policy and strategically important science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects still attract institutional funding when studied as an ELQ. To discern whether there is more the policy can do we have instructed HEFCE in their current review of the impact of the ELQ policy that, while they should continue to prioritise first time students, they should seek to assist universities in responding to the economic circumstances if appropriate changes are suggested by the evidence.</p>

<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br>

The initiative is now led by the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) which has been working with key stakeholders in the development of a toolkit to assist national health service organisations in the implementation of the &#145;10 Key Characteristics of Good Nutritional Care&#146;. A factsheet relating to Protected Mealtimes was developed and launched in April 2008 and the NPSA will be launching the complete toolkit later this year.</p>

 The following table provides estimates of the number of alcohol-related admissions to hospital for miscarriage. These estimates have been calculated by multiplying the total number of admissions to hospital miscarriages within each age group by the fraction of cases that, according to epidemiological research, can be attributed to alcohol.

<i> General</i><br>
Strategic health authorities were reconfigured between 2005-06 and 2006-07. Separate figures for South Central and South East Coast SHAs are only available for the period from 2006-07. A total for the South East is provided for the period up to 2005-06.<br>
Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol.<br>
Details of the proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br>
Figures for under 16s are excluded because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s.<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in hospital episode statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
 Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of episodes to years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>

 It is difficult to isolate the effect of the NMW on take home pay as take home pay is affected by hours worked and other sources of income such as tax credits and taxes. However, evidence suggests that since its introduction the NMW is affecting more people and the hourly wage is rising faster than average earnings and prices benefiting the lowest paid in the economy. The adult NMW has risen by around 59 per cent. since its introduction in 1999 from &#163;3.60 to &#163;5.73 per hour. The rise in the NMW has been greater than average earnings (around 46 per cent.) and retail price inflation (around 32 per cent. over the same period (April 1999 to October 2008).</p>

 Two tables have been placed in the Libraries and show the sponsorship arrangements for each of the academies open in March 2009. The first, headed &#147;Traditional Procurement Academies&#148; shows for each academy where sponsorship is a contribution to capital costs, the total pledged, the amount for which the Department has evidence of receipt, and the amount still expected. In some cases further sponsorship payments may have already been received by the Academy Trust but not yet reported to the Department. The second table, headed &#147;Endowment Sponsorship Academies&#148; shows for each academy where sponsorship is in the form of contributions to an endowment fund, the amounts pledged, the amounts reported so far to the Department as received and the amount still expected. As with the first category, there may be cases where further sponsorship has already been received by the Academy Trust but not yet reported to the Department.</p>

 There is no legal duty on schools or their staff to support a pupil with medical needs or to administer or supervise the taking of medicines. However, schools are encouraged to develop policies on managing medicines and supporting pupils with medical needs.</p>

It also encourages schools to draw up, in consultation with parents and medical professionals, individual Health Care Plans for children with medical needs. We produced sister guidance in the same year, entitled &#145;Including me: managing complex health needs in schools and early years settings&#146;.</p>

 Educational psychologists (EPs) are local authority employees.

In doing so, the CWDC will continue actively to seek the views and engagement of all key stakeholders, through its Educational Psychology National Forum, and carefully examine options for future funding while working with local authorities to secure their agreement to pay into the current subscription scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_669"><a name="90325w0039.htm_para1"><a name="0903264000866">To assist this process, the CWDC has commissioned a workforce development model to support future planning.

 The Fast Track Teaching programme was designed in 2000 and since that time the educational context and the role of school leaders has changed significantly. There is now a greater need for provision which offers those with high potential for headship a personalised, accelerated route direct to the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH). The Fast Track Teaching programme will be replaced with a new programme intended to meet better the needs of the system. The National College for School Leadership (NCSL) will continue to fund schools for the cost of the additional pay point awarded to eligible teachers who joined the Fast Track Teaching before September 2005. Fast Track teachers&#146; basic salaries will not be affected by the programme coming to an end.

 The Government acknowledge the difficulties disabled parents, including deaf parents, face. The most recent assessment made by the Secretary of State on the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#146; report on progress towards disability equality under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, was published in December 2008. It describes both what is happening within the DCSF to promote disability equality and what the entire sector is doing and how we are working together to achieve this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_682"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para0"><a name="0903264000947">In December 2008 DCSF published its first Secretary of State report on progress towards disability equality across the children&#146;s and education sector. Although there is no specific reference to deafness, or indeed other impairments with the exception of learning difficulties, this impairment is part of this report in as much as it is about disability and this of course comes within that definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_683"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para1"><a name="0903264000948">In 2006 we asked each local authority to develop a parenting strategy within their children and young people&#146;s plan&#151;these set out how the authority and its partners will make sure that parents get the services they need, including parents with disabilities. Most local authorities have developed strategies and have now moved into implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_684"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para2"><a name="0903264000949">To further support successful implementation of these strategies our parenting implementation project is working with 18 local authorities to test and develop new and innovative approaches to effective delivery of support services to parents and families. One of the project&#146;s work streams is considering the needs of parents with disabilities. The learning from the project will be shared with all local authorities in summer 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_688"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para6"><a name="0903264000953">With regard to services for parents, our Parent Know How Programme provides funding to a range of third sector partners to provide information and advice services for all parents. Within this ParentlinePlus provides a confidential textphone service for parents and carers who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech impairment. It is available on 0800 783 6783 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. As part of the ParentCast project we are preparing two videos targeted specifically at deaf parents&#151;both are in British sign language (with an option for subtitles in English) which emphasise the need for deaf parents to have access to the same services as all other parents. The first video is about how two deaf parents got engaged in school activities and the second promotes the use of extended schools to deaf parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_689"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para7"><a name="0903264000954">We encourage schools to use a range of ways to enhance the partnership with parents and carers, including advising schools to find out from parents what they would find helpful and what would encourage them to come into the school and participate at parents&#146; evenings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_690"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para8"><a name="0903264000955">The Children&#146;s Plan, 2007, highlighted a partnership with parents as a &#145;unifying theme&#146; across the whole plan and promised action on three fronts:</p>
<a name="90325w0040.htm_brev2"><a name="0903264003603"><ul><p class="tabletext">an enhanced dialogue between the school and parents;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_691"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para9"><a name="0903264000956">We have promoted parental engagement in learning in other ways&#151;for example, through encouraging parents and children to read together by providing free books to all families with young children through Bookstart, by improving access to information through Parent Know How, and by putting parent support advisers in place in many schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_692"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para10"><a name="0903264000957">These measures have made a difference. Evidence shows that mothers and fathers now feel more involved in their child&#146;s school life&#151;up from 29 per cent. in 2001 to 51 per cent. in 2007&#151;and have an increasing appetite for involvement. But these figures also show that more can be done to bring parents centre stage in their child&#146;s learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="90325w0040.htm_para11"><a name="0903264000958">To drive this forward, we proposed in The Children&#146;s Plan: Progress Report, published in December 2008, an approach which both empowers parents to engage and places parental engagement more centrally in the school and early years system. We made it clear that we will issue guidance to schools on working in partnership with parents and that that this guidance will cover how schools work with disabled, including deaf, parents.</p>

 Devolved Formula Capital (DFC) is allocated at school level, to be spent on whichever capital improvement a school considers to be the most beneficial, based on local priorities. Other funds can also be added to DFC, from the local authority and elsewhere, to improve facilities. The purposes for which DFC is used vary widely, from improving drinking water and toilet facilities, to other infrastructure improvement, ICT, sports facilities, even transport such as a school minibus.</p>

 The Government have made &#163;30 million available in 2008-11 for the initial rollout of the Masters in Teaching and Learning (MTL), and up to an additional &#163;25 million will be made available to fund MTL for teachers in National Challenge schools in 2009-11. The funding will pay for teaching cover for teachers participating in the programme and their in-school coaches. It will also pay for the development of the programme; higher education institutions&#146; ongoing costs; for the training of in-school coaches; and for the time of tutors from higher education institutions to support teachers in their learning. Funding for schools will be ring-fenced.</p>

 The Masters in Teaching and Learning (MTL) will be available to all Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) taking up post in schools in the North West region from September 2009, and to NQTs in National Challenge Schools, and in secondary schools where 30 per cent. or more of pupils are eligible for Free School Meals and where the leadership is rated good or better by Ofsted, from January 2010. We will only know how many NQTs are entitled to take up the MTL, and how many choose to do so, when they take up posts in schools from September 2009. However, we estimate that at least 4,000 NQTs could take up the offer of the MTL in 2009/10.</p>

 The Masters in Teaching and Learning (MTL) programme is currently being developed by MTL providers, which are schools and higher education institutions working together, and the Training and Development Agency for Schools. One of the aims is to develop a flexible programme, which can be personalised to meet each teacher&#146;s learning needs, reflecting the role being undertaken by that teacher. It is therefore not possible to provide details of time commitments for individual teachers at this stage. It is important to remember that, although teachers may need to undertake some study in their own time, the programme will be practice-based, with learning centred around what is happening in the classroom.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pursuant to the written ministerial statement of 16 December 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 111-12WS, on guaranteed minimum pension calculations, for what reasons some pensioners have been underpaid since 1978; what estimate he has made of <i> (a)</i> the number of people affected, <i> (b)</i> the average annual underpayment and <i> (c) </i>the cumulative underpayment; and what plans he has to repay such underpayments.

 My written ministerial statement of 16 December 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 111-12WS, explained the circumstances in which some public service pensioners had been paid the incorrect pension. While the majority of those affected were overpaid a small number were underpaid. The National Audit Office (NAO) is investigating the causes of the error. I will update the House once the NAO has completed its work.</p>
