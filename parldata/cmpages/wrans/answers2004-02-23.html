To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what access to legal representation is available to persons detained by United Kingdom forces in Iraq under Article 78 of the IV Geneva Convention (1949); what criteria are used to determine whether they continue to pose a threat to security; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="40223w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As set out in Article 80 of Geneva Convention IV internees retain their full civil capacity. This principle is reflected in Article 113 which provides, inter alia, that the Detaining Power shall provide all reasonable facilities for the transmission of wills, powers of attorney, letters of authority, or any other documents intended for internees or despatched by them. The Detaining Power is also obliged to facilitate the execution and authentication in due legal form of such documents on behalf of internees, in particular allowing them to consult a lawyer. In accordance with these provisions the United Kingdom provides access to legal advice when requested by an internee for such matters. The UK does not specifically provide for legal advice to be available to internees.
<P>

<a name="40223w01.html_para2">A review is carried out after 10, 28 and thereafter every 90 days to determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, internment is necessary for reasons of security.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the proposals for reform of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the pension scheme and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the compensation scheme in the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill are (i) individually cost-neutral and (ii) cost-neutral combined; and if he will make a statement.  [153875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The costs of the new Armed Forces pension and compensation schemes have been and will continue to be assessed individually. However, there are links between the two schemes, as income payments from the pension and associated early departure schemes are offset against the loss of earnings income payments in the compensation scheme. Both schemes are considered to be broadly cost-neutral when compared with current provision. Benefits will be paid against entitlement from centrally management Government funds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the estimate produced by the Royal British Legion of the likely number of cases that would fail under the provisions of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill under <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the proposed balance of probability test, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the proposed time limits for compensation claims and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;both.  [153876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 I have been in correspondence with the Royal British Legion about its assessment of the combined effect on recent War Pension claims of the changes planned for the new compensation scheme to time limits and standard of proof. We do not accept the Royal British Legion's analysis, which was based on a sample which was not representative of the full spectrum of claims. Nor do we accept that data for the time lapse between leaving service and making a claim under the War Pensions Scheme (WPS) can be extrapolated to the new scheme. We expect the timing of claims under the new scheme to take account of the time limit.
<P>

<a name="40223w02.html_para0">No work has been undertaken to assess how the particular provisions in the new scheme for time limits and standard of proof would have affected the decisions that we have taken on claims under the War Pension Scheme. Rather, our approach has been to consider the future requirement for a compensation scheme from first principles. We have sought to design a scheme which offers fair and proportionate compensation to anyone who, within a sensible timescale, can provide reasonable evidence that they are suffering from a condition due to service. The scheme will allow claims for specified late-onset conditions outside the limit, and will provide for exceptional review and an independent appeals tribunal. An independent review of our proposals commissioned from Watson Wyatt, a firm of actuaries and consultants, has confirmed that this approach is appropriate and reasonable. Copies of this report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses entitled "Armed Forces Compensation Scheme&#151;A report on the proposals for a revised compensation scheme for members of the Armed Forces".

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on how the new tariff-based compensation scheme will <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;assess compensation for (i) injuries and (ii) financial losses consequent on injury and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;be administered, with particular reference to appeal arrangements.  [153881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The new scheme will assess compensation by matching an injury accepted as due to service to a tariff description and the corresponding fixed level award. For those injuries lying within tariff levels 1 to 11, where it is assessed that earnings capacity will be significantly affected, there will be an additional Guaranteed Income Stream, paid at graduated levels, up-rated for inflation, and based on salary at service termination. It will be paid for life.
<P>

<a name="40223w02.html_para1">Decisions in the scheme will be the responsibility of lay administrators, but with access to medical and legal advice. They will be evidence-based, reflecting case specific facts and contemporary generally accepted medical understanding. Adjudication guidance in the scheme will be published, with medical aspects externally validated.




<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 7W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40223w02.html_para2">The new compensation scheme will be implemented by the Veterans Agency, which has considerable experience of assessing and determining claims for injury, illness or death due to Service. There will be an internal disputes resolution procedure for claimants who are dissatisfied with the decision on their claims. Following this, claimants can appeal to the independent Pensions Appeal Tribunal (who currently support the War Pensions Scheme). For appeals on points of law, a Social Security Commissioner will provide the new second tier of independent appeal, with a final level of appeal to the Court of Appeal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w02.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what types of injury case will receive <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;less and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;more compensation under the new scheme proposed in the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill; and if he will make a statement.  [153882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 A key principle of the new scheme is a better scaling of compensation to the level of disablement. The War Pensions Scheme provides neither awards that are reasonably proportionate to level of disablement nor significant up-front sums to help people adapt their lives to their new circumstances. However, the new Armed Forces Compensation Scheme for death, injury and ill-health due to Service provides lump sums for pain and suffering that are set out in a 15-level tariff, graduated for level of disablement, with substantial amounts payable, particularly at the higher levels. This also means that money will be available to help people adapt their lives. Where earning capacity is significantly impaired, there will also be a Guaranteed Income Stream (GIS), graduated according to level of impairment. For those with more minor conditions, which are not expected to have a significant impact on earnings capacity, a lump sum for pain and suffering is paid, but no GIS. Details of the compensation scheme, including example tariffs, have been placed in the Library of the House and can be found on the MOD internet site at: www.mod.uk/issues/pensions (A Framework Document For The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme for Injury, Illness and Death Due to Service).

 There are no plans to set up a joint Franco-British rapid deployment force. However, as part of the Helsinki Headline Goal, member states agreed to develop rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. The British, French and German governments are proposing that EU member states create Battle Group-sized forces, deployable within 15 days, by 2007. Member states would be able to offer such formations individually&#151;as is likely to be the case for the United Kingdom&#151;or on a multi-national basis.

 Progress is continuing across the 15 Project Groups established under the European Capabilities Action Plan since May 2003, although all are at different stages in their development. In strategic mobility, for example, and in conjunction with NATO, the Project Group is introducing a 'Strategic Air Lift Interim Solution' or SALIS, (in place until A-400M becomes available) and the co-ordinated use of assets by a Strategic Air Lift Co-ordination Centre, co-located with the European Airlift Co-ordination Centre at Eindhoven. There are also important qualitative outputs under development across the Project Groups, for example in systems interoperability, operational doctrine, and training. The Council Conclusions of 17&nbsp;November 2003 underlined the need to disseminate Project Group objectives, timelines and reporting procedures more widely, and this information will be presented shortly as an integral part of the Single Progress Report compiled once during each Presidency. It is anticipated that a Capability Improvement Chart showing the state-of-play of the Project Groups in a clearly digestible format will accompany the Single Progress Report.

The second investigation at Rhine Garrison in September 2000 resulted in no further action being taken. There is one ongoing investigation which commenced in July 2002 at the Royal Mint Llantrisant which is soon to be brought to a close.

<P>
<a name="40223w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Army, and individual capbadges within the Army, do not recruit as a percentage of liability. The Army is resourced to approximately 94&nbsp;per cent. of liability in FY 2004&#150;05; this defines, through a process of detailed manpower forecasting, the level of recruits required each year. The Director of Manning (Army) divides the total requirement of new recruits each year by capbadge and this will be consistent with the Army Board's endorsed manning priorities. The level of funding is set to increase gradually to nearly 99&nbsp;per cent. of its liability by 2008.
<P>

<a name="40223w05.html_para0">In the Royal Navy and the RAF, recruiting targets are set in order to provide a level of input that will sustain manpower levels in the long-term against the projected requirement.

 The Independent Review of the Fire Service predicted that the metropolitan brigades would gain the biggest savings. However, it may be too simplistic to compare larger versus smaller authorities. That, and the profound changes to the fire and rescue service announced in the White Paper "Our Fire and Rescue Service" is why the Government recognises that revisiting the fire formula spending share formula could be an issue. A working group of officials has been set up to examine the case for change and possible alternatives. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consider any proposals for changes to the formula in the light of the working group's conclusions.

 It would be premature to take any decisions on where the release of the 'reserve' provision in Hampshire should take place, until after the Joint Advisory Panel have made their decision.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not provide any specific guidance on this issue. Section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 requires planning applications to be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Key material considerations include national planning policy such as PPG13: Transport, on the location of development, and PPG6 on Town Centres and Retail Developments. PPG6 indicates that all out-of-centre retail development should be assessed in line with the policy. Other material considerations, as draft PPS6: Planning for Town Centres indicates, may include physical regeneration, employment, economic growth and social inclusion, but the draft guidance does not specifically refer to enabling development.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how the costs of local government reorganisation would be distributed if an elected regional assembly is established in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the North West, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Yorkshire and the Humber and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;the North East.  [155137]<P>

<P>
<a name="40223w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It is too early to say what the costs and savings of any reorganisation will be since these will depend ultimately on the pattern of unitary authorities introduced and on the decisions that the new unitary authorities take about how to discharge their functions. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be discussing how any costs will be funded with local government.

 Two security passes have been reported stolen by staff in the HQ buildings of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister during the period January 2003 to January 2004. A further 165 replacement security passes have been issued in the same period. It is not possible to say how many of the passes were lost other than by theft. Security passes may need to be replaced for a variety of reasons including loss, theft, damage or change of name, and the Office does not record the reasons for the replacement of a security pass. Figures for GOs North East and London are not available but a further 153 passes have been replaced in the remainder GO network. Although ODPM has overall responsibility for these, the Government Offices carry out functions on behalf often Departments.

 An analysis of the costs and benefits of providing for tenancy deposit protection was contained in a partial regulatory impact assessment included in the consultation paper published in November 2002. This suggested that against costs of &#163;19&nbsp;million there could be benefits of around &#163;20&nbsp;million. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is reviewing those estimates as the various elements of measures to safeguard deposits are assessed and we will do so against a range of assumptions.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the estimated cost of a tenancy deposit scheme took account of the proportion of cases requiring adjudication in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the pilot schemes and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other countries.  [155212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w10.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The consultation paper on tenancy deposits contained a partial regulatory impact assessment that took account of the costs involved in the pilot tenancy deposit scheme managed by the Independent Housing Ombudsman. In the subsequent final period of the pilot the proportion of cases requiring adjudication has grown. Although international experiences make a useful comparison they are unlikely to provide a robust method of estimating what might happen in this country because of cultural differences such as attitudes to litigation. The circumstances in other countries may also reflect significant differences in the housing market, not least of all in the way in which it is regulated.

 The Ministry of Defence keeps the size and location of its estate under constant review. Following on from Department-wide studies undertaken last year, the MOD is currently examining areas where rationalisation of the estate may be possible. RM Condor, Arbroath, which is the home of 45 Commando Royal Marines and 7 Battery Royal Artillery, is included in one such piece of work. A report has yet to be submitted, however, and no decisions have been taken on the future of this establishment. Any proposals arising from this&#151;and any other study&#151;will be subjected to full consultation.

<P>
<a name="40223w12.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no Helsinki Headline Goal Catalogue 2003. The Helsinki Headline Goal Catalogue first compiled in 2000, and refined in 2001 and 2002, lists 144 military capability areas required of the EU in order to conduct the Petersberg Tasks within recognised crisis management scenarios. The Helsinki Force Catalogue 2003 and Supplementary Catalogue&#151;which together list the actual forces and capabilities offered by member, accession and third states&#151;show that at least 118 of these capability areas have been met. The Helsinki Progress Catalogue 2003 assesses the progress made overall in the delivery of Headline and Capability Goals, and outlines when new capabilities will feed in to the Force Catalogue. Work now continues&#151;in conjunction with the European Capabilities Action Plan&#151;to address those shortfalls that remain. New Force and Progress Catalogues are expected later this year, and will incorporate the offers made by the ten new members of the EU.

 No changes have been introduced to the implementation of the Helsinki Headline Goal.

This Goal will place a new emphasis on interoperability, deployability and sustainability as its major themes. We anticipate an announcement at the European Council in June.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 9&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1178W, on foreign ships, whether European Union guidelines prevent his Department from having a bias in favour of chartering ships flying the shipping flags of European Union member states rather than those of non-EU countries; and what changes were made to the process for chartering freight-carrying commercial ships following his Department's review in 2003.  [155512]<P>

<P>
<a name="40223w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 MOD procurement, which reflects the Public Procurement Regulations that have their origins in the 1972 European Communities Act, is governed by the fundamental principle that there should be equal opportunity to tender for work without discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Charter of commercial shipping is, therefore, arranged using a panel of commercial shipping brokers on the global market.
<P>

<a name="40223w13.html_para0">The 2003 internal Defence Transport and Movements Agency review of charter arrangements for freight-carrying commercial ships led to the introduction of a Safety Management System (SMS) incorporating a greater risk-based process. The SMS has been approved by the MOD Ship Safety Management Board. The comprehensive assessment of suitability for charter covers: the flag, as per the Paris Memorandum of Understanding; the ship's age; port state inspection record; classification society; nationality of owners/operators; Marine Superintendent's assessment; and previous record of MOD usage.

<P>
<a name="40223w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Rules of engagement, are drafted by operational staff taking into account the UK's obligations under national and international law and treaties such as the Geneva Protocols. Each rules of engagement profile is subject to approval by the Secretary of State for Defence, who may take farther advice from specialist advisers on any aspect. Requests for amendments are made by operational Commanders and submitted for approval by the Secretary of State in the same way.

 No. Rules of engagement remain a national responsibility governed by the domestic legislation of contributing states as well as by international law. Within that framework, however, Coalition partners liaise closely over rules of engagement, and harmonise them wherever possible.

<a name="40223w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No civilian contractors engaged in the repair and maintenance of the civil infrastructure in Iraq come under command of the United Kingdom military. However, the majority of projects being funded through the UK military's Quick Impact Project programme (more than 800 projects, valued at over $17&nbsp;million) have relied, for their success, upon Iraqi contractors and sub-contractors. This is in line with our policy of supporting the use of skilled local labour and the stimulation of legitimate local economic activity wherever possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his assessment was of the number of Al Hussein ballistic missiles possessed by Iraq prior to the onset of war; how this assessment differed from the assessment of the weapons inspectors; how many of the Al Hussein missiles had their long range capabilities removed prior to the onset of war; how many Al Hussein missiles were used against coalition forces during the war in Iraq; and how many Al Hussein missiles have been identified in Iraq since the war ended.  [154985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Al Hussein missile is a version of the Scud B missile modified to increase its range to 650 km.
<P>

<a name="40223w13.html_para3">As stated in the Government's dossier on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction, it was assessed that Iraq had retained up to 20 Al Hussein missiles. These were either complete missiles; missiles broken down for concealment; or separate missile components capable of being reassembled. The UNMOVIC weapons inspectors assessed that it was possible that Iraq possessed a small number of Al Hussein missiles. The UNMOVIC report of March 2003 stated that the consumption of some Scud and Al Hussein missiles could not be independently verified and there were also unanswered questions about the number of indigenously produced warheads and training engines destroyed by Iraq. We have no knowledge of any Al Hussein missiles being modified to reduce their long range capabilities.
<P>

<a name="40223w13.html_para4">There were no Al Hussein missiles used against coalition forces during the war in Iraq and, to date, there have been no Al Hussein missiles identified in Iraq since the war ended.

 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;February 2004]</i>: The World Bank's "Doing business in 2004" survey of 130 countries ranked the UK in top 10 countries with least regulations, and the New Year survey of EU Business leaders by Handelsblatt ranked the UK No. l for competitiveness. The OECD has found the UK has almost the lowest administration cost and fewer regulations for entrepreneurs than any other EU country, while tax burdens on small businesses are lowest in the UK. A NatWest Survey of 851 UK companies showed a welcome fall in their concerns about red tape. Government policies which have contributed to this include; the following:

The Government response, submitted to the Commission on 12&nbsp;September 2003 and available at http://www.defra. gov.uk/environment/ppc/cipp.htm, pointed out that, in the UK's experience, it is essential for regulators to work closely with operators&#151;whether or not SMEs&#151;to explain as precisely as possible what IPPC requires.

 The Department's main role in implementing the OECD convention and the relevant part of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act is promoting awareness of them among UK businesses and liaising with the OECD on policy development and implementation.

Their time is equivalent to at least one full time post. Our expenditure is not recorded in such a way as to permit a precise analysis of the year-by-year spend against-implementing these specific instruments.

To meet the Government's target of 10&nbsp;per cent. of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010 we expect that approximately 3,500 to 5,000 wind turbines will be required. This includes both onshore and offshore turbines, and assumes that around 7&nbsp;per cent. to 8&nbsp;per cent. of electricity is generated from wind with the remaining 2&nbsp;per cent. to 3&nbsp;per cent. from other renewable sources.

<a name="40223w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Studies <sup>1</sup>  of the impact of wind farms on wildlife suggest that there is a small risk of bat strikes from the operation of wind turbines but that this occurs on a very irregular basis due to the good echolocation systems that bats use to navigate.

<P>

<a name="40223w21.html_para5">The great majority of British bat species do not undertake large scale migrations and so would not be expected to interact with offshore wind farms. The exception to this is Nathusius's pipistrelle which is known to undertake long distance migrations in Europe (including sea crossings), but this is an uncommon species in the UK. The potential for bat interactions with wind turbines is recognised and are being considered in the Strategic Environmental Assessments that will precede any future offshore wind farm licensing rounds.
<P>

<a name="40223w21.html_para6">Similarly, bats are listed as a consideration in guidance "Background document on problems and benefits associated with the development of offshore wind farms" issued by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR document EIHA 03/4/6-E(L)) and thus potential effects on bats would be expected to be assessed in project specific Environmental Impact Assessments for offshore wind farms.

UK Trade and Investment, which is co-funded by my Department and the Department for Trade and Industry, has produced a guidance leaflet on UK Bribery and Corruption Law. A small amount of other expenditure, for example on travel costs, has been incurred but is not accounted for separately from other related activities.

 Our decision to take military action was to enforce Iraq's disarmament obligations, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. It was taken as a last resort. The Iraqi regime's refusal to cooperate left us with no option. Authority to use force against Iraq derived from the combined effect of UNSCRs 678, 687 and 1441; and all of these resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which allows the use offeree for the express purpose of restoring international peace and security.

 The independence of the Mozambican judiciary is enshrined in Section 1, Article 164 of the Mozambican constitution. This states that, "In the discharge of their functions, judges are independent and only owe obedience to the law". The Government of Mozambique is committed to ensuring an independent and fair judicial system.

 We fully share my hon.

My hon.

 We regularly raise the issue of North Korean refugees with the Chinese, including at the biannual UK/China Human Rights Dialogue.

In addition, my hon.

<P>
<a name="40223w25.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The threat of proliferation of WMD has, in recent years been successfully limited by international arms control and effective multilateral treaties including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).
<P>

<a name="40223w25.html_para3">The NPT is the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, with 188 States Parties. It forbids acquisition or possession of nuclear weapons, except by the five acknowledged nuclear weapons States, who are required to pursue negotiations on nuclear disarmament. The NPT requires non-nuclear weapons Parties to enter into safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order to verify compliance. The IAEA's safeguards system is being strengthened by the introduction of an Additional Protocol expanding the IAEA's access. The UK is working with EU partners to see this Additional Protocol accepted as an international norm.
<P>

<a name="40223w25.html_para4">The CTBT provides for a global system of monitoring stations, using four complementary technologies, to record data necessary to verify compliance. Its aim is to achieve a total ban of explosive testing of nuclear weapons.

and production facilities. CWC implementation is verified by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) through on-site monitoring of CW destruction activity, and regular inspection of relevant industrial facilities. The CWC also provides for any Party with a concern about another's compliance to seek a challenge inspection. The CWC has 159 Parties, most recently including Libya's welcome accession.
<P>

<a name="40223w25.html_para6">The BWC has 151 Parties. The Fifth Review Conference of the BWC agreed in November 2002 on a three-year programme of work leading up to the Sixth Review Conference in 2006. This process is designed to strengthen the Convention, which currently has no ability to verify compliance. Assistance with the establishment of national legislation and regulation was provided to two States Parties following the annual Meeting of States Parties in 2003. The UK actively encourages universality of the Convention and urges all States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Convention.

 We have been consistent advocates of tough EU sanctions against Mugabe.

 If a Central American garment factory is found not to comply with codes of conduct enshrined in national legislation, the relevant government institution is responsible for taking remedial actions, as laid out within the legislation. If, however, a garment factory is found not to comply with the corporate codes of conduct specified by the retailers with which the garment factory has a contract, remedial actions are identified by the independent monitor by the retailers to ensure compliance. If these actions are not taken, the factory is liable to be fined by the retailers, or in serious breaches, to losing the contract. The threat of losing a contract is a powerful incentive for a factory to implement these actions.

<P>

<a name="40223w27.html_para2">All new investments made by CDC in the future will be funded from the proceeds of realisation of existing investments. CDC's business plan for the next few years estimates that between &#163;200&nbsp;million and &#163;300&nbsp;million will be invested each year into the new funds to be managed by Actis. The intention is that, in the medium term, third party investors will be attracted to commit capital to these funds alongside CDC.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w27.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Since 1999, CDC has been required to follow a set of business principles that require compliance with best practice, both at fund and investee company level. These principles include environmental standards, where, as a minimum, World Bank rules must be applied, or at least met within an agreed timeframe.
<P>

<a name="40223w27.html_para3">The other business principles cover the areas of personal and corporate integrity, social issues such as child or forced labour or discriminatory practices, health and safety, transparency and legal and fiscal compliance.

[153446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w27.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 As set out in my Written Statement of 8&nbsp;January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 15WS, CDC's objective is to maximise the creation and long-term growth of viable businesses in poorer developing countries by making responsible investments and mobilising private capital alongside public funds. This objective will remain unchanged under the reorganisation proposals and will apply to all CDC capital invested in any Actis-managed fund.
<P>

<a name="40223w27.html_para5">The rates of return of the different Actis funds will vary according to the region or sector at which a particular fund is targeted; for example, the rate of return for the Africa fund will differ from that for the Power fund. Target rates of return will be set according to the requirements of businesses in the region or sector in question and according to the requirements of potential co-investors in the fund.

<a name="40223w27.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Actis will be a fully commercial organisation and all ventures that it manages will be on fully commercial terms. CDC will only invest its capital in businesses that offer the prospect, with the help of the investment offered by CDC, of generating returns acceptable to CDC and co-investors. CDC's mission is to develop the private sector in the poorer developing countries. It does not plan to make available any form of concessional financing

 The mandate of the former Commonwealth Development Corporation was widened to include all developing countries in 1969.

<a name="40223w27.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Under a five-year contract, CDC will place 95&nbsp;per cent. of its investment capital into the funds that Actis will launch and manage. Actis will be encouraged to raise as much further capital from private and other third party investors as possible for investment in the poorer developing countries. Maximising the mobilisation of third party capital is the key feature of the reorganisation proposals.
<P>

<a name="40223w27.html_para12">CDC's investment policy (set by DFID) obliges it to concentrate its investment in the poorer developing countries where the private sector is generally reluctant to invest. We believe that in practice there is a wide gap between the demand for investment capital in the poorer countries and the amount actually available to them. It is our aim that CDC will help bridge this gap.
<P>

<a name="40223w27.html_para13">We are aware that CDC's investments must not crowd out or otherwise discourage private investors already active in developing countries. This .is the opposite of its purpose and we will expect the Board of CDC to be particularly vigilant about this issue.

 A key element of the UK Government's Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) Strategy is to reduce the availability of SALW through support for weapons stockpile management, collection and destruction programmes.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para10">Within the framework of the UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (2001), the UK supports a number of governments including those of developing countries to dispose of small arms stocks, preferably by destruction, that are surplus to national requirements.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para11">The UK is supporting the development of five-year National Action Plans in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Namibia. These plans will provide a comprehensive approach to weapons controls in these countries and include elements for the disarmament, management and destruction of weapons.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para12">Since 2001, the GCPP-funded Small Arms and Demobilisation Unit of UNDP have supported the destruction of over 360,000 weapons and in excess of 24&nbsp;million items of ammunition (i.e. small arms cartridges) and 1,090 tonnes of ammunition as part of their global weapons collection management and destruction programme.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para13">The UK has also funded a Brazilian NGO, Viva Rio, which has, as part of its awareness raising campaign, worked with the police and military in organising ceremonial public destructions of firearms. In excess of 114,000 have been destroyed since UK support for the project started in 2001. Destruction of weapons is done in partnership with the Rio State Government.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para14">The UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Lima, Peru, which is supported by the GCPP, has a programme for capacity building and training of law enforcement officials in Latin America. As a component of this work the Regional Centre has been involved in supporting local military and police with weapons destruction exercises.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para15">The UK is also one of a number of countries contributing to an ammunition destruction programme carried out in Albania by the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA), which aims to destroy 11,600 tonnes of small arms and light weapons ammunition over a four-year period.

<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 111W</I><P>
2001&#150;04) seeks to control and reduce the supply, demand and availability of weapons. It does this by supporting policy development and programmes that assist a wide range of international organisations, regional organisations, Governments and NGOs to combat the proliferation and misuse of small arms.
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para17">The four key areas that the strategy seeks to promote are:
<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Integrating small arms controls into wider conflict prevention and poverty reduction programmes.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para18">For example, the UK has supported regional and sub regional efforts to combat SALW proliferation, and the development of long-term national programmes. The strategy has also supported work to build regional and international consensus on the need for an international agreement on small arms transfers and trade. This is done within the framework provided by the UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (2001).
<P>

<a name="40223w29.html_para19">The UK has contributed to the UN Development Programme's Small Arms and Demobilisation Unit global programme of weapons collection, stockpile management, capacity building and destruction within the context of disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration of ex-combatants and community development. UNDP is active in 45 countries in many parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and Central America.

 The Government have notified to the Paris Club unrecovered claims of &#163;623&nbsp;million arising from commercial export contracts with Iraq signed prior to the first Gulf conflict in 1991 insured by the Export Credits Guarantee Department. This amount does not include interest, which it is estimated could bring the figure to around &#163;1.15 billion. The Paris Club deals only with claims arising out of government loans or government-insured commercial credits.
<P>

<a name="40223w31.html_para9">The Government believe that Iraq's external debt is unsustainable and that creditors will need to agree a significant reduction through a clear multilateral process in order to restore Iraq to sustainability. That is likely to involve writing off the vast majority of Iraq's external debt.

 <i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> The Secretary of State has not had any discussions with her counterparts in Thailand or other countries in South East Asia.

 Outbreaks of avian influenza have been reported in Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, including the Territory of Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. Under EU rules none of these countries is allowed to export live poultry or hatching eggs to the EU. Imports of poultry meat are permitted from Thailand only.

<P>

<a name="40223w33.html_para1">The risk of the avian influenza virus spreading through meat is low. However, the European Commission took action on 23&nbsp;January to ban imports from Thailand of fresh/frozen poultry meat and cooked poultry meat that has not been heat treated to at least 70&#176;C, unless it is accompanied by additional certification confirming that it was from birds slaughtered before 1&nbsp;January 2004. Poultry meat products which have been cooked to 70&#176;C or more are not considered to be a risk and may still be exported to the EU. The UK took immediate action to implement these measures in domestic law.

 Government are not taking steps to promote the use of biodegradable plastic bags. The use of degradable plastics that are made from fossil fuel, and specifically designed for disposal with no beneficial recovery potential, runs counter to the Government's aim to increase recycling. In addition, if disposed of in landfill rather than, for example, being composted, biodegradable waste breaks down to release methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas.

 Badgers eat both animal and plant material and are considered to be largely opportunistic in their choice of food. Although they feed on a wide range of foodstuffs, earthworms are the most important single item in the diet of British badgers. Because these and other food types are taken according to their availability, the diet of badgers varies both geographically and seasonally <sup>1</sup> .

 Models which look at the interaction between species are still being developed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w35.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Scientists advise that over the last 20 years the fishing rate on cod has been five times that required to promote optimal use of the cod stock, and the fishery captures too many immature fish. On average less than 5&nbsp;per cent. of each new brood now survives to maturity, and the cod age structure is very restricted. The stock is severely overfished, the biomass of mature fish has shown a prolonged decline, and the number of young cod entering the stock decreased in the mid-1980s.
<P>

<a name="40223w35.html_para8">The ICES Advisory Committee on Fishery Management (ACFM) advises that the reduction in recruitment can be at least partly explained by a reduction in the quantity and quality of eggs produced by a reduced spawning stock. There is speculation about the effect of environmental change and species interactions because of increased water temperature, and various contemporaneous changes in other species, but work carried out on these factors does not yet allow them to be quantified. ACFM notes that there may be some changes to the natural mortality of cod, such as a decrease on younger ages, possibly due to reduced cannibalism, and an increase on older ages due to seal predation, but the supporting evidence for these changes is weak.

 ICES stock assessments are carried out internationally using landings and biological and survey data that are analysed in a standard way by methods that are well-known and are accepted by the international fisheries science community. Results are dependent on the quality of the data, and on our understanding of biological processes in the sea. It is accepted that the data and the methods are not perfect, but they are the best available. Assessment results are reviewed within ICES by ACFM, as well as by the North Sea Fisheries Commission Partnership in the case of the North Sea stocks, and ACFM is further developing quality assurance and review processes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research she has commissioned on the effect of escape behaviour between different species on mortality rates for cod in North Sea fisheries.  [150941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w35.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Differences in escape behaviour alone are not significant determinants of fishing mortality. The combination of escape behaviour and net design can be a factor and considerable research has been conducted into net designs which will, for example, reduce fishing mortality of juvenile cod. One option is to separate cod from other species within the trawl and then subject them to a different selection process (e.g. a larger mesh size) when they try to escape. Alternatively, it may be possible to design nets so that some species, including cod, avoid the net completely. Each fishery targeting different ranges of species may require a different complex design with the aim of catching the marketable species and releasing the unwanted species. Research is ongoing in the UK, in collaboration with commercial fishermen.

<i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> As part of Defra-funded research into cetacean bycatch, the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) carried out eight days of observations at sea in 2000, 25 days in 2001 and four in 2002 in the following UK pelagic fisheries in Area VII: mackerel, pilchard, whiting and anchovy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of whether fishing effort managed by limiting days at sea, including the banning of discards, is an effective fisheries management tool.  [150851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w35.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Scientific assessments have shown that fishing mortality on key species such as cod is too high in waters around the UK. Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas on their own have not been effective in reducing fishing mortality to sustainable levels. In December 2002 and again in December 2003, EU Fisheries Ministers agreed limitations on days at sea to 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 136W</I><P>
complement reductions in TACs&#151;it is too early to assess what impact these restrictions will have had on fishing mortality.
<P>

<a name="40223w35.html_para12">A discards ban is a separate management tool to a days at sea scheme. At present a ban on discards is not yet considered to be practicable. The European Commission published an action plan in November 2002 which suggested a number of options to reduce discarding, including consideration in the medium term of a discards ban. The UK and other member states have welcomed the Commission's intention to try out the ideas in its action plan through a series of pilot projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w35.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is no such research available applicable to EU waters because the EU has only recently introduced days at sea rules to support the Total allowable catches (TACs) set for cod and other threatened species. In the past, TACs alone have not been respected. It is too soon for research to show whether the new approach is more effective.

 As part of the GM Dialogue the Strategy Unit carried out a study of the costs and benefits of GM crops. Their report "Field Work: weighing up the costs and benefits of GM crops" was published on 11&nbsp;July last year. The Unit concluded that GM crops could offer some cost and convenience advantages to UK farmers, although any economic benefit is likely to be limited in the short-term as only a narrow range of existing GM crops are currently suited to UK conditions, and weak consumer demand may limit take-up. In the longer term it concluded that future developments in GM crops have the potential to offer more wide-ranging benefits, to both farmers and consumers.

 Applications for the deliberate release of GM organisms into the environment are assessed under the procedures set out in EC Directive 2001/18. No assessment has been made by the UK Government of the application to import and cultivate "Ms8xRf3" GM oil seed rape because notification of the Belgian competent authority's opinion has not yet been circulated by the Commission. When the application and the Belgian assessment is forwarded to us we will consider it very carefully in the light of the scientific evidence of any risks it may pose to human health and the environment.

<a name="40223w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It was an essential part of the decision at the last Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that a number of strict conditions should be fulfilled before any of the proposed sales of ivory stockpiles went ahead. These included the provision of baseline data on elephant populations and poaching levels under the MIKE process (Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants) and confirmation by the CITES Secretariat that the potential importing countries could effectively regulate their domestic ivory markets. These issues will be discussed at the CITES Standing Committee meeting in Geneva next month. It is therefore too soon to make a definitive assessment but the UK Government remains clear that these sales must not proceed if these conditions have not been fulfilled.

 I have discussed the ivory trade with Ministers from other countries on a number of occasions, most recently during my visit to Kenya in October 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w37.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The last comprehensive report on the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) was presented by TRAFFIC at the 12th Conference of the Parties to CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) in November 2002. This concluded that the illegal trade in ivory is directly correlated to the presence of large-scale, unregulated ivory markets, predominantly found in West and Central Africa, China and Thailand. The report attributed the upward trend in seized ivory since 1998 to the increased demand for ivory consequent upon increased economic prosperity within China.
<P>

<a name="40223w37.html_para2">The UK shares TRAFFIC's concerns about the need to regulate domestic ivory markets around the world. Within the UK and the EU as a whole, trade in ivory is strictly regulated through a licensing system. Permits for the sale of ivory are not issued unless it can be shown that the ivory was legally acquired before the current world-wide ban on commercial trade in ivory came into force in 1990.
<P>

<a name="40223w37.html_para3">Last year the Government contributed some &#163;60,000 to help ETIS continue its good work in monitoring the illegal trade in ivory and we will be providing an additional &#163;20,000 this year.

<P>
<a name="40223w37.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B>

 This issue has been discussed on several occasions in the EC CITES Committee (the Committee on Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora), most recently on 29&nbsp;January 2004.

 We do not yet know what proposals on elephant ivory, if any, will be made at the Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Bangkok in October. However, we are concerned that the market for ivory may be poorly regulated in a number of countries around the world, thereby allowing the illegal trade to continue. We will, therefore, work with our partners within the EU and other CITES Parties to ensure that there is no relaxation of the current ban on commercial trade in ivory, unless it can be shown that very strict measures are in place to ensure that such trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of this species in the wild.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of disposal costs per tonne of contaminated soils to landfill after July; what assessment she has made of additional treatment facilities required by July; and if she will make a statement.  [152542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is estimated that, from mid July, the requirements of the Landfill Directive could increase the disposal costs per tonne for contaminated soils to landfill by between 10&nbsp;per cent. to 100&nbsp;per cent. depending on the degree and type of contamination.
<P>

The Hazardous Waste Forum task force on treatment and disposal capacity is currently assessing all these interlinking factors, continues to monitor closely the provision of facilities, and will advise on the issues that need to be addressed so that all waste is subject to environmentally sound management and disposal. Overall the Government's policy is to reduce the UK's reliance on landfill, which, as well as its negative environmental impacts, makes little practical use of waste and is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste.

 Defra's Ministers see secondments and interchange as a key means of complementing the skills and experience of the Civil Service, drawing in expertise from such fields as business, local government and the voluntary sector as well as other Government Departments. This is assisting Defra's commitment to play its part in developing a modern, flexible, outward looking Civil Service that works in partnership with all sectors of society. Interchange is seen as a key tool in 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 146W</I><P>
meeting this commitment. Defra continues to promote and encourage the interchange of personnel between the Department and a range of other organisations.
<P>

<a name="40223w38.html_para2">The term 'secondee' is used within the Civil Service in a more limited sense than the meaning used outside the Civil Service. In the Civil Service a secondee is a person who is 'borrowed' from an organisation outside the Civil Service for a period of between three months and three years (exceptionally five years), without affecting employment status. Great care is taken in setting up any secondment to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise. During the secondment period the secondee would remain an employee of the parent organisation but would be expected to abide by the Defra staff handbook and the Official Secrets Act. At the end of the secondment the secondee would return to the parent organisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether home composting is taken into account in the setting of recycling targets at <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;local and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;national level.  [154294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w38.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Home composting activity is not measured as part of the local authority best value performance indicator (BVPI) for composting. Its contribution to recycling and composting rates is therefore excluded from statutory performance standards for local authorities and from the national targets for recycling and composting. This is because there is not yet a workable and auditable method of calculating the amount of waste diverted through home composting schemes, or one which properly reflects the local authority's contribution to the activity.
<P>

<a name="40223w38.html_para7">The impact of home composting on reducing waste arisings is already reflected at a local level by BVPI 84, which measures kilograms of household waste collected per head of population. Local authorities are required to set their own local targets for BVPI 84 which has to be included in their Best Value Performance Plans. The Government have concluded a number of Local Public Service Agreements in which home composting activity contributes directly to the achievement of the local authority's target.

 The Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) is putting England on the path to more sustainable waste management with measures to slow the growth in the amount of waste, investment in recycling infrastructure and support for new alternative waste management technologies. This new programme was explicitly created to provide clear responsibilities and accountabilities, and a strong focus at the centre of government to drive forward implementation in specific areas. The initial direction and implementation arrangements for WIP were overseen by a ministerial

<P>

<a name="40223w40.html_para0">Underpinning the programme are effective mechanisms for cross-government working. A Steering Committee, representing key interests engaged in waste management, has been established to drive forward the implementation of WIP workstreams. This group also provides strategic advice on the new programme, and reports direct to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Meetings are attended by representatives from several Government Departments. In addition, there are regular meetings with ODPM, DTI and HMT at official level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if her Department will make representations to the European Commission for the inclusion of the management of wildlife in the criteria for the definition of legality in the European Commission's proposal for an action plan on European Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade proposal.  [153266]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w40.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The European Commission's Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) includes proposals to prevent the import into the EU of illegally logged timber, through the voluntary licensing of timber exports from FLEGT partner countries. Under these voluntary agreements export permits would be granted only if the timber has been harvested in conformity with relevant national legislation.
<P>

<a name="40223w40.html_para2">The Government's view is that it is for each producer state to define legality in reference to the national laws and regulations of that state and for them to decide if the management of wildlife should be included in such a definition. It would not be appropriate to make representations to the European Commission concerning the criteria for defining legality. We would however be willing to work with individual countries to address this as a criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w43.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Trimble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what his policy is on removing rate relief on manufacturing industries.  [153831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w43.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The policy rationale for retaining industrial derating in Northern Ireland no longer exists. This view is supported by leading business and economic commentators and by the outcomes of various studies and an extensive consultation exercise in 2002. An assessment of the impact of removal on manufacturers concluded that any increase in costs would be limited and the impact significantly reduced by phasing it out in the manner announced in April 2003. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 165W</I><P>
The phase out period will begin on 1&nbsp;April 2005 and end on 1&nbsp;April 2011. This means that manufacturers will have been given eight years to adjust and plan for paying full rates which is longer than the timeframe proposed by the former DFP and DETI Assembly Committees. They will have to pay only 15&nbsp;per cent. of their full rates liability in 2005&#150;06. This percentage will rise but on a very gradual basis over the next six years. This is a sensible, modernising reform measure that will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. There are other more effective ways of supporting businesses than retaining a blanket exemption for which there is no supporting rationale. Proposals for a hardship rate relief scheme for all businesses are being examined and will be published after consultation with Councils and business organisations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w43.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Trimble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how much revenue he estimates will be generated by the removal of rate relief on manufacturing industries.  [153832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w43.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The estimated long-term yield from the rating of the manufacturing sector is around &#163;55&nbsp;million per year. This allows for possible valuation reductions as a result of appeals and is based on around 5,100 properties currently in the Valuation List becoming liable to full rates in 2011. Applying the 15&nbsp;per cent. rate liability applicable in the first year (2005&#150;06), the yield in that year is expected to be around &#163;8&nbsp;million. This additional revenue will be invested through the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative (RRI) to help fund a significant programme of major infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland over the next five years. Projects contained within the Strategic Investment Programme and totalling some &#163;2.7 billion in value have already been announced. Investment in our public service infrastructure is essential for sustained economic growth and development. This scale of planned investment will significantly enhance Northern Ireland's prospects for long-term economic prosperity and future business success. The retention of industrial derating will not achieve these outcomes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w43.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Trimble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps are being taken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Industry and its agencies to ensure Northern Ireland's manufacturing industries are not disadvantaged by the enlargement of the European Union, with particular reference to the accession of low-wage economies in Eastern Europe.  [153839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w43.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Invest NI is working with companies in the manufacturing and internationally-traded services sectors to help them increase their competitiveness in home and international markets. Early results of research commissioned into the impact of EU enlargement on the NI economy, indicate that the overall impact is likely to be relatively limited. They also suggest that enlargement will offer opportunities, particularly for sectors with the greatest prospects for high value-added growth.
<P>

<a name="40223w43.html_para3">Around 60 Northern Ireland companies are already doing business valued at approximately &#163;100&nbsp;million in the Accession States. Invest NI has been active in organising a number of trade-related activities, targeted at certain Accession States.

 It is not possible to provide the precise total cost to date of implementing the Patten Report on policing in Northern Ireland. The costs associated with the police early retirement/severance scheme and implementation of specific projects related to some of the individual recommendations from 1&nbsp;April 2000 to December 2003 amount to some &#163;197&nbsp;million. Moreover there would have been other costs, which cannot be exactly identified, incurred by PSNI from its grant in support of the implementation of Patten.

 There a number of policies, both specific and general, designed to help regenerate under populated residential areas.
<P>

<a name="40223w45.html_para2">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive actively seeks to revitalise areas that have experienced population loss and which may also suffer from unfit or vacant housing stock by the use of statutory powers to designate Redevelopment Areas and Urban Regeneration Areas, together with programmes of Renovation Grant activity. The NI Housing Executive is also currently engaged in developing a range of strategies and programmes which seek to facilitate regeneration and sustainable communities such as:

<P>

<a name="40223w45.html_para3">Additionally, the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland has the objective of creating sustainable communities and regenerating urban areas. It requires that 60&nbsp;per cent. of future new build housing be sited within the existing urban footprint. The NI Housing Executive contributes to the Policy Planning Strategy 12 document in respect of Housing Need Assessments that are to be completed as part of each Development Plan. These highlight the housing needs required to achieve sustainable and affordable housing within settlements across Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40223w45.html_para4">In addition, while not specifically targeting under-populated areas, the Department for Social Development's tools for regeneration clearly impact on such areas, and in particular, Northern Ireland's most disadvantaged communities. The Department's wide range of strategies and programmes such as the Urban Development Programme, Urban Development Grant, Environmental Improvement Schemes, and the recently launched Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy, aim to revitalise areas of slower growth, promote social cohesion, and help build more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable neighbourhoods.

 Waiting list statistics are submitted to the Department at specialty level.

Waiting list statistics are collected in three-month time bands for all patients waiting up to 24 months. Patients waiting 24 months or more are grouped together within one category therefore patients waiting two to three years and more than three years cannot be separately identified.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what Government policy is in relation to wayleave compensation payable to landowners affected by measures to facilitate the provision of public services; and what recent changes there have been relating to payments for wayleaves.  [154579]<P>

<P>
<a name="40223w46.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The primary legislation governing compensation for the acquisition of pipeline wayleaves in Northern Ireland is The Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973. The rules for assessing any compensation payable under this Order are contained in the Land Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 1982. The principal thrust of this legislation and the associated case law decisions has been to ensure that compensation is based on the actual loss in every case.
<P>

<a name="40223w46.html_para0">The legal basis of compensation has therefore not changed but each individual case must be looked at on its merits with the aim of establishing what the actual loss is.
<P>

<a name="40223w46.html_para1">The Valuation and Lands Agency (VLA) act on behalf of Water Service in the assessment of wayleave compensation. In most cases the compensation amount is agreed between VLA and the landowner or his agent. If agreement is not possible the landowner then has the option of referring the matter to the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research has been carried out into the proportion of young people who are aware of the Connexions service in each partnership area, broken down by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;ethnicity, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;age and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;gender.  [154786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w47.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Information on the awareness of young people of the Connexions service has been obtained from two recent Department for Education and Skills research studies.
<P>

<a name="40223w47.html_para10">In 2002, the Youth Cohort Study found that 51&nbsp;per cent. of young people were aware of a Connexions service in their area. Of those, slightly more females said they were aware of a Connexions Service in this area (53&nbsp;per cent. compared to 50&nbsp;per cent. of males). Just over one-third of non-white respondents claimed awareness (36&nbsp;per cent.) compared with 53&nbsp;per cent. of white respondents.
<P>

<a name="40223w47.html_para11">In 2003, a customer satisfaction survey of 16,000 young people found that awareness of Connexions was generally high. 92&nbsp;per cent. of both male and female respondents contacted said they had heard of the service. For minority ethnic groups, awareness levels were 88&nbsp;per cent. compared with 93&nbsp;per cent. for white respondents. Young people aged 16&#150;17 had the highest levels of awareness (94&nbsp;per cent.), followed by 13 to 15-year-olds (92&nbsp;per cent.) with those over 18 (89&nbsp;per cent.) being the least aware of the service.

[154787]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w47.html_spnew15"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The quality of advice given by Connexions personal advisers is monitored on three levels:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. It is a condition of grant that every Connexions partnership has effective procedures in place to evaluate the professional practice of personal advisers and takes appropriate steps to improve individual performance. Partnerships are also required to have robust professional supervision arrangements in place for all personal advisers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Connexions partnerships undertake a comprehensive annual self-assessment of their performance which is based on the document "Connexions Partnerships: A Framework for Inspection&#151;April 2002". One of the key criteria addressed is the overall quality of advice given by personal advisers. Areas for improvement are identified and addressed by improvement actions in the following year's business plan. Currently progress against these improvement actions is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Government Office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The independent element of scrutiny of personal advisers' practice is provided by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) over a four-yearly cycle. Ofsted make judgements about the partnership, using the seven key questions within the Ofsted inspection framework. Within this framework Key Question 4 assesses the effectiveness of Connexions practice, assessment, support, teaching and guidance and contains a specific quality statement that addresses the quality of impartial information, advice and guidance provided to young people by personal advisers. Following the report of Ofsted's findings, partnerships are required to address any issues arising from the inspection in an action plan. Progress against this action plan is again monitored by the Government Office.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;parents' and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;clients' complaints against the service provided by Connexions are dealt with.  [154792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w47.html_spnew16"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Connexions partnerships are required to put in place a complaints procedure, which is the primary mechanism for all complaints from parents and clients. Should complaints not be resolved at that stage, the local Government office and Connexions teams within DfES investigate and provide support both to the public and partnerships to continually improve the level of service Connexions provides to clients and their families.
<P>

<a name="40223w47.html_para18">Partnerships are required to have strategies to ensure young people are involved in the design, delivery, evaluation and continuous improvement of the service. This, in part, ensures the number of complaints is reduced. They must respond positively to any complaints made by young people and are required to publish a Youth Charter explaining what Connexions is and offers; its standards of service; and how to complain.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w47.html_spnew18"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Although Connexions Partnerships provide us with the numbers of personal advisers they have recruited, they are not required to provide data on the numbers who have been subject to List 99 and Criminal Records Bureau checks. To do so would serve no purpose as it is a legal requirement for employers to ensure that personal advisers have been subjected to completed List 99 checks before they can come into direct contact with young people. We also require Partnerships to ensure a Criminal Records Bureau check is completed for all Connexions staff working with young people.

 In October 2002, we published our first strategy for engaging the Voluntary and Community Sector [VCS] in Connexions. We have made considerable progress since then in working with the VCS:
<P>

[154798]<P>
<P>
<P>

 Connexions Partnerships are required to ensure enhanced Criminal Records Bureau checks are completed for all staff they recruit, including those who are employed through a subcontractor or voluntary agency. Connexions Service Partnerships are encouraged to provide assistance to voluntary organisations when they apply for funding and are committed to keeping procedures simple. Partnerships are able to provide grant funding and in-kind support to voluntary organisations who might otherwise be able to engage with Connexions.

 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer I gave on 5&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 67W. The Government support the view that, in general, children benefit from a continuing relationship with both parents following parental separation, where it is in the best interests of the child and safe for all family members. The fundamental principle of the Children Act 1989 is that

<P>

<a name="40223w48.html_para0">There is no automatic "right" to contact for either fathers or mothers, but in practice the courts have taken the view that, in most cases, the child's welfare is best served by contact with both parents.

 The figures requested are shown in the following table. The Schools Formula Spending Share (SFSS) formula comprises a basic entitlement for each pupil, which is the same across the country, plus a top-up for each pupil with additional educational needs, which is again the same across the country, plus top-ups for areas where it costs more to recruit and retain teachers and for areas which are sparsely populated. Local education authorities with a greater proportion of pupils with additional educational needs or higher average earnings or with significant sparsity will receive a higher level of funding per pupil.

<a name="40223w48.html_para6">However, the Government is already spending in excess of &#163;700&nbsp;million to support the recruitment and retention of graduates into the public services, for example teachers, dentists and social workers. Part of Sir Alan's work will be to examine this current support and analyse its effectiveness.

<a name="40223w48.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 My Department has an on-going relationship with the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), with whom we are in discussion on the issue of holiday pricing. ABTA advises that if parents book early, discounts may be made available for holidays out of term time. We also know that some local education authorities work in partnership with local tour operators to offer incentives to parents to take their children on holiday outside term time. Good practice on this issue is available at: www.dfes.gov/schoolattendance I am currently considering how this good practice could be implemented in all areas.
<P>

<a name="40223w48.html_para7">The Office of Fair Trading has the power to look into holiday pricing if there is evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. At present, they have no such evidence.

<P>
<a name="40223w48.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Since 1997, 22 independent schools have applied to become maintained schools; of these 19 have been approved. Where approval was not given the reasons included a lack of basic need; surplus places in the area; questions on the longer term education and financial viability of the proposed schools; and being dissatisfied about the school's ability to deliver the full range of the National Curriculum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the average waiting time has been for claims for payment from the terminated individual learning accounts to be assessed and paid. [154339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w48.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Since the closure of the Individual Learning Account (ILA) programme on the 23&nbsp;November 2001, due to serious potential fraud and abuse, the average waiting time for payment of ILA incentives, in cases where validation checks to confirm the propriety of payments from public funds are straightforward, is 20 days. The average waiting time for payment to learning providers in cases where validation checks have proved complex is some 17 months. This takes into account procedures for obtaining sufficiently robust evidence from both learning providers and learners to ensure the propriety of payments from the public purse and lengthy settlement negotiations.
<P>

<a name="40223w48.html_para8">Where registered learning providers have submitted a claim following the Ombudsman's Report into ILAs of 10&nbsp;April 2003, the average waiting time for payment, including validation checks, is a little under 5 months.

<a name="40223w48.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps he is taking to ensure that claims for payment to training providers are settled promptly from the terminated individual learning accounts.  [154340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w48.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 To ensure the propriety of payments and to protect public funds the Department requires registered learning providers to supply appropriate evidence to support all Individual Learning Account (ILA) claims. This evidence is subject to thorough validation checks before payments are made. Since closure of the ILA programme on 23&nbsp;November 2001, due to serious potential fraud and abuse, to the end of January 2004 the Department's process for validating claims has resulted in &#163;12.9&nbsp;million being paid to 3,420 registered learning providers.
<P>

<a name="40223w48.html_para9">Where we have unresolved complaints or there are other on-going concerns, payments continue to be withheld pending the outcomes of inquiries and investigations. Currently, following closure, &#163;14.8&nbsp;million is withheld.

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocates research funding selectively to universities by a formula according to the quality and volume of their research activity. The funding formula has no explicit regional element. The Government's policy is to target available resources on the highest quality research wherever it exists to ensure our global competitiveness.

<a name="40223w49.html_para2">The appointment of directors to the LSC is an operational matter for the LSC. Over 600 local Council 'board' members bring a wealth of knowledge, skills and expertise to bear on the delivery of the skills agenda at the local level.

<P>
<a name="40223w49.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Education Act 1996 places duties on local education authorities (LEAs) and all LEA-maintained schools to identify, assess and make suitable provision to meet children's special educational needs (SEN), including the SEN of children with profound and multiple learning difficulties. In doing so, maintained schools and LEAs must have regard to the SEN Code of Practice, which gives practical guidance on identifying and meeting children's SEN, covering all areas of need&#151;communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development and sensory and physical needs.
<P>

<a name="40223w49.html_para3">The Government's new SEN Strategy "Removing Barriers to Achievement", launched on 11&nbsp;February, will build on the improvements to the statutory framework brought about by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act and the SEN Code of Practice, both 2001.

Under Section 13 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a specific responsibility to help young people and adults with LDD. Although the LSC does not develop policies relating to specific groups of learners, its broad remit means that it can fund a wide range of provision to ensure these learners have access to suitable provision which meets their needs and, where appropriate, the additional support they require to undertake it.

Therefore additional information on this should be held locally.

Within the overall funding for 2003&#150;04, &#163;512&nbsp;million has been allocated on the basis of demonstrated basic need (new pupil places). However, it is for local education authorities to decide whether or not they need to build a new school in order to accommodate all pupils in their area.

 The minimum funding guarantee, which is part of the package of measures to restore stability and certainty to school funding over the next two years announced by the Secretary of State on 29&nbsp;October, specifically recognises that schools with falling rolls have fixed costs for items such as cleaning, repairs and heating which do not reduce when pupil numbers go down. Such schools are guaranteed a per pupil funding increase in 2004&#150;05 of more than 4&nbsp;per cent., which is our guaranteed increase for schools where numbers do not change. In addition, LEAs can have safety nets in their local funding formulae to assist schools with falling rolls, and the mechanism which provides revenue support grant to authorities has one year data lag built into it designed to assist LEAs with overall falling rolls in their schools.

 <i>[holding answer 12&nbsp;February 2004]</i>: The Government are committed to improving the attainment of all 11 to 14-year-olds through the Key Stage 3 National Strategy which is central to our wider plans for transforming secondary education. The strategy aims to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom by investing in teachers' professional development.
<P>

<a name="40223w52.html_para0">The strategy is starting to make a significant impact on standards after only one full year of implementation. The 2003 Key Stage 3 test results stand as the best ever on record with improvements in every subject and at every level. OFSTED have also endorsed the positive impact of the strategy and that it has been welcomed by teachers. Our priority is to build on the gains so far by further embedding the strategy, tackling under performance and supporting teachers in tailoring teaching and learning to better meet the needs of pupils and so personalise their learning experience.

<a name="40223w52.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 No central record is kept of the outcomes for all young people with special educational needs (SEN) who attended mainstream or special schools. However, my Department has commissioned a longitudinal study of the post-16 transitions of young people with SEN. Wave one, which took place between January 2000 and September 2001 when the young people in the study were still aged 15&#150;16, found that more mainstream school pupils with SEN wanted to look for a job at the end of their compulsory schooling than special school pupils (28&nbsp;per cent. as against 16&nbsp;per cent.). The results from wave two of the study will be published in the spring and a wave three has been commissioned. These waves will show the development of any differential employment outcomes as between mainstream and special school pupils.
<P>

<a name="40223w52.html_para2">The new SEN strategy "Removing Barriers to Achievement", launched on 11&nbsp;February, announced cross-Government action to improve the opportunities for progression beyond school for young people with SEN. A multi-agency group has been established to take this work forward and promoting employment as an aim in planning for the futures of almost all young people with SEN is one of the main objectives of this group. The group's work will take account of the findings of the SEN longitudinal study.

The Government do not impose restrictions on the fees that may be charged for part-time undergraduate students, such as those attending Birkbeck College and the Open University. The Higher Education Funding Council for England will shortly be conducting a comprehensive review of how their funding for teaching is allocated. In accordance with the statement by my right hon. friend the Secretary of State to the House on 8&nbsp;January 2004, a major focus of this review will be how the funding system might further support the development of part-time study.

 The aim of the national Skills for Life strategy is to improve adult literacy, language and numeracy skills. The target is to improve the basic skills of 1.5&nbsp;million adults by 2007. From September this year, we will be phasing in an entitlement to free provision for level 2 learning for adults who do not already have a qualification at this level. For those already in the workforce, there are 12 Employer Training Pilots testing ways of encouraging employers to train low-skilled workers to a first level 2 or basic skills qualification. A further six pilots will begin in September this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w55.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Public Guardianship Office (PGO) expects to meet almost all of its key service delivery targets this financial year, and plans to set more challenging measures for next year so that, among other things, it answers a higher percentage of correspondence within target and deals with applications more efficiently. During 2004&#150;05, the PGO will focus on quality improvement further to increase customer satisfaction in its services. A review of how complaints are handled has recently been initiated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w55.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Public Guardianship Office (PGO) experienced severe service delivery problems during 2002&#150;03 resulting in a large number of complaints (1,338 for the year) and key performance measures being missed. It has addressed these problems, so that this year numbers of complaints are well below those from the previous year (456 to end December 2003) and the PGO is on track to achieve almost all of its key performance measures at the end of March 2004.

<P>
<a name="40223w56.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 For the purpose of the offence set out in clause 2 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill, whether or not an excuse for failing to have a document is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 225W</I><P>
However, the offence explicitly rules out deliberate destruction or disposal as an excuse, unless that destruction or disposal is for a reasonable cause or beyond the control of the person concerned. Certain behaviour does not amount to a reasonable cause, namely if the destruction or disposal was with a view to delaying or enhancing a claim or on the instructions or advice of a facilitator.

<P>
<a name="40223w56.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Generally speaking asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the United Kingdom while their claim for asylum is being processed. The Government are aware that some applicants use the asylum system as an alternative route for economic migration and we believe it is vital to discourage this and to send out a message that we will not tolerate abuse of the asylum system.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w57.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced wide changes to the sentencing powers of the courts;
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para9">For the first time, we have made explicit the purposes of sentencing and put them into statute. They are: public protection, punishment, crime reduction and reparation and the reform and rehabilitation of offenders.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para10">We have also put in place key principles to guide the Court when determining the seriousness of the offence and the severity of the resulting sentence. The most important of these is that previous convictions (where they are recent and relevant) should be treated as an aggravating factor when determining sentence severity.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para11">The courts must treat offences as aggravated, for sentencing purposes, where the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation or disability has been a contributing factor.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para12">The Act establishes a new Sentencing Guidelines Council whose role will be to promote consistent sentencing and which will be responsible for issuing guidelines on sentencing for the range of criminal offences.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para13">Magistrates will be able to sentence offenders for terms of imprisonment of up to 12 months instead of the current six months maximum.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para14">The Act provides a new indeterminate sentence for dangerous offenders, which means such an offender can be kept in custody until the Parole Board assesses him as presenting a risk which is manageable in the community.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para15">We are transforming the structure of short prison sentences so that they will be more effective at addressing the needs of offenders. New custodial sentences of less than 12 months will consist of a short 'custodial period' of between two weeks and three months followed by a 'licence period' of at least six months.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para16">The Act introduces intermittent custody for low risk offenders where the term of imprisonment is between 28 and 51 weeks duration. Intermittent custody allows for the sentence to be served either during weekdays or weekends, so that offenders can maintain jobs and relationships that contribute to rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="40223w57.html_para17">The generic community sentence will allow sentencers a much greater degree of flexibility in putting together tough community sentences that will be tailored to the needs of offenders at any level of seriousness. Where a court decides to impose a community sentence this can be tailored to fit the individual and may include an order to perform unpaid work or specific activities. It may also include exclusion orders or orders for treatment for drug or alcohol abuse.

 We are committed to reducing the levels of fear of crime among older people.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what decision has been made regarding increased funding for local authorities affected by the Hillingdon judgment of 2003; and if he will make a statement;  [153014]
<P>
<UL>(2) how much extra funding has been <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;earmarked for and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;paid (i) to each local authority which has a UK port or airport and (ii) specifically in respect of (A) Heathrow airport, (B) Gatwick airport, (C) Stansted airport and (D) the ports of Dover and Folkestone following the Hillingdon judgment of 2003.  [153015]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w58.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The Hillingdon judgment mainly concerns the availability of leaving care services for former unaccompanied asylum seeking children who have turned 18. Funding for leaving care services is provided by the Department for Education and Skills. My right hon. friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced on 19&nbsp;November 2003 that an additional &#163;10&nbsp;million would be made available from 2004&#150;05 to top up the existing funding for care leavers.
<P>

<a name="40223w58.html_para2">The Home Office provides funding for the support of unaccompanied asylum seeking children aged under 18 through an annual grant to local authorities. The unit cost rates for 2003&#150;04 were announced in a letter from the Director of NASS to local authorities on 15&nbsp;January. For those aged 16 and 17 the rate is &#163;300 per child per week. This represents a 15&nbsp;per cent. increase over the previous year. For those aged 15 and under the rate is &#163;670 per child per week, an increase of 17&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40223w58.html_para3">The arrangements announced on 15&nbsp;January also allow for authorities who believe they have incurred significant additional costs to seek to have their level of grant considered under special circumstances arrangements. It is not possible to specify the amounts any authority will receive until these processes are complete. I would expect authorities receiving higher numbers of unaccompanied asylum seeking children, for example those with major air or sea ports in their area, to seek additional funding under these arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The information requested is not available. Information is not collated centrally on how many asylum applicants 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 235W</I><P>
enter the UK illegally in any given year. The available information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records and would be unreliable.
<P>

<a name="40223w58.html_para4">Overall it is estimated that 42&nbsp;per cent. of total asylum applications made in 2002 resulted in grants of asylum (10&nbsp;per cent.), or of exceptional leave to remain (23&nbsp;per cent.) or in allowed appeals (10&nbsp;per cent.), including outcomes occurring after 2002. Corresponding information on the numbers of failed asylum seekers who applied in 2002 and have subsequently been removed is not available and could be produced only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case files.
<P>

<a name="40223w58.html_para5">Information on the outcomes of asylum-related initial decisions, and appeals, and removals is published in the annual statistical bulletin 'Asylum Statistics United Kingdom 2002', a copy of which is available from the Library, and quarterly on the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of how many illegal immigrants will be prevented from entering the UK in a year by photocopying air passengers' passports.  [153125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w58.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 A requirement for carriers to provide copies of travel documents would enable quicker determination of genuine identity, thereby speeding up processing times for asylum claims, which reduces detention and support costs. This would also assist with the redocumentation and removal process for those passengers who subsequently make unfounded asylum claims. The application of such a power should also deter a number of unfounded asylum applicants and illegal entrants from travelling to the UK in the first place. The proposed targeted approach of this power would allow effort to be concentrated on routes and areas of greatest concern. We are discussing with the airlines proposals for a voluntary trial scheme, whose results will help to establish how the new power would be most effective.

They receive continual support and mentoring from more experienced colleagues in a team working environment where the sharing and pooling of acquired expertise is actively encouraged. They also receive any additional training or mentoring necessitated by changes in legislation, policy and procedures, and attend developmental presentations or seminars provided by organisations such as UNHCR and the Medical Foundation. The effectiveness of the training is regularly evaluated to ensure that it continues to match the induction and development needs of new caseworkers.

 We are pursuing our policy of managed migration so that those who want to apply to come and work in the United Kingdom lawfully to meet the country's economic needs can do so on the basis of informed choice and with access to the rights and freedoms available to other workers. In combination, we are strengthening action against illegal working. The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Bill, currently before Parliament, will create a new offence of trafficking for exploitation, including forced labour, with a maximum penalty of 14 years. We intend to strengthen the document checks employers are required to carry out under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. We have been active tackling issues related to gangmasters and support the objectives set out in the Gangmasters (Licensing) Bill introduced by the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons nurses working in the UK with a work permit are barred from registering with a nursing agency.  [153102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w60.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Work permits are not issued to employment agencies and similar businesses for any employment because we wish to ensure that the employer is directly responsible for the duties of the post for which the work permit is issued. Work supplementary to that for which the permit is issued is also subject to this restriction. Overseas nurses are free to use the services of employment agencies and similar types of business to search for further employment opportunities, but it is for the employer, not the agency, that should apply for the work permit.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will change the definition of persistent offenders, with particular reference to rural areas.  [151941]

 The national Persistent Offender Scheme that came into effect in April 2003 defines a Core Persistent Offender as "someone who is 18 or over and has been convicted of six or more recordable offences in the last 12 months". The definition was developed in order to provide an objective test of persistent offending that can be applied across the criminal justice system. However the scheme recognises that there are individuals who do not meet this definition, who may be suspected of being prolific offenders on the basis of local intelligence. Therefore Local Criminal Justice Areas have the flexibility also to apply persistent offender strategies to "Local Persistent Offenders", identified on the basis of local intelligence and priorities, which could include issues of particular relevance to rural areas.

<a name="40223w61.html_para0">The Government welcome the recognition by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) that they must work to reduce the number of collisions involving police vehicles.
<P>

<a name="40223w61.html_para1">Measures already in place include a new police driver training course, launched in December 2000, which introduced a universal standard for driving in England and Wales. An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect.
<P>

<a name="40223w61.html_para2">Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off.
<P>

<a name="40223w61.html_para3">ACPO are working closely with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to identify how police vehicle collisions might be avoided. Useful information can be expected from the increasing use by forces of Automatic Data Recorders (ADR) and Vehicle Accident Data Recorders (VADR). These operate in a similar way to aircraft black boxes, providing data on such issues as speed, gear changes, breaking, and the use of blue lights.

<a name="40223w62.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what factors have been identified as accounting for the increase of self-harming incidents in prisons between 1999 and 2003; and if he will make a statement.  [154176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w62.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> In December 2002 new procedures for reporting self-injury were introduced in prisons in England and Wales. The evidence suggests that much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from this rather than an actual increase in the incidence of self-harm.




<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 249W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40223w62.html_para0">Beyond that, the reasons for any increase in prisoner self-harm may be related to the fact that the prison population includes a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm. Additionally, the current operating environment is very challenging because an increased prisoner population and movement of prisoners puts a strain on resources and makes it more challenging to prevent suicides and self-harm. Long-term trends suggest that self-inflicted deaths have been increasing since 1988, broadly in line with the increase in prison population.
<P>

<a name="40223w62.html_para1">A number of intervention strategies have been introduced into establishments for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to establishments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w62.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> Provisional estimates of the costs are in the region of &#163;1.5&nbsp;million a year. The Ombudsman's office is working on the detail of the new arrangements in consultation with my officials. The necessary extra resources will be provided as part of the Ombudsman's funding for the next financial year. In the meantime, we have provided an additional &#163;100,000 for start-up costs in the current year.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40223w62.html_para2">All customers, including those leaving prison, may make a Housing Benefit claim up to 13 weeks in advance. Where there is continuous good cause for delay customers may also apply for their Housing Benefit to be backdated. We have no plans to change these arrangements at present.
<P>

<a name="40223w62.html_para3">Jobcentre Plus currently assist released prisoners by waiving labour market conditions for the first seven days of their claim and by providing pre-arranged work focused interviews through the Freshstart initiative. As many Housing Benefit applications are linked to claims

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many and what percentage of crimes in each ward in each principal seaside town in England and Wales were drug-related, in the latest month for which figures are available, with figures for Welsh seaside town clusters disaggregated; and if he will make a statement.

 The role of the Sentencing Guidelines Council is to issue guidance on all aspects of sentencing so as to promote consistent and just sentencing by the courts within the framework provided by Parliament. Recruitment of members is currently under way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w63.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the case for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;using tagging with an intensive supervision order and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;making tagged offenders who can afford it pay a rental for tagging equipment.  [150180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w63.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) operates within the supervision order for juveniles. The programme is being evaluated by Oxford university and the evaluation report with 12 month reconviction data is now expected in April 2004. Electronic tagging provides the main form of monitoring of the offender on ISSP. Other forms of monitoring include voice verification.
<P>

<a name="40223w63.html_para0">Electronic monitoring is also used with curfew orders and tagging on bail as well as early release from custody. Evaluation of tagging for juveniles on curfew orders has been published. Progress is also being made on developing the Intensive Control and Change Programme with tagging for 18 to 20-year-old adults and we are extending the pilot areas.
<P>

<a name="40223w63.html_para1">We have no proposals to charge juvenile or adult offenders for tagging. The financial benefits of charging offenders for use of tagging equipment are likely to be small and offset by administration and enforcement costs. Tagging is already a cost effective alternative to custody.

 Arrangements for the issuing of visas are specific to the individual visa issuing Post and are influenced by factors such as the level of demand, and local security situation. Applicants may lodge applications online, in person or by courier service or post. Visa sections may return successful applicants' passports by courier service, or return their endorsed passport to them in person. In the US the visa issuing Posts in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York accept applications made on-line, by post or in person. Visa sections in non-EU or non-Commonwealth countries may operate any one or more of these methods.
<P>

<a name="40223w63.html_para2">US Nationals are not visa nationals and are therefore only obliged to apply for entry clearance to the UK in specific categories, as set out in the Immigration Rules or if coming to the UK for longer than six months. Visa nationals, which include certain non-EU and non-Commonwealth citizens, are required to obtain entry clearance to enter the UK for any period or purpose. Whether applying for entry clearance or not, the same conditions, as set out in the Immigration Rules, apply to all non-EU or non-Commonwealth nationals.

 Immigration and Nationality Department officials are working closely with UKvisas to ensure that all requests for information are handled promptly, effectively and securely by those involved. On 10&nbsp;January this year a new system was introduced making greater use of electronic transmissions. This will also provide an audit trail for each request for information. UKvisas and the relevant Home Office Departments are constantly reviewing the system. Work is currently under way to identify further improvements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 14&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 762W, on HMYOI Wetherby, what assessment he has made of the reasons for the increases in costs per prisoner and cost per prisoner place; and what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;cost and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;increase in cost is per (i) prisoner and (ii) prisoner place.

<a name="40223w64.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people sought asylum from Zimbabwe in the last 12 months; how many applications <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;succeeded and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;failed; how many failed applicants have been removed; and how many were white Zimbabwean farmers in each case.  [154041]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w64.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 1&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The following tables show the number of asylum applications, initial decisions and appeal outcomes between October 2002 and September 2003 and the number of removals between October 2002 and June 2003, the latest published figures available, for nationals of Zimbabwe. Initial decisions do not necessarily relate to applications made in the same period. Appeals do not necessarily relate to refusals of grants of asylum, humanitarian protection or discretionary leave made in the same period. Removals do not necessarily relate to initial decisions or appeal outcomes made in the same period.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para0">Information on the ethnic origin or occupation of asylum applicants is unavailable. The requested information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para1">Information on asylum applications, initial decisions on asylum applications, appeal outcomes and removals by nationality is published in quarterly web pages and in the annual statistical bulletin Asylum Statistics United Kingdom, available from the Home Office website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html. The next quarterly publication, covering the fourth quarter of 2003 and provisional full year data, will be published on 24&nbsp;February.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is on the removal of failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe; and if he will make a statement.  [154042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w64.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in January 2002 a suspension of removals of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe. This was in response to concerns about the serious deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe in the build-up to the presidential election held in March that year. We did not, at that time, regard it as unsafe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, but in view of the rapidly changing conditions we considered that it would be appropriate not to enforce returns.




<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 264W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para2">The Government's position is, as it has been since January 2002, that each asylum (and human rights) claim made by a Zimbabwean national will be considered on its individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information including that obtained from and through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para3">We do of course recognise that conditions in Zimbabwe are such that there are individuals who are able to demonstrate a need for international protection. Where they meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 convention, asylum is granted. There may also be individuals whose circumstances make them particularly vulnerable and who would engage our obligations under the ECHR. Where this is the case these individuals will be granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para4">In the first nine months of last year, we granted asylum to 755 Zimbabweans and granted other forms of protection to 30 others. These statistics show that we are giving protection to the significant number of people who are found to be in need of it.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para5">If an application is refused, there will be a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities against that decision. Should a claim be refused and any appeal be unsuccessful that means that, for that individual, return to Zimbabwe would be safe. That is why we consider it reasonable to expect an individual in that position to leave voluntarily.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para6">However, although it would be safe for failed asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe, our view at present is that in the wider context of the Government's position on Zimbabwe, it would be inappropriate forcibly to return them at this time. The exceptions we would make to that policy are in cases where a failed asylum seeker 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 265W</I><P>
had a serious criminal record or their presence in the United Kingdom was not otherwise conducive to the public good. In such circumstances enforced return to Zimbabwe would be considered by Ministers on a case by case basis.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para7">The policy remains under continuous review.

 The Government's objective is to save more lives by providing faster, more responsive emergency ambulance services, with better trained staff; and to deliver improved patient assessment and treatment while making more use of technology.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para8">Immediately life-threatening emergency calls (Category A) should be responded to 75&nbsp;per cent. of the time within eight minutes, irrespective of location. Clinical evidence shows that achievement of the 75&nbsp;per cent. standard could save as many as 1,800 lives each year.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para9">Other emergency calls that are not life threatening should be responded to 95&nbsp;per cent. of the time within 14 minutes in urban areas and 19 minutes in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="40223w64.html_para10">The latest information about ambulance performance is contained in the Department of Health Statistical Bulletin, "Ambulance Services, England 2002&#150;03". Copies of the bulletin have been placed in the Library.

<a name="40223w65.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 In January 2003, the Department published a good practice guide; "Discharge from hospital: pathway, process and practice". This puts the patient and their carer at the heart of the process for discharge from acute hospital care to other forms of care. February 2003 guidance on reconfiguration, "Keeping the NHS Local", also emphasises the need to expand the range of local options available from providers across the whole health and social care system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the future demand for anaesthetists in Northumberland and Tyne and Wear Strategic Health Authority area following the introduction of the European Working Time Directive; and if he will make a statement on meeting the demand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w65.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Working Time Directive (WTD) is an integral part of modernising and improving services at all levels. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are responsible for planning for implementation by national health service trusts of the WTD for doctors in training from August 2004, as part of their overall NHS planning.
<P>

<a name="40223w65.html_para0">It is for local organisations to determine the level of staff needed to implement the WTD and to deliver a quality service. Priority will be given to trusts facing WTD challenges in the allocation of an additional 1,500 locally funded specialist registrar training opportunities, subject to educational approval being obtained.
<P>

<a name="40223w65.html_para1">Figures from the September 2002 Department of Health census show that, in the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear SHA, there were 272 staff with a specialty in anaesthetics. Of these 138 were consultants. As part of the local delivery plans, the local health economy is planning an increase to 176.48 whole time equivalent consultants by 31&nbsp;March 2006.
<P>

<a name="40223w65.html_para2">In addition to recruiting increased numbers of consultants, the NHS in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear is looking at new and innovative ways to provide services.

 Independent data published in July 2003 found that the number of care home places available nationally exceeded demand by 10,000. Where there are local capacity issues to be addressed, it is for local councils to assess the need for care home places in their areas in the light of local circumstances and preferences and to commission services to meet assessed needs. They should act in consultation with people needing services and local providers.

 It is not possible to give the exact costs for abolishing community health councils (CHCs). We have estimated the running costs for CHCs from 1&nbsp;April to 1&nbsp;December 2003 and for a residual period up to March 2004 at &#163;15&nbsp;million. Additionally, redundancy costs are estimated at &#163;14.9&nbsp;million and the estimated costs for rent, rates, servicing and security of vacant CHC offices is &#163;1.62&nbsp;million per annum. A number of these premises are under offer or are awaiting sale or assignment to other bodies, including national health service organisations, and the position will change as these progress.

 The Government firmly believes that women and their families should be given information on the use of both re-usable and disposable nappies to make an informed choice. The Pregnancy Book and Birth to Five are two comprehensive information booklets produced by the Department of Health, which are given free to all first time mothers. Both publications give detailed information on both reusable and disposable nappies, including information about nappy laundering services, and suggest that parents ask their midwife to show them how to fold/pin terry nappies if they decide to use them.

 The National Health Service provides very few nappies for newborn babies; mothers are encouraged to provide their own nappies. The main exception is extremely premature babies, for whom commercially available nappies are too large. NHS-bought nappies are therefore provided.

 We are committed to rebuilding and restoring national health service dentistry to improve oral health. The report, "NHS Dentistry: Options for Change", published in 2002, set out the ideas and principles behind the reform of NHS dentistry. Central to these changes are the aims of:

From 1&nbsp;April 2005, primary care trusts (PCTs) will assume a new responsibility for commissioning dental services supported by the &#163;1.2 billion resources currently held centrally.
<P>

<a name="40223w67.html_para6">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act also provides for the replacement of the existing Dental Practice Board by a new special health authority for England and Wales with a wider remit for modernisation and change.

<a name="40223w69.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Junior doctors receive a banding supplement reflecting the amount and intensity of their out of hours work. When junior doctors contract for a rotation they are made aware of the bandings of the posts they will be working in. As circumstances change, posts may be adjusted and rebanded and the pay for new entrants to such posts may reduce to a level commensurate with the work undertaken. However, for those already contracted to fill those posts, rotation pay protection (built into the national contract for all doctors in training) applies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w70.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The figure of 58,000 is an estimate in the absence of data on numbers of privately funded residents in residential care homes. There were around 120,000 older local authority supported residents in independent sector care homes in March 2003. The "PSSRU 1996 Survey of Care Homes for Elderly People", www.pssru.ac.uk/pdf/dp1423~2.pdf, found that around one third of older residents of independent sector residential care homes were privately funded.

 The specific and general duties of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 places an onus on statutory bodies to identify and tackle racial discrimination faced by the black and minority ethnic community.
<P>

<a name="40223w70.html_para1">In support of this for mental health services we have issued for consultation "Delivering Race Equality&#151;A Framework for Action" which sets out what those planning, delivering and monitoring local primary care and mental health services need to do to improve services for users, relatives and carers from black and minority ethnic communities. This is backed up by a programme of work by the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE).
<P>

<a name="40223w70.html_para2">NIMHE has also issued "Engaging & Changing&#151;Developing effective policy for the care and treatment of Black and minority ethnic detained patients". The document provides guidance in relation to the development of policies concerning the care and treatment of black and minority ethnic communities in the areas of ethnic monitoring, racial harassment, the use of interpreters and the provision of culturally appropriate care and staff training.

<P>

 The NHS Plan introduced an improving working lives standard in 2000 which makes it clear that every member of staff in the national health service is entitled to work in an organisation which can prove that it is investing in improving diversity and tackling discrimination and harassment. All NHS organisations including mental health trusts have to achieve the standard, which is a key performance indicator, part of the star rating system.
<P>

<a name="40223w70.html_para3">In relation to tackling racial harassment an improving working lives toolkit "Improving Working Lives: Tackling Racial Harassment in the NHS&#151;Good Practice Guidance" was issued in 2001. This guidance sets out key principles on tackling racial harassment in NHS employment.
<P>

<a name="40223w70.html_para4">The need for local policies to deal with staff/patient and patient/patient racial harassment where patients have been detained under the Mental Health Act is highlighted in the National Institute for Mental Health document "Delivering Race Equality&#151;A Framework for Action and Engaging and Changing&#151;Developing effective policy for the care and treatment of Black and minority ethnic detained patients".

Examples of these are nurses trained as first assistants in surgery, as perioperative surgical practitioners, as specialist mental health nurses, and as pre-admission nurses. These pilots have shown that nurse practitioners and nurses in specialist roles can be extremely effective at both helping a trust to achieve compliant rotas and improving the quality of patient care. In all of these pilots, however, the nurses' roles are combined with changes to medical staff working patterns, and changes to service delivery, which together improve WTD compliance.

 National action to improve services for people with osteoporosis is being taken forward through the work of the orthopaedic services improvement team, part of the National Health Service Modernisation Agency, and implementation of the national service framework (NSF) for older people. The prevention, treatment, care and support of those at risk of osteoporosis are important components in the delivery of the integrated falls services that the NSF requires to be in place locally by April 2005.

 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The national programme for information technology is responsible for introducing the National Health Service care record service (NHS CRS), which will lead to the NHS having an integrated, electronic record management service for the first time. The NHS CRS will provide each patient with a single, comprehensive set of electronic medical and care notes. This will enable all authorised clinicians involved with the care of a patient, to see and share health information. Local practices and hospitals will continue to hold detailed local records, but additionally a summary health record will be created containing essential data such as allergies, current treatments or medication.
<P>

<a name="40223w72.html_para1">The NHS CRS will also ensure that key data and information is entered only once and then available to multiple users and professionals who are authorised to access. It will support better clinical decision making, remove the need for repeat and potentially harmful tests simply because the previous record is lost or not available and improve the quality of the time spent with the patient.
<P>

<a name="40223w72.html_para2">The security and confidentiality of patient information is an absolute priority in the context of electronic records and transmissions. Within the contracts for new applications, systems and services being negotiated with IT suppliers are stringent terms around ensuring security, control, alerts and audit measures, including encryption. We will have a right to terminate the contract of any supplier that fails to deliver the high standards that NHS patients and professionals are entitled to expect.

<a name="40223w72.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The electronic transmission of prescriptions is one of the core programmes within the national programme for information technology (NPflT) in the national health service in England. The electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP) programme will enable prescribers to create and transfer prescription data electronically to a patient's community pharmacist and the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA). As well as being more convenient for the patient (for example in relation to repeat prescriptions), this will improve safety by reducing prescription errors and providing better information at the point of prescribing and dispensing. It will also ensure that information about what has been prescribed and dispensed forms part of each person's NHS care record. In addition, ETP will deliver important administrative improvements.
<P>

<a name="40223w72.html_para5">The NHS Plan did not contain a specific target in relation to the electronic transmission of prescriptions. We are working towards the timetable for implementation contained in "Delivering 21st Century IT Support in the NHS". This stated, "the National Prescriptions Service will be 50&nbsp;per cent. implemented by December 2005 and fully implemented by December 2007". This work is being taken forward by the NPfIT in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="40223w72.html_para6">Key elements of the electronic transmission of prescriptions system have been procured as part of the recently concluded NHS care records service procurements. Work is now focusing on how community pharmacies can be connected to the system, and how their pharmacy computer systems can be upgraded to comply with the requisite technical specification. It is intended that deployment of the live system will commence in January 2005.

<a name="40223w73.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Lait: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the Answer of 21&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1362&#150;63W, what the resource implications are to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;local government and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the NHS of the requirement for national services within the NHS to consult Overview and Scrutiny committees when they wish to change a national service; and whether a regulatory analysis of the system has been published.  [155078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w73.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 It is not possible to assess the resource implications for local government or national health service organisations in relation to the requirement for overview and scrutiny committees to be consulted on changes to national NHS services, since each circumstance will lead to a different set of arrangements. It is right that substantial changes are appropriately consulted upon and that both local government and the NHS treat that consultation as a priority for local people affected by any proposed change. Local government and the NHS locally should set aside funding to ensure that such changes do receive rigorous consultation to ensure local people's interests are taken into consideration.
<P>

<a name="40223w73.html_para4">To date, there has not been any regulatory analysis of the work of overview and scrutiny committees in relation to health services. The Department is making a one-off payment to the Centre for Public Scrutiny to undertake a programme of work to support and enable health scrutiny by local government. Part of the three-year programme will be to put in place an evaluation of health scrutiny, including health service consultations, and to assess the outcomes for local people resulting from the input of overview and scrutiny committees.

 The Sex Lottery campaign has been carefully designed to target young adults, aged 18 to 30, who are most at risk from sexually transmitted infections and who would benefit from increased information and awareness raising. A variety of publications and media outlets have been used to reach this audience, and a full detailed list has been placed in the Library.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. These figures represent a count of all FCEs where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (7 prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<P>





2. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w74.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Information on national health service spending on the treatment and rehabilitation of stroke is not collected centrally. Primary care trusts (PCTs) receive unified allocations to cover the costs of hospital and community health services, discretionary funding for general practice staff, premises and computers and primary care prescribing.
<P>

<a name="40223w74.html_para4">The level of funding made available for the drugs, staffing and other costs of providing stroke services are determined locally. It is for PCTs, in partnership with local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to provide health services for their populations, including those with stroke.
<P>

<a name="40223w74.html_para5">Management of much of the research supported by NHS research and development funding is devolved and expenditure at project level is not held centrally by the Department. The main agency through which the government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body that receives its grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC spent an estimated &#163;4.9&nbsp;million on stroke research in 2002&#150;03.

 Advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathies advisory committee indicates that good decontamination is key in reducing the risk of person to person transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) through surgical instruments.
<P>

<a name="40223w74.html_para6">A circular (HSC 2000/032) was issued to the national health service on 18&nbsp;October 2000, emphasising the importance of effective decontamination in preventing the spread of vCJD. In addition, the Department has surveyed the effectiveness of decontamination services and taken action to ensure all NHS hospitals in England had access to decontamination services of an acceptable standard by December 2001.

<P>
<a name="40223w74.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 There are no plans to impose a general restriction on the prescription of unlicensed medicines to children.
<P>

<a name="40223w74.html_para7">Most medicines have only been tested for safe and effective use in the adult population and there are comparatively few medicines on the market that are specifically licensed for the treatment of children. This leads to prescribers having no option but to prescribe unlicensed and off-label medications in this patient population.
<P>

<a name="40223w74.html_para8">Normally, if a product has not been licensed for use in children because of a lack of clinical trial data and/or clinical experience, the summary of product characteristics contains statements to this effect and use in children is not recommended. However, further restrictions (contraindications) have been introduced with respect to the off-label or unlicensed use of specific medicinal products where there is evidence that the benefit/risk may be unfavourable.
<P>

<a name="40223w74.html_para9">The real solution to this problem lies not in restricting paediatric prescribing but in stimulating the development and testing of appropriately formulated medicines for use in the paediatric population. It is expected that the European Commission will adopt a proposal for a Regulation on medicines for paediatric use by the end of April 2004. It will contain a number of incentives and obligations to stimulate the development of medicines for children. In the mean time officials have been asked to develop a UK strategy to deliver, in the short and medium term, improved availability of medicines that are appropriately labelled and appropriately formulated for use in children.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w78.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what resources are made available to New Deal advisers to provide practical advice to members of the public on the New Deal programme who are not graduates, who wish to acquire additional skills to pursue careers which require graduate level entry.  [154341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w78.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The primary aim of New Deal is to help people into employment as soon as possible. The advice given to non-graduate New Deal participants wishing to pursue careers requiring graduate entry level qualifications could depend on a range of factors including the person's existing qualifications, their financial situation, the availability of the training required, and the entry criteria for specific courses.
<P>

<a name="40223w78.html_para0">New Deal advisers have knowledge of the local labour market and access to a range of resources to assist them in providing appropriate advice and guidance to all New Deal participants. Resources used by advisers include: careers publications, access to the internet, links with training providers and local colleges as well as Connexions/Careers Service. Someone without the relevant qualifications to start a degree or diploma course could, for example be referred to an Access Course, which can be funded under New Deal. People interested in further or higher education would also be given advice on sources of funding such as Career Development Loans, and referred to relevant educational bodies for more detailed advice on course funding.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w78.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what procedures are followed to ensure that training programmes and allied support within the New Deal are tailored to an individual's requirements;  [154342]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make it his policy to ensure that individuals are not placed on New Deal training courses that provide guidance and advice on skills the person has already acquired.  [154343]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w78.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The New Deal is primarily a 'jobs first' programme and its success is measured through the number of people helped into work; so far nearly one million people have been helped into employment through New Deal.
<P>

<a name="40223w78.html_para1">Training programmes, and other support available through New Deal, are intended to equip people with the skills needed to compete effectively in the local

<P><I>23 Feb 2004 : Column 316W</I><P>
labour market. Effort is made to tailor courses and other support to meet individuals' requirements but this has to be balanced against the recruitment and skills needs of local employers and the likelihood of the training improving employment prospects. In circumstances where the needs of an individual cannot be met through normal contracts with training providers, one-off courses or training provision can be purchased if this is likely to improve the person's chances of getting quickly into work.
<P>

<a name="40223w78.html_para2">It is not the intention of New Deal to place people on training courses that provide them with skills they already have. However, participants on the mandatory New Deal programmes may be expected to attend courses to help address their barriers to work, for example, a two-week Gateway to Work course, which provides jobsearch and motivational support.

 The most recent monthly progress report on pension credit, accompanied by tables showing the number of pension credit households in each parliamentary constituency in Great Britain, was published on 9&nbsp;February.

<P>
<a name="40223w78.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. However, we estimate that there are approximately 3.15&nbsp;million pensioner households in England likely to be eligible for pension credit. The 



<P>

latest monthly pension credit progress report, published on 9&nbsp;February, shows that at 31&nbsp;January, approximately 1.82&nbsp;million pensioner households in England were receiving pension credit. As at the same date, the numbers of households receiving pension credit in Portsmouth, North and Portsmouth South were 2,555 and 3,862 respectively.
<P>

<a name="40223w78.html_para5">We are currently in the main phase of our marketing campaign for pension credit and aim to have at least 3&nbsp;million households in receipt of pension credit by 2006. By June 2004, we will have written to all pensioner households, explaining about the new entitlement. Direct mail is being supported by extensive TV and press advertising. From May we intend to focus campaign activity on those pensioners who are likely to be entitled but who have not responded. The Pension Service local service is playing a key role, particularly in encouraging pensioners who are less likely to take up their entitlement to apply.

However, we estimate that around 250,000 pensioner households in the North East Government Office Region (GOR) and around 3.8&nbsp;million pensioner households in Great Britain are eligible for pension credit. Information on numbers of pension credit recipients and average awards in the areas mentioned is given in the table.

 The new system for distributing formula grant to local authorities was introduced in 2003&#150;04 following an extensive review involving both central and local government, and a full and open public consultation exercise.
<P>

<a name="40223w82.html_para3">The new system was designed to distribute grant to local authorities according to their relative circumstances&#151;or relative need. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is satisfied that the new grant distribution system is both fair and sustainable.

 As part of the consultation on the provisional local government finance settlement 2004&#150;05, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received 454 written responses from 275 individual authorities, MPs and others. A further 34 arrived after the close of consultation. Ministers also met delegations from the Local Government Association, the Association of London Government and four groups of local authorities. Parliament has now approved the settlement which provides local authorities with a 5.5&nbsp;per cent. increase in general grant.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is carefully considering the case for making regulations to empower local authorities to deal with any Local Government Pension Scheme cases which have not been referred to an Employment Tribunal but which constitute a valid claim in all other respects.
<P>

<a name="40223w82.html_para4">The Local Government Pensions Committee of the Employers' Organisation for Local Government, in consultation with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, have issued guidance to local authorities consequent on directions from the Employment Tribunal. Further guidance in relation to the Local Government Pension Scheme is being prepared. As a result, many claims lodged with Employment Tribunals have now either been struck out or are in the process of being settled by employing authorities. Some claims may be affected by certain legal issues which have yet to be resolved.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) came into existence following the Machinery of Government changes on 29&nbsp;May 2002. I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Liddell-Grainger) on 16&nbsp;July 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 358W. The cost of using management consultants is not separately recorded and could be ascertained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w82.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, from April 2004, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's Prudential Code requires all local authorities to prepare each year estimates of their revenue and capital spending for three years ahead. They are also required to consider known significant variations beyond that timeframe. The Government strongly supports this requirement, and have given statutory backing to the Prudential Code using powers in the Local Government Act 2003.

<P>
<a name="40223w82.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the budget overspend was for each metropolitan authority in each of the last three financial years; and what estimate he has made of budget overspends for the 2003&#150;04 financial year.  [155994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w82.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The amount by which metropolitan authority spend has exceeded their budget forecast for 2000&#150;01, 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 is as tabled. A negative figure shows that the authority spent less than their budget estimate.
<P>

The large under spend figure for Sunderland for 2000&#150;01 is mainly attributable to a revenue receipt of &#163;53.9&nbsp;million in March 2001 being included in their accounts for that year.<P>

 All local authorities have been put on notice that the Government considers that they can and should deliver council tax increases in low single figures in 2004&#150;05.

 Until the Best Value framework was established by the Local Government Act 1999 and the results of Comprehensive Performance Assessments (CPAs) became available, central Government did not hold comprehensive information on which authorities the Audit Commission had identified as having serious shortcomings in their financial controls. Two metropolitan authorities now have been identified under these processes: Walsall, as the result of a corporate governance review, which found significant weaknesses in its financial processes; and North Tyneside, which scored the lowest possible rating for financial standing in its CPA.

 Local planning authorities can invite a retrospective planning application for unauthorised development where they judge that there are no planning objections to it. Otherwise, authorities have wide ranging enforcement powers to control development undertaken without planning permission.

 When development has been carried out to an acceptable standard, or it can be made acceptable by the imposition of conditions attached to a grant of planning permission, it is reasonable to enable the developer or landowner to obtain permission after the event. The considerations applying in determining a planning application will in general be the same regardless of whether or not the development has taken place.

Costs so far have been associated with securing the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003 and enabling referendums in the three northern regions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the costs of abolishing regional chambers in regions where an elected assembly is established; and how those costs would be met.  [155141]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It will be for the voluntary regional chambers to decide whether they should abolish themselves. The Government will cease to pay grant to the chambers in regions with elected assemblies as the functions currently supported by grant will transfer to the new assemblies.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will ensure that the size of a central Government grant to an elected regional assembly will require no assembly to precept more than the equivalent of five pence per week for a Band D council tax-payer to cover its administrative costs in its first financial year.  [155143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government has already said in paragraph 5.8 of the White Paper 'Your Region, Your Choice' that "In setting the level of central Government grant, we will expect council tax-payers in any region with an elected regional assembly to contribute the equivalent of around five pence per week for a Band D council tax-payer".
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) how much the South West Regional Assembly has cost since its creation;  [155302]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the budget of the South West Regional Assembly has been in each year since its creation.  [155303]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The regional chambers are voluntary bodies and may receive funding from a variety of sources. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not therefore hold information on the South West Regional Assembly's annual budget. This is a question for the Assembly itself.
<P>

<a name="40223w83.html_para2">Since April 2001 the Government has paid grants to South West Regional Assembly totalling &#163;2,626,967 in order for it to undertake scrutiny of the South West Development Agency and (since April 2003) to act as the recognised Regional Planning body for the South West Region.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what timetable has been set for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;printing and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;delivery of information for the referendums on elected regional assemblies.  [155458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 During the passage of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister made commitments to provide information on the referendums to every household in the regions affected. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will make arrangements for printing and delivery once the orders for referendums have been approved by Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what discussions have taken place, and with whom, on which constituencies are being considered as sites for headquarters of a regional assembly for the North West; and which constituencies are being considered.  [155459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No such talks have taken place. Paragraph 6.7 of the White Paper 'Your Region, Your Choice' explains that "It will be for an assembly to decide the best way to meet its accommodation requirements, including the location of its headquarters".

<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many regional assembly members there will be for the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;North East, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Yorkshire and Humberside and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;Lancashire; and what percentage of the population each will represent.  [155681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Paragraph 7.7 of the White Paper "Your Region, Your Choice" states that "assemblies should have between 25 and 35 members". The number for each region has not been decided. However, we expect that the North East, as the English region with the smallest population would have an Elected Assembly of 25 members, while Elected Assemblies for Yorkshire and Humber and the North West would have between 30 and 35 members each.
<P>

<a name="40223w83.html_para3">Paragraph 6.13 of the White Paper explains that the Government will "ask the Electoral Commission to advise on the boundaries of constituencies within regions that vote for elected regional assemblies" and the powers to do this are in the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the total number of staff working in the Government Office for the Regions is; how many of those staff have been transferred to the Government Office for the Regions from other Government Departments; and how many have been recruited from outside Government Departments.  [149649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40223w83.html_spnew15"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The total number of staff currently working for the nine Government Offices is 2,742. In addition there are about 100 secondees from the private, voluntary and community and other public sector bodies. All permanent staff working in Government Offices are employed by one of the Departments which conduct business through them.

 There are no time limits set for rent registrations in the 1977 Rent Act. The Rent Service works to a target of completing 87&nbsp;per cent. of Fair Rent applications within 40 working days of receipt. It is unusual for significant delays to occur, but where they have, The Rent Service has diverted resources to redress the situation.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is providing both financial and other support to assist local authorities in delivering decent homes. Over the period 2003&#150;06 &#163;7.9 billion is available for capital expenditure on the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) housing stock.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will provide extra resources for home improvement agencies to help older and vulnerable home owners to remain independent in their own homes and increase the statutory protection for tenants of private landlords by seeking to establish mandatory licensing for Houses in Multiple Occupation. Through a Regulatory Reform Order, local authorities have now much more freedom to help homeowners improve the condition of their homes which can include improvements to heating and insulation.

 In the financial year April 2003 to March 2004, South East England Development Agency will invest a total of &#163;13&nbsp;million on 17 projects on the Isle of Wight. The purpose of those projects is to support the sustainable economic development of the Island. Forecasted core outputs should: create or safeguard 388 jobs, create or fill 1,672 learning opportunities between three and 30 hours duration and 112 over 30 hours and create 40 new businesses while sustaining a further 12 for 12 months. The attached table applies this in more detail to individual projects.
<P>

<a name="40223w84.html_para6">SEEDA has also provided &#163;35,000 towards the Island's Community Wind project.
