<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has allocated at least &#163;200 million for Afghanistan over the five years 2002&#150;03 to 2006&#150;07. We are currently reviewing our country allocations for the 2003&#150;04 Resource Allocation Round. These will be published in the 2003 DFID departmental report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We do not keep a record of all consultations held since 1997 and it would involve disproportionate cost to compile such a list. However, all current consultations are now featured on DFID's website (www.dfid.gov.uk), as well as being available in printed format.

raise awareness of domestic violence in third world countries; and what developments are being made in providing services for victims.  [97745]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Gender equality is an essential precondition for poverty eradication and upholding human rights. Addressing domestic violence is an important component of this work. My Department is making a substantial effort to raise awareness of this complex issue, through partnerships with many poor countries, and with the donor community, including the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the UN Development Fund for Women. Support for legal literacy, and access to justice programmes, focus on women and address the root causes of disempowerment and vulnerability to violence&#151;especially domestic, but also by police, and in prisons.
<P>

<a name="30224w01.html_para4">In working to meet our objective to increase women's personal security and reduce gender-based violence, we are supporting for example:

<a name="30224w01.html_para5">For illustration, DFID assistance is helping to establish the first family protection unit in the Arab world, providing &#163;2 million over three years in Jordan. We are supporting work to sensitise the police in Bangladesh to violence against women, and counselling for the survivors of domestic violence (&#163;4 million over five years). In Pakistan, we are assisting in the design of a comprehensive national strategy including awareness-raising through a national "zero tolerance" media campaign, and the building of referral systems to provide support and recourse for victims, and for community-based dispute resolution (&#163;2 million over three years). In Uganda, we have supported pilot work to establish policy, procedures and practical measures at community level (&#163;95,000). There are many other similar examples.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) what financial resources have been allocated for the establishment of safe havens in Iraq in the event of war;  [97484]
<P>
<UL>(2) what financial resources have been allocated for the provision of clean water to Iraqi refugees in <i>(a)</i> Turkey, <i>(b)</i> Syria, <i>(c)</i> Jordan, <i>(d)</i> Saudi Arabia, <i>(e)</i> Kuwait and <i>(f)</i> Iran and their borders with Iraq in the event of war;  [97492]

(3) what financial resources have been allocated for the provision of shelter for Iraqi civilian refugees in <i>(a)</i> Turkey, <i>(b)</i> Syria, <i>(c)</i> Jordan, <i>(d)</i> Saudi Arabia, <i>(e)</i> Kuwait and <i>(f)</i> Iran, and their borders with Iraq, in the event of war.  [97536]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department does not pre-allocate financial resources for response to humanitarian crises before they happen. DFID provides a contingency reserve of &#163;100 million which we will draw on for the Iraqi emergency.




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 4W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30224w01.html_para6">DFID's funding for the UN and other humanitarian agencies includes provision for emergency preparedness for a variety of contingencies across the world. We are supplementing this funding with an additional &#163;3.5 million contribution to support UN humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq, including the prepositioning of basic supplies by UN agencies including UNHCR. We also fund a programme of assistance to Iraqi Refugees in Iran, which is managed by AMAR Appeal, an NGO, and consists of the provision of emergency supplies and primary health care for refugees living both in and outside of official camps.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) what discussions she has had with Save the Children regarding research they have carried out on the impact of any impending war against Iraq on Iraqi children; and if she will make a statement;  [97603]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions she has had to help ensure that Iraqi people receive aid in terms of food, water, clothing and accommodation in the event of a war against Iraq; and if she will make a statement;  [97605]
<P>
(3) what discussions she has had with aid organisations regarding the possible impact of a war against Iraq on existing food aid deliveries; and if she will make a statement.  [97602]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Iraqi people, including the children who make up half of the population, are already vulnerable. The prevalence of low birth-weight babies has increased more than five times in the last 10 years. A sudden disruption to this already fragile situation, including to the UN Oil for Food programme on which 60 per cent. of Iraqi people are dependent, could lead to a spiralling human catastrophe.
<P>

<a name="30224w01.html_para7">My Department is holding regular discussions with the Ministry of Defence, the US, UN and others about ways to minimise the suffering of the Iraqi people. One key priority would be to re-establish the Oil For Food distribution network as quickly as possible if it is disrupted. We are also providing an additional &#163;3.5 million funding for support to UN humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq, including the prepositioning of food and other essential supplies. My officials continue to discuss the humanitarian situation with NGOs, especially those who we are funding for ongoing humanitarian work in Iraq, including Save the Children.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions she has had with the United Nations regarding their estimates of the number of <i>(a)</i> children under five at risk of death, <i>(b)</i> mothers and children needing food and <i>(c)</i> people needing shelter in the event of a war in Iraq; and if she will make a statement.  [97604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w01.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department holds regular discussions with UN agencies about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and measures to respond to any crisis. United Nations planning estimates of the numbers who may be affected vary according to different scenarios of the extent and length of disruption to existing systems.

 We are giving high priority to the issue of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the WTO. An effective system of special and differential treatment is a key element in ensuring that the current round of WTO negotiations is truly a development round. Special and differential treatment needs to ensure that the implementation of WTO rules and efforts to negotiate and implement future disciplines make sense from a development perspective.
<P>

<a name="30224w02.html_para8">DFID is working with other key partners such as the World bank in order to push this issue forward. As part of this on-going programme of work, DFID will be hosting a seminar on special and differential treatment on 7 March this year which will be attended by representatives of the WTO, UNCTAD, the World bank, and developing country Governments, as well as NGOs and academics working in the area.

 Throughout the periods of industrial action by the Fire Brigades Union, the emergency fire cover service provided by the armed forces, supported by the police service for Northern Ireland and the retained firefighters who were not on strike, was able to deal effectively with all major fire-related and road traffic incidents. The armed forces operated well within capacity and there were no major disruptions to transport or other essential public services as a result of the dispute.

<a name="30224w02.html_para9">Although there were a number of road traffic fatalities and two fire-related deaths during the strikes, there are no indications that any of these deaths could have been avoided had normal fire cover been available.

 The Chief Executive of the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland has been actively involved in the development of the draft linguistic diversity policy from an early stage.

<P>

<a name="30224w03.html_para1">A first draft was prepared in 1999, but it soon became clear that more work was required, and the Trustees agreed to set up a small working group to take the matter forward. The outgoing Trustees did not have an opportunity to consider the next draft before the end of their term of office in June 2002. Since then, some further detailed work has been carried out, and it is hoped that the new Board will be able to consider and formally adopt the new draft shortly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if the Government will make it their policy to use the powers under Section 10 and Schedule 2 to the Human Rights Act 1998 to bring UK legislation in line with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Goodwin and I v UK (judgment of 11 July 2002); and if she will make a statement.

 As I announced on 13 December and in my written ministerial statement on 16 December, <i>Official Report,</i> column 36WS, the Government are committed to legislating as soon as possible to give transsexual people their Convention rights. We have decided against using a Remedial Order under the Human Rights Act because the Convention issues go beyond identifying possible incompatibilities with current law. The necessary response is so wide-ranging that only a Bill would be appropriate. I have corresponded on this subject with the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which agrees that proceeding by way of a Bill is the only proper approach in the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30224w05.html_para0">We are therefore taking forward work towards a draft Bill which we hope it will be possible to publish during the course of this session of Parliament.

<P>
<a name="30224w05.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Department's current fixed asset register came into being in April 1999 and it confirms that no operational heritage or antique assets have been sold since that date. Prior to April 1999 we have no specific records on heritage or antique asset disposals. However, it has never been my department's policy to dispose of such assets.

<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 17W</I><P>
civil legal aid, the LSC has introduced a variety of initiatives to improve access to legal advice and meet the representation needs of the socially excluded including a number aimed specifically at those with housing problems, and the homeless. These include a pilot project funding duty schemes in the county courts to cover housing possession cases; and spending &#163;2 million per year on a telephone advice pilot under which several housing advice services are providing legal help. We are also working to integrate the CLS into a number of cross Government initiatives on tackling social exclusion and working closely with other Departments to increase the number of quality marked outlets for CLS information. At a regional level, CLS Partnerships have also helped to improve access to legal help through grants from the Partnership Innovation Budget and joint work with Local Strategic Partnerships.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In April 1998, the Institute of Legal Executives joined the Bar Council and the Law Society as an authorised body in its own right and as a fully fledged part of the legal profession, in November 1999, the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents was similarly designated. These developments represent a small but important increase in the number of people qualified to appear before the courts, widening the availability of legal services to the public. Reform of the law relating to conditional fees agreements has also allowed innovative products to be developed which have increased the funding options available to individuals with winnable cases.
<P>

<a name="30224w05.html_para1">The Government remains keen to remove restrictive practices not in the public interest. The removal of such practices could provide an incentive for lawyers, or other providers, to introduce innovative, high quality and affordable services to the public. In most cases, open and competitive markets are the best way to ensure that consumers get the best possible service, while continuing to protect consumers and ensuring probity. The Government has consulted on matters that fall to it following on from the Office of Fair Trading's report on competition in professions. We are currently considering the responses to that consultation.

Under section 3 of the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 and the Ministerial and Other Salaries Order 1996 the Lord Chancellor's salary is set at &#163;2,500 more than the salary of the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales. In a recently published report the Senior Salaries Review Body (the SSRB) stated that it was proposing to review the relationship between judicial salaries and those of the Senior Civil Service. The Lord Chancellor has asked that this review be extended to cover the statutory relationship between his own salary and that of the Lord Chief Justice.<P>

The Department's Ministers do not have personal expense accounts. Costs incurred by Ministers, in the course of their official duties, are met by the Department. Occasionally, Ministers pay such costs themselves and are then reimbursed, rather than having them billed direct to the Department. Since 1 May 1997, the Lord Chancellor has paid, and been reimbursed for, the following amounts. These costs were incurred in furtherance of departmental objectives including, for example, the provision of hospitality to overseas judges.<P>

 Up to November 2002, over 129,000 photocards had been issued to New Deal participants, helping them reduce the cost of travelling to job interviews and getting to work in the early days of a new job.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2003]</i>: The 999 system is designed to put callers in touch with the emergency services locally. If an ambulance service receives a call that is outside their area then it is their responsibility to pass it on to the ambulance service in the appropriate area.
<P>

<a name="30224w07.html_para4">The London Ambulance Service (LAS) believes that it may cause unnecessary confusion if 999 callers are given details of the responsibility to pass on information to other ambulance services and that such an explanation of procedures could create delays in responding to emergency calls.
<P>

<a name="30224w07.html_para5">The LAS believes that an assurance that an ambulance is on its way is more important than knowing what its responsibilities are according to national control procedures.

2. Registration data for this year is not comparable with later years due to the change in the registration period.<P>

The number of patients that a GDS dentist sees is dependent on several factors including their amount of commitment to the GDS and the amount of treatment that their patients require.<P>

A patient becomes registered with a GDS dentist when that dentist accepts the patient for treatment. Registrations lapse if patients do not return to their dentists within 15 months of their last visit. The number of patients registered per dentist will exclude patients who have not been to their GDS dentist within the past 15 months.<P>

GDS dentists are required to provide a full range of National Health Service treatment to maintain the oral health of the patients that are registered with them for capitation (Children) or continuing care (adults).<P>

The 1997 registration numbers are not comparable to those for 2000 and 2002 because of the reduction in the registration period to 15 months. Previously the period for adult registrations was 24 months and children's registrations lasted until the end of the next calendar year.<P>

Registrations are included in the area of the dentist. The registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving their dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.<P>

Patients wishing to register with a GDS dentist for tratment can obtain details of dentists accepting new patients in their area by contacting NHS Direct.<P>

Patients do not need to be registered with a GDS dentist to get NHS dental treatment. The personal dental services and community dental services provide NHS dental treatment and some patients receive GDS dental treatment on an occasional basis.<P>

For adults that review would not normally be less than three years from fitting of their last aid, unless their hearing has become significantlyworse in the interim. A shorter review period applies to children's services.

<a name="30224w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Speech and language therapists have been recognised at a national level as a key work force priority for work force planning and development. Speech therapists have been targeted, along with other allied health professionals, for recruitment and retention. Work force development confederations have been made aware of the need to commission additional training places for this target group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to <i>(a)</i> train and <i>(b)</i> recruit more speech therapists.  [97183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 We are committed to increasing the numbers of speech and language therapists employed in the national health service. Between September 1997 and 2001, the number of speech and language therapists employed in the NHS has increased by over 800, or 17 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30224w12.html_para3">"Delivering the NHS Plan", published in April 2002, includes the latest forecasts for growth in the NHS Workforce. By 2008, we expect the NHS to have a net increase over the September 2001 staff census of at least 30,000 therapists and scientists, including speech therapists.
<P>

<a name="30224w12.html_para4">The "NHS Plan" stated that by 2004, there would be an extra 4,450 therapists, including speech therapists and other key health professionals being trained each year over 1999 levels. By 2001&#150;02 the number of students entering training each year to become a speech therapist had increased by 96, or 21 per cent., from 457 to 553. Latest figures suggest a further increase, to 601, in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="30224w12.html_para5">A range of recruitment, retention and returner initiatives are in place to facilitate the NHS meeting the challenging targets set out in the "NHS Plan" and "Delivering the NHS Plan". The Department is working very closely with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapy and has set up a working group to draw up a recruitment and retention strategy.

<P>

<a name="30224w13.html_para0">The United Kingdom abandoned its offensive chemical and biological weapons programmes in the 1950s. Subsequently we have played a leading role in the negotiations both of the BWC of 1975, for which we are a depositary government, and the CWC which entered into force in 1997. We are fully compliant with our obligations under both Conventions and continue to press for their full and effective implementation. To this end, both nationally and with our EU partners, we have conducted a series of demarches world-wide, with particular attention to regions of tension such as the Middle East.
<P>

<a name="30224w13.html_para1">The United Kingdom was instrumental in securing a successful outcome to the BWC Review Conference in November 2002, which saw agreement on a three year work programme of practical measures to deal with the BW threat. At the forthcoming CWC Review Conference (28 April-9 May 2003) the UK will be presenting a number of important technical and scientific papers. The strength of our political support and commitment to both Conventions, as well as the technical expertise we contribute, are second to none.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made Africa a priority for this Government. Our aims in Africa are peace and security; ending inequality and poverty; social justice and human rights; and improved political and economic governance.
<P>

<a name="30224w13.html_para3">Last year at Kananaskis, the Prime Minister announced that the UK development programme for Africa will increase to 1 billion a year by 2006. Our development programme addresses the range of challenges faced by Africa and supports African governments' own efforts to achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals in Africa. For example, our work on health includes supporting the development of health systems, improving access to essential medicines and working towards eradicating polio. In education we are working with African governments to realise their aspirations of education for all.
<P>

<a name="30224w13.html_para4">The UK recognises that peace and security is a prerequisite for Africa's development. In April 2001, we established the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, which brings together all relevant government ministries to identify ways to tackle violent conflict in Africa.
<P>

<a name="30224w13.html_para5">We continue to work with international financial institutions to ensure that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative achieves its aim of freeing eligible African countries from unsustainable debt. In addition, the UK goes further than required under HIPC and gives 100 per cent. debt relief to countries once they qualify. For the 22 African countries that have reached 'decision point' all repayments on their debts (worth over &#163;800 million) have ceased.
<P>

<a name="30224w13.html_para6">African commitment to progress is encapsulated in the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) where African governments have made commitments to improve political and economic governance, solve conflicts and to move forward development. The UK was one of the prime movers behind the formulation of the G8 Africa Action Plan launched at Kananaskis last year in support of NEPAD.

 The framework for relations between the EU and Kyrgyzstan is the EU-Kyrgyzstan Partnership and Co-operation Agreement (PCA). Officials from EU member states and Kyrgyzstan meet annually at a Co-operation Council and a Co-operation Committee in Brussels to discuss progress in relations. The Co-operation Committee last met in November 2002. In the course of developing the dialogue between the parties, the EU occasionally makes representations locally, most recently in late January. It also regularly makes statements at the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on bilateral issues and issues of concern. For example, the EU welcomed the recent consultative process of constitutional reform in Kyrgyzstan, but later expressed reservations about it.

 The remains of the past, whether above ground, underground or underwater are currently identified and protected by a framework of designation regimes. This includes the listing of buildings of special architectural and historic merit, the scheduling of ancient monuments and the designation of conservation areas and historic wreck sites. Separate systems also exist for the identification of historic parks, gardens and battlefields and for the inscription of World Heritage Sites.

 During the last five years nearly 200 sites in Cornwall have been designated as Scheduled Ancient Monuments, ranging from prehistoric burial mounds to 19th century mining remains associated with the tin industry.

<UL>(2) what assessment she has made of the likely additional cost on the voluntary sports club sector of being required to <i>(a)</i> obtain licences for club entertainment and <i>(b)</i> comply with the annual inspection fees as proposed in the Licensing Bill; [97403]
<P>
(3) what plans she has to assist voluntary sports clubs to meet with the costs imposed by the proposals within the Licensing Bill;  [97401]
<P>
(4) for what reasons she will require clubs to apply for licences for club entertainment under the proposed Licensing and Entertainment Bill; and how many clubs will be required to obtain such a licence.  [97404]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Voluntary or not for profit sports clubs do not enjoy any special status under current alcohol or entertainment licensing law. They may, however, operate as registered clubs under the Licensing Act 1964 and therefore enjoy a different status to those operating under justices' licences. Under the Licensing Bill the separate system for authorisations for qualifying clubs will continue through the new club premises certificate. The Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanies the Bill states that there are currently just over 22,000 registered clubs.
<P>

<a name="30224w15.html_para4">Registered clubs are not currently completely exempt from the need for permission to have live entertainment. They need a certificate of suitability from the local authority and a special hours certificate from the magistrates if they currently wish to provide entertainment for extended hours.

the licensing objectives: the prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; the prevention of public nuisance; and the protection of children from harm.
<P>

<a name="30224w15.html_para6">The Government estimate that under the provisions of the Licensing Bill an application for a club premises certificate would cost between &#163;100 and &#163;500 with an annual charge of between &#163;50 and &#163;150 to maintain a revenue stream and cover continuing inspection and enforcement. It will cost no more, in terms of time or money, to apply for a certificate permitting the sale of alcohol and the provision of regulated entertainment than it would to apply for one permitting the sale of alcohol only. The Licensing Bill will not, therefore, impose additional costs for clubs. No specific impact assessment was carried out on not for profit sports clubs. The Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanies the Bill estimates that voluntary associations and other non-profit making bodies would save around &#163;150 million over the first 10 years of operation.

It was funded by &#163;20 million from the Government and over &#163;5 million in cash contributions from the industry, and featured extensive television, radio and press advertising. In addition, BTA offices around the world continue to undertake a full range of marketing and promotional activities, including consumer, travel trade and press liaison work.

 No decision has been taken on military action and it is not possible to make accurate predictions of any impact on the tourism industry. Some overseas visitors might be more reluctant to travel, but more British people might choose to holiday in the UK. We are working closely with the British Tourist Authority and the tourism industry to share information and to ensure that clear and consistent messages are provided to our potential overseas visitors.

<a name="30224w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 During the inquiry into the implementation of the Navigation Bye Laws at Lake Windermere, Sport England along with the British Water Ski Federation considered the issue of the displacement of motorised water sports from the Lake. Sport England and the British Water Ski Federation continue to work together with those affected by the Byelaws to negotiate access to suitable areas of water for the continuation of these sports.

<a name="30224w16.html_para0">Neither the Government nor Sport England would seek to impose specific alternative venues on those affected by the Navigation Byelaws on Lake Windermere.

<P>
<a name="30224w16.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Public entertainment licensing law provides that the local authority may impose any terms, conditions or restrictions that they consider necessary to ensure the safety of people at the premises. A requirement for there to be first aid equipment on the premises and members of staff trained in its use is therefore common. The application of licence conditions does not in any way replace or reduce the underlying statutory duty of employers or self-employed persons to comply with the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and any associated regulations and codes of practice. Employers and self-employed persons are required to assess the risks to their workers and any others (e.g. members of the public) who may be affected by their business so as to identify what measures are needed to avoid or control the risks. Accordingly, the businesses would ideally need to provide first aid equipment on their premises, in working order, and at least one member of staff trained in its use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w16.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Our policy is to prevent joint ownership of a substantial share of the newspaper market and a substantial part of Channel 3, the only commercial public service broadcaster that currently has universal access to a mass audience. We believe this would represent an unacceptable concentration of influence.
<P>

<a name="30224w16.html_para1">The Communications Bill is therefore retaining restrictions on newspaper proprietors holding Channel 3 licences. The rules in the Bill are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No one controlling more than 20 per cent. of the national newspaper market may hold any licence for Channel 3;
<P>
<BR>
No one who runs a national newspaper with more than a 20 per cent. share of the total national market share may hold more than a 20 per cent. stake in any Channel 3 company;

Were the nature of the service to change, however, and its audience share increase under new ownership, it will be possible to alter the public service obligations of the Channel 5 licence, and to introduce a nominated news provider system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w16.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Communications Bill ensures that rules will be retained to safeguard democratic debate at national, regional and local level. In particular, there will be limits on the joint-ownership of newspapers and ITV. Newspapers are the most editorially influential mass medium, and television is people's most trusted source of information. Joint-ownership of a substantial share of the newspaper market and a substantial part of Channel 3, the only commercial public service broadcaster that currently has universal access to a mass audience, would represent an unacceptable concentration of influence. Therefore, no one owning a regional Channel 3 licence may own more than 20 per cent. of the local/regional newspaper market in the same region.
<P>

<a name="30224w16.html_para4">We believe that there are less grounds for concern about the cross-ownership of Channel 5 by a large newspaper group, as it has a relatively small audience, does not reach the whole UK population and has fewer public service commitments than ITV.

<P>

<a name="30224w16.html_para5">The existence of the BBC and Channel 4 will ensure that there are at least three separately controlled free-to-air public service TV broadcasters, in addition to the expanding range of digital channels.
<P>

<a name="30224w16.html_para6">There will also be a scheme to protect the range of voices that exist in the local media. Newspaper and television owners will be subject to local ownership rules that will ensure the existence of at least three local or regional commercial media voices (in TV, radio and newspapers) in most areas.

 Various assessments have been made of access to child care for women. Access to child care was fully explored in the Repeat Study of Parents' Demand for Childcare, focusing on working mothers and non-working mothers (including single mothers). Aspects of access to child care investigated included the role of child care, child care arrangements and difficulties with child care. The issue of access to child care for parents, including mothers was investigated in the 'Fifth Survey of Parents of Three and Four Year Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services'. The survey included the amount of information available to guide their choices, the quality of education provided by their main provider and the quality of nursery education and child care provided by local providers.

This Consultation Document presented a number of scenarios for packaging and delivering licences to establish and use stations and apparatus for wireless telegraphy in the 3.4 GHz and 10 GHz bands for the provision of Fixed Wireless Access services ("FWA") (referred to in this paper as "spectrum licences", "licences" or "FWA licences").

Final allocations have not yet been made for 2003&#150;04 or 2004&#150;05; as the Secretary of State has announced, the Department is conducting a major review of all its 



business support, including that for the construction sector. However, we expect the budget for construction next year to be close to that for this year.<P>

In addition to hosting and administering the meetings of the Strategic Forum for Construction during the development of its report, "Accelerating Change", the Department supported the Forum's work financially by funding the development, publication and launch of the report, the consultation process, which preceded it, and the dissemination of its conclusions. The Department's total expenditure in support of the Strategic Forum in 2002&#150;03 is expected to be approximately &#163;110,000.<P>

Following the launch of "Accelerating Change" on 12 September 2002, day to day responsibility for the administration of the Strategic Forum passed from the Department to the construction industry. Officials and I in the Department continue to work closely with the Forum, its members and its new chairman, Peter Rogers. We will continue to identify areas where financial support from Government will allow the Forum to meet its aim of implementing the "Accelerating Change" proposals.<P>

vapour form and the type of wet scrubbers used on coal-fired plant (eg flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) used for sulphur dioxide control) are not effective in removing this form of mercury from the flue gas. Of the remaining mercury, which is in an oxidised form, wet emissions scrubbers have been shown to be effective. In summary, it is estimated that about 50 per cent. of mercury produced is removed by wet scrubbers. There is no information on dry scrubbers although there is research being carried out on this.

 It is DTI policy to encourage all conformity assessment bodies to seek accreditation from the United Kingdom Accreditation Service wherever it is an option notwithstanding that accreditation is a voluntary and market driven activity.

 The national accreditation marks are the property of my Department and are covered by a Licensing Agreement which licences the United Kingdom Accreditation Service to use the marks and to sub-licence them to accredited organisations. The Licensing Agreement requires UKAS to register the marks with the Trade Marks Registry and gives UKAS the responsibility for encouraging that the use of the national accreditation marks is in accordance with the requirements set down in the conditions for the use of national accreditation marks by UKAS and UKAS accredited organisations. UKAS assessors as part of the accreditation process ensure that the accredited bodies comply with the conditions and in turn, ensure that where such bodies confer the right to use the marks to their own customers, that the customers also comply. The obligations under the Licensing Agreement are also the subject of a periodic third-party audit. My officials are in regular contact with UKAS over a number of issues including the monitoring of the use of the marks as part of the oversight responsibilities of my Department.

 The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is a private company and its core services are self-financed through the charging of fees to its direct customers. However, my Department has a three-year contract with UKAS to enable it to represent the United Kingdom in the international accreditation fora (European Co-operation for Accreditation, International Accreditation Forum and International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation) so that it can play a major influencing role in the development of accreditation internationally. In addition, since November 2000, my Department has supported a UKAS Accreditation Awareness Campaign to help raise awareness to business and to other parts of government of the benefits of using UKAS accredited services. This campaign meets our own policy objective of encouraging businesses to use accredited conformity assessment wherever it is an option. DTI support covers 50 per cent. of the cost of certain elements of the campaign and is agreed on an annual basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w20.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The byelaws deal with the particular circumstances applying on Lake Windermere. Government policy on recreation in national parks is set out in Circular 12/96, which enjoins national park authorities to promote the widest range of recreational opportunities while fully respecting the special qualities of the parks. The circular acknowledges that the intrusive nature of some recreational activities may unacceptably affect other people's enjoyment of these nationally important areas. No particular opportunities should be excluded from the parks as a matter of principle.
<P>

<a name="30224w20.html_para0">The byelaws are expected to cause fast power boating to cease on Lake Windermere, together with associated activities, of which waterskiing is the most popular. On the other hand more people may be attracted to engage in other water-based recreational pursuits when what has been seen as a fundamental problem of incompatibility between power boating and lower key activities has been solved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w20.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Wide consultation and a careful examination of the implications was undertaken. The Lake District National Park Authority consulted over 50 organisations representing recreational and business interests both locally and nationally, before advertising proposals locally. The authority then considered all representations in response to the advertisement before making the byelaws that will introduce a speed limit.
<P>

<a name="30224w20.html_para1">The implications of the byelaws were examined in detail in 1996 at a public local inquiry held by an independent inspector. The issues examined included potential job losses and loss of revenue. The inspector concluded that the strong need for the speed limit had to be balanced against the possibility of some limited economic disruption. He found the overall balance clearly in favour of confirmation of the byelaws. In February 2000, after further views had been invited, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions agreed with the inspector's conclusion. He observed that the tourist profile in the region might alter but that it was not clear whether this would result in a net economic loss or a gain.
<P>

<a name="30224w20.html_para2">The byelaws came into operation on 29 March 2000 and the Secretary of State has no role in their implementation. The five year lapse until the speed limit comes into effect in 2005 should allow businesses and people who engage in power boating and waterskiing to make alternative arrangements.

 The Government recognise the need to ensure that existing animal welfare legislation is effectively enforced to ensure compliance with the standards. Co-ordination of enforcement across the different enforcement agencies, such as the state veterinary service and local authorities is a priority task. We have for some time been investing resource to ensure development of closer working relationships between relevant bodies, through for example, regular liaison meetings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the health of the beekeeping industry in the UK.  [97543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Of the 44,000 beekeepers in the UK about 400 operate on a commercial basis. Since 1992, the greatest single challenge to beekeeping has been the need to control the parasitic mite, varroa, which was first detected in England in that year. With Government help, beekeepers generally have learned to apply good husbandry techniques to control this threat. The market for, and interest in, honey produced in the UK has received a boost as a result of the ban on imports of honey from China in early 2002.

<a name="30224w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In July 2001, the Department received from ADAS Consulting Ltd. an independent economic policy evaluation of our bee health programme.

They estimated the value of pollination of commercial crops

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessments she has made on the impact of changes in duty for biodiesel on British agriculture.  [97392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Biodiesel could offer an opportunity for diversification of agricultural activities and the development of new markets. Following the introduction of the reduction in duty by 20 pence per litre, compared to ultra-low sulphur diesel, in July 2002, we have yet to see biodiesel produced from British-grown oilseed rape. The duty cut is, however, already bringing forward production of biodiesel from used vegetable oil and over 60 forecourts in the UK are already retailing biodiesel. To develop biodiesel production from feedstocks from British agriculture, the return to farmers will need to be sufficient to compete with established food and animal feed markets which currently offer higher prices.

 Action to address the issue of dolphin and porpoise by-catch needs to be taken internationally, as fishing vessels from many countries are involved. We have been pressing for such action and have commissioned a programme of research and development to reinforce our arguments. Urgent action is needed in the pair trawl fishery for bass off South West England, in which the substantial bulk of vessels are from other member states. Our research programme identified a significant by-catch problem in this fishery and is now trialling a possible gear solution. This looks promising, and I am determined to achieve a solution by this or other means. The second urgent need is to deploy EU observers to identify and assess other problem fisheries. In recent weeks we have advanced the case for action by

 The Sea Mammal Research Unit have undertaken trials on the use of detectors as part of their work on behalf of this Department into dolphin and porpoise by catch. To date, this research has demonstrated that detectors may have a role in monitoring the behaviour of dolphin and porpoises around fishing gear but that acoustic deterrent devices (known as pingers) and other gear adjustments have greater potential to prevent bycatch.

The agency does not maintain central records of expenditure in the form requested and therefore the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However a table showing agency capital projects costing in excess of &#163;1 million on which grant has been claimed, has been placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her Department's policy on fly-tipping on forest land is <i>(a)</i> generally and <i>(b)</i> where it is owned by the City of London Corporation; what her policy is in cases where it is her opinion that (i) a local authority and (ii) the Environment Agency should make greater efforts to remove fly-tipped rubbish from forest land; and if she will make a statement.  [98163]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Fly tipping is the same offence no matter where it occurs and the Government do not have different policies on clearing fly tipped waste from different types of land. Powers are provided to both local authorities and the Environment Agency under Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to allow them to clear fly tipped waste and to recover the costs of doing so from either the perpetrators of the crime or the occupants of the land unless they can demonstrate that they did not knowingly allow or permit the fly tipping to take place.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para0">The circumstances in which (i) the local authority and (ii) the Environment Agency should clear the waste are set out in the fly tipping protocol which has been agreed between the Local Government Association and the agency. Under the protocol, local authorities deal with fly tipping of non-special waste, and the agency deals with fly tipping of special/ hazardous waste.

Emissions are calculated from aircraft movement data for the airport in 2000 and aircraft emission factors used in the 1998 Heathrow Inventory study. Aircraft emissions during complete take off and landing cycle up to1,000 m are allocated to the airport. Consequently a proportion of the emissions are emitted at some height and horizontal distance from the boundaries of the airport.<P>

 The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has signed a statement, under section 19(1)<i>(a)</i> of the Human Rights Act 1998, that in her view the provisions of the Hunting Bill are compatible with the Convention rights on the basis that she was satisfied no obstacles prevented her from so doing.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para3">It is the Government's view that the requirements of the Hunting Bill would, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights, amount to an interference with the use and enjoyment of property rather than a deprivation of property, and that accordingly no compensation should be payable for any economic losses that may be suffered as a consequence of the Bill by the persons concerned.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para4">There are numerous occasions where new legislation interferes with existing contractual rights without the individuals being compensated. In this respect the Government consider that persons entering contracts in connection with hunting with dogs have no legitimate expectation that any or all types of this activity would continue to be lawful. The contracting parties will have been aware for a considerable period of time of the intention of the Government to legislate on hunting with dogs, and the present Bill is the result of an extensive and well-publicised process of consultation over a long period.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para5">The detailed reasons for this view are set out in a memorandum submitted by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 31 January 2003 in response to a letter from the Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights to the Minister for Rural Affairs of 21 January 2003. The Committee indicated that, subject to this point, their provisional opinion was that the present Hunting Bill is compatible with the relevant human rights obligations.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para6">Representations on the Hunting Bill which relate to human rights issues have been couched in general terms and have included the suggestion that the continuation of traditional forms of hunting is or should be protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. There have also been references to the rights protected by the United Kingdom's international commitments under the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 1992, in particular Principle 22 which refers to the role indigenous people and their communities play in relation to environmental management and development. Other representations have argued that there is no right to be cruel.

<i>[holding answer 13 February 2003]:</i> Responsibility for the policy with respect to radioactivity in the environment rests with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para8">Under section 13 of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) the disposal of radioactive material requires authorization. The regulation of radioactive waste, under RSA 93, in England and Wales, is the responsibility of the Environment Agency and a system of "discharge authorizations" is used to control the nature and quantities of radioactive waste that may be discharged into the environment from any site. However, under the Radioactive Substances (Substances of Low Activity) Exemption Order 1986 solid radioactive waste that is substantially insoluble in water and that has activity of less than 0.4 Becquerel/gram is exempt from the controls under RSA 93, so-called "free release". As such waste is exempt from regulatory control, no centrally held records are kept of the quantities that have been released.

 The Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network (RIMNET) Phase 3 system is currently under development, as explained in my previous answer on 20 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 105W.
<P>

<a name="30224w23.html_para9">The specification for RIMNET 3 was based upon the proven functionality of the RIMNET Phase 2 system, which continues to meet maintenance contract targets in excess of 99 per cent. reliability. This is through in depth design features which provide the necessary levels of resilience, including backup facilities at a remote location. Remote in this sense, means far removed from the main facility, yet accessible to authorised users via modern electronic communications. Assessment of the effectiveness of the RIMNET 3 system will be undertaken during its development and the acceptance trials.

<a name="30224w24.html_para7">Government have provided extra funding to help authorities meet these standards through successive increases in the EPCS spending block, which includes waste services, and through the National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Challenge Fund under which West Sussex made a successful bid for a project to raise the awareness of waste issues. A separate Capital Fund of &#163;21.3 million was established for authorities across London.
<P>

<a name="30224w24.html_para8">West Sussex has also been successful in receiving approval for PFI funding for a recycling led waste project that aims to enable them to reach their target for 2005&#150;06 of 36 per cent. and achieve long term recycling and composting levels comparable with the highest in Europe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans the Government have to ban the trade in birds and animals taken from the wild except for scientific and conservation reasons.  [97124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have no current plans to ban the trade in all birds and animals taken from the wild. International trade in birds and animals is subject to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which is implemented within the EU under Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1808/1. All commercial trade in those species listed as endangered is prohibited, while the trade in the other less vulnerable species is strictly regulated to ensure that it will not be detrimental to their wild populations.
<P>

<a name="30224w25.html_para3">Last month we began a public consultation exercise outlining proposals to strengthen the existing domestic controls over wildlife trade. This included increasing the penalties for certain offences to up to five years imprisonment, and strengthening the relevant powers of police officers and wildlife inspectors. Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we intend to introduce revised provisions as soon as possible thereafter.
<P>

<a name="30224w25.html_para4">Within Great Britain the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the possession or control of any live or dead wild bird or animal listed on Schedule 5 of the Act, or any part of or anything derived from such a bird or animal. A licence can be issued derogating from this protection. The penalty for taking an animal or bird illegally is a maximum of &#163;5,000 and/or six months custodial sentence.

There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which would have the tendency to increase the number of offences counted. Numbers of offences before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.<P>

There was also a change in counting rules for detections on 1 April 1999. The new instructions provide more precise and rigorous criteria for recording a detection, with the underlying emphasis on the successful result of a police investigation. Numbers of detections before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.<P>

 GW Pharmaceuticals have completed their advanced clinical trials into the development of a medical preparation of a cannabis-based drug and are preparing to submit a dossier of their findings to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), an agency of the Department of Health, for evaluation in the near future.

<P>
<a name="30224w26.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Normally it will not be apparent from the information received by a card issuer that a transaction relates to illegal business. However, within the confines of banking law, where a card issuer is alerted to the fact that an offence has been committed by a cardholder, they will take appropriate action under the terms and conditions applying to the use of its card.
<P>

<a name="30224w26.html_para2">The Government do not at this time consider that removing all credit card, debit card, and other non card based forms of payment facilities from an individual convicted of such an offence is the most cost effective or practical way of combating illegal or child abuse images on line.

 Under European e-commerce legislation, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may not be held liable for unlawful material that they unknowingly transmit, store or host on behalf of their customers. There is also a requirement not to place general monitoring obligations on intermediary service providers, and as such there will be no legislative requirement for United Kingdom ISP's to undertake monitoring of their services for child pornography.
<P>

<a name="30224w26.html_para3">However, if an ISP is warned of illegal material on a website that they host but fails to take the appropriate action by removing or disabling access to the material in question, they will be liable for prosecution.
<P>

<a name="30224w26.html_para4">With regards to sites which host child pornography, the Government supports the work of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), an industry funded body which allows anyone to report the presence of images of child abuse anywhere in the world. The Foundation determines whether the reported website carries potentially illegal material and takes steps to have access denied to the site. The Foundation passes details of illegal material to the relevant law enforcement agencies to initiate action against the originators. If the originators are abroad, the Foundation passes the report to sister hotlines abroad and to the National Criminal Intelligence Services (NCIS) who liaise with enforcement agencies of the countries concerned.
<P>

<a name="30224w26.html_para5">The Government continues to seek to revise and improve the mechanisms and processes for the reporting and removing of illegal material hosted on the web, for example through the work of the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet.

<P>
<a name="30224w26.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 E-Groups enable a great many people to communicate with others with similar interests conveniently and if necessary privately. It is true that this facility, like any other, can be misused, but to require that all e-groups be open would merely displace, not end, the exchange of indecent images of children, and lessen the scope for perfectly legitimate use.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent reports he has received about the trend in respect of credit card fraud; what he estimates its most recent annual level in the UK was; which new forms of such fraud are giving the authorities most cause for concern; what proposals and advice he is planning to help tackle the problem; and if he will make a statement.  [97172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government recognises that plastic card fraud in the UK has increased considerably over recent years. In the Home Office publication, "Crime in England and Wales, 2001&#150;02: Supplementary Volume" published on 9 January 2003, it was shown that the police recorded 153,281 cheque and credit card offences in 2001&#150;02. The Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimated the losses from cheque, debit and credit or charge card fraud in the 12 months to August 2002 at &#163;429.4 million.
<P>

<a name="30224w27.html_para1">Skimming (electronically copying a card's magnetic stripe and using it to make an illegal copy of a genuine card) is a relatively new form of card fraud, which is 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 106W</I><P>
giving the financial services sector and police cause for concern. Counterfeit card losses comprise over a third of total plastic card fraud losses.
<P>

<a name="30224w27.html_para2">The Government has committed &#163;1.4 million over two years, in partnership with APACS, to piloting the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU). The Unit, which started work in April 2002, has enjoyed significant early success, recovering more than 3,000 cards and 468 cheques. This has led to 44 arrests and four convictions with potential savings of &#163;5.3 million. A detailed evaluation of the DCPCU's performance will be used to inform decisions on the future of the Unit and to guide national policy for tackling organised and plastic card fraud.
<P>

<a name="30224w27.html_para3">The Home Office is also actively supporting the finance and retail industry in its implementation of the Chip and PIN programme. New technology will require UK credit and debit card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a four-digit PIN (personal identification number) rather than by signing a receipt. The banking industry expects that by 2005 the new technology will have eliminated over half of the predicted level of plastic card fraud. A public trial of the programme will take place in Northampton shortly and national roll-out will begin after the trial is complete.
<P>

<a name="30224w27.html_para4">The Government, working closely with stakeholders, launched its Safe Internet Shopping Campaign in 2001 to advise consumers on safe payment and give them directions to the Government's Consumer Gateway www.consumer.gov.uk which provides links to sources of detailed information.
<P>

<a name="30224w27.html_para5">The Government welcomes the involvement of the banking industry in actively seeking ways to prevent and detect crime such as plastic card fraud.

<a name="30224w28.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answers of 28 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 757&#150;59W, what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the adequacy of closed circuit television provision in visits areas of prisons and <i>(b)</i> their success in obstructing smuggling of drugs into prisons by visitors.  [97995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 No specific research has been conducted by the Prison Service on the effectiveness of closed circuit television (CCTV). A CCTV good practice guide, drawing on the wider experience within the criminal justice system, has however been issued to prisons, against which individual establishments must review their procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answers of 28 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 757&#150;59W, what importance he attaches to each of the routes he has identified by which drugs enter prisons.  [97996]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Drug smuggling is by nature a covert activity. It is extremely difficult to quantify the frequency with which different routes are used. Routes vary depending on the nature of the individuals or prisons concerned. The Prison Service, however, believes that one of the most frequent routes is through social visits.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answers of 28 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 757&#150;59W, which measures to reduce the availability of drugs in prisons aim to disrupt attempts to smuggle drugs in by mail.  [97997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It would not be appropriate to disclose all the precise security measures in place to disrupt attempts to smuggle drugs. All social mail is opened and searched before being sent to the prisoner. X-ray machines and active drug dogs may be used in support of that process.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answers of 28 January 003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 757&#150;59W, by what means he will assess the effectiveness of measures to reduce the availability of drugs in prisons.  [97998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Random mandatory drug testing (MDT) provides the best available measure of the effectiveness of policies to reduce the availability of drugs in prisons. Since the introduction of MDT the figure has reduced from 24.4 per cent. in 1996&#150;97 to 11.6 per cent. in 2001&#150;02. A wide-ranging programme of research is also under way to assess the effectiveness of supply reduction measures.

<i> [holding answer 12 February 2003]</i>: The random mandatory drug testing (MDT) programme represents the best available measure of overall drug misuse in prisons in England and Wales. The percentage figure for prisoners who tested positive in 2001&#150;02 was 11.6 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners over the age of 65 are <i>(a)</i> serving life sentences and <i>(b)</i> have special medical needs; and if he will make a statement.  [97494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The number of prisoners serving life sentences over the age of 65 on 30 November 2002 was 121.

<a name="30224w28.html_para0">A study of 203 sentenced male prisoners aged 60 and over in 15 establishments in England and Wales (about one-fifth of that total population) conducted in 1999&#150;2000 reported that 85 per cent. had one or more major illnesses reported in their medical records and 83 per cent. reported at least one chronic illness or disability when interviewed. The most common illnesses were psychiatric, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and respiratory. All prisons and their local national health service partners have completed joint prison health needs assessments, leading to the implementation of improvements to healthcare provision based on individual prison health plans.

 The information requested is shown in the table. The term young offenders has been taken to refer to any prisoner aged under 21 years of age held in an establishment, whether or not they have been convicted of an offence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> fathers and <i>(b)</i> mothers are in prison who are aged (i) under 18, (ii) 18 to 21, (iii) 21 to 31, and (iv) 31 to 41.  [97268]<P>

<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There is no routinely collected data on the number and age of fathers and mothers in prison. However, a Home Office study of a large sample of imprisoned women and mothers, published in 1997, found that 60 per cent. of female prisoners, sentenced and unsentenced, had dependent children under the age of 18. Another smaller but more recent study of women prisoners and their work in custody, published in 2000, found broadly similar results (out of a sample of 567 sentenced women, 66 per cent. had dependent children under the age of 18).

<P>

<a name="30224w28.html_para2">Directly equivalent information for male prisoners is not available. However, the 1991 England and Wales prison survey showed that 32 per cent. of male prisoners had dependent children who had been living with them just before they were imprisoned; the corresponding figure for female prisoners was 47 per cent.

 The information requested is shown in the following table. The table shows the population and operational capacity of all establishments in England and Wales. Operational capacity is the total number of prisoners that an establishment can hold taking into account control, security and the proper operation of the planned regime.

 Prison Service establishments install stair lifts as operational needs dictate. Such installations are funded locally. This information is not therefore held centrally and could be collected at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many pregnant women are held in prisons in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> Wales.  [96851]<P>

<P>
<a name="30224w28.html_spnew13"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Statistics on the number of pregnant women held in prisons in England and Wales are not collected routinely. However, a one-off survey was conducted on 13 November 2002 and has recently been collated. At that time, there were 75 pregnant women held within the female prison estate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps the Government is taking to control the number of guns arriving in the UK from Eastern Europe and the Balkans.  [96903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government is aware of the risk of illegal weapons being imported from Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Law enforcement agencies are continuing to monitor the situation carefully and are already involved in efforts to reduce the flow of firearms to this country. Those firearms which are smuggled and intended for criminal use in the United Kingdom are often connected with smuggling of other commodities, including drugs and this is another angle that is currently being addressed.
<P>

<a name="30224w29.html_para0">A conference on organised crime in the Balkans was held in London last November at which the matter of firearms trafficking was discussed. The Government is currently considering follow-up actions relating to tighter border controls, increasing police capacity, encouraging intelligence-led policing and improving international co-operation, which will help restrict smuggling.

 This is an operational matter for individual Chief Officers of police, although we are not aware of any force that has included the Union Flag as part of standard vehicle livery. There are no restrictions under the general law on the display of the Union Flag on land in England and Wales other than those imposed by the provisions of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 and the Trade Marks Act 1994, which relate to the reproduction of flags in trade marks.

 One of the principal objectives of the Prison Service is to reduce crime by providing constructive regimes which address offending behaviour, improve educational and work skills and promote law abiding behaviour in custody and after release. The Prison Service increasingly draws upon "What Works" research to develop a more evidence based approach to tackling offending behaviour and the factors that contribute to re-offending. The What Works in Prison Strategy, launched last year, provides a clear direction for the further development of constructive regimes to reduce the risk of re-offending. The strategy encompasses accredited offending behaviour programmes, drug treatment programmes, increased education provision and a custody to work strategy to improve resettlement outcomes. The Prison and Probation Services have been set the challenging but achievable target of reducing the level of reconvictions by fiver per cent. by 2004 compared to the predicted rate.

From 2001&#150;02, budgets for prison education have been ring-fenced and allocated by the Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit, which reports to the Department for Education and the Home Office. The core budget rose from &#163;57 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;66 million in 2002&#150;03, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education (Charles Clarke) recently announced that it will rise to &#163;85 million 2003&#150;04, &#163;110 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;125 million in 2005&#150;06. Core funding buys teaching hours, induction and assessment sessions, Library services and education materials. While basic skills are a significant part of prisons' education provision, and each prison has basic skills targets, we cannot say exactly how much of overall education funding goes on basic skills.<P>

<a name="30224w29.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 One hundred and seventy-seven prisoners have participated in the Cognitive Self-Change programme since it was accredited in September 2000. Effectiveness is currently evaluated through reports on institutional behaviour, psychometric data, and risk assessments. Early provisional indications show reductions in hostility, aggression and impulsivity in prisoners undertaking the programme. Reconviction data will in due course also be used to evaluate effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="30224w29.html_para15">Since the inception of the Enhanced Thinking Skills (ETS) programme, 18,564 prisoners had participated up to 31 March 2002. This figures will increase by about 5,000 prisoners for 2002&#150;03, and over 6,000 prisoners in subsequent years due to additional funding to increase delivery.

Although the question specifically asks for the number of probation officers, the information on probation service officers has also been provided. There has been an increasing growth in the use of probation service officers to support the work undertaken by probation officers. In particular, the use of accredited programme has seen a number of low/medium risk offenders supervised as part of a group rather than on an individual basis as has occurred in the past. Probation service officers, who receive specific training to enable 



them to manage these programmes and supervise the offenders participating, run these accredited programmes.<P>

<a name="30224w31.html_para6">However, legislation is not the only way of dealing with this problem. Sex tourism is one part of a wider set of issues in which poor people&#151;particularly young women and children&#151;are vulnerable to the interests of the sex industry, national and international trafficking and associated illegal activities. It is an international problem which requires internationally coordinated action.

<P>

It should not be concluded from any of these results that young people in Yorkshire and Humberside are any more or less likely to have ever tried a Class A drug. In 1998 and 2000 particularly the regional result is based on a very small sample (57 and 58 16&#150;19 year olds respectively) which may not be representative of the population in this area.<P>

For the same reason, the apparent dramatic decline in the percentage of 16&#150;19 year olds having ever tried a Class A drug in the Yorkshire and Humberside region over the three surveys, should be treated with caution.<P>





<P>

"The Drug use, smoking and drinking among young people in England in 2001 "survey estimates that 6 per cent. of school children aged between 11 and 15 years olds have tried a class A drug. No geographical breakdown is available for this age group.<P>

 Information regarding the number of laptop computers used within the Ministry of Defence in any given year is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. The same applies to information regarding any items recorded as lost. With regard to the number of laptop computers suspected of being stolen, reported cases are recorded centrally on a summary basis only. Those records relate to items suspected of being stolen and so it cannot be assumed that theft actually applies in every case. Information regarding stolen laptop computers is only readily available from 1997&#150;98 and is here related to cases where the value of suspected loss exceeds &#163;1,000.

None of the instances of hacking had any operational impact, and despite widespread and frequent probes of Ministry of Defence firewalls connected to the Internet, there is no evidence of any successful incursion from an external source to any Departmental computer system.<P>

In the case of computer fraud, all instances are cases where MOD computers have been used in support of fraudulent activities, rather than fraudulent use of a computer&#151;based system.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w33.html_wqn6"><B> Margaret Moran: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to <i>(a)</i> increase awareness of domestic violence and <i>(b)</i> provide services and support for the victims of domestic violence within the families of members of the military services.  [97746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w33.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Domestic violence is a significant social issue and we recognise the need to ensure that it is dealt with effectively within the Armed Forces' community. Domestic violence by Service personnel is not tolerated under any circumstances, not least because of the detrimental impact that such incidents can have on morale, discipline and operational efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30224w33.html_para5">A tri-Service policy on domestic violence was issued in February 2002. The policy, which has now been implemented by the Services, sets out the roles and responsibilities of the chain of command and the welfare agencies in detecting and dealing with incidents of domestic violence and in providing confidential advice and support. The Services are proactive in increasing awareness about domestic violence to those in command and in publicising (via leaflets, posters and 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 135W</I><P>
web sites) the services available to possible victims. There are many agencies, both military and civilian, that exist to provide support to victims. The confidential support lines that are operated by the three Services are able to signpost callers to these support agencies. In cases where immediate or imminent harm is suspected the incident is reported to the most readily available police force; primacy rests with the local Home Department Police Force in United Kingdom whereas cases arising overseas are dealt with by the Service police.

<P>

<a name="30224w34.html_para0">Coalition aircrew only ever respond in self-defence against military targets. When attacks by Iraqi air defences force coalition aircraft to respond in this way we go to great lengths to ensure that the risk of civilian casualties is minimised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w34.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The transport of military casualties from theatres to the United Kingdom is a well planned and practised procedure. In the event of hostilities in Iraq, military casualties will be taken from Kuwait City International Airport to Cyprus in a military VC10 with a flight time of four hours.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w34.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the LOA and LSSA as it applies to personnel serving on Operation Telic.  [96940]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w34.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Local Overseas Allowance (LOA) is not part of the military salary or a reward for overseas service, but a cost of living addition paid only in circumstances where personnel are likely to incur greater day-to-day expenditure overseas than they would in the United Kingdom. This is not generally the case for those deployed on operations.
<P>

<a name="30224w34.html_para2">Those personnel who are temporarily deployed away from their permanent, LOA earning, duty station, and no longer incurring the full range of additional costs associated with that station, still have on-going financial commitments overseas, and many have families who remain at the permanent duty station. Consequently, all Service personnel continue to receive the full LOA rate for the first 17 days of their deployment. Additionally, married accompanied personnel continue to receive 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 139W</I><P>
their full LOA rate unless their accompanying spouse also leaves the permanent duty station for more than 17 days, at which point an abatement of approximately 35 per cent. is applied. Single or married unaccompanied personnel lose 20 per cent. of their full LOA rate after the first 17 days.
<P>

<a name="30224w34.html_para3">Personnel on Operation Telic who meet the eligibility criteria will receive Longer Separated Service Allowance (LSSA) or (for those serving in seagoing units) Longer Service at Sea Bonus (LSSB). These allowances compensate personnel, regardless of marital status, for the effects of separation from home life. They are paid at three rates dependent upon periods of accumulated separation. LSSA is paid for unbroken periods of separation of 10 days or more, while LSSB is paid continuously while in qualifying units. Bonuses are available for those who experience very high levels of accumulated separation and these will be increased to &#163;1,250. In order to reduce the incidence of junior personnel experiencing more than one operational tour without compensation for separation, MOD will reduce the initial qualifying period for LSSA from 18 months' service to 12 months. We are also about to increase the higher rate of LSSB and to reduce the qualifying criteria for LSSB bonuses.
<P>

<a name="30224w34.html_para4">The decision to enhance these separation allowances reflects the Ministry of Defence's wish to target those on operations, particularly our most junior personnel. In view of the current operational deployment, it has been decided to introduce the changes with effect from 1 March 2003, following a recommendation by the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body.

 It is Ministry of Defence policy that all treatments and vaccinations given to armed forces personnel are to be recorded on their personal medical records.

The information is transferred to their personal medical records on return to their home base. In addition, electronic medical record systems are used in theatre where practicable. Although the MOD continues to examine the possible use of "smart card" technology to store medical and other personal information, as yet there are no systems available that fully meet the requirements of the armed forces.

<a name="30224w35.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hoban: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the cost is of printing and collating his Department's White Paper on 14&#150;19 year olds "Opportunity and Excellence"; what that cost would have been if it had been produced as a single document; and what the cost was of printing "The Future of Higher Education".  [95134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w35.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> The recently produced policy document 14&#150;19: opportunity and excellence was not classified as a White Paper. It was published in two parts, a main document and separate annexes, in order to make the document accessible to the wide range of audiences with an interest in 14&#150;19 education and training. This allows the wider audience, such as parents and employers, with a more general interest in 14&#150;19 reform, to order only the smaller main document, while practitioners, for example, can order the detailed annexes in addition. To reflect anticipated demand, we were able to print fewer copies of the annexes.
<P>

<a name="30224w35.html_para0">The main document and annexes were printed at a cost of &#163;36,100. Summary versions and young people's versions were also printed, tailored in style andpresentation to different target audiences, and folders to allow collation of the different versions as required. The cost of producing these elements was &#163;29,400, and collation costs were around &#163;2,200.
<P>

<a name="30224w35.html_para1">It is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of producing a single document to the same timescales as the two volumes produced. It is likely that the cost would have been less than those incurred producing two documents, but this is offset against accessibility considerations and the lower quantity of annexes produced. Printing a larger 120 page document also requires different, more expensive, binding techniques. Collation costs would also have been incurred as different combinations of main document, summary and young people's version would have had to be collated fordistribution.
<P>

<a name="30224w35.html_para2">The cost of printing the main and summary versions of "The Future of Higher Education" was &#163;67,625.

<a name="30224w35.html_para3">There will be no further expansion of a centrally funded Beacon school programme for primary, nursery and special schools. This is in line with the general wish of head teachers to reduce the proportion of funding delivered through ring-fenced grants and to devolve more funding decisions to local communities. Schools and LEAs will be able to broker and fund collaborative partnerships from within the substantial overall increase in resources provided as a result of the 2002 Spending Review. We are encouraging LEAs to fund this activity. My Department intends to explore arrangements for endorsing local programmes through a Beacon recognition scheme.

<a name="30224w36.html_para0">This research finds that most students choose their course because they are interested in the subject. The expected employment prospects associated with the course is also an important consideration to many students. The mode of delivery and timetabling of the course influences many mature students' choice.

<a name="30224w36.html_para1">The most important reason for choosing an institution is that it offers the right subject. The location of the institution is also important, often for financial reasons.

<a name="30224w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Local education authorities' funding formulae for maintained schools normally include a factor which allocates funding according to social deprivation. From 2003, the rules relating to this are being amended to ensure that such a factor always exists. The amount to be distributed is for local decision, but we are encouraging each authority to discuss this issue with its schools forum, with a view to aligning the amounts received by the LEA on the basis of social deprivation with the amounts distributed, and in ways which accurately reflect schools' needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what initiatives are being undertaken by his Department to develop links between higher education colleges and commerce; and if he will make a statement.  [96660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w37.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In order to improve our economic competitiveness, we need to create effective and sustained links between higher education institutions and business. The task for Government is to provide the framework for this to happen and for universities and higher education colleges, businesses and individuals to develop these opportunities. As set out in the recent White Paper, 'The future of higher education' the Government are taking a number of steps to build constructive links between higher education institutions and business.
<P>

<a name="30224w37.html_para0">The effective transfer of knowledge and skills is key to our future success. Through recent initiatives we have already helped institutions to improve knowledge transfer, and this has been shown in indicators such as the number of spin-off companies created, the number of patents filed and the proportion of universities employing specialised staff to support commercial work. We announced in "Investing in Innovation", the Government's strategy for science, engineering and technology, published in July 2002 that the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) would draw together support for reach out from HE to business and become a permanent third stream of funding worth &#163;90 million a year in 2005&#150;06. As announced in 'the future of higher education' we are providing additional HEIF funding to establish a network of up to 20 Knowledge Exchanges. These will exemplify collaboration with employers, be focused on serving the local and regional economy and form part of a wider network with the New Technology Institutes that will help local companies to use advanced technology.
<P>

<a name="30224w37.html_para1">The Foundation Degree which was introduced in 2001 gave employers a greater role in shaping vocational courses to meet their need for associate professional skills. A major expansion of this work focused degree announced in the HE strategy will further encourage partnership arrangements between employers and higher education institutions in course design, development and implementation. The emergence of new Sector Skills Councils will enable stronger alliances to develop between business in their sectors and the relevant departments in higher education institutions both to develop and market courses and involve employers in the delivery of learning.




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 151W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30224w37.html_para2">However, we also need to ensure that all graduates have the skills to equip them to work in a fast changing work environment. We will continue to sponsor work already under way by HEFCE to integrate the skills and attributes which employers need, into higher education courses.
<P>

<a name="30224w37.html_para3">The Government have commissioned Richard Lambert to carry out an independent review of how, over the coming decade, business can better draw on universities to the mutual advantage of both sectors. We look forward to the findings of the review later this year.

 The information is not available directly in the requested format so has been estimated from available data. Annual earnings are estimated using gross weekly earnings from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). Estimating annual from weekly earnings is not ideal but the LFS allows us to provide the best available estimate of annual earnings by qualification. The derived distribution of annual earnings should therefore be treated with caution. The table shows the distribution of estimated annual earnings for all individuals whose highest qualification is a first-degree.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2003]:</i> Our long-term vision for strengthening universities and increasing access to higher education was recently announced in our White Paper, "The Future of Higher Education".
<P>

These figures are taken from the table on page 19 of the White Paper, "The Future of Higher Education" (Cm 5735), and include estimates of funding from the Office of Science and Technology.<P>

The amount of cash that the Department will require to support this resource expenditure is set on a year-by-year basis. The main differences between the resource-based figures above and the in-year cash requirement will relate to the cost of capital and depreciation charges on the administrative capital of the Student Loans Company and the Higher Education Funding Council for England, and to the treatment of student loans. Under resource accounting and budgeting, the costs of issuing such loans takes account of the economic value of all future loan repayments, whereas the cash total will be the payments issued in year (which in 2002&#150;03 amounted to just over &#163;2 billion) without any reflection of the repayments to be received in the future.<P>

The table on page 19 of the White Paper 'The Future of Higher Education' shows the total expenditure on higher education in England. The total publicly planned funding shown in the grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is the expenditure that is paid by the HEFCE to higher education institutions in England and the estimated fee income for home and EU students that those institutions will receive from public and private sources. The main differences between the two totals relate to student support expenditure; funding for research and knowledge transfer from the Office of Science and Technology, estimates of which are included in the totals in the White Paper; and the private contributions towards the costs of tuition which are included in the publicly planned funding total but not in the expenditure table in the White Paper.

Youth Cohort Survey&#151;cohort 9 2000<P>

Attainment at A-level is affected by people's aspirations. Aspirations are often formed at a young age and are shaped by a range of cultural, social, institutional and education influences.<P>

In 2001 the Department published "Social Class and Higher Education: Issues Affecting Participation by Lower Social Class groups" by Connor, H. and Dewson, S. with Tyers, C. Eccles, J. Regan, J. and Aston, J. (DfEE Research Report No. 246). This found that for a small sample of qualified non-entrants from lower social classes the main reasons for not entering HE were:<P>

they wanted to get a job and earn some money;<P>

cost issues;<P>

they wanted to take a break from studying; and<P>

uncertainties about their ability or commitment to complete a degree course.<P>

In 2002 the Department published "Potential mature student recruitment to HE" by Ross, A. Archer, L. Hutchings, M. Gilchrist, and R. Thomson, D. with John, C. and Akantziliotou, K. (DfES Research Report 385). This found that, among a sample of 16&#150;30 year olds from lower middle and working class backgrounds the propensity to enter HE depends upon qualifications, but is independent of their social class.<P>

Both of the above reports are held on the Department's research publications website, www.dfes.gov.uk/research.<P>

It is important to note that people without A-levels or other formal qualifications may be appropriately qualified to enter higher education on the basis of other experience and abilities that they demonstrate.<P>

<a name="30224w40.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. The Government allocates funding for higher education in England to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The HEFCE provide teaching grants on the basis that similar courses are funded at similar rates irrespective of the institution providing the education. The detailed allocations are calculated according to the numbers and types of students in the institutions, and the courses they are taking. Different courses are weighted at different levels to reflect, for example, the higher costs of providing laboratory-based and medical courses. There are also adjustments made to the calculations to reflect London weighting, the additional costs of teaching students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature and part-time students. Average funding per student in institutions will therefore reflect these weightings and adjustments.
<P>

<a name="30224w40.html_para0">Funding for post-graduate research students is also provided through the HEFCE's research funding allocation. The Council allocate funding for research selectively to institutions according to their relative strength in research as measured through the periodic Research Assessment Exercise. The amount of research funding therefore varies widely between institutions.
<P>

<a name="30224w40.html_para1">Institutions receive their teaching and research funding as a block grant and are able to decide how it should be spent.

 The Secretary of State has made no assessment of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, which is not designated to receive funding directly from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. However, the Institute is exploring whether it can be so designated. To this end the Funding Council and the Quality Assurance Agency are working with the Institute to assess its progress towards meeting the criteria for direct funding.

 The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) published an evaluation report in April 2002 on the quality and impact of the work of teaching assistants in primary schools. The report reinforced the Government's view that well-trained and well-managed teaching assistants have the potential to help schools raise standards by showing that the quality of teaching in lessons with teaching assistants is better than in lessons without them.

<P>
<a name="30224w41.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 When we were developing the new LEA funding formula, we looked at whether we should introduce a targeted grant for LEAs with high mobility. However, we found that the problem was surprisingly widespread and it did not therefore seem sensible to introduce a targeted grant which would give a little funding to many authorities. We intend to look further at the question of pupil mobility in the light of data from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census, with the aim of considering the possible introduction of a relevant factor when the formula freeze on Education Formula Spending ends in 2006&#150;07.

Over the past four years the Secretary of State has approved 118 applications to dispose, or change the use, of an area of school playing field larger than a sports pitch (i.e. 2,000 m <sup>2</sup> ). Of these, 48 were in respect of closed or closing schools and, of the remainder, 45 helped fund improved sports facilities at schools.

 School inspectors are required to consider whether the school monitors health and safety and are expected to report on any hazards that they encounter. They are not, however, health and safety inspectors and do not audit possible health hazards such as the presence of asbestos. The responsibility rests with the head and governing body, and (for community and voluntary controlled schools) the local education authority. While it is impracticable for school inspectors to conduct rigorous health and safety inspections, they are required in every inspection to make a judgment about the extent to which pupils work in a healthy and safe environment.

<a name="30224w43.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Early retirement continues to be available to teachers over the age of 50 where their employment has been terminated by their employer and their employer has agreed to meet the associated additional pension costs. In addition, teachers over the age of 55 are able to retire voluntarily with pension benefits that have been actuarially reduced to take account of their early payment. In 2001&#150;02, for example, some 3,500 teachers retired early through these routes.

<i> [holding answer 10 February 2003]</i>: The Cruickshank report on Competition in UK Banking (published in March 2000) examined, among other things, issues relating to payment systems&#151;including the cost of bank charges to retailers for credit and debit card transactions. The Government has not made any recent estimates of such charges. However, it is closely monitoring developments in payment systems and remains committed to introducing legislation to give the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) new powers to promote effective competition in payment systems&#151;and will do so as soon as parliamentary time allows.
<P>

<a name="30224w44.html_para5">To promote its understanding of how payment systems operate, and to help pave the way for its prospective powers, the OFT announced on 27 November that it would conduct an empirical study into recent payment system developments. The terms of reference of this study were published on 31 January 2003&#151;and include issues related to pricing in the credit and debit card markets. The OFT has undertaken to publish a report outlining its assessment and conclusions in spring 2003.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what discussions officials from his Department have had with representatives of <i>(a)</i> the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, <i>(b)</i> the European Federation of Accountants and Auditors and <i>(c)</i> the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales concerning proposals for quarterly corporate reporting;  [96396]

 Treasury officials have raised the issue of quarterly reporting with European Commission officials in the context of a draft proposal for a directive on the transparency obligations of companies with securities traded on regulated markets in the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30224w45.html_para0">Treasury officials have informally consulted a wide range of representatives of the business community on this draft proposal for a directive, and will continue to do so. These discussions have not involved the three organisations to which the question refers, although it is intended that consultation will be broadened to include, for example, representatives of the accountancy and auditing professions.

<P>

<a name="30224w45.html_para1"><i>(a)</i> It is anticipated that regulations to be laid by the Home Office later this year under the RIPA 2000 will give the Inland Revenue access to some communications data covered by the Act. Thereafter, it is expected that any access to communications data from communications service providers will be through the powers specified. The Inland Revenue have more general powers to require the production of information under the Taxes Management Act 1970.
<P>

<a name="30224w45.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> It would be normal for HM Customs and Excise to use the provisions specified in the RIPA 2000 to access communications data in all cases whenever and wherever appropriate. However, in certain cases, normally arrest situations, they will use other primary legislation&#151;PCEA, DTA and VAT Act&#151;to access stored data such as voice mail but this would only be in a very small number of cases and in accordance with Section 1 (5)(c) of the RIPA Part 1, Chapter 1.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to allow parents to claim under working families tax credit for extra costs to child care when the extra costs run for less than four consecutive weeks.  [95864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w46.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The child care tax credit within the working families tax credit provides support to families for the costs of registered or approved child care. Once an award of working families tax credit is made, it cannot be adjusted to reflect changes in the claimant's child care costs. However, from April 2003, working families tax credit is replaced by the new child tax credit and working tax credit. The working tax credit includes a child care element which provides more flexible support for the costs of child care. In particular, the child care element of working tax credit can be adjusted to reflect significant changes in average weekly child care costs.
<P>

<a name="30224w46.html_para10">In response to concerns raised with me by parents paying child care costs weekly, who may have short increases in child care costs during the school holidays, we will shortly bring forward regulations making a minor change to the system to allow parents to take account of changes in costs lasting less than four weeks. This will allow parents with fluctuating child care costs to have their tax credit based on their average child care costs, including any short-term fluctuations. It is our intention to produce this addition to the rules in good time for the start of the new tax credits system in April 2003. The Inland Revenue will issue clear guidance for parents and child care providers on how the system will work from April 2003.

<P>
<P>

 The Green Paper takes a comprehensive look at the issue of women, work and pensions.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para0">It recognises that it is often harder for women to build up state and private pensions rights than it is for men. This is because of a combination of factors including shorter working lives, lower pay and lower occupational pensions coverage among part-time workers. The Green Paper also recognises that the current generation of female pensioners are over represented in those groups of pensioners with low incomes.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para1">We have already taken action to address these issues.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para2">The introduction of the State Second Pension, from April 2002 provides extra help to those on low or moderate earnings, to certain carers and to certain people with long-term illness and disability.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para3">The Government have enabled some low paid workers to get national insurance benefits without paying contributions. From April 2000, the start point of national insurance contributions was separated from the lower earnings limit (LEL) for employees and aligned with the personal allowance for income tax. From April 2002&#150;03, national insurance contributions 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 186W</I><P>
only become payable on earnings from &#163;89 a week whereas entitlement to national insurance benefits start accruing at &#163;75 a week. This has benefited around half a million women.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para4">The Government have also already taken action to support the labour market position of women through, for example, the introduction of the national minimum wage and additional investment in child care.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para5">And many current female pensioners should benefit from the introduction of the pension credit in October 2003.

 In August 2002, there were approximately 7,900 customers receiving the minimum income guarantee in the London Borough of Southwark and approximately 3,200 receiving attendance allowance.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para12">The information regarding the average take-up rate of minimum income guarantee for 1999&#150;2000, the latest financial year for which estimates are available, can be found in the DWP publication, "Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 1999&#150;2000". A copy is placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para13">The next edition of the report containing estimates for 2000&#150;01 will be released on 27 March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para14">Our fundamental priority is to put money in the pockets of pensioners who need it. The MIG take up campaign has put an average &#163;20 a week extra in the pockets of 144,000 elderly people who would not have received it otherwise. These people would have lost out so the campaign undoubtedly achieved value for money.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para15">Because the MIG is more generous and the limits on capital have been increased, there has been a natural increase in the number of people who could claim. Our overall policy is, and will continue to be, that we will get as many eligible pensioners as possible to claim their entitlement to the MIG.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para16">Pension credit will be introduced in October 2003 and we have developed a strategy to ensure maximum take-up.

<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para19">Third, we will write to all pensioners not already receiving MIG over the take-on period (through to October 2004) to help them consider any entitlement to pension credit and encourage those likely to be eligible to apply; and

<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para22">The DWP set up the Partnerships against Poverty Forum for England and Wales as a working group in 2001 with the Local Government Association and voluntary organisations to develop joint working to improve take-up of minimum income guarantee.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para23">The group has, on a national basis, identified and developed a number of initiatives to improve access to entitlements and for the take-up of MIG by older people. The group has been instrumental in helping to develop products such as the shorter minimum income guarantee (MIG) claim form, the new MIG leaflet and the "At a Glance" and "Good Practice Guides", which all support the take-up of benefit entitlements. It also regularly reviews new and revised leaflets and has provided invaluable feedback into the training packages developed by The Pension Service local service.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para24">The Partnership Against Poverty members quickly recognised that the issues that adversely impact the take-up of entitlements by black and minority ethnic (BME) elders needed to be addressed separately. To support this, a sub-group was established.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para25">One of the first tasks of the group was to commission research into the barriers to look specifically at the problems faced by black and minority ethnic elder communities. The research will be qualitative and based around seven case studies looking at different groups. One of these is looking at the black African communities in Southwark.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para26">Take-up is encouraged through local services via their drop-in surgeries in Southwark. These take place frequently in partnership with local groups and organisations. These are Peckham One Stop, Black Elderly Group of Southwark, South Asian Elderly Organisation, Blackfriars Settlement and at the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para27">In terms of attendance allowance, it is not possible to be precise about the number of pensioners who might be entitled if they claimed it. This is because entitlement to AA is determined on the customer's specific circumstances, which can only be determined after a claim has been made. Up-to-date estimates of the take up of AA and disability living allowance are not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30224w47.html_para28">Sutton Disability Benefits Centre undertakes a number of targeted local activities to promote awareness of AA in the area it serves, which includes the London Borough of Southwark. This includes training and awareness sessions for Pension Service staff and external organisations.

<P>
<a name="30224w48.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 [<i>holding answer 13 February 2003]:</i> The levels of all benefits and their components are reviewed annually. Contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits are uprated by the Retail Prices Index to meet the statutory requirement to increase them in relation to the general level of prices. Income-related benefits are uprated by the Rossi index which is based on the Retail Prices Index less housing costs. This index most clearly reflects the cost of living increases for recipients of income-related benefits since housing costs are separately provided for, for example by Housing Benefit for rent. Uprating benefits in line with prices maintains their value in real terms.

 An increase of &#163;100 a year in the average level of council tax would result in an estimated annual increase of up to &#163;600 million in council tax benefit expenditure.

<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 193W</I><P>
framework of common objectives on pensions covering adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation agreed during the Swedish Presidency of the EU.
<P>

<a name="30224w48.html_para6">As part of this process the European Commission published a draft joint report on adequate and sustainable pensions in December 2002 based on national contributions.The draft report recognises that Member States have pension systems that have developed in very different ways and do not conform to one single model of provision. A major theme in the draft report is the need for urgent reform in many public pension systems to ensure they are financially sustainable in the future. This concurs with the UK's position that financial sustainability is a prerequisite for the adequacy of public pension provision. The UK public pension system is one of those found to be financially sustainable in the long term.
<P>

<a name="30224w48.html_para7">The draft report concludes that the major challenge for the UK system is ensuring that there is increased access to occupational and personal pension provision and people are encouraged to save enough to meet their expectations in retirement. These same issues are addressed by the proposals set out in the Green Paper published in December 2002 on which we are currently consulting.

<a name="30224w49.html_para6">There are some important points to note with regard to the data in the table:
<P>

<a name="30224w49.html_para7">'Open' schemes are those that had a registerable date on to the Pensions Scheme Registry during the year in question, and were also recorded as being open on 10 February 2003. This does not represent the total number of schemes that were open in the year in question. Figures in the table refer to the 'flow' of new open schemes in each particular year, rather than the 'stock' of all open schemes. Because of the way scheme-status changes are recorded on the Registry, it is not possible to identify the stock of all those schemes that were open at a particular point in time prior to the current date. Furthermore, scheme trustees have 12 months to notify OPRA of any change to the status of an open scheme, and so some schemes currently included in the table as open may since have changed status.
<P>

<a name="30224w49.html_para8">'Closed' schemes are those that have become closed to new members during the year in question and remain closed as at 10 February 2003. Existing members in these schemes can continue to accrue additional pension rights. 'Frozen' schemes are those that have become closed to new accruals during the year in question and remain frozen as at 10 February 2003. The dates used for closed and frozen scheme figures relate to the effective 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 197W</I><P>
date of change as notified by schemes and recorded by the Registry. In some cases, schemes do not supply an effective date and where this has occurred the date of inputting the change onto the Registry database has been used.
<P>

<a name="30224w49.html_para9">Data for closed and frozen schemes refer only to the number becoming closed or frozen in the year in question, and do not represent the stock of the total number of schemes that were closed (previously closed plus newly closed in that year).
<P>

<a name="30224w49.html_para10">The table updates previous information used to answer earlier PQs. As referred to above, the Registry system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status and the effective date of the change. Because of the way the data are held a later change will overwrite an earlier change, so data for earlier years become increasingly inaccurate. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there could be a lag between the closure or freeze of a scheme and trustees informing the Registry that the scheme has actually closed or frozen. The table reflects the most up to date data available.
<P>

<a name="30224w49.html_para11">Scheme members are those individuals that have accrued pension benefits and do not include those receiving pensions in payment. An individual may have pension benefits accrued in, and therefore may be a member of, more than one scheme.
<P>

Contributions to private pension schemes have been calculated using the methodology outlined in the letter from the National Statistician to the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) on 29 October 2002, PQ 77826, <i>Official Report</i>, column 689W.<P>

The estimates are consistent with those published in both Annexe B table 1 of the Review of Pension Contributions Statistics and the ONS Blue Book for 2002. The Review of Pension Contribution Statistics suggested that until the full implementation of the recommendations of the review, these are the best estimates for pension contributions statistics.<P>

<P>
<a name="30224w50.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 As the Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' (CM 5677) states that the decisions over how much pension an individual should have depends on their individual preferences and circumstances. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the Government to seek to stipulate the level of income that any particular person will need in retirement, and consequently the additional saving any one individual should make.
<P>

<a name="30224w50.html_para2">We are committed, however, to actively encouraging people to consider their pension saving options early so that they have as clear a view as possible of their own pension funding needs. The Green Paper, sets out the Government's proposals to work with employers and the financial services industry to provide:

<P>

<a name="30224w50.html_para4">We are already running a pension education publicity campaign to make people aware of the importance of saving for retirement. The campaign is supported by a range of guides that provides information on pensions options. The current phase of activity started on 8 February 2003. In time, we plan to move the campaign forward from awareness so that it is more focused on taking action.
<P>

<a name="30224w50.html_para5">In addition, we have already introduced measures to inform individuals of the level of pension they can expect when they save in a personal pension. New regulations that come into force in April require money purchase pension schemes (occupational, personal and stakeholder) to give members an annual illustration of what their pension might be when they require. This will give them important information about how theirpension plan is progressing.
<P>

<a name="30224w50.html_para6">The Green Paper, therefore, sets out proposals for building on work that has already been done, as well as identifying new initiatives, in order to provide a coherent education and information effort. This will enable individuals to make choices as to the level of funding for their personal pensions.

In these cases a second card with a separate PIN will be issued for use by the person nominated by the customer. The Post Office card account is not the only option available. Some housebound pensioners may find that a bank account, which may offer services such as phone or Internet banking, may be better to meet their personal needs.

 The Government has already begun to address the social and economic consequences of demographic change in its role as employer. One of the recommendations of Winning the Generation Game was that public sector employers should review their retirement ages and examine the case for allowing those who want to work on to age 65 to do so. Already 75 per cent. of civil servants now have the option to retire at 65 and the numbers able to serve beyond 60 are expected to increase.

<a name="30224w51.html_para2">Most public service pension schemes, however, still allow a normal pension to be taken at 60 or under. The Government is seeking views on the proposal that the rules of public service pension schemes should be changed and applied to all new members during the next few years to make an unreduced pension payable from age 65 rather than 60. Such a change would reflect improved longevity, modern working patterns and the practice in the majority of private sector pension schemes.

 It has been a long-standing principle of the benefits system that it should not provide more than one benefit to cover the same contingency. While income from a War Pension is often disregarded for benefit purposes, there are certain circumstances where the award or cessation of a War Pension or supplementary allowance will necessitate an adjustment to the amount of benefit in payment.
<P>

<a name="30224w51.html_para3">We have measures in place to ensure that benefits paid by this Department are co-ordinated with those paid by the Veterans Agency (formerly the War Pensions Agency), and that any appropriate adjustments to benefit claims are made in the normal course of events.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 22 January 2003, ref: 90125, what the reasons are for the assumption in the Green Paper on Pensions that spending on winter fuel payments will remain at their current level of &#163;200 up until 2051&#150;52; and, on the basis of the projections of spending given in the Green Paper, what the value of the winter fuel allowance will be in real terms in <i>(a)</i> 2011&#150;12, <i>(b)</i> 2021&#150;22 and <i>(c)</i> 2051&#150;52.

 The current amount of the Winter Fuel Payment of &#163;200 will continue to be paid to each eligible household for the rest of this parliament. The rate will be kept under review. However, for the purposes of the projections in Annexe 3 of the Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice' (Cm 5677), it was necessary to make a modelling assumption about the value of winter fuel payments. Modelling assumptions should not be interpreted as statements of policy. It will be for future Governments to decide what the rate of Winter Fuel Payments should be for future years.
<P>

<a name="30224w51.html_para6">The following table shows the projected future value of the winter fuel payment in 2002&#150;03 prices on the assumption that it remains at its current cash value of &#163;200 and that inflation remains constant at 2.5 per cent.

 The Government has designed the aggregates levy to protect the international competitiveness of aggregates businesses by applying the levy to the commercial exploitation of all virgin aggregate used in the UK and by exempting exports. The Government has also recognised the unique position of the Northern Ireland processed products sector, those producing concrete, mortar and asphalt, by introducing a transitional relief scheme.




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 205W</I><P>

<P>

<P>

<a name="30224w51.html_para12">Customs and Excise assure aggregates levy in the same way that they assure other taxes and duties for which they are responsible. Assurance resources are allocated according to risk. Additionally, in the first year of its operation Customs are undertaking education and assurance visits to all companies registered for the levy. The resources allocated to administering the levy in Northern Ireland take account of issues associated with the land boundary, and this resourcing is subject to regular review.
<P>

<a name="30224w51.html_para13">The levy is due at the point of first commercial exploitation in the UK and not at the point of import. Consequently aggregates can be imported without levy immediately being due and therefore the question of illegal imports does not arise. Where it cannot be demonstrated that commercially exploited aggregate is from a levy-paid source, Customs will use their powers to recover the revenue due and impose penalties, where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30224w51.html_para14">Similarly, figures for the total weight of aggregate imported into the UK are not available. Aggregates levy returns record the weight of aggregate which is commercially exploited in the UK and do not differentiate between domestically produced and imported aggregate.

<P>

<a name="30224w51.html_para16">There have been no prosecutions for evasion of the levy. Customs' approach in the first year of the tax has been to ensure that those who should be registered are registered, and that the correct liability is established and paid.

<P>

<a name="30224w52.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> The budgetary provision for payments for the Child Tax Credit is &#163;8.3 billion in 2003&#150;04, &#163;11.7 billion in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;13.1 billion in 2005&#150;06.

For promotional and advertising costs for both credits, I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) on 15 October 2002, column 603W. Since the question was answered, further spending on promoting and advertising the new tax credits means that current expenditure stands at about &#163;9.75 million.

 The UK remains at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief and continues to promote the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The Chancellor discusses debt relief issues in a wide range of international meetings with representatives of developing countries. For example, on 24&#150;26 September 2002 the UK hosted the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting that included a Commonwealth HIPC ministerial forum. Debt relief and the HIPC initiative will also be discussed at the forthcoming spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30224w52.html_para7">On 23 January 2003 the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development published a document on the UK's proposal for the international finance facility.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proposals have been made by the European Commission to harmonise the taxation of diesel fuel for transport by all modes; whether that includes marine use at sea, in estuaries, on rivers and canals, for both commercial and leisure use; what consultations have taken place with interested persons or bodies; what reports have been published by the Government; and whether a decision in the Council of Ministers is by two-thirds majority vote.

<P>
<a name="30224w52.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The only European Commission proposal for full harmonisation of duty rates for diesel fuel used in transport relates to diesel fuel used by lorries over 16 tonnes, buses and coaches. The proposal is that member states should bring their duty rates for such diesel closer together to reach a harmonised rate by 2010 of Euro350 per 1,000 litres, although that rate would be uprated in line with inflation. The Government have submitted an Explanatory Memorandum on this proposal (reference 11571/02 dated 26 September 2002), which set out our opposition to it. That opposition is shared by nearly all member states, so the directive cannot be adopted in its present form, as any decisions taken by the Council of Ministers on matters of taxation have to be unanimous.
<P>

<a name="30224w52.html_para14">The only European Commission proposal relating to duty on diesel fuel for marine use is the proposed directive on taxation of energy products. This would generally continue the existing duty treatment of diesel fuel for marine use in the mineral oils structures directive. It provides for a compulsory exemption for diesel fuel used for navigation in Community waters (although it would allow member states to limit the exemption to international and intra-Community transport) and for an optional exemption for diesel fuel used for navigation in inland waterways. In both cases, private pleasure craft are excluded from these exemptions, but the United Kingdom's derogation from the existing directive, allowing the United Kingdom to exempt fuel for private pleasure craft until 31 December 2006, will be unaffected. The Government have submitted a supplementary Memorandum on the latest version of the proposal (reference 13422/02, FISC 266, dated 26 November 2002). This directive will support efforts to deal with the significant environmental problems arising from global warming, which requires cross-border action. This proposal also cannot be adopted in its present form without unanimous agreement by the Council of Ministers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will take steps to introduce a levy on the use of plastic bags; and if he will make a statement.  [96390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w57.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There are currently no plans to introduce a plastic bags tax. Instead, as the Chancellor said in his pre-Budget statement, the Government will be considering how the use of economic instruments can be extended to provide a more comprehensive and coherent framework for waste management more generally, as well as the scope for using other policies to tackle packaging and encourage producer responsibility. However, in both Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom generally, a number of positive steps are being taken to encourage a significant reduction in the use of plastic bags in order to protect the environment, decrease the amount of visible litter and reduce the volume of plastic bags going to landfill.
<P>

<a name="30224w57.html_para2">A key element in achieving these results is to change consumer behaviour. In Northern Ireland, I am pleased to confirm that, following negotiations with representatives of the major supermarket chains, a Retail Charter was introduced in October last year. This charter takes a pro-active approach to educating both retailers and consumers in the application of sustainable environmental policies to their shopping habits, a message which has again been promoted in recent months, in the Department of the Environment's intensive 'Wake up to Waste' and 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle' advertising campaigns.
<P>

<a name="30224w57.html_para3">A further key step in changing a culture of indiscriminate use and disposal of plastic bags will be the forthcoming review of litter legislation, which will identify and address any shortcomings in the existing body of litter legislation in Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the impact on Northern Ireland of the UK's non-implementation of the EU Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control rules; what representations he has made; what fines will be imposed; and what steps are being taken to rectify the situation.  [98370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w58.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 At present the Industrial Pollution Control (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 provides for an integrated approach to the control of pollution from industrial processes. This provides for a strong and effective system of control and has been successful in providing a better and cleaner environment.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para0">However, the United Kingdom also has an obligation to comply with EC Directive 96/91 on integrated pollution prevention and control, which provides for a similar system. The delay in the introduction of the transposing legislation in Northern Ireland has meant that the United Kingdom has been unable to meet fully its obligations. The Commission has therefore brought infraction proceedings against the UK.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para1">The necessary legislation has now been introduced in Northern Ireland with the introduction of the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002 and the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003. The United Kingdom now takes the view that it has met fully its obligations to comply with the Directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what proportion of Translink's increased customer base, as set out in the latest edition of the Northern Ireland Road and Rail Transport Statistics Quarterly Bulletin, is accounted for by <i>(a)</i> paying customers, <i>(b)</i> those entitled to free travel, <i>(c)</i> new business and <i>(d)</i> ticket price increases.  [98265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w58.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Translink has introduced a new integrated ticketing system on Citybus from 1 October 2001 and on Ulsterbus from 1 April 2002. The new system has not yet been implemented in Northern Ireland Railway hence information is not available to answer questions <i>(a)</i>, nor is any information available which would identify new customers (question <i>(c)</i>).




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 229W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para2">For question <i>(b)</i> it is estimated that the increase in patronage on Citybus is mostly attributable to over 65-year-olds who are entitled to free travel, while less than half of the increase on Ulsterbus resulted from the senior citizen market. It is not thought that there has been any increase in usage of the railways by the elderly sector who are entitled to free travel.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para3">For question <i>(d)</i> there was a 4.5 per cent. fares increase in public transport. Overall receipts increased by &#163;0.9 million which was an increase of 6.6 per cent. over the period. Therefore 68 per cent. of the increase in receipts was due to ticket price increases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w58.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The number of works complying with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive in Northern Ireland for the years 1999 to 2001 is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1999&#151;8 out of a total of 15 complied&#151;which gives a compliance rate of 53 per cent.

<P>
<BR>
2001&#151;13 out of a total of 37 complied&#151;which gives a compliance rate of 35 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30224w58.html_para4">The apparent fall in the rate of compliance between 2000 and 2001 reflects the phased introduction of targets under the UWWT Directive bringing more waste-water treatment works within its scope. For the year 2002, a total of 35 works have been assessed with the results still needing to be confirmed. However, the initial indication is that compliance is in the region of 50 per cent.&#151;similar to 1999 and 2000.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para5">There is a legacy of under-funding of Northern Ireland's infrastructure. However, the upgrading of Northern Ireland's water and sewerage services to meet EU regulations is a high priority. Over &#163;250 million will be invested on the waste-water infrastructure over the next three years. This increased level of investment has been made possible by the allocation of an additional &#163;180 million for the wider water and sewerage services over the next three years, as was announced in the Budget statement in December 2002. In addition, DRD is actively considering with the Strategic Investment Board the potential for delivering a sizeable Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme which could include a number of wastewater treatment works, as part of the Strategic Investment Programme.

Environment's Environment and Heritage Service about the environmental compliance and pollution implications of further development. There was no moratorium on the determination of planning applications.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para7">Discussions took place between Environment and Heritage Service, Planning Service and Water Service and, as a result, Environment and Heritage Service and Water Service agreed an expanded and reprioritised Capital Works Programme to carry out the improvement works to the sewage treatment and sewerage systems necessary in order to ensure compliance with EU Directives and national standards. On the basis of the agreed programme, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly decided that planning applications that had been held on a precautionary basis and future planning applications in the locations affected would be processed to a conclusion. Dermot Nesbitt MLA announced the Executive Committee's decision in a statement to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 7 October 2002.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para8">It was agreed that the Department of the Environment and the Department for Regional Development would monitor the implementation of the capital works programme and compliance with the relevant environmental standards in order to allow the agreed approach to be reviewed, if necessary.

Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson) announced our intention to introduce self-financing arrangements for Water Service, which will require the introduction of domestic water and sewerage charges. I wish to ensure that water and sewerage services are delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible to ensure that future household charges are fair and affordable. This will require reform of the arrangements for the delivery of these services, and may require a change in the organisational status of Water Service.
<P>

<a name="30224w58.html_para11">No decision has been taken on this issue yet, and I intend to engage in full and inclusive consultation on any proposals for change. However, should a decision be taken to move responsibility for the delivery of water and sewerage services outside Central Government, Crown Immunity would not continue for Water Service.

<P>
<a name="30224w58.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Treaty establishing the European Community does not provide for strengthening a common cultural identity, but does encourage bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore while respecting regional and national diversity within the Member States. In order to achieve this the Council of Culture Ministers agreed the Council Resolution of 25 June 2002 on a new work plan on European co-operation in the field of culture. My right hon and noble Friend the Minister for the Arts attended the culture and audiovisual session of the Education, Youth and Culture Council in Brussels on 11 November 2002, accompanied by Dr Elaine Murray, Deputy Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport in the Scottish Executive. They discussed with other European Union Culture Ministers progress on the new work plan and agreed further resolutions, e.g. on mobility of persons and circulation of works in the cultural sector (Report in <i>Official Report</i>, 20 November 2002, column 143W). Future meetings of European Union Ministers for Culture will discuss further progress on the new work plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the effect on post offices in Derbyshire of the change in payment of benefits from over-the-counter to direct bank transfer.  [98893]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w60.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made by the Department. The migration of benefit payment to ACT begins this year and the Post Office's strategy is to respond to that challenge with a range of banking and other services. How the migration of benefit payments affects the revenue of post offices will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change. The income from the various contracts Post Office Ltd. has with the spending Departments and various financial institutions, and the remuneration of sub-postmasters for banking services, is a commercial matter between the parties.

<a name="30224w60.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The use of coal mine methane directly as a fuel in industrial processes is already exempt from the Climate Change Levy. The Department of Trade and Industry have submitted a State Aid Application to the European Commission for exemption from the Climate Change Levy for electricity produced from coal mine methane. The commission has opened an investigation under Article 88(2) of the Treaty to determine whether the proposed aid is approvable. They will be inviting comments from member states and interested parties. We have received the formal notification of this decision from the commission and DTI officials are currently

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reasons a second medical examination to assess the services proportion of coal industry vibration white finger claims is required; what additional <i>(a)</i> resources and <i>(b)</i> expenditure have been set aside for this purpose; and when he expects all claims to be settled.  [97968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w60.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In addition to the general damages paid to those suffering from vibration white finger (VWF) my Department is responsible for compensation to certain claimants who are prevented from carrying out everyday tasks such as DIY and gardening because of the severity of their VWF. Therefore, in accordance with common law it is necessary to identify to what extent VWF itself has caused these difficulties. The second medical examination is designed to identify any other conditions, or co-morbidities, that may impact upon a claimant's ability to undertake the task claimed for. The existing medical examination for VWF was not designed to identify such conditions, which is why a second medical in these circumstances is necessary.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para0">Resources for this second medical, or Services MAP, are already being put in place. The Department announced on 6 February 2003 that Aon Health Solutions (AHS) has been appointed as the new medical provider for this process. We are now involved actively with all our contract partners towards starting medical assessments by the end of April this year. Currently there are 60 adjusters at IRISC preparing claims for the Services MAP. Resources at AHS will be updated over time in line with the volumes of claims passing through to the medical stage of the process.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para1">It is not possible to make firm financial estimates of the cost of Services claims until the numbers of those making claims is clearer. But this is a legal liability and the Department will meet whatever it costs. As well as having financial implications, the final numbers will also impact on the time scale involved. It is hoped to have the majority of claims through the Services MAP by the end of 2005; however, this is significantly dependent on the full cooperation of solicitors in getting claims documentation to our claims handlers.

<a name="30224w60.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Although coal mine methane currently contributes some 30MW to the total 74,000MW generating capacity in the UK, the Government recognise and value the environmental benefits the industry provides by tapping the methane emissions and putting them to good use. We are very supportive of this industry and are keen to help it expand so that it can continue to reduce these emissions throughout the UK. We have already demonstrated this support through our securing exemption from the climate change levy for electricity generated from CMM in last year's budget, and this is currently being cleared with the European Commission.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para3">The Cruickshank report on Competition in UK Banking concluded that there was a profound lack of competition in the provision of payment services and recommended the setting up of a regulator to bring about improved competition in this sector. In his March 2000 Budget speech, the Chancellor announced that the Government would legislate to ensure the payments system is open to new competition. The Government remain committed to introducing legislation to give the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) new powers to promote effective competition in payment systems&#151;and will do so as soon as parliamentary time allows.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para4">Progress has already been made through, for example, reforms to the governance structures of the main UK payment systems. The Government welcome these moves by payment system participants to address the competition issues identified by the Cruickshank report and urges the industry to continue with these reforms.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para5">The Cruickshank report did not specifically recommend regulating the charges on small businesses for credit and debit card transactions. What it did recommend, however, was that wholesale prices&#151;such as interchange fees&#151;should generally be derived through a process that is transparent to final users, and that prices should be based on legitimate costs and should anticipate achievable cost reductions. It is envisaged that the Government's proposed legislation will include provisions designed to promote efficient wholesale pricing. This might reasonably be expected to bring about benefits to all end-users of payment services, including small businesses.

<a name="30224w60.html_para6">To promote its understanding of how payment systems operate, and to help pave the way for its prospective powers, the OFT announced on 27 November that it would conduct an empirical study

 At mid-February 2003, &#163;40.2 million in compensation had been paid to 4,653 former Icelandic water trawlermen. About 2,900 claimants had been assessed as not qualifying for compensation. I regret that there are no figures about how many claims have been rejected and reduced because of gaps in service in each of the main distant water ports. This information could be produced only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the reasons underlying the treatment of <i>(a)</i> compulsory periods of service on North Sea fishing boats and <i>(b)</i> periods spent in prison in calculating service for the purposes of her compensation scheme for Icelandic trawlermen; and how <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> are treated under redundancy legislation.  [98479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w60.html_spnew9"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The continuity of service rules under the Government's compensation scheme were extremely generous to claimants. In general, service was regarded as continuous regardless how many gaps a trawlerman had had between voyages on Icelandic water vessels, or how long those gaps had been, or what the reasons for them had been.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para7">The only exception was where, during a gap of longer than 12 weeks, the former trawlerman had done other work&#151;which included, for these purposes, other fishing work on vessels that had never made voyages to Icelandic waters. The rationale for this was that if a former trawlerman had done other work during a lengthy gap between voyages on Icelandic water vessels, it would not have been right to have regarded him as having remained dependent upon the industry during that period.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para8">One consequence of the generosity of this aspect of the scheme rules was that time spent in prison did not break continuity, provided the former trawlerman's most recent work before going into prison had been on 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 239W</I><P>
an Icelandic water vessel, and that he had resumed work on such a vessel after his release, having done no other work in between.
<P>

<a name="30224w60.html_para9">The continuity of service rules under the statutory redundancy payments scheme are different, and much stricter. In particular, there is a requirement for continuous service with the same employer (or an associated employer), whereas under the compensation scheme there was no such requirement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many projects were started by the South West RDA in <i>(a)</i> 2000&#150;01, <i>(b)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(c)</i> 2002&#150;03.  [98303]<P>

<a name="30224w61.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will consult the authorities in <i>(a)</i> Jersey, <i>(b)</i> Guernsey and <i>(c)</i> the Isle of Man about the extension of the clauses relating to the inspection of bank accounts in the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill to them.  [98428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w61.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 No, we have not consulted the Islands about extending the Bill to them as they customarily enact their own legislation in the area of criminal justice&#151;for example, in the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) (Jersey) Law 2001, the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2001 and the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (of Tynwald).
<P>

<a name="30224w61.html_para17">The clauses referred to implement the 2001 Protocol to the Mutual Legal Assistance Convention 2000. To opt in to this Convention, and the protocol, the Islands would first need to join the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance. They have passed the necessary legislation and any subsequent decision on whether to apply further agreements is a matter for them.
<P>

<a name="30224w61.html_para18">A copy of the Bill will be sent to the Insular Authorities once it receives Royal Assent and becomes an Act. Then it will be a matter for the Islands' discretion as to whether they wish to introduce any similar provisions into their own legislation. I would refer my hon. Friend to the <i>Official Report</i> of the Grand Committee on the Bill in the other place, columns GC42-GC46 (3 February 2003).

<P>
<a name="30224w62.html_wqn0"><B> Sir John Stanley: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps her Department takes to discharge its obligations in relation to rights of access under Article 21 of the 1980 Hague Convention on International Child Abduction in the circumstances where the left-behind parent is in the UK and the abducted child is with its other parent in a state that has ratified the Hague Convention.  [98250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w62.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Article 21 of the Hague Convention allows applications via the designated Central Authorities to make arrangements for organising or securing the effective exercise of rights of access. Any parent resident in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, whose child is resident in another Hague Convention country, may apply to the Child Abduction Unit (which discharges the Lord Chancellor's functions as Central Authority under the 1980 Hague Convention). The unit will transmit the application to its counterpart in the other country, monitor the case, liaise with all interested parties and assist as necessary, for example with applications for legal aid.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on progress towards Government targets for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.  [98064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w62.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Pursuant to section 87(5) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 a full report on the progress being made on implementation of the Act was laid before both Houses on 28 November 2002 (HC6). In line with this requirement a further report will be laid before the House before the end of November this year. In the meantime, the Act continues to be implemented according to the timetable announced by my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor on 13 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 457.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w62.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what stocks of landmines were held in <i>(a)</i> 2001 and <i>(b)</i> 2002 on Diego Garcia; what stocks are held there now; whose authority they are under; and if he will make a statement.  [96389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w62.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have received assurances from the US authorities that no anti-personnel landmines were stored on Diego Garcia during 2001 or 2002. In contrast to anti-personnel landmines, anti-tank mines are not banned weapons under international law and are not subject to ban under international treaties. No anti-tank mines were stored on Diego Garcia by the British authorities in 2001 or 2002. The storing of such mines by the US authorities would be a matter for them under the various international agreements regulating their defence facility on the island.

<a name="30224w62.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 As with previous Administrations, and in line with exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, it is not this Government's normal practice to release details of specific meetings or their content, as some of these discussions may have taken place on a confidential basis. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the rules set out in the Ministerial Code, the Civil Service Code, and Guidance for Civil Servants: Contacts with Lobbyists. Copies of these documents are available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w63.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Government's position remains that set out by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary in his statement of 12 July 2002, <i>Official</i> <i>Report</i>, column 1165.

 Under an agreement between the British and Spanish Governments in 1996, payments to all previous Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund contributors were fixed at 100% of accrued rights at 1988 levels and HMG assumed responsibility for payments to those not resident in Gibraltar.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w63.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Reverend Damanik has been charged with firearms offences which need to be investigated thoroughly and fully. It is essential that the legal process take its full course and the Indonesian courts hear all the evidence. Under international law we are prohibited from intervening in individual cases before the courts in another sovereign country. However, we continue to stress to the Indonesian 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 250W</I><P>
Government the importance of a fair and transparent judicial system, and of applying the law in an even-handed way to all who break it. We have also offered human rights training for a number of Indonesian Supreme Court Judges. The Indonesians welcomed this training, and are keen for it to go ahead.

<P>
<a name="30224w64.html_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Children in Iraq are already vulnerable. In the centre and south of Iraq, under-five mortality rates are 131 per 1,000 live births&#151;worse than the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Mozambique. The situation is particularly bad in the centre and south of Iraq where conditions have been deteriorating since the 1980s. The situation in the North, which is subject to UN sanctions but not ruled by Saddam Hussein, is less serious with the under-five mortality rate of 72 per 1000 live births.
<P>

<a name="30224w64.html_para3">The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of the efforts of the international community to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq. Aside from our role in the UN, UK assistance to Iraq continues both bilaterally and through the EC. Since 1991 the UK has provided over &#163;100 million for humanitarian work. The Department for International Development's ongoing programme expects to spend &#163;8 million this financial year.
<P>

<a name="30224w64.html_para4">We are holding regular discussions with the UN, US and others about ways to minimise the suffering of the Iraqi people, including in the possible event of military action. One key priority will be to re-establish the Oil For Food distribution network as quickly as possible if it is disrupted. In addition to DFID's ongoing programme

This is not a new problem and was addressed in the Intelligence and Security Committee's last Annual Report (Cm 5542) and the Government's response (Cm 5543). The Government continues to take this problem seriously, and the Director of GCHQ and Sir David Omand are taking steps to improve the situation.

The six areas identified here, which have been made public (in HC368 of 30 January 2003, page 5) are drawn from the Agencies' individual statements of internal control, the full details of which are available to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and to the Intelligence and Security Committee. On the matter of the shortcomings in GCHQ's management of assets and the Government's determination to correct these, I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave him today. Weaknesses in the other areas mentioned were of a smaller scale and steps have already been taken to improve control in these areas. There is no evidence that any of these weaknesses have led to material financial loss and there has been no impact on the Agencies' operational effectiveness.

<P>
<a name="30224w65.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The London Fire Brigade (LFB), and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) and its predecessors, have long been closely involved in contingency planning for a major emergency in the capital. Following the events of 11 September 2001, it was recognised that an enhanced emergency planning capability involving LFB, LFEPA and other key agencies was needed to deal with the new kind of threat. In May 2002, a new strategic planning regime was set up under the London Resilience Forum, chaired by myself with the Mayor as my deputy. LFB and LFEPA are represented at a senior level on the London Resilience Forum, and secondees from LFB and LFEPA are attached to the London Resilience Team, an inter-agency team based in the Government Office for London which reports to me and which is driving forward a programme of action to increase London's

As part of this programme, LFB, LFEPA and other key agencies have been closely involved in drawing up a new command and control structure for ensuring a co-ordinated response from the emergency services, the Government and other key players in the event of a catastrophic incident.

<a name="30224w67.html_para1">Emissions reductions will come from a range of policies and measures, covering all sectors of the economy. Key policies introduced so far include the climate change levy package; the UK greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme; a target for the renewables obligation that 10 per cent. of sales from licensed electricity suppliers should be generated from renewable sources; the target to at least double the capacity of combined heat and power by 2010; European-level agreements with car manufacturers to improve the fuel efficiency of new cars; the 10-Year Plan for Transport; better energy efficiency in the residential sector; and, improving performance standards in the Building Regulations.

 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2003]:</i> In 1996 DOE published a report "Methane and other gases from disused coal mines: The Planning Response" which discussed the problems posed by gases, including methane, from disused coal mines, in the context of town and country planning. It provided factual information for those involved with land and property such as planners, developers, owners and insurers, and is relevant to both new and existing development. The report mentions that between 1945 and 1994 there were about 75 surface gas emissions recorded, of which 70 per cent. involved methane, and in 35 per cent. of these cases the gas ignited. Half (nine) involved residential property. A copy of the report is in the House Library.

<a name="30224w67.html_para2">Since 1995 the Coal Authority (CA) has been recording incidents of water, gas and major collapses involving non-operational coal mines. The CA's Surface Hazard call-out system, which aims to attend a call within two hours and make safe within six hours, recorded 68 incidents of surface mine gas between 1995 and 2002 of which four were in the West Midlands. These incidents include both methane and other oxygen-deficient gases such as carbon-dioxide. Incidents are tackled urgently to avoid damage or other problems.

 Within Government, the Sustainable Procurement Group has considered the scope to stimulate markets for recycled goods via public procurement and will make its recommendations to Ministers within the next few weeks. The Group has sought advice from the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) (which was set up to encourage market development for recycled goods) on increasing the uptake of recycled products across Government and we expect its recommendations to point the way to significant improvements in purchasing of recycled products throughout the public sector. The increasing statutory targets that currently exist for local authorities will also provide an incentive for them to ensure that there is a market for recycled goods in place.
<P>

<a name="30224w68.html_para2">More recently the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report on Waste Strategy has recommended that the work that the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is undertaking with the Local Government Association and Improvement and Development Agency to promote the take-up of green procurement by local authorities be extended still further. It also suggested that formal mechanisms be put in place to roll out best practice tools developed by the Sustainable Procurement Group to local government. In Central Government it recommended targets for the use of recycled materials. Voluntary green targets were also recommended for local authorities to purchase more recycled goods, minimise waste volumes and to encourage them to recycle more of their waste. The Government aim to publish their response to that report in the spring.

Prior to 2000&#150;01 resources were provided to local authorities for recycling under a Supplementary Credit Approval scheme. The figure for 1997&#150;98 was &#163;2.159 million.<P>

Defra's Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund has provided &#163;50 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;90 million in 2003&#150;04 to encourage local authorities to expand recycling operations in their area. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has also been allocated &#163;40 million from 2000&#150;01 to 2003&#150;04 to work on overcoming market barriers to reuse and recycling of waste. An additional &#163;15 million was made available to WRAP for 2002&#150;04 from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund to promote increased use of alternative materials as aggregates.<P>

The Government have also provided Private Finance Initiative (PFI) credits for waste and recycling projects of &#163;220 million in SR 2000 and &#163;355 million in SR 2002. So far, PFI waste projects approved by Defra have typically been large integrated waste management schemes including a variety of waste treatment options.<P>

As part of a Local Public Sector Agreements (LPSA) the Government offers, at the outset, a pump-priming grant, unsupported credit approvals and potential relaxations in statutory and administrative requirements. To date local authorities have been awarded approximately &#163;5 million in pump priming grants, and &#163;16 million in Unsupported Credit Approvals to facilitate the improvement of waste minimisation and recycling. Typically, financial support has been used to improve enforcement and publicity; to develop civic amenity sites; and to initiate or expand kerb-side collection schemes.<P>

 We monitor the humanitarian situation in Burma and Thailand including the situation for the 140,000 refugees living in camps, an estimated 1 million irregular migrants living on or near the border and the vulnerable populations living in border areas in Burma itself. Getting relief to internally displaced people living on the Burmese side of the border is difficult and dangerous. We provide humanitarian assistance on both sides of the border through carefully selected agencies eg UNHCR and ICRC in Thailand and Burma. The ICRC is the only organisation with a permanent international presence on both sides of the border. We also support WHO's border health programme in Thailand. In addition, we support food relief assistance for refugee camps through the Burmese Border Consortium (BBC). In the current financial year 2002&#150;03 DFID's assistance in these areas will amount to around &#163;3 million.

 We are providing assistance in various ways to help bring the benefits of mobile communications to poorer people in developing countries. For example, the Building Digital Opportunities programme is supporting work at the policy level (e.g. by assisting regulators to develop pro-poor policy environments) and with communities (e.g. supporting local approaches to providing valuable information to poorer communities through mobile phones). Strategic interventions such as our new CATIA programme (Catalysing Access to ICTs in Africa) and the Open Knowledge Network, both include support for pro-poor mobile communication channels.

In close consultation with key private companies and the DTI, we are jointly exploring how to enable the private sector bring affordable communications services to the great majority of people in developing countries without easy access to a public telephone. Mobile communications will play a critical role in this. In addition, DFID is contributing to broader infrastructure investment funds, such as the EAIF&#151;Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund&#151;which can support, inter alia, investments in mobile communications facilities.

In addition I recently set aside a total of &#163;45.6 million for Montserrat over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, which will bring our total assistance by 2005&#150;06 to over &#163;225 million since the onset of the volcanic emergency. This will represent, for the coming three years, an increase of around 50 percent. of the budget that was previously available to Montserrat over that period.<P>

 The economic crisis has seriously compromised household welfare. Many Palestinian families have endured long periods without work or incomes, and are now dependent on food aid for their daily survival. The international community has responded to the growing crisis through a range of interventions, including the provision of food. Donor disbursements have doubled accordingly in the last two years. But unless Palestinians can move around to work and trade, the Palestinian economy will continue to stagnate and the spiral of unemployment, poverty and malnutrition will worsen.

The percentage of people with access to basic sanitation increased from 51 per cent. to 61 per cent. in the same period. Much work, however, has yet to be done. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 58 per cent. of the population has access to improved water sources.

Of that, 60 per cent. was allocated to urban and 40 per cent. to rural water and sanitation programmes.

 The latest Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee survey indicates that 7.2 million people are currently in need of emergency food aid. The WFP and bilateral programmes aim to target 40 per cent. of needs, with the Government of Zimbabwe and the private sector responsible for the greater part of the response. Government reports imports of around 700,000 tonnes of maize to date, but the distribution of this food is not transparent, and the private sector has been excluded from participation.
<P>

<a name="30224w72.html_para5">The performance of the World Food Programme and its implementing partners has improved steadily. In January 2003, 3.3 million people were fed, and another 2 million people received supplementary food through bilateral programmes. The WFP is close to meeting its revised target of feeding 4.5 million people in February 2003, and 5 million in March 2003. Contributions and pledges to the WFP emergency appeal mean that the main WFP pipeline is 83 per cent. full until June of 2003.

<a name="30224w72.html_para6">Prospects for the coming year are under assessment. Insufficient maize was planted and the lack of fertilizers and rainfall raise the prospect of another poor production year. The capacity of the Government of Zimbabwe to continue to import maize in quantity is of concern, and it is already clear that continued international assistance will be needed. Donors are already planning for the future, and urging Government to ease price controls, which are distorting internal markets, and to open importation to the private sector to help meet needs.

 The Department commissioned an independent review of the effectiveness of cycle helmets, which was published at the end of November 2002 as Road Safety Research Report Number 30. Among other things, it concluded that bicycle helmets are effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injuries. Also, the Bicycle Helmet Initiative Trust has been running a cycle helmet promotion scheme in Reading since 1992. During that time, cycle helmet use by children has trebled and there has been a 45 per cent. reduction in the number of hospital treated head injuries.

 Cycle helmet wearing rates observed on major built-up roads have increased significantly from 16 per cent. in 1994 to 22 per cent. in 1999. TRL Report 286 is principally a study of observed cycle helmet wearing rates in 1996. The report includes an assessment of current local authority initiatives to promote cycle helmet wearing and observed wearing rates but does not provide sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of promotional campaigns on the levels of cycling.

<a name="30224w73.html_para3">Our objectives to increase cycling and improve the safety of cyclists are complementary. A key component in making cycling more popular is to make it a safer and more pleasant activity. Cycle helmets are effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injuries, so encouraging the use of cycle helmets is one of many approaches to improving the safety of cyclists on our roads.

<a name="30224w74.html_para0">Since the establishment of the Department for Transport on 29 May 2002, there has been one reported case of a lost laptop computer, at a cost of &#163;1,011.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much was raised in light dues in the latest available year; and what his estimate is of the amount paid <i>(a)</i> per merchant ship per voyage and <i>(b)</i> by each fishing vessel (i) per voyage and (ii) per year.  [98409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The total income from light dues for 2001&#150;02 was &#163;74,785,262 of which &#163;696,566 was paid by fishing vessels and tugs.
<P>

<a name="30224w74.html_para1">Light dues rates for merchant vessels in 2001&#150;02 were levied at 0.41p per registered ton. Fishing vessels and tugs paid an annual rate of &#163;202.00 for the first 10 metres and &#163;21.00 for each metre of length in excess of 10 metres.
<P>

<a name="30224w74.html_para2">The rates were reduced in April 2002 to &#163;0.40p per registered ton for merchant vessels and a cap of 40,000 tons was introduced, making the maximum charge payable &#163;16,000 per voyage, to reduce the burden of light dues falling on the largest vessels. The rates for fishing vessels and tugs were also reduced to an annual payment of &#163;190.00 for the first 10 metres and &#163;20.00 for each metre thereafter.
<P>

<a name="30224w74.html_para3">Once a merchant vessel has paid light dues, there is no further liability for a period of one month from that date. Furthermore, no more than seven payments are required in any fiscal year. We therefore do not hold information on merchant vessel movements beyond the seven voyage limit. Neither do we hold records on fishing vessel or tug activity.

[98182]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_spnew2"><B> Mr Jamieson: </B> 
 There are currently over 1,100 LPG refuelling sites in the UK. The financial detail of this substantial investment in the technology is commercial information, private to the companies concerned. Eight vehicle manufacturers now offer LPG cars, in addition

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_wqn4"><B> Mark Tami: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the cost to <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> local authorities of damage done to UK roads by overweight vehicles in (i) 1999, (ii) 2000 and (iii) 2001.  [97072]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 These figures are difficult to estimate, since they would require a detailed knowledge of the types of vehicle concerned, the extent of their overloading, the roads that they travelled on, and the distances they travelled. These figures are not available.
<P>

<a name="30224w74.html_para4">Two thirds of heavy goods vehicle mileage occurs on motorways and trunk roads. On these roads carriageways and bridges are designed to cater for overweight vehicles, and the effect of these vehicles is too small to quantify when compared to the cumulative effect of traffic over the life of a road.
<P>

<a name="30224w74.html_para5">Most modern articulated lorries are capable of carrying more than their normal operational weight safely. Overloading offences declined with the introduction of 40 tonne lorries in January 1999, and declined further when 44 tonne lorries were introduced in February 2001.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will amend the Zebra, Pelican and Puffin Pedestrian Crossings Regulations and General Directions 1997 to allow for the part-time operation of flashing beacons.  [98588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Zebra crossings operate 24 hours a day and part-time operation of beacons could be taken to imply that this was not the case. It would also remove an important safety element that warns drivers that they are approaching a zebra crossing. There is, therefore, a real danger that adopting this proposal would increase accidents at pedestrian crossings at times when the flashing beacons are turned off. In view of this, we have no plans to make this amendment to the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w74.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is working with Midland Main Line to implement the latter's franchise commitment to provide an hourly non-stop service from Leeds to London, all of which will call at Sheffield.

<P>
<a name="30224w75.html_spnew9"><B> Mr Jamieson: </B> 
 Following the publication of the Rural Road Hierarchy Report in November 2001 we are progressing work to improve safety across our rural road network. This includes the development of a framework to assess what speeds are appropriate together with surveys of what speeds are actually being driven on rural roads. The first results of this work should be available shortly and will feed into other work including a review of the guidance on setting speed limits due to start later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the Circular which will explain the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 will provide guidance to highway authorities on avoiding sign clutter in the countryside; and when it will be published.  [98027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w75.html_spnew10"><B> Mr Jamieson: </B> 
 DfT Circular 02/2003 was published on 31 January. It explains the differences between the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 2002 and the TSRGD 1994 that they replace. It does not contain guidance on sign clutter. However the Department will be publishing updated guidance later this year which will remind signing practitioners that signs should be used sparingly whether in the countryside or in towns. The revised Chapter 4 of the Traffic Signs Manual, on the use of warning signs, which we expect to publish in the summer, will provide advice on how to provide effective signing while minimising environmental intrusion. Revised guidance on the use of directional signs to tourist destinations will remind local authorities of the need to minimise the environmental impacts of signs, particularly in rural areas.

 Our two new Future Aircraft Carriers (CVFs) have not yet been ordered. On 30 January 2003, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced the way forward for CVF. Our conclusion was that, to obtain value for money and provide the best capability, an alliance approach would offer the best meansof delivering a programme of this magnitude. We envisage that the alliance will be led by BAE Systems as the preferred Prime Contractor, with responsibility for project and shipbuilding management. Thales UK will assume a major role as the Key Supplier of the whole ship design. We intend the Ministry of Defence to take up a formal role within the Alliance. Negotiations on the alliance arrangements are now underway, and it is therefore not yet possible to state what proportion of the costs will be paid to BAE Systems or Thales. It is not intended to place the Prime Contract for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase of the CVF programme, during which the ships will actually be built, until the spring of 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the scope for savings in the defence procurement budget as a consequence of increased European collaboration on defence procurement; and if he will make a statement.  [96643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w77.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Collaboration in defence programmes can bring economic benefits by sharing non-recurring costs and through economies of scale in production and, further through the life cycle, by sharing in service support and upgrade costs. Collaboration is considered in all equipment programmes when developing the procurement strategies to best meet the needs of our Armed Forces, but it is not an easy option. Harmonising requirements, aligning funding and approvals processes and meeting workshare expectations amongst anything from two partners upwards is rarely straightforward. Thus tune, cost and performance risks can be magnified in collaborative programmes. Overall, however, the benefits more than outweigh the potential disadvantages.

<a name="30224w77.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The decision that the fire appliances based at Kineton would not respond to requests for assistance outside the perimeter on days on which local fire brigades were taking industrial action was made by the Fire Station Commander, on the advice of the Commandant of the Depot, and an order to this effect was issued on 1 November 2002. An investigation into the circumstances at Kineton was carried out in early February and as a result the order was revoked on the authority of the Defence Fire Service (Army).
<P>

<a name="30224w77.html_para0">Neither the decision to issue the original order nor its revocation was made on the instructions of, or with the knowledge of, a Government Minister.

 As stated in the answer given on 18 December 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 807W, to the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch), tactics, techniques and procedures, situational awareness and target identification complement each other and form a triad of measures designed to achieve Combat Identification and minimise the risk of fratricide. In relation to possible operations in the Gulf, we are working closely with allies to establish robust arrangements on Combat Identification that maximise interoperability, and we will acquire additional equipment in time for any potential conflict to enable our forces, including the Royal Marines, to operate effectively alongside coalition forces.

 The Ministry of Defence has issued 27 licences for hunting with dogs on the Defence Estate for the 2002&#150;03 season, including one for the Colchester area. In the absence of a statutory ban, my Department has no legal grounds on which to stop this activity, which has been undertaken under licensed conditions for many years on its estate. However, mindful of all the issues involved, foxhunting is restricted to those hunts that have traditionally held licences or enjoyed such rights on the Defence Estate.
<P>

<a name="30224w77.html_para2">The current foxhunting season, (which began on 1 September 2002 and which ends on 30 April 2003), is being conducted under strict terms and conditions, agreed with the Master of Foxhounds Association.

 As was made clear in the SDR New Chapter in July 2002, in post-Cold War conventional military operations there has been an increased emphasis on the need for precision in the use of force, to minimise unintended casualties and accidental damage.
<P>

<a name="30224w78.html_para0">The ability to conduct covert stand-off reconnaissance and surveillance, the accurate pin-pointing of targets, the updating and communication of targeting information in near real time and the ability to strike hard with a high degree of precision, will all be important. Land attack cruise missiles can play a key role in such a scenario. This capability is presently provided by submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles.
<P>

<a name="30224w78.html_para1">The principal role of the Type 45 Destroyers will be Anti-Air Warfare. However, they are being designed and built with significant space and weight margins to enable incremental acquisition, should an emerging requirement necessitate a different equipment fit.

<a name="30224w78.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Whole life cost estimates are being developed for all major Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels as part of the Ministry of Defence's Through Life Management Planning process. The first phase of this work is due to complete in March 2003. A note on progress in developing whole life cost information was contained in Major Projects Report 2002, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. It is planned that Major Projects Report 2003 will include whole life cost data on the 20 projects for which the main investment decision has been taken. This will include the Astute submarine, the Type 45 Destroyer and the Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary). The National Audit Office expect to publish their report at the end of the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the HMS Glasgow refit will be complete; how much it will cost; whether it is on budget; what the target date is for completion; when the ship will be ready for service; and if he will make a statement.  [98848]<P>

<P>
<a name="30224w78.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Glasgow has not undergone a refit. The ship was in extended readiness and regeneration work has been carried out in preparation for her re-joining the Fleet, to ease the short-term programming gap created by HMS Nottingham's unavailability. This package of work cost approximately &#163;2.5 million, and was completed in December 2002 and within budget. On the return of ship's personnel from Operation Fresco, HMS Glasgow will undergo Sea Trials and training requirements before returning to the Fleet.
<P>

<a name="30224w78.html_para4">This regeneration work will enable HMS Glasgow to be available for operations until HMS Nottingham returns to service in November 2004, after which, on current plans, she will be in Extended Readiness.

The Ministry of Defence does not have a specific research and development budget. There is a research budget covering non-nuclear research known as the Research Building Block. Separately, the MOD has a much larger budget for the acquisition of equipment within which some expenditure may be regarded as equipment development and some as equipment production. The development element of the acquisition expenditure is not used as a control total. The amount that is statistically counted as development (rather than production) in any one year is largely a consequence of the stage of the procurement cycle at which major 



equipment projects happen to be in the year in question. Expenditure on 'development' for 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 is therefore not yet separately identifiable.<P>

Research figures for the years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 have been compiled according to the principles of Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB). The figures as follows are for the Research Building Block expenditure and forecasts. All the above figures for these three years exclude recoverable VAT, the Technology Demonstrator Programme (TDP) and other minor research items.<P>

The net revenue to the MOD received from these sales is approximately &#163;26.5 million.<P>

As well as these larger ships, numerous minor vessels have been sold commercially by the DSA or via the DSA's marketing agreements, such as tugs and marine support craft.<P>

Additionally, Canada has acquired the four ex-RN Upholder class submarines. The acquisition takes the form of an eight-year lease with an option for outright purchase. The first of the submarines was handed over to Canada on 6 October 2000 with the second submarine being handed over on 4 October 2001. The third submarine is to be handed over to Canada on 21 February 2003, with the fourth boat following later in 2003. Canada has exercised its option to purchase outright the first of the submarines, ex-HMS Unseen. The value of the lease to buy arrangement with Canada 



(undertaken by the MOD's Upholder Programme), which includes the submarines, training and initial spares, is some 610 million Canadian dollars.<P>

No Royal Naval vessels were put in reserve in any of the last five years.<P>

The next planned refit and upgrade is that of HMS Talent which is expected to commence in spring 2003 and take approximately three years to complete including post refit trials and training. Details of Upkeep Periods beyond 2003 are classified, and I am withholding this information in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which relates to defence, security and international relations.<P>

 Three Swiftsure Class submarines are currently non-operational. HMS Sceptre and HMS Spartan are both in the final stages of refit. They are shortly planned to undergo sea trials before formally joining the fleet later this summer. HMS Superb is currently undergoing a period of inspection before starting a planned maintenance period. She is expected to rejoin the fleet in the first half of 2004.

<P>

<a name="30224w80.html_para2">There are many levels of potential UAV interoperability that require different degrees of compatibility of air vehicle, ground segment equipment and data links. To optimise UAV interoperability, the United Kingdom is contributing to the development, in association with our NATO allies, of standard UAV interfaces.

<a name="30224w80.html_para3">The United Kingdom has not cleared any weapons for use with the candidate UAVs for Watchkeeper. Current requirements for Watchkeeper do not call for the solutions to be able to carry weapons. The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any weapons being cleared, by any other nation, for use with those UAVs now being considered by the Watchkeeper programme. Neither are we aware of them having been used in combat.

 A number of studies have been undertaken in recent years to examine the suitability of the trimaran hull form to meet future naval capability requirements. These studies have indicated significant potential advantages over more conventional hull forms for many naval roles. This led to the design and build of the 97 metre demonstrator RV Triton, which has recently completed an extensive and very successful trials programme. The data gathered will be shared with industry in support of possible trimaran solutions for future defence requirements.

Watchkeeper is a complex programme, involving the integration of aerial vehicles with a ground control segment and wider connectivity to future communication systems such as Bowman. Therefore it was important to ensure that those companies selected for the remainder of the assessment phase can deliver a solution that will meet our operational requirements, at price we can afford and within the required timescales. After initial assessment of the bids, we sought clarification on a range of issues from each of the four bidders in December 2002. The decision and subsequent announcement was then made as quickly as possible following receipt of each bidder's response to these additional points of clarification.

<P>

 Domestic burglary is a serious offence, as has recently been made clear by the Government and the courts. As a rule, it should attract a custodial sentence unless it is a first time offence and there are clear mitigating circumstances. Sentences act as a deterrent in a number of ways, including restricting opportunities to re-offend and by tackling the causes of an individual's offending behaviour.

 The operating contractor of Ashfield young offender institution is Premier Prison Services which also operates Doncaster prison and young offender institution, Dovegate and Lowdham Grange prisons. I have not had discussions with Premier about any of these prisons, but I visited Ashfield on 29 August 2002 because of the concern that had been expressed about its performance.

<P>

<a name="30224w82.html_para1">No sanctions have been imposed on Premier directly as a result of the report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ashfield has been struggling for some considerable time to provide an environment for young people which is safe and constructive. Premier's failures were so significant that in May 2002, some time before the Inspectorate's visit, I considered closing it and would have done so were it not for the population pressures we were facing. Instead, I took the unprecedented step of imposing a public sector governor and he made significant improvements. As Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCIP) report acknowledges, a new, more constructive and safer regime, some weeks in the design stage, was successfully launched shortly after the HMCIP visit.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Premier runs good prisons at Doncaster and Lowdham Grange and is fast improving Dovegate prison.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w83.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government's policies are designed to ensure thatvictims of domestic violence receive help and support irrespective of gender, whilst recognising that this is a crime which predominantly affects women. Women are more likely to experience such violence over a lifetime, more likely to experience repeat victimisation, more likely to be injured and seek medical help, and more likely to experience frightening threats. Ministers have therefore emphasised that all forms of domestic violence are unacceptable and must be recognised and treated seriously, but have retained the policy focus on domestic violence against women, and children affected

<P>
<a name="30224w83.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Domestic violence is not separately identified in recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="30224w83.html_para2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence in England and Wales. It estimated that there were 122,000 incidents of domestic violence against men and 514,000 incidents against women in interviews in 2001/2.




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 321W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30224w83.html_para3">The BCS figures are derived from a sample and so are subject to sampling error. Moreover, the BCS is carried out by face-to-face interviews and some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. The 1996 BCS included a self-completion component on domestic violence to encourage disclosure. Results were published in Home Office Research Study No. 191&#151;copies are available in the Library. This more confidential approach to measurement revealed that the proportion of women that were victims of domestic assault in the last year was over three times higher than in the main BCS. It found that six per cent of women and five per cent of men had been threatened or assaulted by a current or former partner in the last year.

Under the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) recruitment initiative Nottinghamshire Police have been allocated an additional 157 recruits over and above the force's previous recruitment plans for the three years to March 2003. Funding for these officers will continue in 2003&#150;04. The CFF will continue in 2003/04 and we will fund 75 per cent of the cost of new recruits through CFF rather than 100 per cent as in the past three years. Nottinghamshire Police Authority has been allocated &#163;96,000 which on the basis of 75 per cent funding should be sufficient for the force to recruit a further 17 police officers through this fund.<P>

Apart from ring-fenced provision for a particular purpose, such as the Crime Fighting Fund, decisions about the police budget and the allocation of resources, including numbers of officers, are matters for the Nottinghamshire Police Authority and the Chief Constable (Stephen Green QPM). It is therefore not possible to provide estimates of Nottinghamshire's police strength in future years.<P>

 The availability of specialist drug dogs within the Prison Service has increased significantly following investment from the Comprehensive Spending Review 1997 and Spending Review 2000. All prisons now have access to both active and passive drug dogs. There are currently 261 active drug dogs and 212 passive drug dogs deployed across the Prison Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are being taken to reduce <i>(a)</i> delays and <i>(b)</i> late arrivals of prisoners from court; what steps are being taken to improve the information received by prisons from escort contractors; and what assessment has been made of potential benefits of placing the responsibility for escort services on the Prison Service.  [93329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w85.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The delivery of prisoners to court on time has been affected by the recent increase in the prison population. The Prison Service is trying in a number of ways to improve performance and service delivery.
<P>

<a name="30224w85.html_para8">A recent pilot exercise at Pentonville prison streamlined the escort contractor's work so as to prioritise the delivery of prisoners to court, according to the needs and timings of court business; this resulted in an 11 per cent. improvement in performance in London. The pilot may be extended across the wider Prison Service estate, subject to further findings.
<P>

<a name="30224w85.html_para9">The number of courts linked to the video link system is also increasing, with 123 magistrates' courts and one crown court currently using the service. A further 30 crown courts are to receive video link equipment by the end of August 2003, with funding currently being sought for a further 50 crown courts to be linked to the system. This use of the video links system between courts and prisons, which results in a decrease in the number of prisoners having to attend court in person, should help to release contractors' resources and so reduce delays in the movement of prisoners.
<P>

<a name="30224w85.html_para10">The Prison Service is also reviewing the internal working practices of some of those prisons that serve the courts to see if a closer correlation between those arrangements and court business hours could be achieved.




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 330W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30224w85.html_para11">The contracting out of prisoner escort arrangements has offered better value for money, a reduction in the number of escapes and has freed up prison officers to concentrate on their core duties. A recent Prison Service review confirmed that the service should continue to be contracted out. It also concluded that existing contracts, which are planned to become operational in 2004, should be replaced with more flexible ones to allow the Prison Service to respond more quickly to future business needs. The Prison Service is developing this approach and, together with the relevant agencies in the criminal justice system, is considering how all involved can work together to improve the service.

<a name="30224w86.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his Answer of 14 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 585W, on retail industry crime, how many small retail businesses in <i>(a)</i> Lancashire and <i>(b)</i> the North West of England have (i) applied for and 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 2003 : Column 331W</I><P>
(ii) received a grant from the Government to improve security on their property; and when the new survey of crime affecting retail and manufacturing industry will be published.  [97569]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w86.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Funding under the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas Initiative is allocated directly to regional Crime Reduction Directors, whose responsibility it is to distribute the money to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) covering the lO per cent most deprived wards in the region. Proposals invited from CDRPs have to meet the scheme's strict criteria, and are worked up in close conjunction with the regional Crime Reduction Director, who submits them to me for approval. All proposals submitted to me in the first two years of the initiative have been approved without exception.
<P>

<a name="30224w86.html_para0">In the first year of the initiative (2001&#150;02), over 80 small businesses in Lancashire benefited from funding of &#163;73,234. In 2002&#150;03, over 111 retailers and small businesses in the county stand to benefit from funding of &#163;251,453.
<P>

<a name="30224w86.html_para1">For the North West of England, over 420 small businesses benefited from the 2001&#150;02 allocation of &#163;470,670, and over 1140 retailers and small businesses stand to benefit from the 2002&#150;03 allocation of &#163;942,209.
<P>

<a name="30224w86.html_para2">We expect the results of the new survey of crime affecting retail and manufacturing business, which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in April last year, to be published in the summer.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the answer of 14 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 585W, on retail industry crime, if the report on the consultation on the means of creating and maintaining effective partnerships to reduce opportunities for crime against business will be <i>(a)</i> published online and <i>(b)</i> placed in the Library.  [97779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w86.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The consultation period on the business crime consultation document closes on 28 February 2003. We hope to publish a report on the outcome in the summer. The report will be published on the Home Office website and a copy will be placed in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w86.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the answer of 14 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 585W, on retail industry crime, what the average size is of a grant made available from the Government to businesses for improving the security of small retail businesses.  [97780]<P>
<P>
<P>

Staff numbers for the press office increased when a Newsdesk was established in 2000. This was one of the recommendations from the independent external consultants who carried out a review of the structure and operation of the press office in 1999. One of the benefits of has been that media calls to the press office are being answered within four rings 90 per cent of the time. Previously there were occasions when up to 40 per cent of media calls were lost.<P>

Information prior to 1996/97 was not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.<P>

<a name="30224w87.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Police-recorded crime statistics can not provide information on the proportion of violent crime where alcohol and/or illegal drug use are involved. The British Crime Survey (BCS) reports on the victim's perception of offenders in violent incidents. Violent crime measured by the BCS can be classified into four sub-groups: domestic, mugging, stranger and acquaintance violence. The following tables show the proportion of violent incidents in which victims felt that the offender/s was under the influence of drink or drugs, firstly for all violence reported to the survey and then separately for the breakdown by individual types of violence. It should be noted that sweeps of the BCS were not conducted in 1997 or 1999.

<a name="30224w88.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department currently allocates most capital funding for schools to local education authorities (LEAs) by needs-related formulae, and it is for authorities to assess and prioritise the capital needs of their school buildings through their asset management planning process, in consultation with local schools. Individual LEAs will therefore hold information on how much capital investment is being directed towards replacing classrooms in their area.
<P>

<a name="30224w88.html_para0">Central Government support for capital investment in school buildings in Somerset LEA totals &#163;15 million (including Voluntary Aided schools) in 2002&#150;03, rising to &#163;19.2 million in 2003&#150;04, with further allocations shortly to be announced. This forms part of the total capital investment for England of &#163;3 billion in 2002&#150;03, rising to over &#163;3.8 billion in 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> class sizes and <i>(b)</i> teacher retention in the London borough of Havering.  [94206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w88.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Over the last five years, average class sizes in maintained primary and secondary schools in Havering LEA have been very similar to the national average, as shown in the table. In September 2002, Havering achieved full compliance with infant class size legislation.
<P>

<a name="30224w88.html_para1">Retention of good quality teachers in Havering, as elsewhere, is a key priority and we are aware that some schools in some areas are still experiencing problems. However, the new National Agreement signed by the Department and its key partners will enable us to take forward our plans for remodelling the teaching profession. This in turn will address the key recruitment and retention issues of workload and bureaucracy. Taken together with our work on improving pupil behaviour and strengthening leadership within schools, we believe this will lead to a further increase in new teachers in London and elsewhere and encourage more existing teachers to remain in the profession.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 3 February, Official Report, column 87W, on examinations, what reasons he has researched as to why the costs were the same in 2001 and 2002; and how the costs relate to the number of pupils that took the tests in each year.  [97850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30224w88.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The cost given in my earlier reply for printing, distributing and marking the Year 7 progress tests in 2001 was incorrect. The correct figure is &#163;1.7 million, 300,000 more than the 2002 cost of &#163;1.4 million. The additional 300,000 in 2001 was due to higher marking costs because of the greater number of pupils entered in that year, and initial set-up costs in the first year of progress tests for the external marking agency.
<P>

<a name="30224w88.html_para4">In 2001, 79,458 pupils took the English Year 7 progress test and 94,351 the mathematics Year 7 progress test. In 2002, 61,827 took the English, and 76,221 the mathematics Year 7 progress tests.

 My Department's existing health and safety policy and procedures already incorporate many of the recommendations summarised in the ministerial checklist.

 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2003]:</i> We are reducing and will continue to reduce the burden of unnecessary red tape on further education colleges. We have already announced plans to reduce the number of separate budget lines for the Learning and Skills Council from 45 to five, and to consolidate targeted funds for pay and staff training into colleges' core funding, and to introduce three year funding for colleges, from this year.
<P>

<a name="30224w88.html_para5">The Government and the Learning and Skills Council are committed to implementing in full the recommendations of the Bureaucracy Busting Task Force, chaired by Sir George Sweeney, which reported in November 2002. In particular, we will establish powerful scrutiny arrangements to keep in check demands on colleges, remove the requirement for all colleges to have an annual external audit of their Individual Learner Records, and work across government agencies to avoid repeat requests to colleges for the same information.

<a name="30224w88.html_para6">We are determined to go further. In particular, we are working with the Inspectorates to introduce more co-ordinated inspection arrangements, for example for colleges providing both FE and HE, and lighter touch inspection arrangements for better performing colleges. We will also assess, in 2003, the regulation of FE institutions through a review of the Instrument and Articles of Government.

 Raising bonds to cover a delay in repayment times of student loans is not part of the policy set out in the White Paper. We decided not to pursue bonds as an option because the gains from a Government issue of bonds were not clear, and the cost of borrowing by higher education institutions (to fund the lending involved in a bonds option) would inevitably have been higher than borrowing by Government. Forecasts of Government net debt are published bi-annually in the pre-budget report and the financial statement and budget report.

 We said in the White Paper, The Future of Higher Education, that those with higher education qualifications earn around 50 per cent. more than non-graduates. Since graduates earn more than non-graduates, they also pay more tax. The amount of extra income tax they would pay over a working life will depend on how personal allowances, tax rates and thresholds change over time.
<P>

<a name="30224w88.html_para9">In drawing up the proposals in the White Paper, no specific estimates were made of the extra income tax that graduates would pay over their working lives compared to non-graduates. The underpinning analysis was based on the principle of balancing the contribution from the taxpayer with the contribution from the student, bearing in mind the substantial benefit which is derived from having a degree.

 Recent studies into the capital requirements of higher education institutions concluded that there was a need for some &#163;8 billion of investment in infrastructure. The Secretary of State receives regular confidential advice from the Higher Education Funding Council for England and others on the financial needs of the sector against the background of the 36 per cent. real terms fall in spending per higher education student between 1989 and 1997. The announcements made in the White Paper "The future of higher education" and in the annual grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England show the Government are increasing spending on higher education in England by an average of over 6 per cent. a year above inflation in the three years to 2005&#150;06.

These estimates are based on projected student numbers for English and Welsh domiciled students in UK Higher Education Institutions in 2001&#150;02. As numbers increase so would the cost of providing grants to a fixed percentage. The figures in the table assume that all students either the lowest 25 per cent. or 



10 per cent. qualify for the full amount of the grant and that those above these levels get no grant. In practice, means tested grants are almost always tapered out more gently above the threshold for entitlement of the full grant. This increases the costs.<P>

 My Department has funded a number of surveys of employers to assess their current and future skill needs. The Employers Skill Survey, funded by my Department, interviewed 27,000 employers across England in 1999 and in 2001, and was carried out on a smaller scale in 2002. The survey results provide evidence on trends in skill shortages, including headline measures at the level of local Learning and Skills Council boundaries.
<P>

<a name="30224w90.html_para1">The role of assessing detailed skill needs in regions and localities is the responsibility of Regional Development Agencies and the Learning and Skills Council respectively. However, the Employers Skill Survey 2001 showed that 2.1 per cent. of employers in Suffolk reported skill shortages compared to 3.7 per cent. across England as a whole.

The outcomes of the Review will form part of the Skills Strategy, to be published in June 2003. The Strategy will set out how different government programmes and policies will contribute to raising the skills of the population.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what recent representations he has received from learning providers about <i>(a)</i> the need for higher level IT skills and <i>(b)</i> the Government's policy on this issue.  [97965]<P>

<a name="30224w90.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 I have not received any significant representations from learning providers on the need for higher level skills in the Information Technology (IT) sector in recent months. However, we remain aware of their ongoing importance and committed to the policies we have introduced to meet these needs. Skills deficits in the sector have declined from their peak in 1999 when the Stevens report, "Skills for the Information Age" highlighted these issues. Since that time, an &#163;8 million programme of measures has been put in place to improve the image of the IT industry, build greater understanding of the labour market and strengthen links between education and industry.
<P>

<a name="30224w90.html_para2">Recent developments include establishing New Technology Institutes to provide high quality teaching facilities and progression routes into honours degrees, based on partnership between universities, colleges and employers. And currently, e-skills-UK are in the final stages of development to becoming the Sector Skills Council for the industry. They will provide a vital lead in articulating employers' requirements and helping to ensure there is high quality and relevant provision available.

be encouraged to meet the costs of learning at higher levels. The Review of Funding of Adult Learning&#151;the outcomes of which will feed into the Skills Strategy&#151;is currently considering ICT issues, including how ICT skills might be delivered, and how training to acquire those skills might be supported through funding.

<a name="30224w90.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Schools and local education authorities have duties under the Education Act 1996 to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with special educational needs, including those with autism. Provision for children with autism is made in mainstream schools with support; autism units attached to maintained schools; generic special schools; independent, non-maintained or maintained autism specialist schools or through home-based provision.
<P>

<a name="30224w90.html_para13">To help schools, local education authorities and others develop and audit appropriate provision, my Department, in partnership with the Department of Health, published good practice guidance on autistic spectrum disorders last year.

<i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> There are two types of student loan. Borrowers under the pre-1998&#150;99 scheme of mortgage style loans repay their loans direct to the Student Loans Company (SLC). Most borrowers under the current income-contingent loans scheme repay their loans through the tax system.
<P>

<a name="30224w91.html_para0">The SLC will spend around &#163;12 million in the 2002&#150;03 financial year on collecting repayments on mortgage style student loans not sold to the private sector, and on those income-contingent loans not collected by the Inland Revenue&#151;voluntary repayments and repayments from borrowers outside the UK. The Inland Revenue is expected to charge around &#163;1.9 million for collecting income-contingent loan repayments through the tax system in 2002&#150;03. These costs are shared between England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<P>

 Any university which wishes to charge variable fees will be required to have an Access Agreement which will be approved and monitored by the Access Regulator. The Regulator will monitor admission arrangements to ensure they promote fair access and will seek to extend current good practice through, for example, bursary schemes. The maximum fee will be capped in real terms for the duration of the next Parliament at &#163;3,000. Additionally no student or family will have to pay fees before or while they are studying. Students will be able to defer their fees as for the current maintenance loans. No interest above inflation will be charged on either loans for maintenance or fees, and the threshold at which repayment starts will be raised to &#163;15,000 to make repayment easier for everyone. Students from low income backgrounds will be eligible to have up to &#163;1,100 of their fees paid, and student grants of &#163;1,000 will also be introduced for those from low income families.

<P>

<a name="30224w92.html_para7">The NCRI's first strategic analysis, which was published in October 2002, was an overview of the &#163;257 million a year of cancer research in the United Kingdom that is directly funded by the NCRI's fifteen partner organisations. This analysis showed an apparently small investment&#151;2 per cent.&#151;in research into cancer prevention. But this category only included research aimed at the direct application of strategies to prevent cancer, and several other facets that inform preventive strategies are covered by other categories, such as aetiology, which includes diet.
<P>

<a name="30224w92.html_para8">The real investment in research relevant to future cancer prevention strategies was therefore larger than 2 per cent., but was still relatively low. The NCRI partner organisations agreed that the scale of research into cancer risk would benefit from closer joint examination. The NCRI has established a strategic planning group to carry out a much more detailed analysis of the research activity in this area, to discuss any potential opportunities and to identify any further action necessary.

 <i>[holding answers 12 February2003]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Minister of State met the President and Chief Executive of the Health Professionals Council (HPC) on 4 December 2002, at which meeting all aspects of the HPC's proposals were discussed.
<P>

<a name="30224w93.html_para3">The HPC consulted about which titles should be protected by law and has undertaken extensive market research to understand the public's perception of titles currently in use by healthcare professionals. The HPC's decision to propose the protection of both chiropodist and podiatrist reflects the general perception that these titles are used interchangeably. The titles indicate that those registered have met HPCs standards of competence. All applicants for registration will be expected to meet standards of proficiency, whether they are applying through the transitional arrangements, as international applicants or as UK applicants who have completed an approved course.
<P>

<a name="30224w93.html_para4">The HPC proposes using subsections of the register to distinguish between modalities of care but believes that to distinguish between skill levels would be confusing and unnecessary. The HPC has no plans to introduce a sub-register for those practitioners who do not meet the Council's standards of proficiency and who would not therefore be able to use the protected titles. Ultimately, it is for the HPC to propose and the Privy Council to determine the protected titles that will be associated with parts and subsections of the Health Professions Register.

Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) data<P>

Information is not available about prescribing specifically in care homes.<P>

The Government are aware of concerns about the possibility of inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medication in care homes and of the results of a recent survey on this issue. A number of developments should help ensure that antipsychotic medication is used only when appropriate. In particular, implementation of the medicines management supplement of the older people's national service framework and the requirements in the care homes national minimum standards around management of medication should ensure that any problems are picked up.<P>

 A central budget of &#163;50 million per annum for the year 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 has been set up for specialist palliative care. This ensures that the pledge in the NHS Cancer Plan of an additional &#163;50 million per annum by 2004 is met. South Tyneside Primary Care Trust (PCT) has provisionally been allocated &#163;173,000.
<P>

<a name="30224w96.html_para1">Before any allocations can be made from the central budget, the agreed cancer network plans will need to be approved by the strategic health authority&#151;which will oversee the process and retain its monitoring role&#151;and then be submitted to and approved by the National Partnership Group.
<P>

<a name="30224w96.html_para2">The National Partnership Group is chaired by Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director. It includes representatives from all levels of the National Health Service and a wide range of voluntary organisations. Network plans must be submitted to the National Partnership Group by 31 March at the latest and the group will approve plans as soon as possible after that. Allocations will be made as soon as plans are approved. The &#163;50 million is to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and to enable the NHS to make a realistic contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service. The money is for specialist palliative care services in their entirety and not for voluntary hospices alone although, as they play an essential role and provide two thirds of all specialist palliative care, it is reasonable to expect they will get a fair slice of this extra money. Information about this process, about the criteria and of the provisional allocation for each PCT has been placed in the Library and is available on the Department of Health's website at www.doh.qov.uk/cancer/palliative 03 06.htm.

 We do not collect routinely information on stroke services at the level of detail requested in these questions. The most comprehensive source of information is the National Sentinel Stroke Audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the National Health Service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at

<a name="30224w98.html_para1">The audit contains information covering discharge arrangements, and clinical assessments including swallowing assessments and visual fields. The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts who participated had a stroke unit, compared to 56 per cent, three years earlier. In addition, 83 per cent, of patients receive brain imaging&#151;the highest ever level. The audit shows that 80 per cent, of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services. While it is recognised that some services need to increase their capacity, the audit notes that very significant improvements have already been made.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para2">Our major vehicle for further improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF), which sets specific milestones for improvement by 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts (PCTs), specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, Improvement, Expansion and Reform, which sets for the NHS a priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;6, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para3">We monitor progress against the key milestones in the NSF. From the information gathered so far, we know that 83 per cent, of the hospitals who have replied now have plans to have a specialist stroke service in place by April 2004.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para4">Under the NSF, PCTs will need to ensure that every general practice can identify and treat patients identified as being at risk of stroke because of high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation or other risk factors by April 2004. To help ensure that the treatment they receive is of a consistent standard, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence is developing guidelines for the management of hypertension in primary care. The Institute's report is expected next year.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para5">Implementation of the NSF for older people is leading to real improvements in stroke services and making a difference to people's lives. The development of better services and improved standards in stroke care requires the right balance between national standards, provided by the NSF, national clinical guidelines and local control. It will be important to ensure that stroke care services are co-ordinated and fully integrated within a full range of other relevant local services.

 There is at present no system of licensing for retailers of tobacco products.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para6">There is a Tobacco Enforcement Protocol (published in March 1998) aimed at assisting local authorities with regard to the enforcement legislation to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors. The Department of Health has sponsored an initiative over the last year to improve the awareness and training of trading standards officers and enforcement officers of local authorities involved in this work. This has been done in co-operation with the Trading Standards Institute (TSI) and the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made with renewal of NHS trusts' vehicle fleets on a lower emission basis, broken down by volume and percentage for each category of vehicle, type of power unit and/or type of fuel, in each of the last three years.  [96593]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 10 February 2003]:</i> Reducing vehicle emissions is a key transport issue, which has been agreed as a priority across Government. Against a baseline year of 2002&#150;03, all Departments are aiming by 31 March 2006 to reduce road transport vehicle carbon dioxide emissions by at least 10 per cent, and requiring at least 10 per cent, of all fleet cars to be alternatively fuelled.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para7">Progress against these targets will be reported in the Sustainable Development in Government annual reports. The first full report against the Framework will be in 2003, reporting against the baseline year of 2002&#150;2003.
<P>

<a name="30224w98.html_para8">The National Health Service has a vehicle fleet of more than 40,000 vehicles but information in the format requested is currently not available.
