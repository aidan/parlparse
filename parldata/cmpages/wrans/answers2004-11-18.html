 To ask the hon. Member for Gosport, representing the Speaker&#039;s Committee on the Electoral Commission how much money the Electoral Commission is spending on encouraging <i>(a)</i> young people and <i>(b)</i> people who are living abroad to vote. [198640]</p>









<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41118w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 The Electoral Commission has a duty to promote public awareness of current electoral systems in the United Kingdom. The chairman has informed me that, in pursuance of this, the commission has an ongoing programme of awareness raising activity. Within this, it has allocated about &#163;705,000 in the current financial year specifically to measures aimed at raising levels of awareness among young people, principally through its Outreach programme. The commission&#039;s activity in relation to overseas voters this year focuses on measures aimed at reminding them of their electoral rights. The commission expects to spend about &#163;9,000 on this work in the current financial year. All figures include estimated staff costs.

 The Commission has no plans to appoint hon. Members to the Board of Management. The board, which is composed of the most senior management of the House of Commons Service, operates on the basis of an Instrument of Delegation from the Commission, which retains responsibility for setting strategy and taking major decisions. The board&#039;s primary function is to co-ordinate and oversee the provision of services to the House of Commons and to advise the Commission and the Finance and Services Committee on these matters. In addition, the Administration Estimate Audit Committee, comprised of two members of the Commission and two external members, has among its functions the encouragement of best financial practice, use of resources and governance in the House administration.

Notes:<br>

These figures must be interpreted carefully and do not represent personal earnings in one year. There are a number of reasons for this.<br>

1. Payments received in one year simply represent turnover in that year. Cases may well have lasted more than one year and overall earnings may be increased by one exceptional case lasting a number of years for which payment was received in that year.<br>

2. In most cases the figures are inclusive of VAT (17.5 per cent.) and disbursements incurred ( e.g. travelling).<br>

3. Barristers will typically pay 25&#150;30 per cent. of fees in professional expenses. Additionally, barristers face the same expenses as any other self employed person, including the cost of pension provisions, medical and life insurance etc.<br>

A number of other qualifications need to be added to these figures.<br>

1. While these figures represent gross payments actually made to the barristers during the year, some of those monies have been (or may in the future be) repaid to the Community Legal Service Fund by other parties. This will happen in cases where the legally aided 



party wins the case and recovers costs from the opponent. Once those costs are recovered the legally aided party&#039;s solicitor refunds some or all of the money to the CLS Fund. As a consequence the figures may not reflect the net cost of the barristers&#039; fees to the Fund. In some cases where costs are recovered from the losing party the actual cost to the CLS Fund may be very little or even nothing.<br>

2. Not all payments could be verified with all the individuals concerned. Cases in dispute, where amounts listed as being paid to individual barristers were identified from records held by the Department and the Legal Services Commission and the practitioner has no such record, have been included. Where possible, amounts have been verified by practitioners and adjusted where necessary. <br>

For example, a series of roadshows on FOI have been held across the country over the past two years. A comprehensive Model Action Plan and a Training Plan, offering suggestions on good preparation for implementation and suggestions for effective training on FOI, were issued across the public sector. More recently, my Department has delivered FOI presentations to local authority discussion groups. These presentations have been an opportunity to encourage local authorities to cascade information and key messages about FOI and have stressed the importance of support from senior management in handling requests. Local authorities also have access to a comprehensive FOI website. This includes a portfolio of guidance on how to apply the Act and it will be revised and maintained in line with legal and policy developments.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="41118w10.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 DFID is guided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on this subject. The WHO has indicated a shortfall in global supplies of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), the most effective medicines available to treat drug resistant malaria, until March 2005. The shortfall is caused by a recent four-fold increase in demand as more countries adopt ACT as first line treatment. 40 countries, 20 in Africa, have adopted ACT since 2001.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w10.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_61">The rapid increase in demand has created temporary pressure on availability in the market. There is insufficient supply of the key ingredient, artemether, from largely, its Chinese suppliers. Artemether is derived from artemisinin, a raw material extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. Chinese suppliers are scaling up production and efforts are underway to cultivate the plant in East Africa however cultivation requires a minimum of six months with extraction, processing and manufacturing of the final product requiring an additional three to five months. The UK and other agencies have encouraged the Chinese authorities to support cultivation in Africa through providing seed stocks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_62">The WHO is recommending that all countries facing shortages increase procurement of their second-line anti-malarial treatment, which is generally quinine. The WHO will provide technical assistance to any country facing interrupted supply of ACT and will provide regular information on expected quantities available, and delivery schedules. The WHO will also establish a system to prioritize between requests for ACT. A number of countries are in the process of changing drugs policies and are likely to put plans on hold temporarily.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w10.html_para2">

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="41118w12.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Since the issue of PPG12 in 1992, there has been an expectation that each English region should have up-to-date regional planning guidance in which the regional planning body would have an important role in preparing. That role is currently discharged by regional chambers, established following the Regional Development Agencies Act (1998). It would be very regrettable if a regional chamber were dissolved and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister see no reason why this should happen. But under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, 2004, the regional planning body does not have to be the regional chamber and regional planning procedures are not dependent on there being regional chambers. The Act provides for a regional planning body to be recognised by the Secretary of State my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, and for at least 60 per cent. of the members of that body to be members of local authorities, National Park Authorities and, where relevant, the Broads Authority.

 Actual job creation is achieved through businesses employing more people and for this reason, Invest NI&#039;s Corporate Plan 2002&#150;05 and its Public Service Agreement targets do not include specific job creation targets. There are, however, targets for a range of other objectives, including the number of new business starts, business development projects, and new inward investment projects secured.

<a name="41118w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_122">Not all investments involve potential new jobs, but where they do, Invest NI practice is to refer to jobs promoted as such job numbers can be quantified at the negotiation stage as being an anticipated requirement of the project. Since negotiations with companies are 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1766W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
ongoing throughout the year, it is not Invest NI&#039;s practice to report progress on an in-year basis although comprehensive performance figures are provided at the end of each financial year. However, in relation specifically to those projects which have been publicly announced during the year to date, 311 new jobs have been promoted, representing total investment of over &#163;4 million.

<a name="41118w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_123">Invest NI continues to focus its sales and marketing efforts on aggressively promoting Northern Ireland as an attractive and viable location for inward investment opportunities. It is difficult to predict in advance the nature of new projects and the needs of those promoting such projects, but the type of projects likely to locate in the north west will tend to be from those sectors where there are obvious clusters and strengths, such as ICT and call centres.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w19.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_124">Working with existing overseas investors in a region is a key function of Invest NI, and I am encouraged by the reinvestment earlier this year at Limavady by Huco Lightronic of Germany, promoting an additional 24 jobs.

When appropriate, the Limavady area will be included.

 The Solemn Declaration on European Union of 1983 was signed by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the name of the UK Government. It was a non-binding commitment of the then 10 member states to reform the Community&#039;s institutions and to develop its policies in many areas. Much of it has since been implemented through the successive stages of evolution of the EU, through three further waves of accession, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice. The EU Constitutional Treaty would consolidate this process of reform.

 We remain seriously concerned by the absence of democracy in Turkmenistan. Parliamentary elections have been scheduled for 19 December. However, although the Turkmen authorities have announced each seat will be contested by more than one candidate, Turkmenistan remains a one-party state. We believe that there is no prospect that the December elections will meet even minimal democratic standards.

<a name="41118w29.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_171">Turkmenistan has substantial reserves of natural gas and oil deposits. However, there are reasons to doubt whether this will underpin successful long-term economic development. Firstly, most of its gas exports have traditionally gone to countries in the former Soviet Union like Ukraine which pay well below world market prices. Secondly, there is little evidence that the revenues generated by the energy sector are effectively invested in areas&#151;such as health and education&#151;which would provide a basis for continuing growth prospects in the future. The distribution of wealth is very uneven; poverty is rife while the large profits of the energy sector are shared between a relatively small section of the population.

<a name="stpa_172">There has been little economic reform and no agreement concluded with the IMF. The Turkmen economy is highly reliant on the production of energy and cotton.

 Since the publication of the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cm 5206) in July 2001, the Department has undertaken a very extensive programme of consultations with interested bodies about options and proposals for changes to gambling law in Great Britain. There have been two formal public consultations, the first on the Review Body&#039;s report and the second on the draft clauses published for pre-legislative scrutiny in November 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w30.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_179">In addition to these consultations the relevant Government Departments have corresponded with and met individual companies (including those who have expressed an interest in trading in Great Britain as well as those already doing so), trade associations, charities and other bodies concerned with problem gambling or who benefit from lotteries, local authorities, trade unions, law enforcement agencies, academics and many other bodies and individuals, including members of the public, with an interest. These contacts, designed to ensure that the Government&#039;s policy proposals are sound and take full account of all relevant benefits, costs and risks, have involved both Ministers and officials. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Code and the Civil Service Code.

 None. Analogue cable television is not affected by digital switchover and the extent to which operators convert their networks to digital is a commercial decision for them.

Human Rights Watch reported at the time that the International Committee of the Red Cross had found at least 30 locations in Basrah, which contained abandoned munitions.

 The 1961 United Kingdom/United States General Security Agreement concerns the protection of any classified information exchanged between the parties and not just defence information. As the UK National Security Authority the Cabinet Office is the ultimate UK authority for this Agreement. Amendments were made to this Agreement on 5 July and 19 December 1983. In April 1984 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the US Department of Defense (DoD) negotiated a supplement to the Agreement covering an industrial security annex. This annex was reviewed and replaced last year when a new Security Implementing Arrangement for operations between the MoD and the DoD was signed on 27 January 2003. Information received by UK Government Departments under the 1961 Agreement is normally transmitted through Government channels and falls under the responsibility of the respective departmental security officer. Each UK Government Department has available to it guidance governing the handling of sensitive material generally, including that which is issued by international organisations or governed by international Agreements.

Our analysis suggests that by 2030, the development of a new close parallel runway, assuming a -14 dBA technology improvement, would reduce the number of people affected within the 63 dBA 16 hour Leq contour by 300 with an increase of 200 people affected at the 69 dBA 16 hour Leq contour.

 The Strategic Rail Authority operates a number of regimes which make incentive payments or impose penalties to train operating companies (TOCs). These regimes are for punctuality/reliability of services, provision of rolling stock formations as timetabled to meet demand and changes to planned timetables.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_238">For punctuality/reliability the punctuality incentive payment (PIP) regime measures performance of peak London commuter services and regional and rural services against an historical benchmark of annual average performance. For the provision of rolling stock, the short formation incentive payment (SFEP) applies to operators providing peak services into London and some other cities where penalties are applied if the operator does not deliver the train plan for capacity. For changes to the planned timetable, the timetable change incentive payment (TCDP) provides an incentive for provision of timely notification of timetable changes to minimise the disruption to passengers. Net payments/penalties to TOCs are shown in the SRA&#039;s National Rail Trends Yearbook, which has been placed in the Library of the House.

<i>[holding answer 26 October 2004]:</i> The Department has no plans to put a transitional protection scheme into place for this group of families at this time. Our latest estimate is that with 900,000 families remaining to be transferred to child tax credit, fewer than 200 will see a net reduction in their overall income as a result of the interaction with council tax benefit, mostly by no more than a few pence per week. In contrast, more than 75 per cent. of families who move off benefit as a result of claiming CTC will gain by &#163;20 a week or more. Nevertheless, we have issued a reminder to local authorities of their powers to consider an award of a discretionary housing payment to affected families where appropriate. Discretionary housing payments are designed for circumstances where there is a shortfall between HB/CTB entitlement and liability.

Information about the former ES estate prior to this date is not available.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup> PRIME space is occupied under the terms of the PRIME PFI contract and includes space occupied by other Government Departments (OGDs) within DWP buildings.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Information about floor area is held at departmental level only. Information about the space occupied (not net internal area of buildings) by each of the Department&#039;s agencies is currently being gathered and should be available early in the new year.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup> The overall facilities price (FP) paid is shown. Details of annual rental value are not available as the PRIME PFI procured serviced accommodation as a global price, customised by building, and it is not possible now to extract a separate price for each traditional element covered by the FP. Rent in Non PRIME space is paid directly by the Department&#039;s businesses to OGDs and the information is not recorded centrally, although the overall FP recorded above does include the cost of facilities management services delivered through the PRIME contract to Non PRIME building occupants.<br>

They are also getting about six times as many people to take up further help to get back to work, and there are positive and encouraging indications of an increase in flows off incapacity benefit in comparison to both last year and to non-pilot areas.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_262">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the delivery of the Working Neighbourhoods pilot in Knowsley and the issue of Crisis Loan processing. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_263">It may be helpful if I explain how the overall funding has been distributed for the pilot. The Employment Development & Modernisation Fund provided &#163;77m for the 12 pilot sites operating in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country for the period 2004/05 to 2005/06. Of this, &#163;5m was allocated for set up and evaluation costs. Of the remaining &#163;72m, each pilot site will receive &#163;3m per year of which &#163;1m is discretionary funding to allow personal advisers, working with Local Strategic Partnerships, the flexibility to meet individual and community needs.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_264">The Working Neighbourhood pilot for Knowsley delivers to selected parts of the Northwood and Towerhill wards. The postcode boundary for the site contains around 6,000 residents, with approximately 2,000 in receipt of working age benefits.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_265">The most recent statistics produced for 31 October 2004 indicate the Knowsley pilot has engaged with 879 customers of which 188 are volunteers to the programme.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_266">With regard to the pilot&#039;s targets, there will be overall monitoring of performance and objectives which will then be evaluated. The evaluation of the objectives aims to test the extent to which the programme of local intensive work focussed action is effective in addressing long-standing barriers to work experienced by residents of deprived areas; the number of individuals moving into work and by how much it decreases the overall workless rate within the pilot area.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_267">Whilst Jobcentre Plus job entry targets relate to movement into full time employment all who enter full time, part time and voluntary employment will count as successes for evaluation of the pilot.

Notes:<br>

1. The first three Pathways to Work pilots commenced on 27 October 2003.<br>

2. Work Focused Interviews should take place at around eight weeks after the start of the benefit claim. This means that majority of benefits starts in July and August will not be included in the data.<br>

3. Initial Work Focused Interviews attended refers to the actual number of Work Focused Interviews that have taken place. Some individuals will have attended more than one Work Focused Interview. These will be people who have started more than one benefit spell since 27 October 2003.<br>

4. Job starts: This includes all recorded job entries plus Return to Work Credit (RTWC) awards for which no job entry is yet recorded. (By definition, an RTWC award must indicate that a job entry has occurred).<br>

5. The total number of job entries in the first three pilot areas is higher than that recorded in the table. This table excludes job entries achieved with existing clients who had already started to claim benefit before 27 October 2003 and those not required to have a work-focused interview.<br>

6. Job starts figures include job starts achieved through referral to New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) job brokers.<br>

7. The job starts figures represent all job starts that have occurred subsequent to an initial Work Focused Interview within the same benefit spell.<br>

8. Referred to Condition Management Programme: this represents all Condition Management Programme referrals that have occurred subsequent to an initial Work Focused Interview within the same benefit spell.<br>

9. New Deal for Disabled People referrals: The data provided is all NDDP broker registrations plus referrals to NDDP brokers that have not yet resulted in a registration. This represents all NDDP referrals that have occurred subsequent to an initial Work Focused Interview within the same benefit spell.<br>

<p><a name="qn_753"><a name="41118w69.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measurable progress her Department has made towards meeting its Public Service Agreement target <i>(a)</i> to raise the rate of UK productivity growth over the economic cycle, <i>(b)</i> to improve UK competitiveness and <i>(c)</i> to narrow the productivity gap with the US, France and Germany.  [198509]</p>








<p><a name="st_748"><a name="41118w69.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 HM Treasury estimates set out in Budget 2004 show that the trend rate of underlying productivity growth has increased from 2.22 per cent. per annum between 1986 Q2 and 1997H1 to 2.65 per cent. per annum between 1997H1 and 2001 Q3. Trend productivity growth is projected to be 2.35 per cent. per annum between 2001 Q4 and 2006 Q4.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w69.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_393">Data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) published in autumn 2004 shows that, on the output per hour worked measure, the UK has narrowed the gap with Germany since 2000 but a sizeable productivity gap with the US, France and Germany remains. On the output per worker measure, the UK&#039;s productivity gap with the US, France and Germany is broadly unchanged, though the UK is as productive as Germany on this measure. Comparisons are relative to a 2000 base year when all four countries were at a similar point in their economic cycles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118w69.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_394">However, it takes time to raise competitiveness and increase productivity. Consequently, in assessing progress towards raising productivity, it is reasonable to look for changes in the drivers of productivity. The Government have identified &quot;five drivers&quot; of productivity&#151;investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competition&#151; and has monitored performance on a range of productivity and competitiveness indicators underlying these drivers since 1999. Some progress has been made on all five of these &quot;high-level&quot; drivers. In particular, there have been improvements in the competition regime, evidence of rising skills levels across the workforce and improvements in the UK&#039;s world-class science base. The Government are continuing to invest in these areas through the Skills Strategy, the Innovation Report and DTI&#039;s Five Year Programme.

 Operation of the urban reinvention programme, including consideration of applications from subpostmasters for investment grant funding, is a matter for Post Office Ltd. The Department has not imposed a timetable for the use of this funding. It was always anticipated that there would be some time lag between closure decisions being announced and take up of investment grant funding. Post Office Ltd is now beginning to see take up of this increase and expects further increases as the restructuring of the network continues and subpostmasters become more confident about their future prospects. Post Office Ltd has devoted additional resources to establish a separate team dedicated to promoting and supervising the implementation of investment required to upgrade remaining offices and fully expects to utilise the &#163;30 million available. To date, the DTI has paid &#163;5,448,897 to Post Office Ltd under the urban reinvention programme for investment grant funding.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1944W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="st_758"><a name="41118w69.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Ministers and officials of the Department meet frequently with Post Office Ltd to discuss a wide range of post office issues. The classification of a post office branch as urban or rural is an operational matter for Post Office Ltd. The broad definition of &#039;rural&#039; used by the Post Office applies to communities of up to 10,000 people, the Countryside Agency definition. The company has carried out detailed planning to establish which of its branches serve either rural or urban areas and has specially developed a sophisticated geographical mapping computer model, which measures population in terms of contiguous or very close agglomeration. Thus where a number of villages or small communities adjoin each other or adjoin a larger town, and the aggregate population of the area exceeds 10,000, the model reflects that fact and classifies it as urban. Post Office Ltd has adopted a consistent approach nationally to classifying the entire post office network.

<i>[holding answer 9 November 2004]:</i> We know there are differences in health outcomes for different socio-economic groups. However, we are aware that people diagnosed with cancer in deprived areas suffer from higher mortality rates than those in wealthier areas. We have recently announced a new public service agreement which includes a target from April 2005 to achieve a reduction in the inequalities gap of at least 6 per cent. in cancer mortality between the fifth of areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators and the population as a whole by 2010. We will work with organisations in deprived areas to see what interventions can help reduce inequalities in treatments and outcomes. We envisage this will probably be achieved through a range of measures including reducing smoking prevalence, tackling obesity, improving screening coverage, including bowel cancer screening, and ensuring that patients with symptoms that could be cancer present earlier to their general practitioner.

Notes:<br>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

3. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4. Grossing<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

 The Mental Health Act 1983 provides for people who appear to be suffering from mental disorder to be removed to a place of safety in certain circumstances. For these purposes, a place of safety includes residential accommodation provided by a local social services authority, a hospital, a police station, an independent hospital or care home for mentally disordered persons, or any other suitable place whose occupier is willing temporarily to receive the patient. The identification of preferred places of safety is a matter for local agreement. The Department does not maintain records of these places.

In the next year, NHS organisations that overspent should make a surplus in order to ensure that other bodies can utilise the underspends from the previous year.

<p><a name="st_895"><a name="41118w82.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We anticipate that for the majority of existing radiographers the effect of &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; will be an increase in their rate of pay. Under &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, there will be a phased move to a standard working week for all full-time national health service staff of 37.5 hours per week. In the case of radiographers, this will mean an increase in their current weekly hours from 35 to 37.5. The changes for radiographers will be phased in over seven years, with no change at all for the first four years.

The figures relate to activity by UK fishing vessels over 10 m in length. They represent the average levels over the year, and there is considerable variability seen between individual vessels and individual months of the year.

<a name="stpa_552">Illegal persecution constrains populations sizes and distribution. The population of hen harrier is now at a level which jeopardises the continued existence of the species in England. However other species are in the process of recovering former distribution and population size, apparently as a consequence of recent lessening of levels of illegal persecution directed at them. Thus the Buzzard currently appears to be re-establishing its former range in lowland Britain.

<a name="stpa_553">The population status of birds of prey is affected not only by their legal status, but also by a range of other factors some of which are under different forms of legislative or policy regulation. Thus in recent decades the populations of Peregrine and Sparrowhawk have been recovering their former distributions and numbers as a consequence of progressive legal restrictions on the use of persistent organo-chlorine pesticides formerly used in agriculture, leading to the ultimate banning of the use of DOT in 1986.

<a name="stpa_554">Land-use changes (many of which are under legislative or policy control), such as open-ground afforestation, have affected UK raptor populations in a range of ways&#151;and have had different impacts consequent on species&#039; different ecological requirements.

 The sewage collection system serving London is comprised largely of combined systems which collect and transport for treatment both domestic and industrial waste water, and rainwater run-off. As sewers and sewage treatment works have a maximum capacity, it is a design feature of combined systems to have overflows which discharge in some wet weather conditions to prevent sewers from flooding, and sewage treatment works from being overloaded. Therefore, although we hope the environmental effects of the sewage discharge in early August aren&#039;t repeated, the overflows will continue to operate during some wet weather conditions.

 None; under Section 9(2) of the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 a waste disposal authority (WDA) automatically becomes liable for a (financial) penalty if the amount of biodegradable municipal waste it sends to landfill in any one scheme year exceeds the amount authorised by the number of landfill allowances it holds for that year. Before that position is reached, however, a WDA will be able to trade or borrow allowances in a six month reconciliation period that follows the end of a scheme year, in order to balance its books. Alternatively, a WDA can make a case to the Secretary of State for her to use her powers to waive a penalty if the reason for the breach was beyond its control.

<a name="stpa_578">The Prime Minister&#039;s pledge to reduce by a half the number of applications by September 2003 (using a baseline of October 2002) has been achieved. A range of initiatives has contributed to this success, including the introduction of juxtaposed controls, the deployment of New Detection Technology in France and Belgium, an informed and robust visa strategy, a network of airline liaison officers and close co-operation with carriers, port authorities and our EU colleagues.

<a name="stpa_588">The Commission does not divide applications into urgent and non-urgent. Applications that require no more than five days case work are allocated for review as soon as all the necessary papers are to hand and these account for 51 per cent. of applications. A further 31 per cent. of applications are dealt with on a largely administrative basis, usually because the applicant has yet to exhaust the normal appeals process.

<a name="stpa_589">The remaining applications (18 per cent.) are placed in a queue, distinguishing between those in custody, which have priority and those at liberty. Within those cases awaiting allocation, a small number are accorded priority over others for particular reasons such as age, state of health, deterioration of evidence, witness availability and public interest. Such cases are allocated without delay. This practice continues. At 31 March 2004, the maximum delay before allocation to a caseworker was one year for in custody cases and two years for those at liberty.

The budgets for 2005&#150;06 have yet to be delegated and that for the Commission will have to be set in the light of competing priorities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to protect children from paedophiles operating on the internet.  [198191]</p>

 The Government is determined to ensure that children are protected from the insidious use of the internet by paedophiles.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Nov 2004 : Column 2074W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118104.html_para0">
In 2001 The Home Secretary&#039;s Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet was established, with the aim of making the UK the best and safest place in the world for children to use the internet, and to help protect children the world over from abuse fuelled by criminal misuse of new technologies. Much good work has been initiated through the Task Force to assist in working towards these objectives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118104.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_600">The Task Force has recently launched its fourth national awareness campaign to help keep children safe on the internet, and Government has spent over &#163;3 million on the development of these campaigns. We have also provided guidance for young people, as well as parents and carers. In 2003 the Task Force developed and published models of good practice for providers of chat, instant messaging and web services, the first of their kind in the world. These encourage clear and accessible safety messages, advice and user-friendly ways of reporting abuse. The Task Force is currently reviewing these models. This year, following discussions with the Task Force, the UK mobile operators published a self-regulatory Code of Practice for new forms of content on mobile phone services, and furthermore a Code of Practice has also been developed by the mobile operators on passive location based services. We have also been working with industry to look at the issues which are raised by moderation in interactive services (such as chat rooms), and a draft good practice model for companies offering such moderation is nearing completion. These are just some of the examples of the work of the Task Force in seeking to protect children online.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118104.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_601">The Government is also ensuring that legislation provides an adequate deterrent to those who might consider doing harm to children. The Sexual Offences Act introduced a new criminal offence, developed by the Task Force, to tackle the &quot;grooming&quot; of children by paedophiles online or offline. The Act also included the creation of a Risk of Sexual Harm Order which relates to behaviour towards a child for an illegal or harmful sexual purpose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118104.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_602">Law enforcement agencies in the UK are at the cutting edge of developing new techniques to detect and combat paedophile activity on the internet. We fully support effective intelligence-led policing to help forces effectively investigate paedophiles using the internet. In addition the Home Office is also considering with the Association of Chief Police Officers as part of the police reform agenda, how crimes which by their nature are not confined to geographical force areas, such as online paedophilia, are best dealt with within force structures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118104.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_603">The Government is also aware that child abuse on line is an international problem that can only be combated through effective international co-operation. We continue to work within international fora to encourage practical and other measures to remove images of child abuse wherever they are hosted, and to increase child safety online.

Open prisons give prisoners the opportunity to find permanent employment, reintegrate into the community, restore family ties, and find suitable long-term accommodation where necessary.

 The Academies Programme is not governed by an application process, nor does it involve a simple change of status for existing schools. Academies are a completely different type of institution&#151;independent charitable companies&#151;which replace poorly performing schools in disadvantaged areas. This process involves the statutory closure of any predecessor schools and the creation of a completely new school, with a new ethos, governance and organisational structure and, in most cases, new buildings.

<p>
<a name="41118112.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_641">It is, therefore, possible for any school which meets these criteria to be closed and for an academy to open in its place. However, there are some technical issues around the closure of PFI schools, particularly those which are part of a larger PFI package, which may make their replacement by an academy impractical.

However, the impact will vary depending on the area, and pilot areas such as Stoke-on-Trent will have experienced much of this impact already. We estimate that around 1,400 16-year-olds in full time education in Stoke-on-Trent are eligible on income grounds for EMA.

<a name="stpa_671">Skills for Life, the national strategy for improving adult literacy, language and numeracy skills, was launched in March 2001. It aims to help create a society where adults have the basic skills they need to find and keep work and participate fully in society, thereby increasing the economic performance and social cohesion of the country. So far we estimate that 550,000 adults achieved a qualification in literacy, language or numeracy and current projections show that we are on track to meet the target of 750,000 achievements by July 2004. In terms of participation, it is estimated that 2.3 million learners will have taken up 4.7 million learning opportunities between April 2001 and July 2004. Staffordshire has a Basic Skills Strategy Group with representation from all key partners including colleges, work-base learning providers, Job Centre Plus, probation, voluntary and community sector and the LSC. The partnership is working to improve levels of literacy, numeracy and language across the area.

This is a different definition to the Department&#039;s main measures of HE participation: the Age Participation Index (API), which measures the proportion of UK domiciled students who enter full-time HE by the age of 20, and the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR) which measures the proportion of 17&#150;30 year old English domiciled first time entrants to full or part-time HE. Neither the API nor the HEIPR are calculated for each LEA, because of the lack of detailed data at local authority level.

 The Integrated Children&#039;s System (ICS) is derived from the social services functions under the Children Act 1989 and the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000.

It announced a capital grant of &#163;10 million to support the development of information technology systems for children&#039;s social services. The &#163;10 million is the first tranche of a total grant of &#163;30 million payable in 2004/05 and 2005/06.

<p>
<a name="41118118.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_689">LAC(2004)22 provided more detailed guidance. It required the grant to be spent on building the information technology systems required to support the implementation of the Integrated Children&#039;s System (ICS). This grant is therefore primarily concerned with enabling staff to record and manage electronically case record information about children being served in the context of the Children Act 1989. The Integrated Children&#039;s System (ICS) will be quite different from the information database(s). The ICS is a national framework for Councils with Social Services Responsibilities&#039; (CSSRs&#039;) to help them work with children in need and their families. It provides a single approach for assessment, planning, intervention and reviewing based on an understanding of children&#039;s developmental needs in the context of their families and communities. It is signed to improve outcomes for children in need. The information gathered in the course of working with children and their families must be recorded by social services. These records have traditionally been paper-based but a growing number of councils have electronic record keeping systems in place. As part of implementing the integrated children&#039;s system, social service records will all be kept electronically, replacing paper-based systems. The ICS is simply a better way to maintain and meet existing record keeping requirements and, therefore, requires no legislative provision.

The FSS formula is used for this purpose. This grant is in addition to the Capital Grant for Improving Information Management supporting Information for Social Care described in Local Authority Circular LAC(2003)17. &#163;25 million was paid in 2003&#150;04 to CSSRs for the purposes of the developmental, improvement or acquisition of systems for improving information management.

recommendations made in Lord Laming&#039;s report and the Joint Chief Inspectors&#039; Report, &quot;Safeguarding Children&quot;.

<a name="stpa_693">It is for local authorities to decide how best to provide support and services for all children in need in its area. There is no current specific earmarked funding for services; instead, Government funding is allocated to councils with social services responsibilities on the basis of the needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each body&#039;s target fair share of available resources. It is, therefore, for councils, working in partnership with relevant local stakeholders, to determine their spending priorities on the basis of local needs.

<p><a name="st_1354"><a name="41118118.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The IT system, to support the use of Integrated Children&#039;s System (ICS), will enable councils with social services responsibilities to hold information electronically about children in need who are in receipt of their services. It will contain information gathered in the course of working with children and their families, which has been recorded by social services. These records have traditionally been paper-based but a growing number of councils have electronic record keeping systems in place. As part of implementing the ICS, social service records will all be kept electronically, replacing paper-based systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118118.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_694">The legislation on access to personal information held by social services departments is the same for paper-based and electronically kept case records.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118118.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_695">The Access to Personal Files Act 1987 gave people the general right to see social work records which related to them produced after 1987. The Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998, which came into force on 1 March 2000, enhances these rights and abolishes the time limit. Any living person, who is the subject of personal information held and processed by a social services authority, has the right of access to those records. The right of access only extends to the person who is the subject of those records, or someone acting on their behalf.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118118.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_696">A person does not have the right to know what is recorded about someone else, even someone who is a member of the same family, without that person&#039;s consent. Requests from parents to see records relating to a child can be dealt with under these arrangements only where they are acting in the interests of a child who is unable to act for himself, rather than on their own behalf.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118118.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_697">The right of access extends to children and young people under 18 who understand what it means to exercise that right. If they do not have sufficient understanding to make the request, a person with parental responsibility can make the request on their behalf.

Local authorities have a general duty in common law to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information, which they hold in connection with their social services functions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41118118.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_698">However, there are circumstances in which personal information can be disclosed. For example, an authority may disclose information to social services staff directly involved in a case, or to anyone who cares for one of their clients, such as a voluntary body or foster carers. An authority will also need to disclose personal information to various bodies with the power to order disclosure, when ordered to do so, such as the police, the courts and statutory inquiries.

 Following the publication of the consultation document, &quot;Integrated Children&#039;s System&#151; Working with Children in Need and Their Families&quot;, in December 2002, a programme of work was set up in partnership with local authorities with social services responsibilities to pilot its introduction and test the integrity of the Integrated Children&#039;s System (ICS).

 All providers in receipt of Government funding to deliver early education are under a statutory obligation to deliver the Foundation Stage Curriculum&#151;the first stage of the National Curriculum. The Foundation Stage is a distinct phase of education, to meet the needs of children aged from three to the end of the reception year in primary schools. There will be children in Foundation Stage settings who will have a home language other than English. Practitioners plan to meet the needs of all children, including those from diverse linguistic backgrounds. The curriculum states that learning opportunities should be planned to help children develop their English by, for example, providing a range of opportunities for children to engage in speaking and listening activities in English with peers and adults.

 Through the pupil level annual school census (taken in January of each year) it is possible to identify which pupils are recorded on the roll of a school. Pupils in Pupil Referral Units can also be recorded on the roll of a mainstream school. In these cases the pupil is counted at the mainstream school, leaving only those pupils solely registered at a PRU contributing towards results for PRUs. The majority of pupils should only be in Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) for a short time, as the focus should be primarily on getting them back in to a mainstream school as soon as possible.

<sup>(132)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(133)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(134)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

<sup>(135)</sup> In 2002&#150;03 the combined LEA and school based expenditure is calculated by Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE) plus line 60 NCE (with adjustments to income to take account of School Standards Grant and Standards Fund scored here) plus lines 61 to 74 NCE.<br>





<sup>(136)</sup> Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included for 1999&#150;2000 onwards. Other LEA maintained pupils are also included in the pupil count and this includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 as reported by the LEA (as at 10 November 2004).<br>
