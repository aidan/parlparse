 The British Cattle Movement Service will operate the Cattle Tracing System, providing a register of all cattle in Great Britain, their location and their movement history. Once it is fully operational, it will comprise an estimated 261 staff. The anticipated breakdown by grade and the salary bands are given in the following table.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under his proposed computerised cattle passport scheme <i>(a) </i> how many passports are estimated to be issued annually and <i>(b)</i> how many passports he estimates will be issued in each of the scheme's first three years. [18828] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 It is estimated that between 2.5 million and 3 million passports will be issued annually.

<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 On 30 July I announced that the Government was setting up a computerised cattle tracing system (CTS) which would be fully operational in 1998. The system will be administered by a new public sector organisation, the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS), which will manage cattle movements and respond to database queries. On 7 October I also announced that the Government had decided to centralise the issue of cattle passports at the BCMS. The new scheme will give the UK one of the most advanced cattle tracing systems in Europe.

<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the impact of his decision to restrict the general retail sale of higher dose vitamin B6 supplements on <i>(a)</i> consumers, <i>(b)</i> manufacturers and <i>(c)</i> retailers. [18969]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy has advised that 1.4 mg of vitamin B6 per day is enough to meet the needs of almost all individuals, even those with high needs. The proposed maximum limit of 10 mg per daily dose on the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements sold under food law is more than seven times greater than this amount. Those who need higher doses for the treatment of medical conditions will continue to be able to obtain them from pharmacies and on prescription.
<P>

<a name="71205w01.html_para0">Information on the impact of the proposed controls on manufacturers and retailers has been requested from relevant trade associations. This will be included in the regulatory assessment which will accompany the draft regulations that will give effect to the controls.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Farming will continue to be regulated where necessary for the implementation of national and EU policies. All regulations introduced will be carefully examined in line with the Government's policy for better regulation to ensure that they are simple, helpful and fair, taking account of the needs of businesses, the citizen and the environment.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how much has been spent by his Department on food safety in the last year for which figures are available. [19354]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In 1996-97 expenditure on food safety matters totalled &#163;28.13 million. A detailed breakdown of expenditure and receipts is shown under the entries for programmes PP1:01, 1:02, 1:03, 1:07 in Chapter 3 and in Table 33 in Chapter 8, of the MAFF/IB Departmental Report 1997, a copy of which may be found in the Library of the House.

<a name="71205w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will assess the advantages of replacing the current HLCA with an area-based instrument for farmers in less-favoured areas. [19357]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Under current EC rules, compensatory allowances provided to livestock farmers in the less-favoured areas may be paid only per head of eligible livestock. The Commission's proposals in Agenda 2000 indicate that they are considering transforming compensatory allowances into a basic instrument to maintain and promote low-input farming systems. However, replacing HLCAs with an area-based instrument would not, on its own, necessarily fulfil this objective.
<P>

<a name="71205w01.html_para2">The pros and cons of an area-based instrument are one of the issues being addressed in an evaluation of the HLCA scheme in England, being undertaken by Drew Associates and Exeter University on behalf of the Ministry. That report will be published shortly. Other similar studies are in hand in respect of the other constituent parts of the UK. The Government is also considering HLCAs as part of its Comprehensive Spending Review and will further consider the options in the light of the Commission's detailed proposals following Agenda 2000.

 The Crime and Disorder Bill will place a joint obligation on local authorities and the police service to develop strategies for reducing crime and disorder in each district, borough and unitary local authority area in England and Wales. Where the two tier structure of local Government still exists, county councils will have an obligation to participate in this process on an equal basis.
<P>

<a name="71205w01.html_para3">The Bill will also give the Home Secretary power to designate by Order other key local agencies which must be involved. At county level or wider, these are likely to include police authorities, probation committees and health authorities.

Some Crime Prevention Panels may merge into the new partnerships; that will be a matter for local decision. But where they do not, we intend to

 This department published two reports containing information from the British archives on Nazi gold in September 1996 and May 1997. Both reports contain details of the theft of gold by the Nazi regime from governments and individuals. Separately, a draft joint DTI/FCO report about the treatment of enemy property held in the UK during and after World War II was delivered to the office of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary on 1 December. It will be published as soon as possible.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received representations from the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU) and from three members of the public, and as a result made inquiries of the BBC. The management and organisation of the BBC's Information and Archives Department are matters for the Corporation itself, but it is obliged under the Royal Charter and Agreement to establish and maintain archives containing material relevant to the objects of the Corporation, and to make the archives available to the public with or without charge. The BBC has assured the Department that it is continuing to meet its archival responsibilities under the Charter and Agreement.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 I am today announcing the establishment of the National Health Service Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group (CPAG). The Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group will assist Ministers to prioritise on a national basis all future major NHS capital projects worth over &#163;25 million. The terms of reference and membership of the group have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71205w05.html_para1">In future, major capital projects will take place where they are most needed. The development of major schemes will be determined on a national basis, in response to patients' needs, as it should be, not, as it has been, on the basis of market forces, regardless of the wider interests of patients or the NHS.
<P>

<a name="71205w05.html_para2">The Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group's first exercise will be to prioritise those projects wishing to go forward in the next wave of the Private Finance Initiative, following on from the 15 major PFI hospital projects already given the go-ahead. Guidance is being issued today to the NHS Executive regional offices on this process, and all NHS regional offices will examine, with their local NHS trusts and health authorities, the major proposals in their region, to determine which meet the greatest health service need. Each regional office will then be responsible for submitting two schemes to the Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group for national prioritisation and recommendation to Ministers. I plan to announce the next wave of major PFI schemes next spring.
<P>

<a name="71205w05.html_para3">The prioritisation process will be as open and fair as possible. Details of the criteria for assessing health service need that will be used by the regional offices and CPAG have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71205w05.html_para4">Projects which meet a clear need but are not suitable for PFI will be considered alongside other proposals, in a separate prioritisation exercise next summer for the limited amount of public capital available.
<P>

<a name="71205w05.html_para5">The establishment of the NHS Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group and the launch of the second tranche of major capital schemes clearly demonstrate our commitment to modernising the NHS, and to creating a

 In 1997-98, the Government are funding a Health Education Authority run adult smoking education campaign costing &#163;5.5 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will make a statement on Government policy relating to the consideration of student loans as income in assessment for benefits. [16849]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The primary source of funding for students is the student support system, not Social Security benefits. Most full-time students are not eligible for benefits.
<P>

<a name="71205w07.html_para0">It is a condition of the income-related benefits that a person should take up any available income, including a student loan, before having recourse to benefits. Student loan income is subject to a weekly &#163;10 disregard. To ignore completely the availability of a student loan in calculating benefit entitlement would operate unfairly against the majority of students who are not entitled to these benefits, as well as being contrary to the general principles governing income-related benefits.

 A project is currently being undertaken to consider transferring the work of the Benefits Agency Medical Services to the private sector. Contractorisation could provide an opportunity to modernise working practices and provide a better value to the taxpayer and better service to people claiming benefits. This supports our commitment to modernise the delivery of Social Security to make it better, simpler and more efficient.

We recognise that people with fluctuating conditions, such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, have particular needs and will be considering what changes are necessary to current procedures to ensure they are treated sensitively and fairly.

 Defence use of the site will cease in mid-1999.

 The Greenwich Foundation is in discussion with potential occupants, including the University of Greenwich and Trinity College of Music. Once the Foundation is satisfied that it can assume responsibility for the site and is content to sub-let to particular occupants, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence will need to approve these under the terms of section 30 of the Armed Forces Act 1996.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w08.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 There is no definition of subsidiarity or proportionality in the draft Directive on the Burden of Proof, although there is a reference to those principles in Recital 20. The Government believes the draft Directive complies with the principles. At the European Council in June in Amsterdam the UK stated its intention to accede to the social provisions of the new Treaty. The European Council agreed that the United Kingdom would henceforth be asked to express its viewpoint during discussions on Directives. The UK's views have accordingly been taken into account in this Directive: in particular, recital 15 was inserted to reflect legal practices in this country.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Ministry of Defence are keen to be involved in the New Deal and, whilst thus far it has largely been in the context of mainstream forces recruitment, other local initiatives are being developed. The Ministry of Defence see New Deal as a useful stepping stone for young people who want to join the forces, but may not be able to meet pre-entry requirements without further support. Discussions have not specifically covered the Cadet forces but we would be very open to any proposals as to how they could be involved.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked for a list of youth organisations consulted on the New Deal proposals. As you will be aware, we have consulted widely at national, regional and local level. While we have not kept centrally a list of all the organisations that have taken part in the consultation process, they have included many with a particular interest in young people. At the national conferences, for example, there were representatives from the Prince's Youth Business Trust, the Prince Youth Volunteers, the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, the National Youth Association and the YMCA. Many other organisations will have taken part in consultations at regional and district level.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It might assist you if I explain in more detail how the preferred supplier system works. It is a form of pre-selection, whereby organisations who wish to be considered for inclusion on an Invitation to Tender list are invited to complete a questionnaire seeking information about such matters as their financial standing, their track record, their quality systems and their health and safety policies. The Employment Service Region then evaluates this information and makes a selection of organisations to be on its list 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>5 Dec 1997 : Column: 391</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of preferred suppliers for programme services in that Region. When contracts fall due to be retendered, tenders are invited from among those organisations on that list. The preferred suppliers exercise is repeated at regular intervals to keep it up to date and to provide opportunities for new entrants to the market. The alternative would be to undertake considerably larger competitions, which would be more costly both for the taxpayer and for the competing bidders.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As I said in my previous reply, I am satisfied that the system is effective in helping both the Employment Service and potential contractors to make the best use of their resources. The preferred suppliers technique, which is followed by many public sector organisations and is fully in line with Government procurement practice, is an established way of minimising the expense of competitive tendering for all concerned while achieving good value for money for the taxpayer. I have, however, asked my head of procurement to undertake an assessment of the system, including an assessment of whether it would be possible to devise indicators to measure its performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment for what reasons the United Kingdom Government reserved its position on section 9 of the UNESCO Recommendation on the status of Higher Education Teaching Personnel; and if he will make a statement on the alterations to that recommendation sought by Her Majesty's Government. [18485]

<P>
<a name="71205w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The UNESCO General Conference adopted the Recommendation with UK support, but with the following reservation expressed by the United Kingdom and supported by Australia, New Zealand, Spain and France:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and France strongly support the recommendation's aims of securing academic freedom and human rights for higher-education teaching personnel. These Member States also strongly support the principles in Section IX "Terms and Conditions of Employment". However, because the drafting of this section appears to go, in such great detail, into areas that are properly the responsibility of individual Member States and institutions, these Member States reluctantly place a reservation on this section.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71205w10.html_para0">On the advice of the UNESCO Secretariat, the UK Government did not seek alterations to the text of the Recommendation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what guidance he has given to local authorities to ensure that the extra money announced in the budget for 1998-99 for education is spent on schools. [18407]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has written to the Leaders of the local authorities that are responsible for education, to emphasise that the &#163;1,017 million increase in recurrent resources announced by the Chancellor in his Budget has been made available for the people's priority of raising standards in our schools. Officials have also discussed with representatives of the Churches and Local Government organisations the principles and criteria for the allocation of the first two phases of capital funding under the New Deal for Schools. The Government wishes to work in partnership with local authorities, and these increases in funding demonstrate that.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans the Government has to reduce teachers' holiday entitlements; and what assessment he has made of the effect of those plans on his programme for recruiting new teachers. [19181]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71205w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Any such proposal would have had to be referred to the School Teachers' Review Body, which would have had to consider it and make recommendations in its report which is due in February next year. No such proposal was referred to the Review Body.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has in addition to PPG6 and Local Transport Note 1/87 to promote the benefits of pedestrianisation; and if he will make a statement. [18882]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w11.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The benefits which pedestrianisation can bring to a town and community are generally well established and appreciated by highway and planning authorities. The measures involved are set out in PPG6 "Town Centres and Retail Developments" and Local Transport Note 1/87 "Getting the Right Balance". Schemes should be individually tailored to meet local needs.




<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 1997 : Column: 398</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71205w11.html_para0">Where full pedestrianisation is neither feasible nor desirable, there may be a case for giving greater priority to pedestrians and improving the pedestrian environment in town centres. It is for individual authorities, taking into account the needs and views of local people, to examine the merits of full or partial pedestrianisation of a town centre. As part of this process they should ensure reasonable access, particularly for disabled people. Authorities should also keep schemes under review and modify them if need be.

<a name="71205w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 For the seven-month period to 1 December 1997, my Department has received 179 representations about railway issues involving Railtrack. The recent modification to the company's network licence places Railtrack under a stronger duty to keep up to date with its programme of maintenance, renewal and improvement and gives the Rail Regulator enforcement powers if Railtrack fails to deliver its programme without good reason.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take steps to ensure that Railtrack invests in track and signalling improvements. [19235]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71205w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A recent modification to Railtrack's network licence establishes a new general duty in respect of maintenance, renewal and development of the rail network. It also places obligations on Railtrack to consult the train operating companies and to publish the criteria by which it will determine the priority and timing of different works. In addition, the licence now gives the Rail Regulator powers of investigation and enforcement to ensure that Railtrack's programme objectives have been met.
