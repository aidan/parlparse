<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">On joining the EU, the new member states only received very limited allocations of quotas related to any fish stocks involving the waters within British fishery limits. Based on the information reported by these new and the existing member states on the activity by the new member states vessels in 2004, no reported catches of quota stocks involving the areas covered by British fishery limits took place. UK fisheries Departments have details related to activity by such vessels when it results in landings of fish at a UK port. For 2004, these show that while there were landings by some Polish vessels into the UK, they did not involve any activity within British fishery limits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Information is available from the UK fishing vessel monitoring system, which records observations of UK and fishing vessels registered in other countries while present within British fishery limits. These observations are based on satellite monitoring information for larger vessels and also aerial and naval sightings of vessels. The satellite reporting system does not cover the full fleets of the member states in question, but does cover the larger vessels that are more likely to make the journeys required to fish in UK waters. Similarly the system records the location of vessels but not if they were actually fishing at the time of the report. Based on the overall vessel monitoring reports available, since the accession of the new member states on 1 May 2004, there have been only three vessels from the new member states observed as present within British fishery limits&#151;one each from Estonia, Lithuania and Poland.

<p><a name="qn_4"><a name="51012w01.html_wqn4"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the effects of the hazardous waste regulations on the construction industry;  [14999]

</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_0">(2) what the definition of occupy is for the purposes of the hazardous waste regulations, with regard to the mobile services tenure restriction for exemption from notification to the Environment Agency;  [15000]
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_1">(3) whether construction contractors are considered for the purposes of the hazardous waste regulations to occupy the premises on which they work;  [15001]

</p>



<p>(4) whether the number of registrations anticipated by the Environment Agency as a result of the hazardous waste regulations includes construction sites.  [15002]</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51012w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Environment Agency are responsible for enforcing the new regulations and it has confirmed that, in some circumstances, it will consider sub-contractors working at construction sites to be mobile service operators. The agency would normally expect a construction company producing hazardous waste at a construction site to notify those premises. However, where a producer is genuinely carrying out a mobile service at a site, such as a painter and decorator, the mobile service provisions would apply as long as that person produces less than 200kg at those premises in any period of 12 months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">As far as the tenure restriction (i.e. that the operator of the mobile service neither owns nor occupies those related premises) is concerned, the interpretation of the regulations is ultimately a matter for the courts. The term &quot;occupies&quot; is not defined in the regulations and it will therefore carry its ordinary meaning. In the Government&#039;s view, it would normally refer to the person in occupation and in many cases that will be the tenant or licensee of the premises. The effect would be that any contractor who is a tenant or a licensee would not satisfy the mobile service tenure restriction and would need to notify the premises. However, a sub-contractor attending a site to carry out a specific task (without occupying the site) would be able to operate under the mobile service provisions as long as they produced less than 200kg of hazardous waste at that site in any period of twelve months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The final regulatory impact assessment which assessed the impact of the regulations on a range of businesses and industry notes that the Environment Agency estimated that there would be 110,000 notified sites in year one. This estimate is based in part on the number of sites producing and consigning special waste under the previous regime. In so far as construction sites consigned special waste under the special waste regime, they will be included in the estimate of notifications under the hazardous waste regulations.

 DFID has not made its own assessment of the 2004 locust infestation, but an independent review of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) regional control operation is being planned and will include an assessment of the appropriateness of the technical response, which will be important for the preparation of future campaigns.

<a name="stpa_17">Fortunately, cold weather in North Africa earlier this year has helped to diminish breeding capacity so there has not been a repeat of the large swarms seen in 2004, but we will of course, continue to monitor the situation carefully.

Prior to 1998 average earnings were estimated from the New Earnings Survey (NES), and are provided for full time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period.

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

<sup>(24)</sup> 1997&#150;98 figures for LEAs subject to local government reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

2. Figures reflect education standard spending assessment/education formula spending settlement (all sub-blocks), plus all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to EFS pupils aged 3&#150;19.<br>

3. Figures exclude education maintenance allowances and grants not allocated at LEA level. They also exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and the Learning and Skills Council for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06.<br>

4. The pupil numbers used are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC three-year-olds maintained pupils and estimated three to four-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5. Real terms figures are based on GDP deflators as at 30 June 2005 (2004&#150;05 prices).<br>

6. Per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

<a name="stpa_99">We believe that a strong grounding in functional English, maths and ICT are essential skills that all young people need to participate effectively in everyday life, including the workplace. To secure these skills we are toughening GCSEs so that, in future, no-one will be able to get a higher grade in English and maths without achieving mastery of the functional basics. We are also introducing a new general diploma to recognise the achievement of those who achieve five good GCSEs or equivalent&#151;including English and maths.

 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) funds all learners at published national rates up to but not exceeding the maximum contract value that each learning provider negotiates for each academic year. The LSC fulfilled its obligation to fund all learners through the contracts agreed at the start of 2004/05. However, it became clear earlier this year that some providers would exceed their maximum contract value due, in the main, to larger programmes for learners, better retention and higher than planned levels of achievement. The LSC was keen to reward providers for the improvements made and a further &#163;38 million was made available by the Department to the LSC. As a result the LSC was able to make additional payments to providers who exceeded their agreed maximum contract value calculated at 50 per cent. of the published national rate for existing learners and in addition to fund new apprentices aged 16 to 18 at the full rate. Although we are aware that some providers were not content with this, we are confident that the LSC has treated them fairly.

 Vaccine specifically against a pandemic strain of influenza virus needs to be developed to match that particular strain. This work can only be done once that strain has emerged and been identified, although preparation can shorten the lead-in time. We are working closely with manufacturers, the World Health Organization, the European Commission and other countries to ensure that a vaccine can be developed as quickly as possible once a pandemic flu strain emerges. Departmental officials have met with representatives from six major manufacturers to discuss how to minimise the delay in production and secure early access to vaccine for the United Kingdom population.

<p>
<a name="51012w17.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_115">Maintaining health services will be key in reducing the impact of a possible flu pandemic and healthcare workers may need to be prioritised for vaccine. As part of our ongoing work on preparedness we have invited manufacturers to tender for a contract to supply a limited amount of H5N1 vaccine. This vaccine would be based on the strain currently circulating in South East Asia and could offer some protection against an H5N1 flu strain. This strategic stockpile could be used as a first line of defence for priority groups, such as NHS workers, while a vaccine against the exact flu strain is manufactured. Experts will also be able to carry out further clinical studies on the H5N1 vaccine to learn more about how it works against the virus.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="51012w17.html_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Avian influenza (bird &#039;flu) is continuing to circulate in South East Asia and other countries. In the period of December 2003 to September 2005, this H5N1 strain of the flu virus has infected 115 people in four countries, 59 of whom have died. In order for the avian flu to develop into a pandemic, the virus would need to mutate to become more transmissible between people. To date, there have been very few examples of person-to-person spread. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the evidence suggests that &quot;the viruses are continuing to evolve and pose a pandemic threat&quot;.

<p><a name="st_175"><a name="51012w20.html_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The proposed regulation seeks to address the use in the labelling and advertising of foods of nutrition claims, such as &quot;low fat&quot; and &quot;sugar free&quot;, and health claims such as &quot;helps maintain a healthy heart&quot; and &quot;good for your bones&quot;. Such claims can be useful in helping consumers make healthy eating choices, but only if the claims are true and not presented in a way which undermines advice on healthy diets and lifestyles. At a time when there is increased concern over obesity and diet related diseases, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, an appropriate level of control over nutrition and health claims is of clear public health benefit.

 In line with the Cabinet Office Code of Practice on Consultations, regulatory impact assessments are published with our consultations on regulatory proposals.
