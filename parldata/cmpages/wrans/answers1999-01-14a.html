To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many planning applications have been submitted in the past year for major developments with particular reference to shopping complexes in the Newtownbreda Purdysburn and Saintfield Road area of South Belfast.  [65108]<P>

 Responsibility for the subject in question has been delegated to the Planning Service under its Chief Executive, Mr. T. W. Stewart. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent question about planning applications for major developments with particular reference to shopping complexes in the Newtownbreda, Purdysburn and Saintfield Road areas of South Belfast.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During the period January--December 1998, the Planning Service received two such major applications. One is for the development of a Class 1 foodstore and petrol filling station on lands at 170 Newtownbreda Road, Newtownbreda. The other is for a site for a retail unit, petrol filling station and park and ride facility at the junction of new Link Road, adjacent to Beechhill Road and Saintfield Road, Castlereagh. Both applications have been designated under the Article 31 procedures of the Planning (NI) Order 1991 and are at an early consideration stage. Retail and Traffic Impact Assessments have been received on both applications. No decision has yet been made on the need for a Public Inquiry to be held.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You will be interested to know that the Planning Service is also considering a Crown Development submission from the Roads Service for a park and ride scheme to include car park, terminal building and small scale retail at Saintfield Road, Purdysburn Road, Castlereagh.</FONT></UL>

 My noble Friend Lord Macdonald, the Minister with responsibility for business and industry, last met Sir Ian Wood, Chairman of Scottish Enterprise, to discuss the Scottish Enterprise strategy on 4 December 1998. At my request Scottish Enterprise has been reviewing its strategy over the last year. This process has involved extensive public consultation. The new strategy will be launched today. I have placed copies in the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<a name="90114w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B>

<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 1999 : Column: 233</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para1">I am grateful to the Task Force for their deliberations. They have made a number of recommendations for improving the transparency of the application process and for enhancing the operation and monitoring of Protection Orders approved. These recommendations have been incorporated in the revised guidance and application forms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w01.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Roseanna Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the timescale for the clean-up of the area within two kilometres of the outfall pipe of UKAEA Dounreay; what action has been taken by UKAEA to identify the source of the escaped irradiated nuclear fuel fragments; what action has been taken by UKAEA to clear Sandside beach of all such fragments; when the fishing restriction in this area will next be reviewed by SEPA; what is the nature of SEPA's monitoring of the specified area; what monitoring is carried out on the land and sea adjacent to the specified area; and what scientific advice he has been given, and from whom, regarding the risk to humans on Sandside beach from direct contact with radioactive particles from UKAEA Dounreay.  [65051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The timescale for clean-up operations can only be considered when survey work has been completed and properly assessed.
<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para2">The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has undertaken a substantial programme of work to determine the source and extent of particles on the seabed adjacent to the Dounreay site. The study takes advantage of state-of-the-art diving and other monitoring technology. The results of this study are expected to be published shortly. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will then consider possible courses of action.
<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para3">Since 1983 three particles have been found in Sandside Bay and removed. UKAEA currently monitors the strandline at Sandside Bay weekly, and nearby public beaches twice yearly or following storm activity. UKAEA undertakes such remedial action as is necessary in line with the requirements of the regulators to ensure public safety.
<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para4">The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) will review the fishing restrictions when more complete information is available on the contamination of the seabed and local marine environment or if new information relating to offshore contamination comes to light.
<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para5">SEPA undertakes monitoring of seafood (collected on a quarterly basis) from within the restricted area and the results are provided to the Scottish Office as well as being published annually. No fragments of irradiated nuclear fuel have been detected in the samples taken from the area.
<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para6">UKAEA also carries out monitoring of seafood from within the restricted area and further afield. In addition to monitoring nearby public beaches, UKAEA currently monitors the foreshore at Dounreay fortnightly.
<P>

<a name="90114w01.html_para7">The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) supplied scientific advice on the risks to human health from encountering fragments of irradiated nuclear fuel. That advice was contained in the report "Fragments 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 1999 : Column: 234</I><P>
of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel in the Dounreay Local Environment" submitted by SEPA to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, a copy of which was placed in the House of Commons Library following a parliamentary question answered on 15 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 418, number 64389. The report includes an assessment of the risk to Sandside Bay bait collectors, the group likely to spend more time in contact with the sediment than most other users. NRPB considered the probability of the bait collectors encountering a fuel fragment to be a round 1 in 200,000. The views of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation int he Environment (COMARE) were taken into account by the NRPB.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what resources he is providing for the Organic Aid Scheme in Scotland in the current financial year.  [65647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 I expect expenditure on the Organic Aid Scheme in Scotland to be about &#163;0.24m in 1998-99. This will represent a rise of 64 per cent. over expenditure in 1997-98.

[65254]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The new arrangements for dealing with asylum seekers will apply to the United Kingdom so that they are treated equally across to whole country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The new asylum support system proposed in the White Paper will be administered by an Asylum Support Directorate in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in the Home Office. My Department and the Home Office are currently considering what arrangements should apply when the asylum seekers are placed in Scotland.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what discussions he has had with the Home Office regarding the proposals in the White Paper on Asylum Seekers to disperse asylum seekers outside London.  [65117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 I was fully involved in collective consideration of the White Paper, as were other ministerial colleagues. My officials are in regular contact

 The Government have been considering the means of improving the way in which Parliament can debate the affairs of the English regions. I shall shortly be submitting a memorandum to the Modernisation Committee inviting it to examine the possibility of reviving and adapting the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs already allowed for under the Standing Orders of the House.

<a name="90114w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government intend to develop a balanced and equitable strategy across all sectors to meet the UK's international and domestic climate change targets. As a first step, on 26 October 1998, the Government published a consultation paper describing progress to date in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and setting out a variety of policy options for further action. The consultation paper refers to a number of options which could be taken in the electricity generation sector to reduce carbon dioxide emissions including increased use of CHP, increased use of renewable energy, improvements in energy efficiency, implementation of Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regulation and improved utility regulation.

<a name="90114w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what effect the closure of driving test centres has had on waiting times for driving test appointments.  [65343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Test centre closures have not affected average waiting times for driving test appointments as the overall capacity to conduct tests has not been affected. The driving examiners from the closed centres have been re-deployed to adjoining centres.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many people who have taken the theory test and passed have not applied to take a practical driving test; and what steps the DSA has taken to ensure that those who have passed the theory test apply for a practical driving test within two years.  [65341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We estimate that there are around 300,000 people who have passed the theory test but do not currently have an appointment for a practical test.
<P>

<a name="90114w03.html_para3">Theory test pass certificates have always shown the date of test pass and stated that the certificate has a two year life. The expiry date on certificates have been given greater prominence since August 1998. The Driving Standards Agency has been sending reminder letters on a quarterly basis to theory test pass holders since last spring. reminders were sent in April to 80,000 people whose theory test pass certificates were over 14 months old, and shortly afterwards to 5,000 people whose certificates were 10 to 13 months old. the Agency has since written in August and November to everybody holding a certificate then over 14 months. The Agency will continue to issue reminder letters until all extant certificates are those carrying a prominent expiry date.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans the DSA has to reduce the period within which candidates who have passed a theory test are expected to take a practical test.  [65344]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Theory test pass certificates are valid for two years. This provides an ample period for a successful theory test candidate to prepare for the practical driving test. We have no current proposals to reduce that period, but will keep the matter under review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reductions in examiner staffing levels have occurred following driving test centre closures; what effect future closures will have on examiner staffing levels; and if redundancies are planned.  [65362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 No driving examiner redundancies have occurred as a result of test centre closures. Staff were transferred to adjoining test centres to cover the expected increase in demand there. No redundancies are planned, in fact the Driving Standards Agency plans to recruit 85 new examiners during this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what service improvements have resulted from savings acquired from the closure of driving test centres; and what future improvements are anticipated.  [65357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Restructuring the test centre estate has helped the Driving Standards Agency to provide a fair and consistent standard of test. Savings have helped fund improvements to the remainder of the estate and to administrative systems, including the new driving test booking system that becomes operational later this year. There has been a series of improvements in customer service targets and new customer service features introduced. These were recognised by the Charter Mark award last year. Savings from future closures will be used to help pay for service improvements in the same way.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out the consultative process used by the Driving Standards Agency in areas affected by the closures of driving test centres.  [65358]

<a name="90114w03.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency normally consults interested parties locally, such as the Member of Parliament, the local authority and instructors when considering whether to close a driving test centre. A public consultation meeting is usually held, and all the results of the consultation process are considered before a final decision is taken.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps will be taken by the Driving Standards Agency to monitor demand in areas where test centre closures have occurred.  [65353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Following closure of a driving test centre, we monitor the pattern of demand at adjoining centres to ensure it is in line with forecasts. Should demand at these centres give cause for concern, steps are taken to ensure that additional examiners are allocated.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_wqn13"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what further plans there are for the closure of driving test centres over the next five years apart from those already identified for closure in the next two years; and if he will list the centres affected.  [65360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We do not have a planned list of driving test centre closures over the next five years. We regularly review requirements against demand for driving tests, operational suitability, and the need to provide accommodation that offers a safe working environment for examiners and candidates at a reasonable cost. Should a centre fall short of these criteria its continued viability is considered, each case being considered on its merits with due regard to local factors.
<P>

<a name="90114w03.html_para4">We are currently consulting about the future of the following car driving test centres: Didsbury (Manchester); Washwood Heath (Birmingham); Newport (Monmouthshire); Minehead (Somerset); and Holyhead Road (Coventry).
<P>

<a name="90114w03.html_para5">Consultation has also been completed about the proposed closure of the following centres, but no final decisions have yet been reached: Hartlepool, Rochdale, Cheltenham, Oswestry (Shropshire), Sevenoaks, and Tunbridge Wells, and the Ore (Hastings) lorry and bus driving test centre.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w03.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There may be a surge in demand ahead of the new, longer test which could increase waiting times by one to two weeks above the target for the next three months. The Driving Standards Agency will seek to minimise the effects of any surge by ensuring that additional examiners are deployed where necessary.

 When in April 1998 the Driving Standards Agency wrote reminder letters to 85,000 theory test pass certificate holders, around 10,000 were asked why they had not completed the test process. About 1,700 responded. The majority had attempted the practical test and had failed but intended to keep trying. Nearly a quarter had delayed learning for financial or health reasons.

 The question bank for each type of theory test is revised annually to reflect changes in legislation and other developments. The Driving Standards Agency publishes books containing the question banks before the adoption of new questions so that candidates can prepare for their test.

<a name="90114w03.html_para15">The edition of the car and motorcycle theory test book published in June 1998 contained a number of errors. A revised edition was issued in August 1998. Candidates who had purchased the June edition were not disadvantaged. Test papers containing questions where a candidate may have been misled by the June edition were withdrawn. Where such questions appeared in test papers before they were withdrawn, incorrect answers were ignored in the marking.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the purpose is of check tests of approved driving instructors; and what effect such tests have had on pass rates since their introduction.  [65367]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w04.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The check test was introduced in the early 1970s to allow the Department to test an Approved Driving Instructor's continued ability and fitness to give instruction, in the interest of both road safety and consumer protection. It allows the supervising examiner to identify any weaknesses in an instructor's tuition and offer constructive criticism on how he or she might improve their teaching methods.
<P>

<a name="90114w04.html_para0">Although the pass rates for the practical driving test are the same today as they were at the time the check test was introduced its introduction saw a levelling out of a falling pass rate that had gone from 50 per cent. in 1950 to 51 per cent. in 1960 and to 46 per cent. in the early 1970s.

<a name="90114w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We see merit in introducing a training logbook for learner drivers. This will be introduced on a voluntary basis in the spring. A logbook will provide instructors and their pupils, and others who supervise learners, such as parents, with a syllabus and encourage them to adopt a structured and progressive approach to driver training. The syllabus, which has been developed in consultation with the driving instruction industry, will enable progress to be charted. The logbook identifies the areas that need to be taught. It does not define the teaching methods to be adopted when covering each topic.

 The target of quadrupling the number of trips by bicycle (on 1996 figures) by the end of 2012, was established by the National Cycling Strategy (NCS). In the White Paper "A New Deal for Transport" published last year, we endorsed that target and recognised the positive contribution that cycling can make towards a transport system that is safe, efficient, clean and fair. The Department requires local authorities as part of their local transport plans to establish local cycling strategies which will contribute to the target of increased cycle use. We will continue to offer guidance to authorities on policy and technical issues, and to work in partnership with other organisations in achieving the NCS objectives.

As part of this process, the CAA are seeking to confirm compliance status of the 2,000 organisations (including UK airlines) which they currently approve. The situation has been and will continue to be monitored on a regular basis. Once the industry has completed their compliance programmes later this year, we will be asking the Chairman of the CAA to provide the Department with appropriate assurances as to the state of readiness of the UK aviation industry. If the CAA have any safety doubts arising from millennium compliance problems, operating authorisations will be withdrawn or withheld.

<P>

<a name="90114w05.html_para0">I have carefully considered the evidence which all consultees representing many interests put to the Department. I have decided not to make unsigned agreements enforceable since I have been given clear evidence that some consumers are suffering detriment from the practices adopted by some mail order firms. In addition to signing nothing, some consumers are not receiving copies of mail order credit agreements. This leads to confusion about the debt owed and the terms and conditions on which the credit has been provided, which can also reflect unfairly on credit worthiness. I am concerned that some mail order companies may not be satisfying the requirements of the European Consumer Credit Directive and the Distance Selling Directive on giving written information to consumers.

 Information and communication technologies (ICT) have a central role to play in reducing the bureaucratic burden on teachers, particularly in reducing the burdens involved in administration and in preparing for lessons. Key targets for the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) include that by 2002, serving teachers should feel confident and be competent to teach using ICT within the curriculum, and all general administrative communications with schools and collection of data from schools should largely cease to be paper-based.

 The Department published on 18 November 1998 guidance on good practice in drug education in schools and the youth service. It includes advice for teachers and youth workers on the effective delivery of drug education, and on dealing with drug-related incidents. The guidance was sent to all Chief Education Officers of local education authorities, and is available to all schools free of charge.

 The Literacy Hour began in primary schools in September 1998. The vast majority of teachers are teaching the daily hour, which has had a considerable impact on teaching methods and organisation of lessons. Evaluations of the pilot National Literacy Project, published last month by OFSTED and the NFER, confirm that the Literacy Hour is based on teaching methods that will raise standards. Children who started some way below the national average in their reading scores made eight to 12 months progress above what would normally be expected, in less than two years.

 On 30 December 1998, the Department announced that we would be making available &#163;390 million additional funding for over the next three years. This will enable the participation rate for three-year-olds in early education to approximately double to 66 per cent. by 2002. I should also add that there has been an increase of 9&#189; per cent. in Local Education Authority's standard spending assessments. Local Education Authorities can spend this money on early years education if they wish.

 Asylum seekers who declare their applications at their ports of entry may be eligible for income support and housing benefit. Other asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute may be eligible for support from local authority social services departments under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989. In these circumstances, it is the Government's intention to reimburse local authorities in this financial year on the basis of a maximum unit cost provision of &#163;165 per week for single adults; &#163;230 per week for families (&#163;240 per week for families in Inner London), &#163;400 per week for unaccompanied children aged 15 or under; and &#163;200 per week for unaccompanied children aged 16 and 17.

<a name="90114w13.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when the report of the Inspection of Medway Secure Training Centre will be published; and if he will make a statement.  [66319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The report has been published by the Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) today, and copies of the report have been put in the Library. The report identifies shortcomings in the management of the Secure Training Centre (STC), and makes 32 key recommendations for improving the standard of service being provided by the contractor. All the recommendations have been accepted, and Rebound are taking urgent action to implement these recommendations. The Home Office will be monitoring progress in conjunction with SSI.
<P>

<a name="90114w13.html_para5">The report made a number of recommendations which required immediate action to strengthen management at the centre, and to improve operational procedures and monitoring. The Director at Medway has been working closely with SSI to implement these recommendations, and to introduce more effective strategies for dealing with difficult young people. A stronger management structure has been put in place to support the staff who were praised in the report for their enthusiasm and commitment. More staff are being recruited, and a programme of repair work has been completed.
<P>

<a name="90114w13.html_para6">The Government remain committed to the public/ private partnership approach, and to making a positive difference to the lives of persistent young offenders, who despite repeated efforts by the Youth Justice system continue to offend. STCs are a new and challenging initiative, and Medway as the first centre of its kind has had a difficult beginning, but action is now being taken to introduce the positive regime we require. I will be monitoring closely the position at Medway, and a further inspection will be undertaken by SSI later this year.

 The consultation document entitled "Regulation of Pre-paid Funeral Plans" is published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90114w14.html_para1">In my announcement of 29 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>300</i>, I said that the Government would be looking at ways of excluding from direct regulation under the Financial Services and Markets Bill pre-paid funeral arrangements that offer sufficient protection to consumers. The consultation document explores how to meet that objective without the need for regulation by the Financial Services Authority. It discusses two possible exemptions: plans backed by a life insurance policy (either whole of life or investment-backed); and where a provider has set up a trust arrangement which has sufficient safeguards.
<P>

<a name="90114w14.html_para2">The proposals apply to new plans, but the document asks for views on how existing plans could be enhanced to provide the types of safeguard set out in the document.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Significant progress has been achieved in the priority review since May 1997. The major firms monitored by the Treasury have advanced from 15 per cent. to 94 per cent. of priority case reviews completed since the Government took office.
<P>

<a name="90114w14.html_para4">Of the 21 firms whose results are set out only one has resolved less than 75 per cent. of its cases. Seventeen have now resolved over 90 per cent. of their cases.
<P>

<a name="90114w14.html_para5">The time limit for completion of the priority review, set by the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), has now expired for the last 19 firms. As of 31 December <i>all</i> firms should have completed the priority review. Consistent with the treatment of the twenty firms already removed from the Treasury's monthly list the Government will look to the PIA for its assessment of whether the remainder have in fact met their targets. Those that have will be removed from the list next month.
<P>

<a name="90114w14.html_para6">Firms must now concentrate their efforts onto phase 2 of the review. It is important that the lessons of the priority review are properly learnt. The Government and the regulators will no longer tolerate delay, and expect all firms to adhere to the regulators' timetable.

 The Financial Services Authority's guidance for phase 2 will include appropriate timescales for completion of the review. FSA will monitor the performance of firms to see that this guidance is adhered to. The regulators have made clear that disciplinary action will continue to be taken against firms that do not conduct their reviews with a sufficient degree of despatch.

 About 2.0 million taxpayers have paid tax at the higher rate for the 1996-97 tax year. The information available on taxpayers who have filed 1996-97 tax returns to date does not allow the number who have paid higher rate tax to be separately identified. However, the vast majority of higher rate payers will have filed a tax return.

Since then the UK Government have kept the Government of Gibraltar informed of significant developments in the Code of Conduct exercise. Gibraltarian officials attended a seminar in September 1998 to discuss the Code and other initiatives to tackle harmful tax competitions. A meeting took place in October 1998 between the Chief Minister and other Government of Gibraltar representatives and senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Treasury and Inland Revenue officials to discuss these issues.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 1998]:</i> These are two separate and distinct issues. The EU Code of Conduct tackles the specific problem of harmful tax competition. It is only right that Gibraltar should be part of international efforts to ensure fair tax competition and Gibraltar is part of the Community for these purposes. With reference to the issue of voting rights for citizens of Gibraltar in European Parliamentary elections, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by the then Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd), on 9 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>499</i>, to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson).

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the legislative base for, <i>(b)</i> the extent of and <i>(c)</i> the duration of (i) full, (ii) temporary and (iii) transitional exemptions in respect of VAT.  [64824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The legislative base for VAT exemptions and zero rates, in terms of EC law, is the Sixth VAT Directive.
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para0">Most of the UK's VAT exemptions, such as finance, insurance, most leasing of property and betting and gaming, are part of the normal VAT system, and there is no expiry date set down in the Sixth Directive. The same is true of the zero rate for exports outside the European Community, and associated supplies.
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para1">Under the so-called 'transitional' arrangements of the Sixth VAT Directive, the UK is also able to:
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>zero rate social items such as food, public transport, books, newspapers and children's clothing (Article 28(2)(a) of the Directive); and

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90114w15.html_para4">In addition, there are a number of technical zero rates on goods dispatched (exported) from the UK to other EC member states.
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para5">It was originally envisaged that the transitional arrangements would last until 31 December 1996, when they would be replaced by a 'definitive' (Common) VAT system. However, the Commission has not yet put forward legislative proposals for key elements of the replacement Common VAT system. Until they do so, and they are unanimously agreed by member states, the transitional arrangements will continue automatically.

[64810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90114w15.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The European Commission gave notice of infraction proceedings by the issue of a reasoned opinion to the UK Government on 4 September 1984. On 13 September 1985 the European Commission made an application to the European Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 169 of the EEC Treaty (as the Treaty was then known), alleging that the UK had breached Article 28(2) of the Sixth Directive. (Article 28(2) provides for the continuation of those zero rates which satisfy the conditions contained in the Second Council Directive of 1967.)
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para8">A copy of the report for the hearing of the case (416/85) before the European Court of Justice on 15 September 1987 was placed in the Library of the House of Commons on 23 July 1987. The opinion of the Judge Advocate (2 December 1987) and the judgment of the Court (21 June 1988) were published in European Court Reports, the formal law reports of the European Court of Justice.
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para9">New VAT law was introduced in the Finance Act 1989 to reflect the judgment of the European Court of Justice. The construction of commercial buildings became standard rated but dwellings and residential buildings continued to benefit from zero-rating.
<P>

<a name="90114w15.html_para10">The infraction proceedings did not apply to alterations to existing buildings which have been standard rated since 1984.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 1999]:</i> The Secretary of State for Social Security announced a number of measures in his statement on 28 October 1998 including the largest ever increase in Child Benefit. And the under-11 child premium in Family Credit was increased from November last year--a change which will follow through into the Working Families Tax Credit when it replaces Family Credit from October 1999. The WFTC will be part of the tax system, and because it will begin to be paid through the pay packet from April 2000, it will reinforce the message that "work pays". The WFTC will help make work pay for families on low and middle incomes, around 400,000 more than are currently helped by Family Credit. Many of these families will be couples with only one income, where one parent chooses to stay at home with the children.

<a name="90114w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 January 1999]:</i> I have made no assessment of the impact on the UK road haulage industry of the difference in rates of duty between EU states. However, when considering the impact of taxation on the industry it is necessary to take account of the overall taxation burden, which is lower in the UK than that of our major EU competitors.

 The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee has considered the practice of spreading rendering condensate on fields. The Committee noted the difficulty of establishing the origin of any ruminant protein found in condensate and concluded that spreading condensate on fields where cattle might graze should be prohibited. The Committee's concerns were related to the risk from BSE to animal rather than human health.
<P>

<a name="90114w17.html_para4">Renderers will be advised that the presence of ruminant protein in condensate means that the practice of spreading it contravenes the Fertilisers (Mammalian Meat and Bone Meal) Regulations 1998. This legislation contains the specific offence of spreading material containing protein on agricultural land and is enforced by the appropriate local authority.
