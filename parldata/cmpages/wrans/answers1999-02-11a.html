<a name="90211w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 I have so far received no requests for consent to prosecution as provided for by Section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 as amended by Section 5(2) of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, or as provided for by Article 12 of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 as amended by Section 6(2) of the 1998 Act.

 Subject to Parliamentary Approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate, it is proposed that the cash limit for Class XV Vote 1--the Northern Ireland Office--will be increased by &#163;62,431,000 from &#163;926,291,000 to &#163;988,722,000. This reflects the take-up of end year flexibility on capital of &#163;2,740,000 and departmental running costs of &#163;5,000,000. Additional expenditure on compensation of &#163;27,000,000 is also reflected in the increase, as is funding for the Prison

This increase reflects a rephasing of Student Loan Book sales of &#163;38,500,000 and reclassification of Bus Fuel Duty Rebates of &#163;7,209,000, the take-up of end year flexibility on capital of &#163;14,645,500, departmental running costs of &#163;30,000,000, European Structural Funds of &#163;8,734,000, Health programme of &#163;29,406,000 and Welfare to Work end year flexibility of &#163;1,643,000. The increase also reflects additional resources of &#163;5,389,000 for the Welfare to Work programme, &#163;6,499,000 for DHSS Winter Pressures, &#163;6,100,000 provided for the Chancellor's Initiative, the transfer of &#163;38,829,000 to the Northern Ireland Office cash limit on Class XV, Vote 1 and other technical changes of &#163;2,709,000.

This reflects the take up in 1998-99 of &#163;35,000,000 of the end year flexibility entitlement announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 14 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>134-36</i>, transfers of &#163;4,000,000 in respect of prison officer redundancies, &#163;750,000 for increased Inland Revenue charges, &#163;526,000 in the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, &#163;470,000 in respect of accommodation costs and other minor transfers in totalling &#163;53,000. Of the revised gross running costs provision, &#163;181,391,000 is for the NIO and &#163;608,691,000 is for Northern Ireland Departments. The gross running costs limit for the Welfare to Work programme which is outside the Northern Ireland Departmental Expenditure Limit will be increased from &#163;6,041,000 to &#163;8,193,000.

 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) plans to release tickets for sale to the general public from early Autumn 1999. The NMEC has no plans to hold a specific event to mark the sale of the first tickets direct to the public for the Millennium Experience. However, as part of the NMEC's planned marketing strategy there will be, during the summer and autumn of this year, a wide range of information on the Millennium Experience including ticket availability and processes; public transport routes; opportunities for travel and Dome ticket packages. This will be achieved through a wide range of media including television and national press.
<P>

<a name="90211w01.html_para9">The NMEC announced on 18 June 1998 that it was starting a recruitment campaign throughout the UK for 100 young people to have the chance to appear in the Millennium Show in the central area of the Dome. The first phase of auditions took place in August 1998 at which 43 young performers were recruited and they are now well into their training programme. The second phase of auditions are currently underway.
<P>

<a name="90211w01.html_para10">A total of 5,000 people will be employed at the Dome by the NMEC and catering companies during the year-long operation of the Millennium Experience.

<P>

<a name="90211w01.html_para11">As a direct result of the Millennium Experience around 2,000 construction jobs have been created and it is estimated that a further 3,000 jobs will be created in secondary markets.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is finalising training programmes for operational staff. The current outline programmes provide for three hours training each for all staff in Disability Etiquette. This follows consultations with the company's Accessibility Advisory Group membership, details of which were published in the company's Annual Report and Financial Statements last year. Staff whose duties will focus on accessibility matters will undertaken more training; the nature and the scope of this will be appropriate to each role.

 We believe that recycling is critical to the task of making our waste management more environmentally acceptable and are committed to seeing a substantial increase in the role that recycling plays. It makes sense to recycle waste if this is the Best Practicable Environmental Option (for example in some cases the amount of energy needed to collect, transport and process materials for recycling, and the associated air emissions, are greater than those required for virgin material production).
<P>

<a name="90211w03.html_para0">It is of course for individual local authorities to consider whether recycling of a particular material is a viable option, economically or on environmental grounds, within their particular district. Factors which will need to be considered in the recycling of plastic are, for example, the economic and environmental costs of transporting a large volume, lightweight material, of sorting the various polymer types and of washing the material which is very often contaminated by the food and drink it has contained.
<P>

 The Government have introduced a wide range of measures to encourage bus operators to reduce harmful emissions from diesel powered buses. We fully support the heavy diesel Directive agreed by the Council of Ministers in December 1998, which sets far more stringent emission standards for new buses and lorries from 2001. We are also encouraging the early introduction of ultra low sulphur diesel through the use of fuel duty differentials, and the fitting of particulate traps through the new Vehicle Excise Duty concession for low emission buses and lorries. In addition, my Department is funding the Energy Saving Trust's Powershift programme which helps to cover the additional costs of converting vehicles, including buses, to use alternative fuels.

 The Department has given no formal advice to UK airlines about the aviation fuel tax introduced by Norway on 1 January 1999. However, in conversations about the tax with UK airlines operating to Norway, DETR officials confirmed that the tax appeared to breach the UK/Norway Air Services Agreement, signed in Oslo on 26 January 1979, which exempts aviation fuel for international flights from tax. Officials wrote to the Norwegian authorities on 4 January drawing attention to this apparent breach and asking them to rescind the tax. I understand that the Norwegians are currently considering the position, in the light of this and other similar representations received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Our policy on town centres, including retail and leisure development, is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 6: Town Centres and Retail Development (PPG6). This aims to sustain and enhance the vitality and viability of our existing town centres by focusing new investment, particularly for retail and leisure uses within city, town and district centres. This statement is intended to add to and clarify the guidance in PPG6 in the light of a number of issues raised in recent litigation which concern the interpretation of PPG6 and Government policy.
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para2">PPG6 advises local planning authorities to adopt a positive, plan-led approach to handling planning applications involving new retail and leisure developments. It advises them, in preparing planning strategies and policies, to consider the need for new retail and leisure development in the plan area over the lifetime of the plan. Having established that such need exists, local planning authorities should then adopt a sequential approach (as 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 1999 : Column: 309</I><P>
explained in PPG6) to identify suitable sites. If there is no need for further developments, there will be no requirement to identify additional sites.
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para3">Proposals for new retail and leisure development which accord with an up-to-date plan strategy or are proposed on sites within an existing centre, should not be required to demonstrate that they satisfy the test of need because this should have been taken into account in the development plan.
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para4">However, proposals which would be located at an edge-of-centre or out-of-centre location and which:
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para5"><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90211w04.html_para7">In the context of PPG6 and this additional guidance, the requirement to demonstrate 'need' should not be regarded as being fulfilled simply by showing that there is capacity (in physical terms) or demand (in terms of available expenditure within the proposal's catchment area) for the proposed development. Whilst the existence of capacity or demand may form part of the demonstration of need, the significance in any particular case of the factors which may show need will be a matter for the decision-maker.
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para8">In the circumstances referred to above, the need for such proposals should be considered carefully when determining planning applications. A failure to demonstrate both the need for such proposals and that a sequential approach has been applied in selecting the application site would normally justify the refusal of planning permission unless there were weighty additional material considerations.
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para9">In applying the sequential approach, the relevant centres in which to search for sites will depend on the nature and scale of the proposed development and catchment that the development seeks to serve. The scale of such proposals should also be appropriately related to the centre--whether town, district or local--the development seeks to serve.
<P>

<a name="90211w04.html_para10">The policy set out in PPG6, and the guidance above should be applied equally to proposals for extending existing edge-of-centre and out-of-centre development which creates additional floor space. Local planning authorities should consider the need for further retail or leisure facilities and then apply the sequential approach to identifying where any such development should take place. Where proposals for such extensions to existing developments are put forward, the Government will expect applicants to demonstrate the need for additional facilities, and that such additional facilities could not be accommodated on sites in more central locations, in accordance with the sequential approach. Need in this context, as in PPG6 generally, should be interpreted as already explained above. Local planning authorities should therefore treat extensions to existing retail and leisure facilities in edge-of-centre and out-of-centre locations as if they were new development.

<P>
<a name="90211w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 All appointments to the RDA Boards were based on merit. We considered party political balance only in relation to the four local councillors appointed to each board. We had in mind the number of council seats held by each political party, and the proportion of votes cast for each political party across the whole of the region; but also sought to reflect other factors such as geographical spread and other relevant background experience.

The principal changes are: an increase of &#163;41,488,000 for expenditure in advance of EC receipts on European Regional Development Fund Objective 2 programmes incurred on behalf of this department (&#163;22,395,000), the Department of Trade and Industry (&#163;11,128,000), the Department of Culture, Media and Sports (&#163;2,708,000) and the Department for Education and Employment (&#163;5,177,000, including a small element for other old programmes); a transfer of &#163;23,620,000 to the DETR/HC (Housing Corporation) cash limit mostly for Estates Renewal Challenge Fund grants to registered social landlords administered by the Housing Corporation from direct government expenditure on that programme; an increase of &#163;16,994,000 for Single Regeneration Budget programmes, comprising the take up of &#163;12,494,000 end-year flexibility and the transfer of &#163;4,500,000 from the DETR/NC (New Towns) cash limit; and new provision of &#163;17,657,000 for Coalfields Regeneration Trust expenditure.

Lastly, &#163;4,100,000 of Rent Assessment Panels provision, &#163;1,500,000 of which is running costs, will be transferred to the cash limit for Class VI, Vote 5 (Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions: administration).</FONT></UL>

The increase reflects a transfer of &#163;951,000 from the DETR/OES (other environmental services) cash limit for remedial work on contaminated land (&#163;912,000), funding for the local authority air pollution unit (&#163;20,000), both to be undertaken by the Environment Agency, and pneumoconiosis compensation payments (&#163;19,000); a transfer of &#163;250,000 from Class VI, Vote 13 (Ordnance Survey) for pneumoconiosis compensation payments; offset by a transfer of &#163;20,000 to Class VI, Vote 5 (Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions: administration) to allow for increased Departmental running costs following the winding up of the UK Ecolabelling Board.</FONT></UL>

In addition, an inter-vote transfer from Class VI, Vote 1 (Housing, construction, regeneration, countryside and wildlife, England) of &#163;1,500,000 of running costs and &#163;2,600,000 of other provision has been made to central administration; together with a transfer from Class VI, Vote 3 (Environment protection and water) of &#163;20,000 in respect of the running costs associated with carrying out the residual functions of the UK Ecolabelling Board, following the decision to wind up this body; a transfer from the Department of Trade and Industry (Class V, Vote 1) in

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will provide a regional breakdown of courts' progress in meeting the target of halving the number of days between arrest and sentencing of persistent young offenders.  [67727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In the past, information on the length of time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offender cases has not been routinely collected. We have undertaken two special exercises to monitor performance nationally against the pledge on persistent young offenders and we have also put in place new arrangements to enable this information to be collected on a regular basis through the existing Time Interval Survey. The first special exercise showed the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders was 142 days in 1996. The second showed an improvement to 138 days between May and December 1997. It is not possible from these data to provide a statistically reliable measure of progress towards the pledge at regional level. A third special exercise, which should produce the 1998 figures in the spring, will, however, allow an estimate to be made on the progress of individual regions in 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="90211w06.html_para0">The new arrangements for the regular collection of data on the time taken from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders and all other young offenders were implemented in October 1998 after piloting. The first complete data from the new Time Interval Survey should be available by late 1999. These will allow for a breakdown of performance by area.
<P>

<a name="90211w06.html_para1">Under guidance issued by the Home Secretary in October 1998, a half of all cases involving persistent young offenders should be dealt with in under 71 days by April this year. The Government fully expect to fulfil its pledge during this parliament.

 The Government are committed to halving the average time taken to deal with persistent young offenders from the 142 days it took in 1996. Figures for 1997 show that between May and December 1997 the average dropped to 138. These figures cover a considerable period when there were very few fast tracking schemes; at the time of the election there were only 8 in the whole of England and Wales. There are now around 150 covering almost half of all court areas.
<P>

<a name="90211w06.html_para2">Under guidance published by the Home Secretary in October 1998, a half of all cases involving persistent young offenders should be dealt with in under 71 days by April this year.
<P>

<a name="90211w06.html_para3">The Government fully expect to fulfil their pledge during this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90211w06.html_para4">Information about the average time for arrest to sentence for all young offenders in the youth court has not been collected nationally in the past. New arrangements to do so were introduced in October last year but are unlikely to produce reliable data until the end of this year at the

earliest. The magistrates' courts Time Interval Survey collects information on cases completed in one week samples each February, June and October, covering the date of charge or summons until the date of completion. The latest available results for the Youth Court come from the June 1998 survey, and reports an average of 81 days, compared with 92 days in June 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list for each police force in England and Wales the training which has been given on operation of the new police personnel procedures which come into effect on 1 April.  [70579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Training Support section of the National Police Training organisation has delivered half day seminars to appropriate members of all police forces (including "non-Home Office" forces) in England and Wales to inform them of the new procedures, and additionally have run two-day workshops which were attended by delegates from 41 police forces. The workshops were aimed particularly at force trainers to equip them to train members of their forces. The individual forces concerned are identified in the table. The national training was completed in January 1999 and forces are now engaged in training their personnel. Each force is responsible for its own training in terms of its nature and scope and, while all officers are understood to be receiving some information, police managers will naturally require more than police constables.

 There is no separate offence of "throwing an object from a bridge". Where danger, injury or death results from such behaviour, it can be covered by a range of existing offences, including general offences against the person. There are also a number of offences which relate specifically to the roads and railways. Examples of these offences and their maximum penalties are set out in the table:

 The planned number of students underlying the funding plans for higher education are not disaggregated by age groups. However, the funding plans announced on 8 December 1998 will allow for 61,000 extra students in 2000-01 compared with planned numbers for 1998-99 and for an extra 100,000 students in 2001-02 compared with 1997-98. The planned additional 61,000 students in 2000-01 include 37,000 part-time students, of whom the majority are likely to be mature students.

 The main causes of shortages of food and other basic needs in North Korea arise from its economic policies, though the problems were exacerbated by natural disasters in the mid-1990s.

<a name="90211w12.html_para9">Following the UK-led mission to North Korea last May during the UK Presidency, we are working with our European Union partners to provide, through the European Commission, a programme of food aid and related measures to enhance food security.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what evidence he has evaluated of changes in the level of consumption of alcohol and tobacco by people <i>(a)</i> under and <i>(b)</i> over 18 years of age; and what assessment he has made of the cause of those changes.  [70020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Levels of consumption of alcohol and tobacco are measured in surveys carried out by the Office for National Statistics, on behalf of the Department. The results are presented and discussed in Statistics reports "Living In Britain--results from the 1996 General Household Survey", "Smoking among secondary school children in 1996: England" and "Young teenagers and alcohol 1996". Copies of these reports are available in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w14.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 In December 1996 the European Commission published its communication on the role of the Community in combating tobacco consumption, which considered a range of options for possible future action at Community level, including the level of excise duty on tobacco within Member States. I ensured that smoking reduction was discussed at the Health Council on 30 April 1998 during the United Kingdom Presidency. The Health Council has kept the issue under review since then. The Health Council has not discussed the issue of excise duty on alcohol during this period.

 The information is not available in the form requested. The organisation of health services, including services for people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, and the manner in which they are delivered are matters for National Health Service trusts and health authorities, taking account of the needs of the local population and the priorities set for the use of the available resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Only plano lenses may be sold without prescription. Both ophthalmologists and opticians have let us know of their concern that the fashion for wearing plano tinted contact lenses could endanger eye health unless retailers know how to fit and care for the lenses. Retailers are required to provide appropriate advice to the purchaser on the care, maintenance warnings and precautions as well as the use of the products they sell. The Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for enforcement under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 and the Department's Medical Devices Agency will provide advice as necessary.

 National Health Service Estates, an executive agency of the Department, provides building guidance to the NHS, principally through the Health Building Note (HBN), Health Technical Memoranda (HTM) and Health Facilities Note (HFN) series of documents. These represent best practice guidance, and through their adoption NHS trusts and health authorities should comply with current legislation affecting disabled people.
<P>

<a name="90211w14.html_para0">NHS Estates has published specific guidance in: HFN 14 "Disability Access" (1996); HFN 21 "Car Parking" (1996); and HBN 40 "Common Activity Spaces, Volume 1: Public Areas" (1995), and Appendix 1 "Checklist of access and facilities for disabled people". This guidance examines the concept of accessibility for all, including car parking, with particular emphasis on the problems that face people with a disability.
<P>

<a name="90211w14.html_para1">In February 1999, the NHS Executive will issue "Doubly Disabled--Equality for Disabled People in the new NHS--Access to Services". This guidance gives advice on accessibility for disabled people including "Transport, cars and parking". An access audit tool has also been developed by the NHS Executive, in partnership with NHS Estates Agency, and will be available to all NHS bodies in spring 1999.

 Courses leading to a diploma in midwifery last 3 years. Courses leading to a degree last either 3 or 4 years. For those who already hold a registered nursing qualification there is also a 78 week programme in midwifery.

The latest tobacco review, due in December 1996, was published in June 1998 and is progressing through Council working group. It has yet to be discussed at ECOFIN.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Information on the number and characteristics of teachers in schools has been collected via a regular census of all teachers working in schools on a particular date. The last such census took place in September 1998 and did not categorise visiting specialists directly. Information on the number of class and specialist teachers in primary and secondary schools on short-term contracts was collected in the 1998 census and teachers were asked explicitly whether they were on a permanent or temporary contracts and whether they were on a supply list at the time. Provisional results from the 1998 census are expected to be available in Summer 1999.
<P>

<a name="90211w21.html_para0">The Scottish Office and other main partners in the education system have also been working together to enable schools to supply data electronically through the National Management Information Systems (NMIS) Project. A number of schools already provide data in this way and it has been agreed that by 2002, all schools will do so. The data specification for the NMIS Project does allow visiting specialists to be identified. The Scottish Office will consult with its partners as to whether a further census of data from teachers is needed before 2002.
<P>

<a name="90211w21.html_para1">While there can always be supply difficulties in particular subjects or areas, we are not aware that vacancies remain unfilled in any quantity because of shortages of teachers.

<a name="90211w22.html_para8">A person who earns &#163;10,000 per annum in 1998 earnings terms throughout their working life would, on the basis of having paid only their National Insurance rebates into a stakeholder pension scheme, receive a total income from the basic State Pension and stakeholder pension of &#163;83 per week (in 1998 earnings terms). This represents 110 per cent. of the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) level where the MIG is raised in line with earnings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security by how much it would have been possible to increase the age addition for pensioners aged over 80 years, taking account of savings in means-tested benefits and higher income tax revenues, if the &#163;2.5 billion allocated to the pensioner income guarantee had instead all been allocated to this purpose.  [68861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> The &#163;2.5 billion package of measures to tackle pensioner poverty over the next three years includes provision for the Minimum Income Guarantee and Winter Fuel Payments as well as free eye tests for the over 60s and concessionary travel. We have assumed expenditure of about &#163;0.8 billion a year.
<P>

<a name="90211w23.html_para0">A net increase in expenditure of &#163;0.8 billion on the age addition in 1999-2000 would result in an estimated weekly increase of about &#163;11.90.

1. The answer is based on those aged 54 years old at 5 April 1996. This is the only age group at present on which full annual details of their National Insurance (NI) record is known, since the commencement of their working life i.e. aged 16 during the 1957/58 tax year.<P>

2. Those shown in the tables are those who have had earnings from employment or self-employment and paid National Insurance Contributions (NICs) during a tax year. It does not therefore contain details of anyone who may have had earnings below the weekly lower earnings limit for NICs in any one tax year or other source of income.<P>

3. It self-employed NICs have been paid in any tax year then details of the number of years worked, self-employed or employed, have been shown in the self-employed at any one time column.<P>

4. Those who have had employed earnings and paid NICs during their working life to date have been shown in each earnings quintile by the amount of earnings on which NI has been paid during the tax year 1995-96. The upper earnings limit for 1995-6 was &#163;22,880.<P>

5. Percentages have been calculated as percentages of all 54 year olds which are held on the LLMDB. This may include some people who do not now reside in Great Britain although at some point in their working life have paid into the National Insurance system.<P>

6. Percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.<P>

<a name="90211w24.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There has been no research commissioned specifically to examine the financial impact of the 30 hour credit on couple family finances. However, starting in 1991 the Department has carried out a series of surveys as part of the Programme of Research into Low Income Families (PRILIF).
<P>

<a name="90211w24.html_para0">The first survey, in 1991, included couple and lone parent families. Since that time the focus has been on lone parents. One of the key objectives of this research has been to explore the impact of Family Credit on lone parent family finances in relation to work. The report "Lone Parents on the Margins of Work", published in the

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what changes there will be to widows' pensions after 2000 resulting from legislation enacted prior to 1 May 1997.  [70326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 As a result of legislation enacted prior to 1 May 1997, the amount of SERPS which a widow can inherit from her late husband is being reduced from 100 per cent. to 50 per cent. for a woman widowed on or after 6 April 2000. Widows already receiving inherited SERPS will not be affected.
<P>

<a name="90211w24.html_para2">This change was part of a package of SERPS reforms introduced by the Social Security Act 1986. Other changes included a phased reduction in the rate at which SERPS pensions build up, from 25 per cent. of reckonable earnings to 20 per cent., and the ending of the "best 20 years" provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what parts of the Representation of the People Acts will apply to the Welsh Assembly elections for the purpose of broadcasting in Wales; and if he will make a statement.  [66181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We propose to apply in the Assembly Elections Procedure Order provisions equivalent to those in section 92 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 which regulates broadcasting from outside the United Kingdom designed to influence voters in an election campaign.
<P>

<a name="90211w25.html_para9">We have consulted the political parties and broadcasters about including in the Order provisions equivalent to those in section 93 of the 1983 Act and have concluded that it is impracticable in the context of party list elections to apply that section. Broadcasters will therefore simply be bound to fulfil the normal requirements of fair and balanced coverage in reporting particular constituency or regional contests. The broadcasters have been working on new guidelines to cover the circumstances of the coming elections and all have agreed to respect those guidelines. The Government intend to review the situation after the elections in the light of experience during the campaign.
<P>

<a name="90211w25.html_para10">Section 93 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 lays down restrictions on broadcasting items about constituency campaigns during parliamentary elections; a broadcast focusing on a constituency may be vetoed by any candidate contesting that constituency. The original purpose of section 93 was to try to ensure equal treatment to candidates in the same electoral area. The broadcasters believe that section 93 is outdated (from a time when there were usually no more than 2 or 3 candidates per constituency) and inhibits their ability to provide meaningful coverage at election times. In an Assembly election, the section 93 provisions would enable any one of the list candidates in an electoral region to veto a broadcast about the campaign in that region.

<a name="90211w25.html_para11">Section 93 was not applied for the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. When we consulted on the draft Elections Procedure Order in October, we drew specific attention to the fact that we were proposing not to apply section 93 and invited comments. Only one political party responded, expressing mild concern but not outright opposition. The only other respondents were the broadcasters who were wholeheartedly in favour of non-application.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1999]:</i> The draft copyright Directive seeks to harmonise basic rights and exceptions to rights, and to implement a number of international obligations resulting from two new treaties in the copyright field (World Intellectual Property Organisation). United Kingdom copyright law, the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, already meets most of the requirements of the draft Directive and the new treaties, but some amendments will be needed. In particular, changes to UK law would be necessary to comply with the regime of compulsory and permitted exceptions in Article 5 of the Directive. Amendments would also be needed to give performers exclusive rights to control "on-demand" transmissions of recordings of their performances, to cater for the fact that protection of technical systems in Article 6 extends beyond what is currently provided in UK law, and to provide for the protection of electronic rights management information as set out in Article 7 of the draft Directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will introduce legislation to protect consumers from unduly-aggressive doorstep sales techniques on behalf of utilities companies following deregulation of the domestic electricity and gas markets.  [69676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w29.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Misleading and over-aggressive doorstep selling practices are unacceptable. In relation to the gas and electricity markets, I have made my concerns clear to the Regulators and the industry on numerous occasions. In both sectors licence conditions have been put in place to help regulate the doorstep selling and marketing activities of gas and electricity suppliers. Also, the Association of Energy Suppliers have modified their code of practice so that members' sales representatives calling on the doorstep provide to consumers, on request, clear written information in relation to prices.
<P>

<a name="90211w29.html_para1">In addition, I have recently strengthened the Regulations governing doorstep selling, to improve the protection for vulnerable consumers. The amended Regulations came into force on 31 December 1998.
<P>

<a name="90211w29.html_para2">These give consumers greater protection because consumers who agree to a trader visiting following an unsolicited doorstep selling approach retain the right to cancel the contract within seven days. In addition, it is now a criminal offence for a trader not to give the consumer written notice of their right to cancel, (subject to exceptions, including where the agreement is cancellable under the Consumer Credit Act 1974).
<P>

<a name="90211w29.html_para3">I will shortly launch an information campaign informing consumers of their rights and warning them about the practices of unscrupulous doorstep sellers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the value of the order for arms exports is recorded at the time when licences are applied for; and if the value is shown on the licences.  [70146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w29.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Applicants for standard individual export licences are required to record on the application form the value of the goods for which a licence is sought; this information is recorded on ECO's computer databases. 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 1999 : Column: 403</I><P>
However, where a licence is issued, the value of the goods covered by that licence may be less than the value of the goods covered by the original application. Exporters sometimes mistakenly apply for a licence to export goods for which no licence is required. In addition, goods are sometimes withdrawn from the coverage of an application during the licensing process, for example at the exporter's request or the value may change during the time taken to process the application because of changes in exchange rates. However, as it would in any case be misleading (because some licences are used only in part or not at all), the value of the goods licensed for export by each individual licence is not recorded on ECO's computer databases, although it is shown on the licence itself. HMC&E is responsible for the compilation of statistics on UK trade in goods.
<P>

<a name="90211w29.html_para4">Open licences allow the exporters concerned to make multiple shipments of the specified goods to the specified destinations in accordance with the licence conditions. While such licences do not normally impose any limit on the volume of exports that may be made under the licence, exporters are required as a condition of the licence to maintain records of all controlled exports for a minimum of three or four years depending on the goods. While these records may be examined by compliance officers in the course of routine compliance visits, the Export Control Organisation does not compile any central record.

All relevant individual licence applications are circulated by DTI to other Government Departments with an interest, as determined by them in line with their policy responsibilities. These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.
<P>

<a name="90211w30.html_para0">While the average length of time taken to process export licence applications is not recorded, performance is measured against two aims:

<a name="90211w31.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Jenny Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 15 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>453</i>, on Sellafield, if the relevant emergency planning officers were informed of the two shipments of mixed oxide fuel.  [69765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The relevant Home Office Chief Constables, rather than relevant Local Authority emergency planning officers, are given advance notification of such shipments. This is because it is for the police to initiate and take charge of the implementation of well rehearsed emergency plans in the unlikely event of any safety incident involving nuclear material.
<P>

<a name="90211w31.html_para0">Consequently, only key nuclear operations personnel, the police and appropriate security authorities need to be or are informed of such movements in advance.

<P>
<a name="90211w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 We share the concerns over the late payment of invoices from United Kingdom companies under the EU Tacis programme. I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development on 10 February 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>280-81</i>.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on minimum levels of redundancy payments.  [68906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employer is obliged to pay only the statutory minimum redundancy payment to employees. This is based on age, length of service and rate of pay and is subject to a maximum (currently &#163;220 per week).
<P>

<a name="90211w31.html_para1">The amount of any redundancy payment over and above the statutory minimum is a matter between the employer and the employees, or their representatives. However, the Government hope that employees would adopt a consistent approach when determining redundancy payments regardless of where the employees are situated.

 I am launching the Science Enterprise Challenge today. This meets one of our key commitments in the recent White Paper to further strengthen exploitation of the science base. This &#163;25 million Challenge is open to UK universities, to compete for funds to endow up to eight new Science Enterprise Centres. Centres will bring the teaching of entrepreneurship and business skills into the science curriculum and be centres of excellence for the knowledge transfer process.
<P>

<a name="90211w31.html_para13">The Challenge is in two stages; applicants are invited to submit an outline business plan for Stage 1 by 14 April. Those who succeed in Stage 1 will be invited to submit a more detailed business plan in Stage 2. I hope to announce winners in the summer. The lead applicant must be a university. However collaborative bids can include, for example, other higher educational institutions. Copies of the Guidelines for Stage 1 have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

 BNFL's External Financing Limit has been tightened by &#163;115.5 million from &#163;178.91 million to &#163;63.41 million. This reflects adjustments in the profile of payments from the UKAEA to BNFL for decommissioning and waste management of UKAEA liabilities at BNFL sites, and correction of historical imbalances between the relative shares the parties pay to Nirex. Provision for UKAEA expenditure has been increased accordingly in the Spring Supplementary Estimate for Class V Vote 1. The adjustments do not require any increase in public expenditure.

 Birds do not give bovine TB and there is no significant evidence of them being a carrier of this infection. However, birds infected with avian TB can pass infection to cattle. This rarely produces clinical disease in cattle but can cause cross reactions to the tuberculin skin test. To overcome this we conduct a comparative skin test so that if cattle react to the avian tuberculin test as well as the bovine tuberculin test the interpretation of the results can be adjusted. This reduces the number of false positive cattle which are slaughtered unnecessarily.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1999]:</i> The Government's Forestry Strategy for England, published last December, identifies the opportunity to increase significantly the level of planting of woodland on derelict land, and puts forward a series of actions to achieve this. However, we have not set specific targets.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1999]:</i> Since 1996 MAFF has had delegated authority for negotiating pay settlements. For the last pay round the core MAFF settlement included Pesticides Safety Division and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.
<P>

<a name="90211w33.html_para1">The headline pay settlement was 2.7 per cent. on the paybill. Together with the additional funds from staff turnover this settlement allowed performance related increases with an overall cost of 4.2 per cent. and one-off structural changes worth 0.5 per cent. of the paybill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. David Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he has had on the future of the calf processing aid scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [71389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 Farmers' organisations have pressed for continuation of the Scheme in view of the uncertain situation facing the beef market. When I announced on 16 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 624-40, a package of aid for the livestock sector, I extended the life of the scheme until 31 March 1999. I undertook then to keep the scheme under review. I have now concluded with my colleagues that, in view of market circumstances, we should further extend the scheme to 31 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="90211w34.html_para0">In view of the need to give certainty about the final end-date of the scheme there will be no further extension. It will end on 31 July.
<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the monthly cost of the revised calf processing aid scheme and the proportion paid by <i>(a)</i> the Treasury and <i>(b)</i> the EU.  [70634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 At the current exchange rate, and assuming throughput at average 1998 levels, the monthly cost of the Calf Processing Aid Scheme is a little over &#163;3 million. The Scheme is in principle 100 per cent. financed by the EU, but 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 1999 : Column: 420</I><P>
due to the operation of the Fontainebleau rebate mechanism the Exchequer effectively pays about 71 per cent. of the costs.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the cost over the last year of the over thirty months scheme; and what proportions are funded by <i>(a)</i> the Treasury and <i>(b)</i> the EU.  [70635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The cost of the Over Thirty Months Scheme in 1998-99 is estimated to be around &#163;364 million, made up of payments to producers (&#163;247 million) and slaughter and disposal costs (&#163;117 million). Payments to producers are in principle reimbursed by the EU at a rate of around 70 per cent., although the effective rate of reimbursement is close to 20 per cent. after the operation of the Fontainebleau rebate mechanism. The costs of slaughter and disposal are fully funded by the Exchequer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what estimate he has made of the annual cost of increasing the maximum weight limit under the over thirty months scheme by <i>(a)</i> 100 kg and <i>(b)</i> 200 kg;  [70638]
<P>
<UL>(2) what would be the annual cost of removing the weight limit under the over thirty months scheme.  [70636]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 First, changes to this scheme are not within the gift of the UK Government; its rules are set by the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="90211w34.html_para1">It is difficult to estimate precisely the likely extra costs of the three options that the hon. Member mentions, as each of the options may cause both slaughter weights and throughput to change. Nevertheless I estimate that increasing the weight limit by 100 kg would increase costs by around &#163;15.5m; increasing the limit by 200 kg would do so by around &#163;16.75m; and removing the limit altogether would increase costs by around &#163;17m.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the European Commission's criteria for the lifting of the export ban on British beef require dedicated abattoirs or dedicated slaughter and cutting lines within larger abattoirs.  [70632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90211w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Date Based Export Scheme requires that eligible animals are slaughtered, and their meat and products handled subsequent to slaughter, in plants which handle only export eligible cattle and beef, or other species and their meat. Abattoirs will be able to slaughter pigs or sheep but will not be able to slaughter cattle which are not eligible for export.
