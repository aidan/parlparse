 The costs of the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, by financial year, are shown in the following table (the figures by Session are not available), and are mainly direct staffing costs. Most of the general office running costs, including accommodation and IT/IS support, are absorbed by other parts of the House administration and cannot easily be disaggregated.

Details are still emerging, but any compensation to Bombardier is likely to be a matter between them and their client for the new trains, Go-Via.

 The Green Paper on Children at Risk, to be published this spring, is examining the range of services available to children and young people who are at risk of educational failure, offending, victimisation and abuse, and poor health.Whilst its too early to comment on the detail of the Green Paper on Children at Risk, the role of parents, schools and children's professionals in improving the outcomes for children are at the core of the work. The Green Paper is looking at how parents can be enabled to support their children best, from preparing for parenthood, throughout the key early years and as their children grow towards adulthood.
<P>

<a name="30321w01.html_para2">Positive experiences of schools and of after school leisure activities outside of schools, play a pivotal role in building self-esteem and enabling children to succeed, educationally, socially and in employment in later life. The Green Paper is considering how mainstream services and institutions can ensure they are positive and accessible environments for the most vulnerable children and young people.
<P>

<a name="30321w01.html_para3">The Green Paper is also looking at ways to improve common training across the professionals who work with children and young people to ensure a shared understanding of child development and safeguarding children.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30321w01.html_para4">While there have been incidents of corporate identity fraud in the UK in the last two years which have been investigated by UK law enforcement agencies, these cases have not resulted in any reported loss to the financial institutions concerned. With regards to incidences of hoax e-mails, more commonly known as advance fee or '419' fraud, once again there has been no reported financial loss to UK financial institutions. Losses have been sustained by a number of individual victims of such crime and in the years 2001 and 2002 National Criminal Intelligence Service figures detail reported losses of &#163;19,451,000. This however is likely to be only a small percentage of losses as few victims are prepared to acknowledge their losses to Law Enforcement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 An individual's personal tax liability will depend on a number of factors including the income tax rates and bands and the level of personal allowances. It will also make a difference if the individual has savings or investment income that is subject to income tax.

 The principal purpose of the new rules on egg marking is to improve consumer information and to provide greater traceability, for example in the event of a possible food borne disease outbreak. This need applies irrespective of the outlet. Where eggs are from a clearly identifiable producer and are sold direct to the final consumer in a WI market, they do not necessarily have to be marked. Otherwise, the normal egg marketing rules will apply.

 Initial principles for the participation of Canada, Russia, Ukraine and other interested states in the European Security and Defence Policy were agreed at the Nice European Council in December 2000, and arrangements subsequently set out in letters to the countries concerned. They have not been the subject of recent ministerial discussion. Canada may participate in EU operations which use NATO assets and capabilities, if she so chooses, and we expect her to take part in the forthcoming EU operation in the Republic of Macedonia on this basis. Canada may also take part in EU operations without recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, if invited by the Council. These arrangements mirror those for European non-EU NATO Allies. Russia, Ukraine and other interested countries may be invited to participate in EU-led operations on a case-by-case basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what funding is in place for specialist agencies to provide assistance and support to child victims of trafficking.  [103405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w03.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We expect that the provision of assistance and support to child victims of trafficking will be secured by local statutory services in response to identified needs, whether provided directly or through specialist agencies. The relevant statutory agencies include the immigration service, the police, social services and health, which have a responsibility to safeguard vulnerable children and to prevent and detect crimes against them.
<P>

<a name="30321w03.html_para0">Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and in many cases, protection under the Children Act 1989. Social services have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of these children following an assessment of their circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w03.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 In 2002&#150;03, the Revenue Support Grant for the London Borough of Havering made provision for an increase in funding for social services of 5.2 per cent., compared with a national average increase of 4.9 per cent. This represented an increase from &#163;38,514,000 in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;39,890,000 in 2002&#150;03. Councils have discretion to decide their spending priorities and are not required to spend exactly these amounts on social care. It is therefore for each council to decide how much to spend on care homes. In addition, in 2002&#150;03 Havering received a Building Capacity Grant of &#163;1,173,000 which is more than double the amount they received in the previous year.

 There is currently no cure but, with appropriate treatment, lymphoedema can be very well managed in the national health service.

 There has not, historically, been a separate budget for health care within overall prison service expenditure.

<a name="30321w04.html_para0">The Department will assume overall financial responsibility for prison health services from April 2003. However, the Government do not plan to devolve full financial responsibility for these services to primary care trusts (PCTs) until April 2006. Until then, the majority of funding for prison health services will be passed back to the prison service to secure services as now. Allocations to PCTs for 2003&#150;04 take account of existing national health service responsibilities for securing secondary care services for prisoners, along with the development of mental health in-reach teams under the NHS Plan.

<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_wqn0"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many appeals made from outside the UK were successful in each of the last three years for <i>(a)</i> asylum, <i>(b)</i> tourist visas, <i>(c)</i> work permits and <i>(d)</i> British citizenship.  [102445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under provisions of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which came into force on 7 November 2002, a claimant whose asylum or human rights claim has been refused and certified as "clearly unfounded" may not appeal that refusal until they are outside the United Kingdom. No such appeals had been lodged as at end December 2002 (the latest date for which data are available). However, for the small number of such cases for which appeals have since been received and determined, none has been successful.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para0">Prior to 7 November, no asylum applicants were required to appeal from outside the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para1">There is no statutory right of appeal against a refusal to grant tourist visas or British nationality.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para2">The number of successful non-statutory appeals made outside the United Kingdom for work permits in each of the last three years is as follows: 753 in 2000; 937 in 2001; and 2,123 in 2002. The issue of a work permit does not guarantee the issue of a visa and/or entry to the United Kingdom.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) on 22 January 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 334W.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para3">I also refer to the answer provided to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) on 11 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 207W.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para4">Detailed information for all Ministers in respect of United Kingdom travel is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the on-the-spot fines pilot project in North Wales.  [103398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 North Wales is one of five police forces piloting penalty notices for disorder in four police force areas. The pilot in North Wales commenced on 2 September in its central division. Up to 5 January 100 penalty notices had been issued with 53 paid and only one request for a court hearing. 23 penalty notices were within the 21 day payment period with no recorded outcome. North Wales police have welcomed this new option for dealing with low-level disorderly offending and are now extending the pilot forcewide.

<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his Answer of 24 February, ref 97598, what the role of his Department is in determining policy and guidelines relating to the deployment of police forces.  [100063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Under the Police Act 1996, a police force is under the control and direction of its chief officer. Operational decisions, including the deployment of officers, are a matter for the chief officer of police.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para5">The Police Reform Act 2002 provides for the publication of an annual National Policing Plan which sets out the Home Secretary's strategic priorities for the police service and the targets and indicators by which police performance will be measured. Chief officers and police authorities are then required to have regard to the National Policing Plan when preparing their own three-year strategic plan.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para6">From time to time the Home Secretary may also issue regulations requiring all forces to adopt particular procedures and practices in the interests of promoting efficiency and effectiveness. The Home Secretary may for the same reasons issue codes of practice on any function of chief officers and to which a chief officer shall have regard. The Home Secretary may issue guidance to the 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2003 : Column 971W</I><P>
police on specific aspects of policing. Codes of practice are drafted by Centrex (the Central Police Training and Development Authority) after consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities. The Home Secretary shall also seek the advice of Centrex (who will again consult) in drafting regulations.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para7">The Home Secretary may also direct that an action plan be drawn up where inadequate performance is identified by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary in a force or part of a force.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para8">The National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) has been established within Centrex specifically to advance the professional capacity of the police. It will develop and disseminate knowledge to improve effective policing practice and will focus on priority issues affecting public confidence and risk, including those required by the Home Secretary for incorporation into regulations and codes of practice.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_wqn4"><B> Adam Price: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much his Department has withdrawn from the National Assembly for Wales police provision to fund centrally managed initiatives. [102762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 A number of specific grants and central initiatives are financed from the overall provisions for police grant and for revenue support grant from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and from the Welsh Assembly Government. The share contributed by the National Assembly for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;21.26 million. It is based on the Welsh police authorities' share of Total Assumed Spending for police authorities in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para9">Welsh police authorities will receive &#163;355 million in general grant in 2003&#150;04, an increase of 3.6 per cent. over the provision for 2002&#150;03. In addition, they are expected to receive in specific grants sums at least equivalent to the National Assembly contribution.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_wqn5"><B> Chris Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many community support officers have been recruited by each police authority in England and Wales, in the last year for which figures are available.  [103394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Police forces were first invited to bid for funds for Community Support Officers (CSOs) on 31 July 2002. 27 forces made successful bids. The table sets out the numbers of CSOs recruited up to 17 March in 26 of these forces. Avon and Somerset have not, as yet, employed any CSOs although they hope to have 12 in place shortly.

 The following tables give the readily available information in respect of England and Wales. This covers the three years since 1999, in which year the definition of 'traffic officer' used by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary changed. The definition is now

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"staff who are predominantly employed on motor-cycles or in patrol vehicles for the policing of traffic and motorway related duties".
This definition excludes those engaged in accident investigation, vehicle examination or radar duties. Policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Scottish Executive and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland respectively.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30321w05.html_para13">The importance given to traffic policing should not be measured solely by the number of dedicated traffic officers, and does not depend on increases or decreases in the number of such officers. The adoption of an intelligence-led approach to traffic policing, its integration with other core activities, the increased use of cameras and other technology, and the more effective use of police resources can lead to a reduction in dedicated traffic officers without a reduction in traffic-related targets or enforcement levels.
<P>

<a name="30321w05.html_para14">The importance of roads policing is recognised in the National Policing Plan. This sets out that forces and local authorities should include in their local policing plans targeted and intelligence-led strategies for reducing deaths and injuries on the roads and achieving a safe environment for all road users.

<P>

<a name="30321w06.html_para8">The main business of this Council was a discussion on the proposed Directive on working conditions for temporary workers and the preparation of the Spring European Council, to take place on 21 March.
<P>

<a name="30321w06.html_para9">On the former, following lunchtime discussion, the Presidency concluded that the dossier was not ready for agreement at this point. The UK declared its readiness to reach agreement on a directive, but one with considerably more flexibility than the current draft, and joined the consensus for aiming for political agreement in June.
<P>

<a name="30321w06.html_para10">On the latter, the Council adopted without amendment the Joint Employment Report 2002 and its contribution to the Spring Council, "Key messages on the future of the Employment Strategy". In a public debate, member states were in broad agreement on the priorities for the revised Employment Guidelines outlined in the paper: the Guidelines should be fewer in number, focused on outputs rather than inputs, and linked closely to the Lisbon employment rate targets.
<P>

<a name="30321w06.html_para11">The debate also revealed broad support for the idea of an Employment Task Force, as proposed by the UK, France and Germany. The Council agreed that the Task Force should be a one-off, independent analysis of the measures required to improve Europe's employment performance in the short term. The Task Force should complement the revised Employment Strategy, without creating any new processes.
<P>

<a name="30321w06.html_para12">Council approved Joint Reports from the Commission and the Council on adequate and sustainable pensions, and on the future of health care and care for the elderly.

<P>

<a name="30321w06.html_para17">Following an orientation debate, the Council agreed on a joint Presidency and Commission proposal for the Council to send an annual report on Gender Mainstreaming to the Spring Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the replacement ratio is by <i>(a)</i> state pension only, <i>(b)</i> state pension and SERPS and <i>(c)</i> state pension, SERPS and private pension provision.  [99980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 An individual's replacement rate depends upon a number of factors, including past saving behaviour, employment history, earnings profile, private pension provision, investment returns and date of retirement. Depending on earnings, income-related benefits are also available such as MIG and Pension Credit. Figure 2.7 in the recent Green Paper (Cm 5677) shows replacement rates from the state in 2050 as a percentage of weekly average earnings. The Government's strategy is to focus resources on those pensioners who need them the most. As a result, those with low lifetime incomes will have higher replacement rates provided by the state.
<P>

<a name="30321w07.html_para2">The Government have no specific objective on earnings replacement. It is the responsibility of individuals, where possible supported by their employers, to determine the level of income in retirement they want over and above that provided by the state system. Given their state income, figure 2.8 in the Green Paper (cm 5677) estimates the weekly contributions an individual and their employers would need to make to a private pension for the individual to retire on either half or two-thirds of their final salary in 2050.
<P>

<a name="30321w07.html_para3">The assumptions underlying figures 2.7 and 2.8 are detailed in Annex 5 of the Green Paper (Cm 5677) and in the figures' accompanying footnotes.

 Making the move from benefit into employment can be worrying. In recognition of this we have developed a package of financial help designed to provide real support for people making this transition and give them confidence that they can take up work.
<P>

<a name="30321w07.html_para4">To bridge the gap between leaving benefit and receiving a salary we introduced the Job Grant in April 2001. The Job Grant can provide a one-off tax-free payment of &#163;100 for people aged 25 and over moving into full-time work. We have recently announced our intention to extend and improve the Job Grant to include lone parents and people claiming incapacity benefits. For Lone Parents, this will replace the Lone Parent Run-On that currently provides continued benefit payments for lone parents for the first two weeks after moving from benefits into work.

<P>
<a name="30321w08.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Until October 2001, officials dealing with House of Lords reform were an integral part of the Constitution Secretariat at the Cabinet Office and were also engaged in other duties within the Secretariat. On transfer of the functions to the Lord Chancellor's Department, provision of &#163;361,000 was also transferred. This included provision for the purchase of legal advice to the Unit. The lawyers' part of the transferred resources has now been allocated to that part of the Department along with the posts in question. The estimated outturn for the House of Lords Reform unit for 2002&#150;3 is &#163;181,000. However, both the officials in the Unit and the legal advisers have been principally engaged on other duties within the Lord Chancellor's Department. The spending on the House of Lords Reform Unit in 2003&#150;04 will depend on the work needed in response to the decisions made by the Committee on House of Lords Reform. Provision has been made for a budget of up to &#163;273,000.

 As part of a rolling programme of refurbishment throughout the Parliamentary Estate, the Lord Chancellor's State Rooms in the Palace of Westminster were refurbished in 1997&#150;78 at a cost of &#163;580,000. The scheme included the installation of automatic fire detection, fire compartmentation, electrical rewiring, asbestos removal and essential maintenance. The refurbishment was authorised by the House of Lords Administration and Works Sub-committee on 8 July 1997 and by its Finance and Staff Sub-committee on 16 July 1997. The House of Lords Offices Committee submitted a report to the full House which was agreed on 30 July 1997.
<P>

<a name="30321w08.html_para0">Since 1998, only minor routine maintenance has been carried out. The Palace of Westminster does not keep records in such a way that allows such minor expenditure to be quantified in relation to a particular area of the Palace.

<a name="30321w08.html_para1">At the conclusion of the refurbishment, the Lord Chancellor, for the first time, opened the residence to members of the public for tours and for charitable functions to be held. Tours of the residence and access for charitable functions are provided free of charge. To date, over &#163;5.3 million has been raised for charitable causes.

<a name="30321w10.html_wqn0"><B> Matthew Green: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 4 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 932W, on the New Deal for Communities, in which year the 17 employees had their contracts terminated; in which year the two employees were made redundant; what the total pay-out in financial settlement for each employee was; and how much of each financial settlement came from central government funding, including grants.  [102657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. It is currently being collected from Government Offices and I will write to the hon. Member as soon as the information is collated.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w10.html_wqn1"><B> Matthew Green: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 24 February 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 263W, on the New Deal for Communities, what the administrative budget was for each financial year.  [102680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 There is no annual New Deal for Communities (NDC) administrative budget. However over the 10 year programme each NDC must not spend more than 10 per cent. of its allocation on management and administration. In the early years NDC's admin expenditure will be a higher percentage of its total spend than in later years. This is because early on each NDC has to set itself and its systems up before it can start getting projects under way.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the amount of Objective One monies spent in Wirral, South in the last 12 months.  [103176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30321w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not hold information on levels of European funding at constituency level. However the Wirral, South constituency will benefit from &#163;13.5 million European funding to the Wirral local authority area since 1 March 2002. The individual projects are listed in the following tables. As the Objective One programme is Merseyside-wide in scope, a further substantial amount of programme-funded activity will be delivered by organisations that have a pan-Merseyside remit.
