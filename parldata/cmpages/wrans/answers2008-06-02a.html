 STFC is aiming to retain important skills at the Daresbury Science and Innovation campus to resource the range of scientific research investments being planned for its future. I have most recently announced a &#163;25 million investment by St. Modwen, a private sector developer that will be investing in a new (Vanguard House) business incubator facility at Daresbury to accommodate the rapidly growing (over 65) science and technology-based companies at the site, and new start-up science and technology businesses emerging in part from Daresbury&#146;s own leading scientific research programme. STFC has also tabled proposals for a new computer science centre at Daresbury (Hartree) and, in conjunction with its sister campus at Harwell, a new detector systems centre. These proposed centres would add to the existing Cockcroft Institute for accelerator research and the contribution that Daresbury is making to the preparatory phase of the New Light Source project. Taken together, I believe that the portfolio of facilities and projects at Daresbury will continue to sustain and develop its leading edge skills&#151;which are highly valued by me and my Department. We are fully committed to the development of the Daresbury Science and Innovation campus as announced in Budget 2006.</p>

Many local authorities have been spending considerably more than the 40 per cent. match funding element of the DFG on providing adaptations. The mandatory nature of the DFG remains in place with the legal responsibility for delivering the scheme resting with local authorities. It is therefore expected that the removal of the 60:40 split will have no impact on the level of local authority investment.</p>

It will also empower local authorities to design services which fit with local delivery arrangements and the needs of individuals. Local authorities will, for example, be able to use DFG funding to cover the costs of moving home, where this is a more appropriate solution to adaptation.</p>

 September 2008 represents the start of the first school year since compliance with the School Admissions Code became a statutory requirement. The code and related admissions legislation help ensure that school places are awarded openly and fairly. During the summer we will be consulting on a number of measures that will further strengthen the code and enhance the admissions process. As with all policies it is important to have a clear picture of their impact and we will be carrying out a comprehensive review of all aspects of the admissions process in the future.

 1. The reference period for households below average income figures is single financial years.<br>
 2. A child is defined as anyone aged under 16 or an unmarried 16 to 18-year-old in full-time non-advanced education.<br>
 3. The information shown in Tables 1 and 2 is for the United Kingdom from 1998-99 to 2005-06, and for Great Britain for 1997-98. Data for Northern Ireland has been imputed for 1998-99 to 2001-02. The information shown in Tables 3 and 4 is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2005-06, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02, as data for Northern Ireland has only been imputed for the headline statistics.<br>
 4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#145;equivalised&#146;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
 5. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.<br>
 6. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are. This means that after housing cost incomes will generally be lower than before housing cost.<br>
 7. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. Ages have been split into four bands because of sample sizes. Total numbers of children are in line with National Statistics mid-year estimates.<br>
 8. Small year-on-year movements should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>

A family is defined as a single adult or a couple living as married and any dependant children.  4. The information shown in Tables 1 and 2 is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2005-06, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02.  5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.  6. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.  7. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are. This means that After Housing Cost incomes will generally be lower than Before Housing Cost.  8. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.  9. Small year-on-year movements should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.  <i> Source:</i>  Households Below Average Income, 1997-98 to 2005-06.<br>

The amount allocated to this service for members of the public with disability inquiries for the six months from 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2008 is approximately &#163;0.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80602w0012.htm_para4"><a name="08060220000911">The Commission has a specific power under section 16 of the Equality Act 2006 to initiate inquiries into disability and other equality, discrimination and human rights issues. The Commission is currently considering a number of proposals for inquiries. The provisions in the Equality Act 2006 require the Commission to consult those affected, on the inquiry's proposed terms of reference in advance of these being made public. The Commission has an overall budget for the six months from 1 October 2007 until 31 March 2008 of &#163;30 million. Within this budget there is scope for the Commission to use all of its powers including inquiries and formal investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80602w0013.htm_para2"><a name="08060227000160">Clinical trials submitted at the time of licensing have examined the safety and efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These data are carefully evaluated by the independent scientific advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to licensing to ensure that the products work and are acceptably safe. The longer term safety of the use of SSRIs in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by MHRA including reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by health professionals through the &#145;Yellow Card&#146; Scheme. All new data, including data relating to the effects of SSRIs on immune system disorders, are carefully evaluated. Where appropriate, product information for prescribers and patients is updated and advice issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80602w0013.htm_para3"><a name="08060227000161">As with all effective medicines, SSRIs may cause side effects in some individuals and it is recognised that SSRIs can rarely cause hypersensitivity reactions including rashes, angioedema (swelling of the eyelids, face, lips, mouth or tongue) and anaphylaxis (a severe hypersensivity reaction that can cause difficulty with breathing). This is reflected in the product information for both prescribers and patients and their use is contra-indicated in patients that are known to be hypersensitive to the drug substance.</p>

 The Department published a concordat, &#147;Putting People First: A shared vision and commitment to the transformation of adult social care&#148;, in December last year, which recognises that prevention is one key element of the transformation agenda. Copies of the publication are available in the Library. The concordat sets out the cross-sector commitment to personalising public services and aims to support all councils to transform their adult social care systems by moving away from intervention at the point of crisis towards early intervention and prevention, focused on promoting independence and improved wellbeing. We are extracting and disseminating early lessons learnt from the Partnerships  <br>

 The relationship between sodium and blood pressure was considered by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) in 1994. COMA concluded that a reduction in salt intake would reduce the average blood pressure of the population. In 2001, the Food Standards Agency asked the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) to review the evidence since the COMA report. SACN considered a wide range of evidence for the relationship between salt and hypertension which is detailed on their report, &#145;Salt and Health&#146; (2003).

The release of all tariff expired life and indeterminate sentenced prisoners, including those detained in special hospitals as well as in prisons, is now a matter for the independent Parole Board.

 It is not our policy to confirm or deny surveillance operations in prisons. Since the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000) came into force, all forms of covert surveillance are subject to a strict and rigorous statutory regime for authorisations, and are conducted in accordance with the guidance set out in the statutory Codes of Practice.

 The precise interplay between climate change, sea level rises and the effect on vulnerable people has not been fully explored, but it is clear that sea level rises will have a huge impact. The nature of that impact will vary from place to place, but might include widespread loss of life, homes and livelihoods, and mass migration in small island states such as Vanuatu or low-lying areas of countries such as Bangladesh. Furthermore, as noted by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, developing countries often lack the financial and other resources to protect or relocate people living in low-lying zones; this can make their populations far more vulnerable than people living in similar physical locations in developed countries.</p>

 In very broad terms, using the methodology applied in my previous answer on 15 May 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1702W, approximately 11 per cent. of the Regular Army is preparing for operations and the same proportion has recently returned from operations. For the Territorial Army the equivalent proportion is approximately 2.5 per cent. in each case. For the RAF, the proportion of reservists contained within the overall numbers about to deploy and recently returned from operations fluctuates considerably, and it would not be possible to produce a representative snapshot. As I made clear in my previous answer, data for the Royal Navy could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The UK commitment to the EU Battlegroup roster for July to December 2008 will be met by forces from the Small Scale Focused Intervention Battlegroup (SSFIBG) element of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF). As this is a national high readiness contingency which is already on standby during the relevant period, there is no additional cost to the UK of providing an EU Battlegroup on standby.</p>

However, an EU Battlegroup is a standby commitment intended for emerging contingencies and it is impossible to predict at the current time whether or not it will be deployed during its standby period.

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="80602w0034.htm_para8"><a name="08060319000604">The UK Battlegroup is certified nationally to standards which incorporate and exceed the Standards and Criteria for EU Battlegroups. Other enablers taken from the JRRF also meet these standards. The only cost of certification therefore are the negligible administrative costs associated with the formal notification to the EU that the UK contribution is of sufficient standard, and the administration costs associated with hosting the EU Battlegroup observers day to Exercise Druid&#146;s Dance on 12 May. Hosting the observers&#146; day is not a requirement of EU Battlegroup certification but is encouraged in the EU Battlegroup concept to help share best practice amongst EU member states.</p>

 Service personnel deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq are entitled to 30 minutes of free telephone time per week. It is not possible to provide a specific figure in terms of top-up costs as this varies considerably dependent on which country and which telecommunications provider within a country is being called. In all, there are 381 different call cost rates for some 140 countries advertised in telephone cabins etc. in the Afghanistan and Iraq theatres of which 21 rates apply to the UK. These are broken down between British Telecom rates and the various mobile network providers. However, if a call to a British Telecom line is used as an example, the charge is 11p per minute to make a call from a telephone cabin satellite phone. It will therefore cost &#163;2.20 for 20 minutes of call time; &#163;3.30 for 30 minutes of call time; &#163;4.95 for 45 minutes of call time; and &#163;9.90 for 90 minutes of call time. Personnel calling from an Iridium satellite telephone will pay &#163;17.80 for 20 minutes; &#163;26.70 for 30 minutes; &#163;40.08 for 45 minutes; and &#163;80.10 for 90 minutes. Personnel calling from an INMARSAT system will pay &#163;23.40 for 20 minutes; &#163;35.10 for 30 minutes; &#163;52.65 for 45 minutes; and &#163;105.30 for 90 minutes. Iridium and  <br>

 Following Veterans Day 2007, the event was discussed in July and October at the Veterans Executive Steering Group which is chaired by the MOD and attended by the Confederation of Service and Ex-Service Organisations (COBSEO) and the heads of a number of its key member organisations. Their main comments were that COBSEO members should have wider and earlier visibility of events, that there should be higher level VIP support at the major events and that the London event should have a more central location. All these issues have been addressed for this year's events and COBSEO has been an integral part of our planning process since October 2007. Both the Government and the main ex-service charities have recognised that Veterans Day would need to be built up over a number of years. We are committed to working in partnership with the non-government organisations and others to achieve proper public recognition for the nation's veterans.</p>

 When the Government first launched Veterans day in 2006 as a key element of its initiative to improve the nation&#146;s recognition of its veterans and their achievements, it made clear that this was something that would need to be built up over a number of years. Veterans day 2008 promises to be a further step forward from last year with improved quality and size of events and growing public involvement.</p>

The aim is to encourage communities to take the initiative in the organising of events, whether in large cities or more widely, allowing them a wide degree of freedom to design events that engage young and old, while conveying our key messages about the achievements and diversity of veterans and the support available to them.</p>

 The education system, like so much of the infrastructure in Zimbabwe, has suffered as a result of the Mugabe regime&#146;s economic and political mismanagement. Many professional teachers have left the country, unable to survive on the low wages in the hyper-inflationary economy. Of those who have remained, many are now the targets of state-sponsored violence and intimidation because they acted as polling agents in the recent elections. This is only serving to encourage more teachers to leave Zimbabwe and further debilitate the education system. As a result of the economic crisis, schools now charge exorbitant user fees. Whereas in 2002 over 90 per cent. of children were in school, that figure is now thought to be fewer than 70 per cent.</p>

Current Home Office research shows that, when controlling for some of these factors&#151;for example changes in the economy, demography and social factors&#151;increases in police strength, visibility and focus have had a significant impact on reducing crime.&#148;</p>

 The potential requirements for the sharing of information between the National Ballistics Intelligence Service Database (NABIS) and the National Firearms Licensing Management System was examined, and discussed, in detail by key stakeholders (including forensic and investigatory professionals) throughout the lifetime of the project management process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_527"><a name="80602w0043.htm_para10"><a name="08060326000161">It was found that the potential crossover between the data held by the systems was very small, due to the very low instances of legally held firearms being used in gun crime and the small overlap in information shared between the two applications. Furthermore, the data descriptors of 'firearms recovered at Scenes of Crime' and 'firearms being licensed' may be somewhat different and, as a result, inquiries would be passed from NABIS to expert firearms officers in the Licensing Departments. As a consequence, it was agreed that any risk of legally held firearms being used for criminal purposes was so low and the difficulty of automating a matching process between systems that the cost of building such an interface would outweigh any perceived benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="80602w0043.htm_para11"><a name="08060326000162">The NABIS system has been designed to accredited police corporate data model standards, which means that information sharing may be possible in the future providing that there is a business case to do so.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 May 2008]:</i> Decisions on the removal of DNA profiles from the National DNA Database (NDNAD), and the destruction of the DNA sample, rest with the chief officer of the police force which took the sample. The chief officer may consult the Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Record Office (ACPO CRO), a specialist unit which provides advice on the removal of DNA and fingerprint records, before making a decision. If a chief officer decides that a DNA profile should be removed from the NDNAD, they will instruct the NDNAD Custodian that the profile be removed and the DNA sample destroyed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="80602w0044.htm_para8"><a name="08060326000392">There will be some associated costs arising for the police force which took the sample; for the ACPO CRO, if the request is referred to them for advice; for the NDNAD; and for the forensic supplier laboratory where the sample is stored. It is not possible to disaggregate the costs of removing profiles and samples from general NDNAD service delivery costs or the general administrative costs of the other organisations involved.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 May 2008]:</i> A DNA sample is biological material containing cells with a person's DNA, whereas a DNA profile is a numerical sequence stored on the NDNAD, which is an information technology system. A subject sample is taken from an arrested person, usually by means of a swab which picks up cells from the inside of the cheek. A crime scene sample is one retrieved from material at a crime scene, for example blood, semen or saliva. A DNA sample is analysed to produce a DNA profile by an accredited supplier of forensic science services. A DNA profile is a numerical sequence, representing part of the DNA in the sample, which can be entered on the National DNA Database.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="80602w0044.htm_para9"><a name="08060326000395">The costs of processing, and retaining, DNA samples fall to individual police forces.

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="80602w0044.htm_para10"><a name="08060326000396">The cost of retaining DMA profiles is the cost of running the NDNAD Information Technology system.

<i> [holding answer 16 May 2008]:</i> It is not possible to give the total number of profiles on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) at the end of each year, however, the table gives the number of profiles added to the NDNAD by English and Welsh police forces in each year since its inception. The numbers cannot be added to give the total number of profiles on the NDNAD, as some profiles will have been removed throughout each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="80602w0044.htm_para11"><a name="08060326000402">It should be noted that the number of subject profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals with a profile on the database. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="80602w0044.htm_para12"><a name="08060326000403">For figures on the number of removals from the NDNAD, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) on 8 January 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> column 455W.</p>

The sample size of the International Passenger Survey was increased to collect more information on the flows of emigrants. Improvements to the methodology used for distributing migrants to the local authority level in the mid year population estimates were implemented (based principally on use of household and port survey sources in combination at regional level and IPS questions on length of stay). These changes were implemented in the mid-2006 population estimates issued in August 2007 and were used to revise previously published estimates for 2002 to 2005. They also fed into subsequent ONS population and labour market statistics (e.g. 2006-based National Population Projections, 2006-based Subnational Population Projections to be published in June 2008 and Labour Force survey reweightings issued in May 2008).</p>

 Police and local authorities have available a range of measures to deal with antisocial behaviour, including the nuisance caused by unsolicited car windscreen washers. The measures are usually employed incrementally and it is important that they should be proportionate to the behaviour concerned. Among the available measures normally used for low-level antisocial behaviour are warnings, acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs), and injunctions. For more serious cases, antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) may be used. In addition, the police have powers to disperse groups of two or more where their presence or behaviour has resulted, or is likely to result, in a member of the public being harassed, intimidated, alarmed or distressed. These could be used where more than person is engaged in unsolicited windscreen washing in a particular location.</p>

 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) operates to a set of public service standards which are to issue 90 per cent. of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days.</p>

This SLA has been agreed by ACPO on behalf of the 43 local police forces in England and Wales and the time taken by each force to complete their part of the enhanced disclosure process is measured against these targets. By meeting these targets the police forces directly affect the CRB&#146;s ability to meet the public service standard for enhanced disclosures.</p>

The Act also introduces an alternative dispute resolution scheme under which consumers have access to a free and independent means of resolving disputes with their lenders by taking their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, rather than having to go through the courts.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 7 May 2008]:</i> The UK remains concerned, about allegations of the use of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan. The UK has raised its concerns through the EU and has discussed the issue with the Uzbek government. The EU welcomed Uzbekistan's signing of the International Labour Organisation Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour earlier this year and has urged Uzbekistan to implement effectively its international obligations in this regard.</p>

 The 10 per cent. discount rate used to appraise nuclear power against other generation options is based on an assessment of the cost of capital faced by private sector electricity generators.

<i> [holding answer 21 May 2008]: </i>On 17 May 2007 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced an investment of &#163;1.7 billion to sustain a national Post Office network. This package recognises the important social and economic role played by post offices in the communities they serve and reflects the breadth of Government interests in the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_664"><a name="80602w0057.htm_para2"><a name="08060338000435">Accordingly, on 8 November 2007, I entrusted Post Office Limited with the provision of certain specific services of general economic interest under the terms of a letter to its managing director, Alan Cook. The specific services are set out in the annex to that letter. I have today arranged for a copy of the letter to be placed in the Library of the House. Compensation for the provision of these services up to March 2011 is included within the &#163;1.7 billion investment announced on 17 May 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_665"><a name="80602w0057.htm_para3"><a name="08060338000436">The European Commission provided the approval necessary for the funding on 29 November 2007, following the submission of a formal notification on 28 June 2007, and certain consequent clarificatory discussions between officials of BERR and the Commission.</p>

It is not possible to say what effect the closure of individual post offices may have on local businesses until the implementation of Post Office Ltd&#146;s relevant network change area plan is completed.</p>

For this reason, the amount of electricity sourced from renewables cannot be allocated to individual consuming sectors. Therefore the value of renewable electricity sold by sector is not available. The level of renewable heat sold is small, so price information is not collected, thus no value information is available.</p>

 The feasibility study focuses on tidal range power generation because the key resource of the Severn estuary is its tidal range&#151;it has the second highest tides in the world (up to 14 metres) and around 90 per cent. of total UK practical tidal range resource. Whereas, as the Sustainable Development Commission's recent study confirms (Turning the Tide, published October 2007) the tidal stream resource of the Severn estuary is much smaller and represents a minor part of the total potential of UK waters.</p>

 The benefits of international trade to gross domestic product (GDP) result from greater economic efficiency due to a combination of increased competition in markets, relative comparative advantages, economies of scale, increased opportunities for learning, and greater incentives for innovation.

 The Government recently responded to the report on UK economic regulators by the House of Lords Committee on Regulators (November 2007, HL 189-II) which among other issues covered the accountability of regulators to Parliament as well as their accountability through the Competition Commission, impact assessments and consumer representation. In its response (February 2008, URN 08/648), the Government stated that:</p>
<a name="80602w0059.htm_brev0"><a name="08060338000941"><ul><p class="tabletext">Regulators should be encouraged to think about whether they can be more proactive in using competition law, including market investigation references to the Competition Commission;</p>

However, as bodies independent from government, regulators assess their effectiveness through their own corporate governance structures. Further assessment beyond this is primarily a matter for Parliament.</p>
