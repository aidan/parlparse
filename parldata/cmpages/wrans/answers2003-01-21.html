<a name="30121w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 Repair and renovation costs are not separately recorded but account for most of the Department's capital expenditure which was: &pound;8,000 in 1999&#150;2000; &pound;299,000 in 2000&#150;01; &pound;21,000 in 2001&#150;02; and has been &pound;5,000 in 2002&#150;03 to date.

 Funding for university research in Wales is delivered largely by research councils and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW).

<P>

<a name="30121w01.html_para2">Research councils are sponsored by the Office of Science and Technology (OST) on a UK-wide basis. Figures are not yet available for the academic year 2002&#150;03. The latest available figures are for 2000&#150;01 when the total amount provided by the research councils to Welsh higher education institutes was &pound;23,007,000.
<P>

<a name="30121w01.html_para3">HEFCW's budget is provided by the National Assembly for Wales out of the Welsh block voted by Parliament, but it is a matter for the National Assembly how much funding it allocates to HEFCW. HEFCW contributed &pound;54.6 million in 2000&#150;01 towards university research.
<P>

<a name="30121w01.html_para4">Using the latest population estimates for Wales provided by the Office for National Statistics of around 2,903,200 people, Central Government funding can be estimated at approximately &pound;7.93 per head of population for 2000&#150;01. If both central Government (research councils) and HEFCW funding are taken into account, this rises to &pound;26.76.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The aggregation of many of the Ministry of Defence's resources into central and tri-service budgetary organisations makes it impossible to provide a comprehensive picture of Royal Naval resources used on deployments such as those cited by the hon. Member. The number of personnel and amount of equipment used are, moreover, constantly changing in the course of a deployment lasting several months. It is estimated that around 180 RN personnel and their equipment were assisting the United Kingdom community at the height of the foot-and-mouth crisis. The bulk of the cost of RN resources will have fallen to the two distinct naval budget areas, those of the Commanders-in-Chief Fleet and Naval Home Command, which between them incurred additional expenditure of around &pound;200K. MOD recovered these additional costs from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
<P>

<a name="30121w02.html_para0">An estimated 3,000 RN personnel and their equipment were deployed on a typical strike day during the firelighters' industrial action in November 2002. It is too early to estimate how much the military assistance has cost to date, because the costs incurred since November have yet to be fully captured through the Ministry of Defence's central cost reporting system. The additional costs for the two budget areas referred to in the first part of this statement are expected to be of the order of &pound;800K for the period to 30 November. These costs will be recovered from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<P>
<a name="30121w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 While the Type 42 Destroyer, HMS Glasgow, will help ease the short term programming gap in the Fleet created by the unavailability of HMS Nottingham, she is not a direct replacement for that ship. Although both ships are designed to provide area air defence, either independently or as an integral component of larger joint or coalition maritime Task Groups, Glasgow does not have the enhanced air defence capability to take over HMS Nottingham's programme. However, there is no difference between the &quot;anti-terrorism" capabilities provided by the two ships.
<P>

<a name="30121w02.html_para1">HMS Glasgow was placed at extended readiness from May 2002 (<i>Official Report</i> 2 May 2002, column 965W). Further to the answer given to the hon.

 The Ministry of Defence is not currently seeking to erect a radio mast at Lagopatria (or any other location in the Naples area) to provide a British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) radio channel for United Kingdom personnel serving at HQ Allied Forces, South. The provision of such a facility is not currently assessed to be a high priority against other welfare needs or against the size of the service population who might benefit. The erection of such a mast could, in any event, only proceed with the prior approval of the Italian authorities, for both its construction and the use of a viable radio frequency. The Italian authorities have previously declined to grant the use of such a frequency.

<P>
<a name="30121w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answers 15, 16 and 20 January 2003]</i>: DEFRA has commissioned the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to evaluate and further develop the ICE test (Immunocapillary Electrophoresis Test) with a view to its potential use in the pre-clinical diagnosis of BSE and scrapie. Work on this test has also been funded since September 2002 by the EU Commission with EU laboratories and the VLA under the Framework 5 Programme.
<P>

<a name="30121w04.html_para10">The technology has been transferred from the USA and the test is still in the development phase. It has not yet been applied to field samples on a larger scale commercial level. Technical issues have had to be resolved, further improvements are envisaged, and the implementation of field case testing has been delayed by Foot and Mouth Disease.
<P>

<a name="30121w04.html_para11">To date the ICE method has been used on sheep within a controlled scrapie-infected flock. The test has been shown to identify positive animals at certain stages of infection before clinical disease develops. Further work is being done to determine the exact age range in which positive animals can be identified. Scrapie-free animals give negative results with the test. The method therefore shows promise as a diagnostic tool but its use on a wide scale will be determined by the final characteristics of the test, in particular the optimum time for the test to be used to identify TSE positive sheep. Further validation will be required when the final test protocol is defined.
<P>

<a name="30121w04.html_para12">In the absence of other validated confirmatory pre-clinical tests, the results from ICE testing are being correlated with biopsy materials and eventual post-mortem confirmation of infection in the tested sheep. Facilities to expand the use of the test for field sampling are in place at the VLA and sample materials have been 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 2003 : Column 218W</I><P>
collected to use in a validated test. The preparatory stages for samples in this test are relatively complex and require several days to process; this may limit the number of samples that can be processed and the scale of use of the test. Currently the ICE method remains the only non-invasive live animal test that has been developed to the potential for identifying TSE-infected sheep or sheep flocks.

<a name="30121w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has stated, urgent progress on the MEPP is essential. Our goal is to achieve an Israeli state free from terror, a viable Palestinian state based on 1967 boundaries. The Quartet is working on a roadmap to realise President Bush's goal of a final status agreement within three years. It represents best current chance of securing peace. I was pleased with the progress made at the London meeting, intended to support the Quartet's efforts, on Palestinian reform. We judge that this will have made a contribution towards both improving prospects for peace and clearing the way for a cessation of terror.

<a name="30121w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has held bilateral discussions on this issue with a number of UN Security Council (UNSC) colleagues. We also expect the UN Security Council to discuss it.
<P>

<a name="30121w06.html_para0">The Foreign Secretary issued a press statement 10 January expressing his deep concern about North Korea's recent actions. We subsequently delivered a similar message to the North Korean Government through our Embassy in Pyongyang. We also protested to the DPRK charg&#233; d'affairs in London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Diplomatic relations between the UK and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were established in December 2000, and the British Embassy in Pyongyang opened on 30 July 2001. This established a channel of communication which has allowed us to address the North Korean authorities directly on issues of international concern, such as non-proliferation and human rights.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We have no hard evidence that the North Koreans have produced nuclear weapons, but we assess that they have sufficient fissile material for one or two nuclear weapons, and the technical capability to produce them. In October 2002, North Korean Government officials admitted to the visiting US Assistant Secretary of State, James Kelly, that North Korea had been pursuing a secret uranium enrichment programme. If North Korea begins to re-process the spent fuel rods at Yongbyon, it is possible that they could be used to produce nuclear warheads within a matter of months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 North Korea is the world's biggest supplier of ballistic missiles and related technology to countries of concern. Missiles are North Korea's most significant export and, by channelling profits back into the programme, an almost self-sustaining missile industry has been developed, supporting the requirements of both the domestic programme and the export market. North Korea has provided No Dong missile technology to Iran and Pakistan, enabling them to acquire their own versions. SCUD technology is also available for export, and has been sold to Iran, Syria, Egypt, Libya, UAE and Yemen. Over the last 15 years North Korea has exported at least 400 missiles

 Our immediate priority is the implementation of those resolutions already passed; most recently, Security Council Resolution 1435 of September 2002, which called for a complete cessation of violence, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian cities and action by the Palestinian Authority to bring those responsible for acts of terror to justice. The UK played a leading role in the adoption of this resolution. There are no plans for a further resolution in the near future, but we remain committed to further Security Council action whenever this might be useful.

 As my right hon.

We are working to ensure that Iraq becomes, in the Foreign Secretary's words, &quot;a stable, united and law abiding state, within its present borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its international obligations and providing effective and representative government for its own people."

 In the event that there is a material breach, the preference of the British Government is for a second resolution.

 The UK has played a prominent role in international efforts to press the Russian Government to halt the closure of internally displaced persons camps in the North Caucasus. Bilaterally, we have informed the Russian Government that the suspension of food, water and energy supplies to the camps constituted, in our view, a forced closure and reminded Russia of her obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. The UK has also initiated and helped draft a number of EU demarches, calling for the closure of the camps to be stopped. We were therefore encouraged by President Putin's statement last month that the closures should be halted. However, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and take further action if necessary.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2003]</i>: We share the concerns of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities over the missing persons following the events of 1974.

 We believe that it remains for EU member states to organise their respective bilateral Diplomatic Services at the national level, although co-ordination and co-location of diplomatic missions with EU partners may be appropriate.

<P>

<a name="30121w07.html_para1">The recommendation in the Working Group report is not that member states' bilateral embassies should work under the authority of the High Representative, but that the Commission's delegations should be re-badged as EU embassies/delegations, staffed by officials of the Commission, Council Secretariat and seconded national diplomats. These officials would work formally under the authority of the High Representative on Common Foreign and Security Policy issues, and under the authority of the Commission for other aspects of external action.

 The UK has a very good record in fulfilling its NPT obligations. In furtherance of the aims of Article VI of The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the UK has, since May 1997:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>withdrawn and dismantled the RAF's freefall WE 177 nuclear bomb, so that Trident is now our only nuclear weapons system;
<P>
<BR>
reduced our operationally available stockpile to fewer than 200 warheads, which is a reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of our nuclear forces since the end of the Cold War;
<P>
<BR>
dismantled the UK's last Chevaline warhead in April 2002;
<P>
<BR>
reduced the readiness of our nuclear forces. Only a single Trident submarine at a time is now on deterrent patrol, carrying 48 warheads. The submarine on patrol is normally on several days 'notice to fire' and its missiles are de-targeted;

placed fissile material no longer required for defence purposes under international safeguards, and all enrichment and reprocessing facilities in the UK are now liable to international inspection;
<P>
<BR>
been more transparent about our nuclear and fissile material stockpiles and begun a national historical accounting study for fissile material produced;
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and promoted its early entry into force;

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pursuant to his answer of 8 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 266W, on plutonium disposition, what proportion of the funds committed by the United Kingdom to the disposition of Russian plutonium is earmarked to convert the plutonium into MO&quot; nuclear fuel.  [92060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has committed &pound;70 milion over ten years to help Russia dispose of plutonium, as it agreed to under the 2000 US/Russia agreement. That agreement saw both Russia and the US commit to dispose of 34 tonnes of plutonium each. The Russian 34 tonnes will be disposed of as MO&quot;. The UK, unlike some other contributors, has not earmarked its funds for a particular purpose. We believe this programme to be an important part of our wider non-proliferation policy, as it will ensure that a substantial quantity of fissile material cannot fall into terrorist or criminal hands.

 We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief.

The UK co-sponsored a resolution at the UN General Assembly in November, 2002 in New York, to work to eliminate all forms of religious intolerance. We regularly raise specific cases of religious persecution with the Governments concerned.

 The UK has been engaged in both multilateral and bilateral negotiations with Russia on such a legal framework for some time, but these negotiations are yet to be concluded. Throughout the negotiating process, UK officials have taken every opportunity, both in the negotiations themselves and at appropriate international meetings, to resolve difficulties and to stress the importance of a legal framework. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister raised the matter in discussions with the Russian President Putin in Moscow in October 2002. We hope the remaining legal obstacles can be overcome in the near future, and work can begin on this important programme.

<a name="30121w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Nuclear Decommissioning Fund was established in 1996 when British Energy was privatised. The value of, and British Energy's annual contribution to, the Fund are reported annually in the company's report and accounts. On 28 November 2002, British Energy announced a restructuring proposal intended to achieve the long-term viability of the company, including new and enhanced arrangements to fund decommissioning and other back-end nuclear liabilities. The proposal is currently being considered by the company's creditors. A copy of the company's announcement was placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="30121w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The current value to Post Office Ltd. of encashment business from the Department for Work and Pensions is some &pound;400 million a year. The migration of benefit payment to Automated Credit Transfer (ACT) begins this year and the Post Office's strategy is to respond to that challenge with a range of banking and other services. How the migration of benefit payments affects the revenue of sub-post offices will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change. But the contract for the Post Office card account is potentially worth &pound;1 billion to Post Office Ltd. over its 10-year lifetime.

These would harm the people of Zimbabwe and the region at a time of humanitarian crisis, while having little impact on the ZANU (PF) leadership.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many projects are likely to be affected by the ending of the waste management and recycling element of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme in April 2003; which projects they are; and what representations he has received from the waste management industry about the proposal to end the waste management and recycling element of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme.  [91487]<P>

<P>
<a name="30121w11.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government estimates that approximately 300 projects are likely to be affected by the ending of the waste management and recycling element of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme in April 2003. It is not possible to identify affected projects precisely given the information available about the scheme. However, information on the scheme and projects is available at www.ltcs.org.uk/database/default.asp. The Government receives representations from industry about a range of issues but the Treasury has not received any significant number from the waste management industry about the proposal to end the waste management and recycling element of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme.

<a name="30121w11.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The impact of the changes to the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme on match funding was one of the factors which the Government took into account in deciding to make the changes announced in the 2002 Pre-Budget Report. No clear information is available on the quantities of match funding obtained by projects, nor the source of such match funding. However, a study by Glasgow Caledonian University for Entrust, the Scheme's regulator, has estimated that on average waste management and recycling projects have levered in approximately 34 per cent. funding in addition to Landfill Tax Credit Scheme funding. The Government recognises that the change from a tax credit scheme to public spending may reduce the availability of match funding but decided that the benefits of converting funding on waste management and recycling from tax credits to public spending outweigh any loss in match funding.

No clear information is available on the quantities of match funding obtained by projects. Information is also not available on the quantities of match funding from the European Social Fund or from other public funds. The lack of transparency in the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee's report on the scheme in July 2002, and both the PAC and the National Audit Office have criticised the lack of information on the scheme. These factors were taken into account by the Government in its decision to make the changes announced in the 2002 Pre-Budget Report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w11.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 676 responses were received to the consultation on the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme. 45 per cent. of these were from organisations which had benefited directly from funding through the scheme and a further 30 per cent. were from local authorities. Of the total responses, 82 per cent. were in favour of retaining the scheme as a tax credit scheme. However, 62 per cent. also supported giving greater priority to funding for sustainable waste management.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on his Department's assessment of the application by Citizens Advice Scotland to the Treasury's Capital Modernisation Fund in 2001 for funding of an electronic case recording system; and for what reasons the application was declined.  [91458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The devolved administrations automatically receive a share of allocations made from the Capital Modernisation Fund for devolved matters, calculated according to the Barnett formula. Partial consequentials were awarded to the Scottish Executive in respect of an allocation made to the Department of Trade and Industry, on behalf of the National Citizens' Advice Bureaux in England and Wales, because the Department's responsibilities span both devolved and reserved matters.
<P>

<a name="30121w11.html_para2">Where it is not possible to fund a project fully because there are other higher priorities for funding, it is open to the Department and the devolved administration to consider whether they can fund the project from within the resources already allocated to them.

 The Department of Trade and Industry was allocated &pound;20 million in 2001 to provide electronic access from Citizens' Advice Bureaux.

 There are only two known instances of Inland Revenue staff selling information about taxpayers. Two Inland Revenue employees did so in 1994 to a debt collection agency, and one employee sold information in 1996 to a solicitor. All three were dismissed from the Department and jailed. In relation to the Data Protection Act, there will also from time to time be technical and unintended breaches of the Act in an organisation as large as the Inland Revenue.

 The powers and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority are set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and secondary legislation under it. The Government keeps the position under review to ensure that the regulation of financial services continues to strike the right balance between the interests of firms and consuMerseyside. Whenever the Government plans changes to the scope of regulation this is generally subject to full public consultation.

 In 2001&#150;02, 2 per cent. of starts on Advanced Modern Apprenticeships, and 15 per cent. of starts on Foundation Modern Apprenticeships, were by people who received a training allowance. These trainees receive at least the minimum training allowance of &pound;40 per week, but some will receive more than this. However, we are not able to give the proportion that are on the minimum allowance, or break this down by sector. The majority of Modern Apprentices are employed and are paid a wage by their employer. The rate of pay for a Modern Apprentice is agreed by the employer and the individual apprentice.

<P>
<a name="30121w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 There is no single measure of pensioner poverty. Poverty is a complex issue with various elements which affect many aspects of people's lives, including their income, living standards, health, housing and quality of environment.
<P>

<a name="30121w14.html_para3">A report was commissioned by Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) as part of the research and evaluation strategy for the Government's New Targeting Social Need (New TSN) initiative. This report was published in May 2002. The primary aim of the report was to assess the potential of establishing a baseline of poverty. The report utilised data from the Continuous Household Survey and estimated that there were 81,000 individual pensioners living in households in the bottom 30 per cent. of gross household incomes.
<P>

<a name="30121w14.html_para4">Ensuring that pensioners have a decent income is a key measure in combating pensioner poverty. At present, no pensioner has to live on less than &pound;98.15 a week under the minimum income guarantee (&pound;149.80 for couples). From April 2003 these rates will increase to &pound;102.10 for single pensioners and &pound;155.80 for couples.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. These figures show very little difference in the first four quintiles to those<P>

published in the Pensioners' Incomes Series, which include pensioner units with earnings. Gross and investment income for pensioners without earnings in quintile five and the overall mean are slightly lower than for those with earnings, and these pensioners also contribute a higher proportion of their gross income to benefits.<P>

2. The estimates are from the Family Resources Survey 1994&#150;05 and 2000&#150;01, which is the latest year for which results are available. The survey covers Great Britain and does not include people living in residential care or nursing homes.<P>

3. As with data from any survey, these estimates should not be treated as exact as they are subject to sampling error. In particular, great care should be taken when comparing groups with similar incomes, or looking at changes in income over a short time period, since random sampling fluctuations mean that estimates should be regarded as a broad indication of trends only.<P>

4. Incomes are in &pound; per week and are at 2000&#150;01 prices.<P>

5. Estimates have been rounded to the nearest &pound;1. Estimates of less than &pound;0.50 are labelled '*'.<P>

6. The distribution of income is based on net unequivalised income (unequivalised income refers to the actual cash amount directly received by pensioner units), and has been calculated separately for singles and couples, i.e. estimates for pensioner couples show income for each quintile of the pensioner couples' income distribution.<P>

7. Single pensioners are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women). Pensioner couples are defined as couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.<P>

 Figure 3.1 of the Green Paper Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement (Cm 5677) is reproduced in the following two tables under the alternative assumptions about the rate of return on saving. Each of the two tables shows the required level of weekly saving in order to generate a given target income in retirement. The level of saving is in net terms, i.e. before the addition of tax relief at the basic rate, while the target income is in gross terms, i.e. before the deduction of any tax liability. Apart from the revisions to the assumption about the rate of return all other relevant assumptions are as set out in Annex 5 of the Green Paper.

 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was not required for the wind energy development at Cheverton Down. Responsibility for determining the planning application, and therefore for deciding whether EIA would be required, rested with the local planning authority, the Isle of Wight council. The council originally granted planning permission in 1995, and in 2002, determined an application to vary one of the conditions attached to the permission. A request by local residents that my right. hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister should call in that application for his own determination was declined.

 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3, &quot;Housing", introduced a series of tough new measures designed to meet the country's future housing needs in the most sustainable way possible, including a sequential approach which gives priority to re-using brownfield sites in urban areas in preference to developing greenfield sites. Local planning authorities should revise their plans to take account of the guidance in PPG3 and Regional Planning Guidance, and they should seek to do so as quickly as possible.
<P>

<a name="30121w17.html_para0">In considering planning applications for housing development in the interim, before development plans can be reviewed, local authorities should have regard to the policy contained in PPG3 as material considerations which may supersede the policies in their plan.

 All funding for alcohol treatment services and all funding for drug treatment services until 2001&#150;02 was drawn from the mainstream budgets of the national health service and local authorities. The amounts spent on treatment services from these budgets was substantial, although the method of funding means that it is not possible to give figures on expenditure.

<P>

<a name="30121w19.html_para3">In 2001&#150;02, in addition to the funding from NHS and local authority mainstream budgets, the Government put into place a pooled drug treatment budget which meant resources were specifically made available for drug treatment.

 The national treatment agency, which was set up by Government in April 2001 to increase the quality and availability of drug treatment services, has recently published the models of care (MOC) guidance, which is in effect a national service framework for drug treatment services. The MOC proposes a whole-systems approach, which includes a role for education, training, employment and housing as key elements of care.

<a name="30121w19.html_para5">Funding has also been specifically allocated for the re-integration of substance misusers into employment. The Department for Work and Pensions allocated &pound;40 million in 2001, spread over three years, to help drug users find employment in 31 pathfinder areas in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w20.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The transfer of Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) laboratories to national health service trusts is intended to contribute to raising the standards of microbiology in the NHS as a whole and to build on the standards they have reached. PHLS staff and management have been closely involved at each stage of the process to ensure that any risks inherent in the transfers are identified and managed.

 All the existing information technology systems will remain in place for the time being and no networks will be unbundled unless the regional public health microbiologist and the national health service trust<i>(s)</i> are satisfied that this is in the interests of both the NHS and of public health. NHS trusts will only introduce alternative systems after the risks have been assessed

<P>

<a name="30121w20.html_para4">The laboratories are being transferred with the same level of funding, which will be maintained for at least the first two years and it is expected that these developments will strengthen the public health microbiology outputs of the national health service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w20.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We do not anticipate any of the laboratories losing their surge capacity, as the appropriate level of funding and staffing will be transferred with the laboratories.

 The national health service prostate cancer programme stated that an education programme for the public, patients and professionals on the risks associated with individual testing for prostate cancer will be introduced.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if the Lord Chancellor will make it his policy <i>(a)</i> to introduce rules relating to the conduct and competence of judges in the small claims court and <i>(b)</i> to introduce independent assessors (i) to monitor the observance of such rules and (ii) to permit assessment to inform future appointment by way of promotion or otherwise.  [91393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30121w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has no plans to introduce either rules relating specifically to the conduct and competence of judges in small claims cases, or independent assessors to monitor the observance of such rules. The decisions of judges in those cases are, of course, subject to the possibility of appeal (as are the decisions of judges in other jurisdictions). Where there is no complaint about a judicial decision, but it is alleged that a judge has failed to meet the high standard of conduct expected of all judges, the Lord Chancellor, as head of the judiciary, is able to consider a complaint about the judge's conduct.
<P>

<a name="30121w21.html_para2">Small claims cases are generally dealt with by full-time District judges or part-time Deputy District judges. The Lord Chancellor would usually expect candidates for appointment as District judges to have gained experience of sitting as a part-time Deputy. Deputy District judges are observed, and appraised, in their work by full-time judges, enabling both their performance, and suitability for promotion to full-time office, to be assessed.

<P>
<a name="30121w21.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The 2002&#150;03 target of 30,000 removals per year was based on the public service agreement (PSA) to enforce the immigration laws more effectively by removing a greater proportion of failed asylum seekers. Latest information on performance against this target will be published in the &quot;Asylum Statistics Q4 2001 United Kingdom" on 28 February.
<P>

<a name="30121w21.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has always made it clear that, the target for 30,000 removals set for 2002&#150;03 was aspirational and hugely ambitious. In order to reach and exceed 30,000 removals per year, we needed to remove about 2,500 people per month. This target was not attainable.
<P>

<a name="30121w21.html_para7">The PSA in 2003&#150;04 remains the same, ie to enforce the immigration laws more effectively by removing a greater proportion of failed asylum seekers. The proportion is measured by comparing the total number of refused asylum seekers (including dependants) removed from the UK with the total number of refused asylum seekers (including dependants) who have either exhausted all appeal rights or not appealed within 15 working days of the despatch of the refusal decision or meet the criteria for non-suspensive appeals.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 10 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 232W, if he will ask his noble Friend the Lord Falconer of Thoroton to raise at his next weekly meeting with the chief executive of the Criminal Records Bureau the cases of constituents from Colchester who have been waiting months for their applications to be processed; and if he will make a statement on the operational performance of the Criminal Records Bureau measured against targets.

 I will ask my noble friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton to raise with the chief executive of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), the issue of cases of constituents from Colchester.
<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para0">The CRB has a set of published customer service standards in relation to its response times for disclosure applications:
<P>
<BR>

95 per cent. of standard disclosures issued within one week.

<a name="30121w22.html_para1">The CRB has so far been unable to meet these service standards.
<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para2">However, the Bureau's Service Improvement Plan is steadily delivering improved results. Over the last six full weeks before Christmas the CRB has been averaging around 45,000 disclosures per week, which is over double the weekly output issued by the police under the previous arrangements and compares to a weekly average of 24,000 in August and an average intake of 40,000 applications per week.
<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para3">The average turnaround time for disclosure applications is now about five weeks but it is recognised that there are a significant number of older outstanding applications which have taken much longer than this to process.
<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para4">A factor that is contributing to the bureau's inability to meet its service standards is that a small number of police forces have been unable to keep pace with the increase in the volume of applications. As some 90 per cent. of applications received by the bureau are for enhanced disclosures requiring a local police check, the capacity of the police to carry out their local searches 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 2003 : Column 288W</I><P>
has a significant impact on the overall process. To deal with this situation the police are recruiting and training additional staff. While this is well advanced the problem will persist for a while.
<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para5">The CRB is working with the police to address the situation. Pending the recruitment and training by the police of new permanent staff, the CRB has offered to provide staff to assist those small numbers of forces that have the greater need to improve capacity, and this assistance has been taken up in some cases. These additional local checks are not needed for standard disclosures whose processing times are therefore steadily falling.

<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para7">The guidance notes that accompany the Disclosure Application Form have just been reviewed and some fundamental changes have been made to simplify the process of completion. The notes are now in a graphical format and rely less on text; this has shortened the notes from 25 pages to six. It is envisaged that the improved guidance notes will make the Disclosure Application Form easier to complete. The new guidance notes will be issued in February.
<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para8">We have also recently taken a decision to no longer ask applicants to complete all sections of the Disclosure Application form. The relevant sections are E and F, which include details of applicants' bank account numbers, marital status. The Registered Bodies are being kept fully informed of the changes being made, and the CRB is providing ongoing guidance and advice to them to ensure they fully understand their role of ensuring that Disclosure Applications Forms are correctly completed before onward transmission to the CRB.

<P>

<a name="30121w22.html_para9">An independent team, led by Patrick Carter, have taken a fundamental look at the strategy and operations of the CRB and its private-sector partner, Capita, and recently submitted their conclusions and recommendations to my right hon.

 212 disclosure applicants claim to have lost earnings because the bureau delayed sending disclosures to them. These claims also involved elements of delay, inconvenience, and embarrassment. Of these claims, 166 are resolved and 46 await assessment. The highest sum paid out is &pound;2,400.00 and the lowest is &pound;15.00. The total sum paid out by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) for these claims is &pound;28,900.

 Decisions about the arrangements for checking the identity of disclosure applicants are a matter for the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). In formulating their policy, the Bureau took account of the experience of a number of other organisations, most notably the United Kingdom Passport Service, (UKPS) who have a long and notable record of achievement in this area. The CRB also wished, in line with the Modernising Government agenda, to place less reliance on paper documentation and greater reliance on electronic access to private and public sector databases. It has also sought to depend on face-to-face identity checks by registered bodies wherever possible.

 Where a person has left a control area without permission, escaped from detention or failed to comply with the terms of their reporting conditions, their details will be noted and posted internally within the Immigration Service and with the police. If there is reason to believe that a person is at their last known address, or if fresh intelligence comes to light, immigration officers will undertake a visit. In cases where the person concerned is considered a threat to UK national security, then the appropriate agencies will be involved.
<P>

<a name="30121w24.html_para7">In addition, as part of the improvements in contact management as detailed in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, entitlement to the National Asylum Support Service support will be conditional on asylum seekers reporting as required. The Immigration Service will seek to identify and locate those who have lost contact with the Home Office.

 There are two public offices at Croydon, the first being that of the Public Enquiry Office (PEO), which enters through the main entrance at the front of Lunar House.
<P>

<a name="30121w24.html_para8">There are no records kept of the numbers of those who are initially queuing for the PEO when it opens at 8 am but the covered waiting area can hold between 500 and 600 people at any one time. However, between 6 and 8 January 2003 respectively there were 1,146, 1,153 and 827 people who attended PEO, of which 63, 80 and 72 people on each respective day could not have their cases dealt with immediately.
<P>

<a name="30121w24.html_para9">The other queue is that of the Asylum Screening Unit (ASU), which currently enters through a temporary entrance at the rear of the building. According to figures initially compiled for ASU management, at 8 am on 6 and 7 January there were respectively 120 and 300 people waiting in the ASU queue. On 8 January, the date of the introduction of new asylum support arrangements, 80 applicants were waiting in the queue at 8 am. Around 75 applicants (most with addresses) were asked to return the following day.
