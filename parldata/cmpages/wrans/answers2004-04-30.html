<p><a name="40430w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many instances of gold plating have been brought to the attention of the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit, with particular reference to the Cabinet Office Transposition Guide, 2003, page 17. [168646]</p>









<p><a name="40430w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s policy is to transpose Directives so as to achieve the objects of the European measure, on time and in accordance with other UK policy goals, including minimising the burden on business. It is Government policy not to over-implement (&quot;gold-plate&quot;) directives unless there are exceptional reasons for doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w01.html_para0">
The Regulatory Impact Unit has regular discussions with departments concerning policy development, including, on occasion, possible over-implementation. Records of the number of times such discussions have taken place are not available. Since November 2001, Transposition Notes have normally accompanied all legislation laid before Parliament that transposes any European directive. These show how all the main elements of the directive have been or will be transposed into UK law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w01.html_para1">
In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, Departments discuss with the Regulatory Impact Unit the range of options that might be included in regulatory impact assessments. These include options that could go beyond the minimum necessary to comply with a European directive, bearing in mind that, particularly where the original directive is unclear, it is not always straightforward to know in advance whether a proposed method of implementation might represent over-or under-implementation.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will set a time limit on the maximum length of time between an appeal against the withdrawal of United Kingdom nationality being lodged with the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the appeal being heard.

<p><a name="40430w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 It is important that appeals before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) are dealt with quickly and efficiently and the Government are keeping the position under very close review. But there are risks to setting rigid time limits that stipulate appeals must be heard within a defined period. The complexities of a case, and the need to ensure that SIAC has the full facts at its disposal, mean there are always instances where it would not be possible. We are committed to decide each appeal on its individual merits and give that appeal the necessary time for a fair decision to be given.

<p><a name="40430w04.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Health announced on 7&nbsp;April 2004 an agreement in principle to transfer over 100 surplus NHS sites to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The announcement follows an earlier decision by the Department of Health not to pursue a public/private partnership with Miller Homes/HBOS but instead to open discussions with to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister about the contribution the sites might make to delivering the action set out in the Sustainable Communities Plan (February 2003). Discussions commenced between ODPM and DoH officials after a decision by DoH to reconsider pursuing the proposed Miller/HBOS deal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w04.html_para0">
Following the in-principle agreement to transfer the sites, there will now be an intensive process to establish the terms of the transfer and the implications for individual sites. It is not possible at this stage to say when individual sites, including sites in Hampshire, will be brought forward for development. Those sites which are currently vacant are likely to transfer from the Department of Health later this financial year. The terms of the transfer will be informed by the market value of the sites. An independent valuation is under way to determine an overall value for the portfolio.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w04.html_para1">
While many of the sites are already vacant, others remain occupied&#151;if only in part. The timing of individual sites becoming available for development will vary from site to site. Each site will be considered separately in its local planning context before decisions are taken on future development options. The role that English Partnerships (EP), the national regeneration agency, will play in this process has still to be determined but we would expect it to be significant. There will also be a role for other public sector bodies such as the Regional Development Agencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w04.html_para2">
It is likely that EP will be asked to undertake a master-planning exercise of some of the key sites to maximise their potential to deliver high quality developments. These will be exemplar projects to demonstrate best practice in creating sustainable communities. We would expect EP to engage with the local authorities concerned at an early stage and to involve the wider community and other stakeholders in pre-application discussions. This will help to determine issues such as the number of houses to be developed on each site and the appropriate proportion that should be affordable, as well as the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Apr 2004 : Column 1335W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
infrastructure required to ensure development is sustainable. Appropriate arrangements will be put in place to ensure that there is no conflict between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s role in bringing these sites forward for development and its role in the planning process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w04.html_para3">
The public sector will prepare sites for development and ensure their potential to contribute to the establishment of sustainable communities is realised. Development opportunities will then be marketed to the private sector. How individual sites are marketed will be determined through the master planning process and is likely to vary from site to site. The private sector will therefore have a major role in the development of these sites.

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above estimates are based on unaudited figures supplied by local authorities in response to a regular survey called &quot;Entitlement to Housing Subsidies and Grants&quot; and, in particular, the First/Second Advance Claim forms.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total arrears reflect arrears due from both former tenants and current tenants.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in cumulative rent arrears from one year to the next can be affected both by the success of a local authority in chasing up rent arrears and by the fact that local authorities can simply write-off outstanding arrears at any time.<br>

<p><a name="40430w05.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Paragraph 47 of the annex on Wind Energy in Policy Planning Guidance Note 22 (PPG22) contains guidelines about turbine separation distances from residential dwellings, specifically in relation to noise. This matter was also covered in paragraph 18 of our revision to PPG22, which was issued as a draft for consultation last November.

 The Government&#039;s proposals for amending the current planning policy guidance note 22: renewable energy (PPG22) were set out in draft Planning Policy Statement 22 (PPS22) published for public consultation on 5&nbsp;November 2003. This document covered the handling of all types of renewable energy projects through the planning system. Copies have been made available in the Libraries of the House. The consultation period ended on 30&nbsp;January. The final version of PPS22 will be published later this year following careful consideration of the consultation responses received.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make it her Department&#039;s policy to source sea bass used in catering outlets for which her Department is responsible from hand-line fishermen rather than pair trawlers.  [167539]</p>









<p><a name="40430w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra supports the sourcing of sea bass from sustainable fisheries and handlining, as a relatively low impact method of fishing, can play a part in ensuring fisheries remain sustainable. However, the last report in 2003 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas on sea bass advised that the level of exploitation of the stock at that time was sustainable and did not recommend closure of the offshore pair trawl fishery. There are currently no restrictions at a UK or Community level on the method of fishing that can be used to target bass. In addition, to address the dolphin bycatch problem associated with the pair trawl fishery, Defra-funded trials of a separate grid device to reduce dolphin bycatch are currently taking place, with the co-operation of the fishing industry.

<p><a name="40430w07.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There are two main lessons to be learned from the New Zealand experience of possum clearance. Firstly, in a situation where a wild mammal acts as a maintenance host of TB, a successful eradication scheme must include a strategy to limit the infective contacts between the wildlife reservoir and cattle. This must be in addition to a programme of frequent tuberculin testing of cattle herds, removal of reactors, slaughterhouse surveillance and controls of cattle movements from infected herds. The second lesson is that this multi-pronged approach is an effort that must be maintained over time.

The UK would have preferred the Regulation to have been stricter in certain areas but the agreed Regulation represented a package that was acceptable to the majority of member states, in the light of available scientific data. The review clause in the Regulation provides the opportunity to press for further action to refine and target measures at other sectors of the fleet if justified. In these circumstances, I do not believe a request at this stage to the Commission to conduct a further study in relation to cetacean bycatch would be justified or successful.

implement monitoring schemes to observe bycatch on vessels of 15 metres or over. Such schemes need to provide representative data for bycatch in a range of fisheries. For vessels under 15 metres, members states need ot take steps to collect data on incidental catches by means of appropriate scientific studies or pilot projects. The Regulation is not expected to enter into force until 1&nbsp;July 2004 and the start date for the monitoring requirements will be 1&nbsp;January 2005. The UK monitoring scheme will be designed in the coming months and I am therefore not in a position at present to provide detailed data on the coverage or otherwise of the scheme.

<p><a name="40430w07.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 A maximum of seven pairs of UK vessels were in the pelagic trawl fishery in area VII fishing for bass in March and early April. This has since dropped to one pair of vessels. Defra-funded observers have been onboard two pairs of vessels to monitor bycatch and one pair of vessels has been engaged in trialling mitigation measures since December 2003 as part of Defra-funded research.

I do not rule out action to restrict this fishery but, given the involvement of other member states, Community action would be most effective means of addressing bycatch in this fishery. Consideration of emergency restrictions would be premature before this season&#039;s trials of mitigation measures have been completed and the results considered.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the EU ban on the use of antimicrobial growth promoters in animal feeds; and if she will make a statement.  [167071]</p>








<p><a name="40430w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The EU-wide ban on the use of antimicrobial growth promoters comes into effect on 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Apr 2004 : Column 1348W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
1&nbsp;January 2006. The VMD collects and publishes annual figures of sales of all veterinary therapeutic and growth promoting antimicrobials to monitor changes in sales of these products. The latest figures available show that sales of antimicrobial growth promoters had reduced to 27 tonnes of active ingredients in 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w08.html_para0">
Officials from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) have held a number of discussions with colleagues from Denmark and other countries that have already voluntarily banned the use of antimicrobial growth promoters. They have considered their experiences and the success of the measures put into place to minimise any adverse effects from the loss of these products. In the period following the ban an increase in animal illness had been noticed that lead to an increase in use of therapeutic antimicrobials.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w08.html_para1">
This information is being shared with industry through VMD&#039;s regular meetings with the Responsible Use of Medicines In Agriculture (RUMA) alliance. A representative from RUMA also recently attended a meeting of the Defra Antimicrobial Resistance Coordination (DARC) group to discuss this issue. Further such meetings are planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w08.html_para2">
Another part of the Government&#039;s efforts to help farmers prepare for the ban was to fund a research and development project to look at the potential effects of the withdrawal of antimicrobial growth promoters on the pig industry. The results have shown ways farmers can adapt their herd management to cope with the ban on antimicrobial growth promoters without increasing the risk of disease and therefore the need to treat with therapeutic antimicrobials. Two meetings have been held with pig farmers to inform them of the results. Details of the project can be found at www.vmd.defra.gov.uk.

<p><a name="40430w08.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am aware of the problems caused by the spread of the introduced non-native plant, Japanese knotweed. Current legislative controls exist under section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) to prevent its deliberate planting or growing in the wild. The Department is also collaborating with a consortium led by Cornwall County Council to undertake a four-year project researching the natural control of Japanese knotweed. The study began last year and will undertake the necessary research to establish whether natural control is a feasible method for the long-term, sustainable management of Japanese knotweed in the UK.

<a name="40430w08.html_para3">
Recognising the importance of a strategic approach for non-native species policy, the Department recently consulted on the development of a strategy, and officials are currently analysing the responses.

English Nature must consent before any such operations are carried out. I understand from English Nature that Operation 19 and Operation 21 were specified as likely to damage the special interest of Slapton Ley SSSI when the site was re-notified in 1984. They remain applicable to Slapton Ley SSSI because it is considered that such operations would have the potential to cause damage to the site.

<p><a name="40430w09.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 As the previous reply explained, information on the Department&#039;s task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews is given in the annual publication, &quot;Public Bodies&quot;. This publication explains that such groups have a short-term focus and when their work comes to an end they are disbanded. These groups are usually created to give expert advice to the Government on a specific issue and are usually expected to remain in operation for less than two years. They are not separate statutory bodies. As such, they have no capacity to employ staff or hold assets in their own right and rely on secretariat and other support from the Department and, sometimes, other interested bodies. They will not normally have any formal separate budget allocated to them, and accountability for expenditure will remain with the body to whom any funding is allocated.

<p><a name="40430w09.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The New Scientist published on 14&nbsp;April a research paper from the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, Australia, which reported that the BIS (Bispectral Index) monitor can aid evaluation of the depth of anaesthesia in a patient undergoing surgery. The research recommended that the BIS monitor be used in the small number of operations where there is a high risk of the patient becoming aware during the operation. A different system has been developed at the University of Glasgow. The Auditory Evoked Potential System measures the depth of anaesthesia in a different way to that of the BIS monitor. As further trials are carried out, our understanding of the safety and efficacy of these systems will increase.

 Police officers have no legal authority to ask gamekeepers to sign a pledge supporting Operation Artemis. Police officers request that pledge but nobody is compelled to make it impracticable to visit each person to ask them to sign a pledge. Operation Artemis is innovative in that it has identified and seeks to raise awareness specifically amongst those who may have a motive for committing offences against Hen Harriers. Given the numbers of breeding birds the Police service considered it possible to visit many of those persons who may have a motive for criminal action. The purpose of such visits is to make people aware of the importance of complying with the criminal law and advising them individually that the Police would be embarking upon enforcement action against those who choose not to comply with the law and commit criminal offences. The request to sign up to Operation Artemis amounts to confirmation that such advice has been received.

 Xenotransplantation is the grafting, or transplantation, of cells, tissues or organs between species. It encompasses a wide range of techniques from the injection of cells to solid organ transplantation. As with all research licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, suffering in xenotransplantation experiments is minimised by removing causes of pain and distress and implementing measures to detect and alleviate any suffering that is caused.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what comparison has been made in take up rates for pension credit between rural and urban areas; and what causes he ascribes to the lower rate of increase in claims for pension credit in inner city areas in comparison to other areas.  [166884]</p>








<p><a name="40430w15.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 It is not possible to provide detailed comparisons of levels of pension credit take-up between rural and urban areas, since estimates of numbers of households eligible for pension credit are not available at any level below that of Government office region. However, the information in the table shows the level of increase in numbers of households receiving pension credit as at 31&nbsp;March 2004 over numbers receiving the minimum income guarantee (MIG) as at 3&nbsp;October 2003, for local authorities classified as either &#039;rural&#039; or &#039;not rural&#039;. This suggests that overall rates of increase in &#039;not rural&#039; areas are in general lower than in their rural counterparts. Overall, there has been an increase of 31&nbsp;per cent. in the number of households receiving pension credit over those receiving MIG and an increase of 37&nbsp;per cent. in the area including Newport, West.

 The Combined Pensions Forecasting service, an initiative jointly pursued by the Department for Work and Pensions and the pensions industry with the support of the Association of British Insurers and National Association of Pension Funds, was introduced following a series of pilot exercises with representatives from the private sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w15.html_para1">
The pilot evaluation was carried out on a confidential basis with employers and pension providers. However, a summary of the results was included in &quot;Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement&quot; (pages 43&#150;45. Command 5677) published in December 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w15.html_para2">
We are currently conducting further research into the combined pension forecast service with results due to be published in the summer of this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w15.html_para3">
Following the pilots, the combined pension forecasting service went live in October 2001. By the end of March 2004, a total of 1.12&nbsp;million Combined Pension Forecasts had been issued. To date over 700 employers and pension providers have expressed an interest in participating in the service. By the end of 2005&#150;06 we aim to have reached 6.3&nbsp;million people.

<p><a name="40430w15.html_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Local authority defined benefit pension schemes will not be liable for the pension protection fund levy as they will never have recourse to PPF assistance. This is because the sponsoring employers of local government pension schemes can never become insolvent.

 The way in which the PPF is organised and the staffing requirements which will flow from that organisational design will ultimately be a decision for the PPF Board. However we are having to make a number of planning assumptions in order to ensure that the PPF is operational by Spring next year.

<p><a name="40430w15.html_spnew5"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Giving people the choice to work up to and beyond State Pension age is critical to ensure the economic prosperity of our society in terms of both work and pensions. Individuals must have the choice and opportunity to work, either full or part time, and save longer towards a financially secure retirement. Flexible working and retirement options can be 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Apr 2004 : Column 1377W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
especially important for individuals who have had interrupted working lives, or have on-going caring responsibilities to balance alongside their work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w15.html_para5">
In &#039;Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement&#039; (December 2002) we set out our proposals to help individuals continue in full time or part time work longer. These included extra back to work help for those over 50, more generous incentives for deferring state pensions, tax rule changes to allow people to draw their occupational pension while continuing to work for the same employer and encouraging occupational pensions to support flexible retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40430w15.html_para6">
The Finance Bill will introduce a simplified pension regime which increases choice and flexibility for both companies operating pension schemes and individuals saving in such schemes. The Finance Bill will mean that it will no longer be necessary for an individual to leave employment in order to access an employer&#039;s occupational pension. The tax rules will no longer dictate that an individual cannot receive their pension and continue to work for that same employer. This increased flexibility will enable people to move from full-time to part-time work and help to make the transition from work to retirement a more smooth and gradual process.
</p>

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures are for Great Britain in 2003&#150;04 price terms rounded to the nearest &#163;100&nbsp;million. It is assumed the change comes into effect from April 2004 and basic State Pension is uprated in line with earnings thereafter.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. Gross costs refer to the additional costs after allowing for National Insurance Fund benefits and non-means tested vote benefits.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income-related benefit offsets are calculated using the DWP policy simulation model and April 2004 benefit rates.<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional income tax revenue is estimated by the Inland Revenue using 2004 tax rates. We are unable to publish any income tax forecast estimates for years beyond that which is 



published in the Financial Statement and Budget Report (currently 2006&#150;07). The income tax estimates for 2004&#150;05 to 2006&#150;07 are based on the 2001&#150;02 Survey of Personal Incomes and are projected in line with March 2004 Budget assumptions. The income tax revenue in 2004&#150;05 is &#163;4.6 billion, for 2005&#150;06 is &#163;4.9 billion and for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;5.2 billion, for illustrative purposes, it is assumed income tax revenue will be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09 although estimates for later years would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty.<br>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings from abolishing the State Second Pension are calculated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with the long term Public Expenditure Survey forecasts. No allowance has been made for changes to contracting out rules.<br>

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings credit is assumed to be frozen, payments uprated by prices, with no new recipients after 2004. Figures for 2004 and 2005 are based on published medium term forecasts, while those for 2006&#150;07 and beyond are based on the illustrative long-term projections of benefit expenditure underlying Annex A of the Budget report. This is a separate saving from the offsets in income related benefits outlined in note 3.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data is not available by Parliamentary Constituency. Stalybridge and Hyde Parliamentary Constituency used to be part of Tameside Social Fund District. This District was involved in a very complex interlocking set of boundary changes affecting an area from North Cumbria to Norfolk, which took place from 



September 2002 to June 2003. Tameside District was combined with part of Stockport interim District in January 2003 to form Stockport and Tameside Jobcentre Plus District. The two areas for which data is given above are thus different, so the data is not comparable<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure Start Maternity Grants were introduced on 27&nbsp;March 2000. The very small number of cases for 1999&#150;2000 has been excluded for data protection reasons.<br>

3. Data is given for all applications and awards, irrespective of whether the application was made by the mother or her partner.<br>
