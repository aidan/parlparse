 Vehicle activated signs (VAS) are designed to address the problem of inappropriate speed at locations where conventional signing has not proved effective.

 The latest quarterly progress report issued by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) indicates that considerable steps have been made towards the Afghanistan Compact benchmark of increasing the amount of electricity available through bilateral power purchase by 2010. Details of this progress, extracted from the report, are listed at Annex A. Given this, we would expect the amount of electricity available through bilateral power purchase to increase by the end of 2010.</p>

DFID is not directly engaged in this sector. The lead donors are the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>

The programme is focused on the rehabilitation of the South East Power System (SEPS), a 100 MW power generation and transmission network. It aims to provide low cost and reliable power to 1.7 million residents in Helmand and Kandahar provinces by the end of 2009. Central to this initiative is a commitment to rehabilitate the Kajaki multi-purpose dam, built by USAID in 1953 on the Helmand River.</p>

The first phase will increase Kajaki&#146;s generation capacity to 51 MW. Funding of $150 million has already been allocated for this work. The UK Government, through DFID, may fund smaller projects in the vicinity of the dam as part of a stabilisation programme.</p>

 Better governance is a central theme of DFID's work in Bangladesh. Programmes range from activities fighting corruption and supporting reform of the civil service and police, to supporting public debates and protecting human rights. Participation of children and young people has most impact on activities that aim to change values in relation to corruption and political governance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="70323w0002.htm_para0"><a name="07032344000227">For example, DFID&#146;s support for Transparency International Bangladesh includes a component called &#145;Youth Engagement and Support&#146; (YES). Over 900 young volunteers deliver nationwide debates, competitions, and rallies against corruption. The recent Anti-Corruption Concert in Dhaka attracted 30,000 young people in a bold public statement against corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="70323w0002.htm_para1"><a name="07032344000228">DFID Bangladesh also supports a series of governance themed programmes and &#145;Question time&#146; debates broadcast in Bangla on BBC World Service radio and local satellite TV. Audiences of 17 million have included around 4 million 16 to 24-year-olds. In 2005, a special live debate went out globally on BBC World TV, with a panel including politicians from both major parties in Bangladesh. Hard hitting governance questions came from audiences of students and young people in both Dhaka and (by satellite) from the British Bangladeshi community in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="70323w0002.htm_para2"><a name="07032344000229">At global level, DFID launched its &#147;Action Plan on Children and Young People&#146;s Participation&#148; in 2004 to promote children and young people&#146;s participation in decisions affecting them. Part of a UK Government initiative &#145;Learning to Listen&#146;, the Action Plan describes how DFID is involving children and young people in its work to reduce world poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="70323w0002.htm_para3"><a name="07032344000230">DFID continues to promote the active role of children and young people in governance programmes. Our work varies at the country level depending on the context. In Sierra Leone, for example, DFID has supported work to engage young people in dialogue on the implementation of the national Poverty Reduction Strategy and the decentralisation process. Given its history, engaging young people is crucial in creating consensus and relieving tensions.</p>

 Recent research by Cranfield university shows that the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing flowers in Kenya and flying them to the UK can be less than a fifth of those grown in Holland because they are not grown in heated greenhouses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70323w0002.htm_para15"><a name="07032344000250">Flowers imported to the UK are subject to increasingly rigorous standards that insist on good agricultural practice and prevent overuse of pesticides. In addition to these standards, flower growers may also adopt codes of conduct that require exacting social and environmental standards to be maintained. UK shoppers have played an important role in demanding better standards as have development agencies including DFID and non-government organisations. Consumer concern has also encouraged Kenyan flower farms to invest in water conservation and other improvements in their environmental practice. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement and we welcome efforts to develop similar codes of practice in Ethiopia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70323w0002.htm_para16"><a name="07032344000251">While we encourage shoppers to demand continuing improvements, it is for the Kenyan and Ethiopian people to decide on the best use of their natural resources.</p>

 There have been three confirmed outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in UK poultry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="70323w0004.htm_para1"><a name="07032344000387">In 1959, H5N1 avian influenza was detected in a flock of chickens in Scotland. In 1991, H5N1 avian influenza was detected in turkeys in Norfolk, England. In both cases the birds were culled and the disease was confined to a single premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="70323w0004.htm_para2"><a name="07032344000388">On the basis of genetic analysis, the H5N1 viruses discovered in 1959 and 1991 were a different strain to the H5N1 Asiatic strain which is currently circulating. The source of neither outbreak was ever firmly established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="70323w0004.htm_para3"><a name="07032344000389">Most recently, on 3 February 2007, H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed at a Bernard Matthews turkey farm in Holton, Suffolk. In accordance with EU legislation, a 3 kilometre Protection Zone, a 10 kilometre Surveillance Zone and a further Restriction Zone around the infected premises were put in place. Extensive guidance was issued to bird keepers in the zones on biosecurity measures to protect their birds from avian influenza. The birds on the infected premises were humanely culled and disposed of according to DEFRA&#146;s published Contingency Plan for Exotic Animal Diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="70323w0004.htm_para4"><a name="07032344000390">Within the area around the infected premises, there were enhanced levels of surveillance of wild birds. While the investigation in the outbreak was under way, 25 wild bird locations comprising 73 sites in the area were regularly patrolled. Laboratory tests were completed on dead wild birds found in the area as well as on live wild bird droppings from the infected premises. All results were negative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="70323w0004.htm_para5"><a name="07032344000391">We are currently developing our investigation into what might have caused the outbreak of avian influenza at Holton. The conclusion of the interim report is that importation from Hungary is the most plausible route. However, investigations are still ongoing and nothing can be ruled out at this time. The final epidemiological report will be published in due course.</p>

 The proposed Bill would allow, under prescribed conditions, a proportion of emissions reductions achieved overseas and paid for by UK entities, to be counted towards the reduction targets in the Bill. This is fully consistent with (and would be limited by) international law, including the Kyoto Protocol and its Marrakech Accords which state, under the flexible mechanism provisions, that countries are permitted to use credits, so long as they are &#147;supplemental to domestic action&#148;, and that domestic action comprises a &#147;significant element&#148; of the efforts made by each country.</p>

 The distance between several secondary sector service targets and the service initial positions in March 2003-04 is moderately correlated to the age/needs index: the PCT health economies with low age/needs had modestly further to travel to achieve the targets. However, numerous parts of the country with low age/needs did not have far to travel in meeting these targets. The correlation is not a perfect one (with correlation co-efficients ranging from -0.28 in the case of distance to the A&amp;E four hour wait and age/needs to -0.13 in the case of distance to the outpatient booking targets and age/needs).

 The principal reason for the change to the capital values of the scheme at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells national health service trust was that in October 2006 the scheme was subject to a Departmental reappraisal. A key part of this was an assessment of the capacity assumptions to ascertain if these were realistic and properly suited to the needs of the local health economy; and a review of the estate in terms of current and planned building stock to ensure optimal use. This led the trust to reconsider how the scheme could best be structured in order to deliver services in the most cost effective way and ensure long-term viability, and the capital value of the scheme was reduced accordingly.</p>

 My Department is fully committed to playing our role in the Government&#146;s strategy on climate change. Recent improvements we have made to the energy efficiency of building regulations, have, for example, reduced energy use by around 40 per cent. Compared to pre-2002 levels. And we have recently consulted on making all new homes zero carbon by 2016&#151;which together with our new Code for Sustainable Homes and our new draft planning policy statement on climate change&#151;could save between 5 and 7 million tonnes of carbon by 2020.

 Communities and Local Government published its energy strategy in May 2006. The strategy was a response to specific energy targets relating to carbon emissions and energy efficiency that Government Departments were mandated to meet. We have worked with the Carbon Trust, using their expertise to assist us in identifying improved methods of working and projects that will enable us to improve our use of energy and to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.

This has shown that communication by local government is important&#151;the more informed people feel the more satisfied they are with their local authority. Similarly, participation and empowerment are significant&#151;the more satisfied people are with opportunities to participate and their level of influence in local decision-making the more satisfied they are with their local authority. Performance is also critical&#151;the higher the CPA star category of an authority and the higher its direction of travel assessment the more satisfied people are.

Exceptions to the rules are made only in exceptional circumstances, and in reaching its decision, the committee considered the importance of British involvement in the Malaysian campaign in the histories both of Malaysia and the UK in the years 1957-66, the generous gesture by the King and Government of Malaysia, as well the principles on which the British Honours System is based. Similar exceptions were made for medals from the Saudi and Kuwaiti Governments after the First Gulf War.</p>
