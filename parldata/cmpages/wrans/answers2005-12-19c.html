<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51219w02.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Buck </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 December 2005]:</i> Not all foreign operated flights into the UK require prior permission from the Secretary of State for Transport. Those stopping for non-traffic purposes (e.g. to refuel) and privately operated flights do not require prior permission. Where operators of foreign registered aircraft are required to seek permission to land from the Secretary of State in order to comply with Article 138 of the Air Navigation Order 2005, it is apparent from their applications whether the purpose of the flight is to carry passengers or cargo. Flights carrying dangerous goods or munitions of war are required to seek specific authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority.

 The &quot;Future Air Transport&quot; White Paper published in December 2003 sets out a 30-year strategic framework for the development of airport capacity in the UK.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reasons the Postal Services Act 2000 does not require the Post Office to compensate for the cost of the postage when a package is lost.  [38110]</p>




<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51219w11.html_spnew10"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 Section 89 of the Postal Services Act 2000 enables universal service providers (currently only Royal Mail) to make schemes setting out the terms and conditions for their provision of universal postal services. These schemes include provision for compensation payments for loss etc. Postcomm, the independent regulator, is responsible for enforcing such schemes (including on compensation) through the licensing regime also created by the Act.

<p>
<a name="51219w11.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_59">The powers required for Royal Mail to make such schemes were already in place under previous postal services legislation before the creation of the 2000 Act. Rather than introduce new arrangements, when adequate mechanisms already existed, the Postal Services Act 2000 merely mirrored previous arrangements updating them only to take into account the new framework and references for postal services envisaged by the 2000 Act (i.e. the potential for more universal service providers in addition to Royal Mail and the licensing regime).

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make representations to British Telecom on not holding consumers responsible for telephone charges due to rogue dialling; if he will introduce legislation to protect consumers from the effects of rogue dialling; and if he will ask the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information to re-open an investigation of the role of premium media communication and other companies in rogue dialling.  [33181]</p>




<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51219w12.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) has put in place a prior permission scheme for Premium Rate diallers. This makes it possible to assess the dialler software to be used for proposed services, and if appropriate to prohibit their release. The independent regulator for electronic communications, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), is currently consulting on extending this scheme to enable ICSTIS to take action against any rogue dialler irrespective of the telephone number or call charge used. Implementing a recommendation from Ofcom&#039;s Report into the Regulation of Premium Rate Services, this Department has just increased the maximum fine for breaches of the ICSTIS Code, and ICSTIS intends to review its sanctions policy early in 2006. ICSTIS has also put in place a key recommendation from the report to slow the money-flow to those that abuse the premium rate services charging mechanism. This obliges telecoms companies not to make payments to premium rate service providers for at least 30 days after calls have been made. This gives ICSTIS more time to identify breaches of its Code and enables ICSTIS to direct telecoms companies to withhold funds pending the outcome of investigations.

As ICSTIS has not had any complaints since May, Premium Media Communications may have withdrawn from the UK dialler market. However ICSTIS plans to write to this company shortly to give it notice of the withdrawal of its licence to operate diallers. This means that no phone company can give Premium Media Communications premium rate numbers for dialler services.

The criteria clearly set out, among other considerations, our commitment to assess the risk that exports might be diverted under undesirable conditions, used for internal repression, external aggression, to abuse human rights, or the risk of reverse engineering or unintended technology transfer.

 The focus of the United Kingdom Government&#039;s space policy is on civil and scientific uses. However, we also derive important security benefits from its military use. Like many countries, the UK uses satellites for a wide range of military functions such as secure communications, meteorological predictions and in the effective monitoring of various arms control treaties. This military use of space is distinct from the deployment of weapons in space. The UK Government has no plans to deploy weapons in space.

 The cost of prisoners&#039; telephone calls is reviewed quarterly. Call rates are no longer linked to public payphone rates, they are agreed under the terms of the contract with BT which allows the Prison Service to set appropriate charges, taking account of the pattern of calls, as well as maintenance costs. The minimum charge, which is lower than that for public phones, reflects the fact that prisoners&#039; calls tend to be of short duration.

 The United Kingdom is a signatory to two multi-party prisoner transfer agreements; the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, and the Commonwealth Scheme for the Transfer of Convicted Offenders. In addition, the Government have concluded bilateral prisoner transfer agreements with 18 countries. The UK has prisoner transfer agreements with a total of 97 countries and territories and is in regular contact with the Governments concerned about the transfer of individual prisoners.

<p>
<a name="51219w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_74">Prisoner transfer under these agreements is voluntary; the consent of both states involved, and of the prisoner concerned, is required before repatriation can take place. In 2004, 107 prisoners were transferred from prisons in England and Wales to other countries to continue serving their sentences.

<a name="stpa_75">The systems are not intended as a means of assisting the Youth Justice Board&#039;s performance monitors to monitor the contractors&#039; performance. However, the monitors do, on occasion, make use of the systems for that purpose. For example, if a monitor has concerns that an incident report is unclear, or if the report raises doubts whether the incident has been handled correctly, he or she may decide to view the footage of the incident. Or if a young person makes a complaint about an incident at the centre, the monitor may choose to view the relevant footage to enable him or her to consider the complaint.

 The Home Office routinely monitors the effectiveness of sentencing in reducing re-offending through examining reconviction data. Records from the Police National Computer are used to ascertain whether sampled cohorts of offenders have been convicted of further offences during the two year period (one year for juvenile offenders) either following the imposition of sentence (in the case of community sentences or fines) or following release from prison (in the case of custodial sentences).

 The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) have been in place since 2001 and have already made a significant contribution to public protection. Under the MAPPA, the police, probation and prison services, supported by additional agencies including housing, health and social services, combine forces to manage the risk to the public posed by sexual and violent offenders. Those &quot;critical few&quot; offenders that pose the highest risk are referred to a Multi-Agency Public Protection Panel (MAPPP), where their cases are regularly scrutinised by senior representatives of local agencies.

 Bovine TB does affect both cats and ferrets. The incidence seems low, but TB in these species is not notifiable. So far this year in Great Britain, the Veterinary Laboratory Agency has diagnosed nine cases of bovine TB in cats, and one case in a ferret. Of these, spoligotype 13 has been isolated from one cat, and the ferret. Both of these animals came from the East Sussex area.

The Environment Agency has established a website for intensive livestock operators concerning PPC at http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1224648/1224695/1116263/?version=1&lang=&#95;e

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51219w26.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 In 2004, there were in excess of 200 generating stations utilising landfill methane in the UK. The Government does not hold statistics determining whether these landfill gas utilisation plants are located on closed landfill sites or operational ones. There are about 900 of the latter. According to DTI statistics, the total installed generating capacity at landfill sites in 2004 was 722 MW. Research for Defra by Colder Associates indicates that the volume of methane captured for electricity generation was about 1,070 thousand tonnes (kT) in 2004. An estimated additional 1,307 kt methane was captured and flared at landfill sites. This means that electricity generation and flaring saved greenhouse gas emissions of about 6 million tonnes carbon equivalent (MtC equiv), and about 7.5 MtC equiv, respectively. The total saving from capture was therefore about 13.5 MtC equiv. The generating plant produced about 4 TWh of electricity, equivalent to saving a further 0.5 million MtC equiv due to reduced emissions at power stations.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to promote the separate collection and recycling of paper and other materials from small and medium-sized businesses; whether her Department has set targets for such recycling; and if she will make a statement.  [34860]</p>




<p><a name="st_147"><a name="51219w28.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 12 December 2005]:</i> The Government aim to have reduced the amount of commercial and industrial waste going to landfill to 85 per cent. of the 1998 level by 2005. The recent Environment Agency report, published this month, showed waste recovery rates were at record levels in 2004, with 53 per cent. of all business waste recycled or re-used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w28.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_127">The main incentive for businesses to recycle more is economic. The landfill tax is increasing the cost of waste disposal and thus providing the waste management industry with a strong incentive to offer separate collection facilities for businesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w28.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_128">&#163;43 million from the landfill tax escalator was fed back into business via the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) programme to fund a variety of initiatives such as Envirowise, which advises and supports businesses who want to improve their recycling performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w28.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_129">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 have set targets to obligated businesses for recycling paper packaging waste, peaking at 70 per cent. in 2008. To create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials such as paper, Government have established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). Clean source separation of paper and other recyclates is a well recognised factor in obtaining best prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w28.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_130">WRAP is currently undertaking a study aimed at finding ways to overcome the barriers currently inhibiting adequate provision of recycling services for SMEs, and to improve their capacity to recycle more waste. The study is funded by BREW. WRAP intend to deliver a series of trials to collect materials for recycling from SMEs that presently receive no recycling services. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Dec 2005 : Column 2391W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Trials are expected to continue until summer 2006 after which WRAP will produce a final feasibility study report based on their findings.

 In November 2004 the Government commissioned its Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET) to examine five forest certification schemes to determine whether they provide credible assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources as defined in the model contract condition and specification used by central Government Departments. One of the schemes assessed was the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) which sets forest management and certification requirements for national bodies, endorsed by PEFC, to adopt and apply to suit local conditions. PEFC has endorsed the Australian Forestry Standard (AFS) which means that forests and products that derive from the trees harvested in those forests that are certified as operating to the AFS can be marketed under the PEFC label.

PEFC was judged not to have sufficient requirements for involving all relevant interest groups in the forest standard setting and forest management auditing process. This was judged to be a system failure at the international scheme level and was not influenced by actual situations at a national level. No national body was examined and there was no assessment of actual performance on the ground. PEFC has since changed its scheme requirements and been reassessed as providing a credible system, on paper, for assuring sustainable timber production as defined in Government contracts. However, the UK Government, aware that scheme changes at the international level are meaningless if not adopted nationally, gave notice that it would check to see that national PEFC bodies had implemented changes to their published requirements. CPET plans to make such checks in January 2006.

Several academies have shown remarkable improvements in their GCSE results since opening. The City Academy in Bristol, for example, has shown an increase of 25 per cent. in the number of pupils achieving five grades A* to C in just two years. Four other academies have shown increases of greater than 20 per cent. since opening.

<a name="stpa_149">The Government&#039;s proposals to establish trust schools represent an extension of the freedom to innovate to schools outside those areas currently being targeted by the academies programme. The creation of trust schools will assist in offering more and better choice and diversity in the schools system for parents and pupils. Trust schools will build on the long tradition of voluntary schools which are backed by trusts, and also on the successful experience of specialist schools and academies in working with sponsors from the voluntary, not-for-profit and private sectors. The success of specialist schools in their value-added performance is attested by research by Professor David Jesson, most recently his study: &#039;Educational outcomes and value added by specialist schools, 2004&#039;.

 Academies are situated in areas of deprivation and/or educational need. The main criteria for consideration of an Academy is for it to be sited in an area of historically weak educational performance and that the local authority area concerned is listed in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister statistics on deprivation. Other factors such as poor ratings by OFSTED and low admission numbers for predecessor schools are sometimes considered, but it is the academic under-achievement and deprivation that are of primary importance. Some Academies are being established in areas not considered as deprived overall but with particular enclaves of deprivation or low attainment.

 The purpose of the annual parents&#039; meeting was to provide an opportunity for a discussion of the manner in which the school had been conducted, and of any other matters relating to the school raised by the parents. Many meetings were very poorly attended and, despite adopting various innovative strategies to improve turnout, it still proved difficult, in many schools, to generate enthusiasm for attending the meetings. The new school profile will give parents a broader and deeper understanding of what a school is doing. The removal of the requirement to hold an annual parents&#039; meeting allows governors to manage their own relationship and communications with parents, to better reflect local circumstances, this may include choosing to hold a meeting.

 My Department allocates funds for further education (FE) colleges to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) which is the planning and funding body for post-16 education and training in England. For FE the LSC distributes funds regionally and local offices allocate funds to providers based on locally agreed development plans. I can confirm that the LSC will fund these plans. This guarantee that college plans will be funded has been widely welcomed by the sector as ensuring stability and provides confidence that colleges can make commitments for the year based on assured funding levels. This guarantee means that those colleges recruiting above their agreed plans cannot expect to receive additional funding in the current year over and above the levels they have agreed with the LSC.

 Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children are fundamental duties for maintained nursery schools and private and independent nurseries. Providers are required to comply with local child protection procedures and to have a written statement of the arrangements in place for the protection of children. The statement must state staff responsibilities for child protection and include procedures to be followed in the event of allegations being made against a member of staff or volunteer. The statement should be based on the procedures laid out in the Government booklet &quot;What to do if You&#039;re Worried a Child Is Being Abused&#151;Summary&quot;. This booklet lays out clearly the circumstances when information about child abuse should be passed on to the relevant authorities in confidence.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">Jobcentre Plus advisors use a networked version of the Departmental Integrated Benefits Information System (IBIS) computer system to help them provide &#039;Better-off in work advice to customers. This IT tool provides a comprehensive calculation across the full range of income-based benefits and tax credits. The user either enters the amount of benefit known to be in payment, or lets the system calculate current entitlements based on the information provided by the customer. The system then allows a &#039;what if scenario to be entered to compare to the current position, and this will most typically involve a customer&#039;s prospective job details. Such events often involve a number of consequential changes such as the addition of travelling expenses and childcare and the IBIS system prompts for all of these to be considered and captured where appropriate.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Once all of the additional information has been entered for the prospective change, the system performs another series of calculations to show estimated entitlements. It also performs a financial comparison between the current actual position and the (typically) in work estimate. This is known as the Better Off calculation and shows a customer exactly how much per week they will gain or loose by taking a particular job.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">With regard to accuracy, we take this very seriously and regularly update the IBIS system in line with, for example, changes to benefit rates. When we have investigated cases where the advice may have appeared incorrect, we have generally found this to have been caused either by incorrect or incomplete information being supplied by the customer, or when circumstances have changed between the advice being given and, for example, the take up of a job.</p>

However, departmental administrative data indicates that if a full basic state pension were paid to those who have the equivalent of at least 10 qualifying years, approximately 85 per cent. of newly retired women in March 2005 might receive the full basic pension. This may overestimate the reduction in qualifying years needed for a particular proportion of newly retired women to receive a full BSP in their own right, due to the way in which HRP interacts with qualifying years.

<p>
1. The answer is based on 2004&#150;05 departmental administrative data which provides information about the amount of basic state pension (BSP) in payment.
2. The answer includes an approximation of the proportion of women at state pension age in March 2005 who made a late claim or deferred their state pension entitlement.
3. Currently women normally need 39 qualifying years for a full BSP and 10 qualifying years to get the minimum BSP, at least one year must derive from paid NICs. In 2020, when SPA for women is raised to age 65, the number of qualifying years for women will equalise with men, increasing to 44 for the full BSP and 11 qualifying years for the minimum BSP (which is 25 per cent. of the required qualifying years for a full BSP over a person&#039;s working life). The administrative data does not hold information on the entitlements of those who fail to qualify for the minimum BSP.
4. The figure is based on those women with the equivalent of 10 or more qualifying years. This includes women who have at least 10 qualifying years from paid Nl contributions, or a combination of contributions and Nl credits as well as women who have some home responsibilities protection HRP on their record. For example, a women with 19 years of HRP and 5 years of paid contributions is entitled to the same amount of BSP as a person with 10 years of paid contributions only.
5. The data set does not break down how the BSP is accrued (for example the number of years of paid contributions, credits or HRP). For this reason, the answer should be treated as approximate only.
6. The answer is based on women aged 60 in March 2005 resident in Great Britain.

Hence the change of the state retirement pension age to 65 years for women, with associated rises in the qualifying age for benefits such as pension credit or winter fuel payments, is expected to lead to a net saving in benefit expenditure of &#163;10.1 billion in the year 2020 (figures do not sum exactly due to rounding).

A strict permitting process is in place, and visits to the Islands require the permission of the Commissioner for SGSSI. No cruise ship may land passengers other than at Grytviken/King Edward Point without being a member of IAATO. All IAATO vessels follow the Antarctic Treaty Environmental Protocol guidelines while at GSSI. Expeditions to SGSSI are vetted by an independent panel of experts, which considers the potential impact on wildlife and the environment. The GSGSSI has banned the use of helicopters for the purpose of tourism, and any other flying is strictly regulated. The GSGSSI has closed many areas of South Georgia to tourists in order that wildlife should remain undisturbed.

 The Government consider the promotion of Human Rights, Democracy and Good Governance as interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The Foreign and Commonwealth Offices&#039;s approach to this task has been to mainstream this work throughout relevant Global Opportunities Fund (GOF) programmes. This includes the Sustainable Development programme (formerly Human Rights, Democracy and Good Governance), which incorporates the grant in aid to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, as well as the Reuniting Europe, Engaging with the Islamic World and Economic Governance (formerly Emerging Markets) programmes. The criteria for supporting projects for the promotion of democracy under GOF programmes are to strengthen political parties, parliaments, civil society and other institutions of democracy; support increased participation by the disenfranchised, especially women, ethnic minorities and the disabled, in accordance with principles of equality, diversity and non-discrimination; and to promote freedom of expression that underpins the exercise of democracy. On human rights, the GOF programmes seek to support projects that combat torture, the death penalty and promote child rights. We seek to promote good governance by supporting projects that enhance the rule of law, e.g. to enhance separation of powers, independent and professional judiciaries and legal services, access to justice and independent complaint mechanisms, such as ombudsmen.

<a name="stpa_79">Sierra Leonean institutions remain generally weak and lacking in capacity. Much has been achieved since the end of hostilities in 2002, but much work remains. An Anti-Corruption Commission is functioning well. A civil service reform programme is under way. Local councils exist, but lack capacity and resources. The judiciary is overstretched and under-resourced. Parliament lacks the necessary resources to allow it to exercise full powers of oversight. The UK is assisting in the development of democratic institutions, including assistance to the judiciary and police through a &#163;25 million project, assistance to the civil service reform programme and wide-ranging governance and anti-corruption support. But the 11 years of civil war have left enormous deficits in institutional capacity, which is slow to recover.

 We recognise the consequences that the reforms to the EU Sugar Regime agreed at the 24 November Agriculture Council may have on some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers with preferential access to the EU market. However, we welcome the overall agreement in the broader context of reforming the EU&#039;s Common Agricultural Policy and the benefits this will bring to many developing countries. Furthermore, the sugar reforms will see a smaller price cut and a longer adjustment period than originally proposed. This will give the ACP a better opportunity to adapt to the reforms.

<a name="stpa_85">In September 2003, the Department for International Development (DfID) commissioned consultants (LMC International Ltd) to produce an independent report into the impact that EU sugar reform would have by 2015 on the ACP countries that are party to the Sugar Protocol. This work was updated in June 2005, after the Commission put forward its proposals but before agreement was reached on the shape of the reforms. It therefore assumes a 39 per cent. price cut rather than the actual 36 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w58.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_86">More recent assessments have been carried out by European Commission funded consultants, who again assumed a 39 per cent. price cut. For example, in Jamaica the consultants concluded that this would reduce the value of sugar export revenues from 6.9 per cent. of total exports to 4.9 per cent. and reduce GDP by 0.8 per cent. over four years.

 The exploitation of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)&#039;s forests has the potential to generate significant benefits for the country&#039;s people. But forestry resources need to be managed in a transparent and environmentally sustainable way, which both generates revenues and promotes the rights and livelihoods of forest dwellers. The UK is advocating this balanced approach to forest management in its engagement with all partners working on the issue in the DRC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w62.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_118">The World Bank provided support for development of the new DRC forestry code. The code is based on a forest classification system, which will delineate areas for commercial exploitation and community forestry. The code also provides for rights of access for traditional users, the transparent auctioning of forest concessions and the decentralised allocation of revenues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w62.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">Donors (led by the World Bank and the EC) are now discussing how best to support the implementation of the code. A multi-donor trust fund is planned. At the same time, and in recognition of the lack of implementation capacity on the ground, the World Bank is stressing the need to curb illegal and unsustainable exploitation. Two conditions; the continuation of the moratorium on the granting of new forestry concessions and a legal review of existing concessions, were attached to the most recent tranche of World Bank budget support. DFID supports this approach.

 Salaries for soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC&#039;s) armed forces come from the DRC&#039;s national budget, not from donor funds. The UK has been active, however, in urging the Government of the DRC to ensure that its soldiers receive their salaries. A properly integrated, paid and trained national army is essential for consolidating peace and security in the DRC and the whole Great Lakes region. At present, soldiers rarely receive their salaries, creating insecurity for all as they prey on civilians to make ends meet.

<a name="51219w62.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_121">While in the in DRC in November, I advised President Kabila that the UK (through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool) would support the basic needs (sanitation and accommodation) of soldiers in newly integrated brigades. However, this support is conditional on the DRC Government ensuring that soldiers are properly paid, including through implementing the recommendations of the EU&#039;s advisory mission on Security Sector Reform (SSR). One of the key strands of this work is a project to reform the army pay system. It will see advisers seconded to each integrated brigade to oversee payment of the soldiers&#039; salaries and to help ensure that the DRC&#039;s own money reaches the people it was destined for and is not diverted by corrupt senior officers. We expect the Government of the DRC to approve the report&#039;s recommendations shortly.

<p><a name="st_142"><a name="51219w62.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK is concerned by the limited progress made by the demobilisation process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Progress is slow because too few soldiers associated with the different &quot;composants&quot; of the transitional government are being encouraged and facilitated to enter the process. The UK, with the rest of the International Community, continues to press the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to accelerate its efforts in the implementation of the demobilisation and re-integration process. I personally urged President Kabila and other members of the transitional government to step up army integration and demobilisation of soldiers during my recent visit to Democratic Republic of Congo.

<a name="stpa_122">The International Committee Accompanying the Transition process in the DRC (CIAT)&#151;in which the UK is a very active member) has repeatedly pushed the Congolese transitional government for more progress in this area. The CIAT released a very strong statement in early December urging the Government of the DRC to speed up both the integration of the army and demobilisation of ex-combatants. The international community, including the UK, are providing substantial direct support to the demobilisation process. The UK is putting $25 million over 5 years into the World Bank&#039;s Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (MDRP), covering nine countries including the DRC.

 DFID is the second largest bilateral donor to Kenya. In 2004&#150;05, DFID spent &#163;39 million. This year we will spend &#163;50 million. Our primary aim is to support the implementation of the Government of Kenya&#039;s Economic Recovery Strategy. Our focus is on supporting accountable service delivery, stimulating pro-poor growth, tackling HIV/AIDS and working to improve donor effectiveness. Around 75 per cent. of our spending supports the health and education sectors. Kenya is making excellent progress towards the education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

DFID worked with the Government of Kenya to help produce a credible anti-corruption action plan. Against this, they have already passed Procurement and Privatisation Bills, fully staffed the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, and have developed a code of ethics for Ministers. While the fight against corruption will be hard, these measures should begin to reduce the opportunities for grand corruption; but leadership in this fight remains equivocal and no senior Ministers have yet been asked to take responsibility for corrupt deals. DFID will continue to work with the key anti-corruption institutions, civil society, and the private sector, to continue the pressure in the fight against corruption while, at the same time, helping to deliver benefits to poor people.

 The UK Government deplores the use of child soldiers. Child abduction is the rebel Lord&#039;s Resistance Army&#039;s (LRA) principle recruitment method. Although a recent World Health Organisation Survey in parts of northern Uganda indicated a significant decline in LRA abduction rates in 2005, the problem remains serious. Large numbers of children are forced to commute into town centres at night to avoid abduction by the LRA. We are helping UNICEF provide safe shelters in which these children can sleep. We are also helping UNICEF re-integrate child soldiers that escape or are rescued from the LRA through counselling, help with tracing families and specific initiatives to deal with the social challenges of re-integration.

<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51219w73.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 The principle of random selection from the electoral register should mean that the composition of juries, whether in terms of ethnic background, age, gender, sexuality or religion is broadly representative of the general population. Jurors are summoned from geographic catchment areas within 1&#189; hours travelling distance from the Court. The Government is committed to ensuring that juries reflect the full diversity of the communities they serve. The Electoral Administration Bill currently before Parliament includes provisions aimed at improving both the quality and the coverage of the electoral register. In addition the &quot;Get London Registered&quot; campaign will target young people and black and ethnic minority groups to ensure that they are properly represented on electoral registers.

The budget data for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 are a mix of FRS 17 and non-FRS 17.

Previously settlements have been based on the latest available mid-year estimates as the dominant drivers. This change should provide more support for areas experiencing rapid population growth. The population projections are prepared by the Office for National Statistics using a trend-based methodology which projects forward the population (using 2003 mid-year population estimates as the starting point) into the future.

<i>[pursuant to the reply, 16 November 2005, Official Report, c.1275&#150;78]:</i> The available estimates are from Land Use Change Statistics, shown in the following tables. The numbers and table titles are unchanged but the units for the tables headed &quot;New dwellings within 1997 designated green belt&quot;, given previously as &quot;hectares&quot;, are corrected to &quot;dwellings&quot;. The order of the tables has also been changed to follow the order of the questions. The estimates for 2003 are provisional and are subject to revision. Figures are not shown for 1999 as the data received for that year were incomplete. Figures for 1997 to 2000 reflect planning policies and decisions made before this Government took office.

With reference to town centres, &quot;Planning for Town Centres, Guidance on Design and Implementation tools&quot;, which accompanies Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 6 &quot;Planning for town centres&quot;, states that local authorities should seek to improve the quality, convenience and safety of access on foot, by bicycle and public transport.

 Translink has advised that the Belfast to Londonderry railway line has 27 unmanned public road crossings and 92 private crossings between Ballymena and Ballykelly.

<a name="stpa_272">Public road crossings are checked at least twice a week by track patrol staff to ensure that all equipment is intact and functioning, and are also subject to a monthly inspection and maintenance regime by signalling technicians. There is also an annual safety examination of all public road crossings by a combined group of inspectors from NI Railways, PSNI and DRD Roads Service.

<a name="stpa_273">In addition to the routine inspections carried out by Northern Ireland Railways, a &#039;Crossings Management Group&#039; consisting of experts from within NI Railways and the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company meets bi-monthly and prioritises crossings for additional inspection and surveys based on a combination of risk and reports of misuse.

 The independently managed mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has supported about 30 individual studies to investigate the potential health effects of radiofrequency (RF) exposures from mobile phone technology. The programme has commissioned a study of cancer incidence in pre-school children living near mobile phone base stations compared with those living further away. Infants and young children are more likely to be home-based and this is the reason why the MTHR childhood cancer study has, to date, been the only scientifically viable option for epidemiology around base stations. Studies of older children and adults have not been recommended because proximity to base stations has been shown to be a poor representation of exposure to RF fields. The MTHR studies concentrate largely on the exposures from the mobile phone handsets because these exposures are considerably higher than those from base stations. A description of the programme and the individual studies can be found on its web site www.mthr.org.uk.
