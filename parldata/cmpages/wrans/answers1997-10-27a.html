<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Minister without Portfolio how long the millennium dome will remain in place. [12597]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The millennium experience dome will have a greatly enhanced lifespan following the decision to use PTFE-coated glass fibre for the roof. The Government are now considering its potential long-term uses.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Minister without Portfolio (1) what representations he has received about the use of PVC in the millennium dome; [12737]
<P>
<UL>(2) what additives the PVC coating of the millennium dome will contain. [12739]
<P>
(3) what discussions have taken place with the European Commission about the use of PVC for the coating of the millennium dome; [12598]
<P>
(4) what evidence he has evaluated on PVC as an environmentally suitable material for use in coating the millennium dome; [12596]
<P>
(5) what examination has been carried out of the restrictions on the use of PVC in other European countries; [12595]
<P>
(6) where the PVC coating of the millennium dome will be manufactured. [12738]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 On 22 August 1997, the New Millennium Experience Company--NMEC--announced its decision to change the roofing material of the Millennium Experience dome from PVC-coated polyester to PTFE-coated glass fibre. The reason for the change was to give the dome a greatly enhanced lifespan, thereby assisting delivery of the Government's aim to ensure an enduring legacy from the millennium experience. The extra longevity and durability of the dome's roof covering as a result of the change to PTFE-coated glass fibre will increase significantly the legacy options which can be considered.
<P>

<a name="71027w01.html_para0">As part of its earlier considerations about PVC-coated polyester, the NMEC required a full environmental review, taking account of all available information in the UK, Europe and elsewhere, of the material's manufacture and disposal. The NMEC was satisfied that the material met all UK and EU environmental requirements. The company had no discussions with the European Commission but did receive representations about the use and safety of PCV from members of the public, from environmental groups including Greenpeace, and from companies involved in the chemical industry. PTFE-coated glass fibre, which is widely used across the world on large tensile roof structures, does not contain plasticising additives and also meets all UK and EU environmental requirements.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will assess the implications for the legal system of the United Kingdom of ratification of the treaty of Amsterdam, with particular reference to likely changes in court and legal procedures. [12812]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam will not affect court procedures in the United Kingdom. Under the treaty, civil judicial co-operation is transferred to the Community pillar, but it will not involve the United Kingdom unless we specifically choose to opt into a particular measure or measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have set out our proposals on the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into United Kingdom law in the White Paper, "Rights Brought Home," published on 24 October. The White Paper explains the provisions of the Human Rights Bill introduced in another place on 23 October. As regards the treaty of Amsterdam, I refer the hon.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A number of Government Departments are co-operating closely to investigate the whole of the house buying process. My own Department is concentrating on the problem of gazumping with the help of the various institutions whose members provide professional services in the housing market. The various strands of work are being co-ordinated by a ministerial working group comprising Ms Hilary Armstrong, Minister for Local Government Housing, Mr. Nigel Griffiths, Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, myself as Chairman and key officials from our Departments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 The latest available figures show that there are around 1.7 million people employed in tourism-related industries in Great Britain. The revenue

<P><I>27 Oct 1997 : Column: 651</I><P>
generated by tourism in the United Kingdom is estimated to be &#163;40 billion for 1996. This is equivalent to approximately 5 per cent. of gross domestic product.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans his Department has to develop a strategy for further development of the United Kingdom tourism industry. [12519]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Clarke: </B> 
 The Government believe that the further development of tourism can best be achieved by working in full partnership with the industry, local authorities, tourist boards and others. On 10 October we therefore announced an expanded role for the Tourism Forum and the creation of a new forum working group on strategic planning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Responsibility for the transmission arrangements for television services in the United Kingdom rest with the BBC and the Independent Television Commission. I have been advised that, at present, 98.3 per cent. of the population of Wales has access to television signals from a Welsh transmitter, an English transmitter, or both, which constitute a technically adequate service according to the technical standards agreed by the broadcasters. A total of 96.8 per cent. of the population of Wales can receive HTV, 97.2 per cent. BBC1 Wales and 96.8 per cent. can receive both services.

 My Department has made no estimate of the number of voluntary-managed tennis clubs in England and Wales or the type of tenure they might have. However, I am pleased that the Lawn Tennis Association is carrying out a comprehensive survey which should address these issues. The results will be available next year.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has purchased the Integra Accounting package from GC McKeown Ltd. to perform the processing of payments for goods and services.
<P>

<a name="71027w01.html_para1">The work to process the payments is undertaken by the Department with some functions outsourced to CSL Managed Services Ltd. It has no co-operative arrangements with other Departments. The Department orders the goods and services, certifies the invoices and enters the information into the computer system. CSL arranges for payment either by payable order, banker's automated clearing service or clearing house automated payment service on behalf of the Department. The cost of implementing the new system during 1996-97 was &#163;112,609 including the cost of some sub-contractors, whilst the cost of the work performed by CSL during 1996-97 was &#163;101,850.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> procedure and <i>(b)</i> financial effect of VAT base capping in respect of the United Kingdom's contribution to the European Union general budget for 1998. [12283]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 VAT capping was first introduced for the EC budget in 1988, at a rate of 55 per cent. of 1 per cent. of each member state's gross national product. 



<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1997 : Column: 654</I><P>
Under the current own resources decision the VAT capping rate is being reduced progressively from 55 per cent. in 1994 to 50 per cent. in 1999. The 50 per cent. rate has applied to Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal since 1995. The VAT capping arrangements are broadly neutral for the UK because any change resulting from the application of the capping mechanism is offset a year in arrears by an equal but opposite change to our abatement.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 None. The current EC VAT system, with tax accruing in the member state of consumption for intra-Community transactions, remains in force in the absence of unanimous agreement to change it. The European Commission has yet to produce legislative proposals for changes to the current system, and so discussions on the merits or otherwise of a move to an origin-based system have not even begun. The Government, while supportive of efforts to simplify and modernise the current EC VAT system, is opposed to further unnecessary harmonisation at the Community level.

 The sterling value of the United Kingdom (UK) abatement contained in the 1998 preliminary draft budget--2,066 mecu--will be determined by the pound/ecu exchange rate which applies at the end of this calendar year. If the rate were to remain at the level it was at on 30 September--&#163;1 = 1.4501 ecu--the reduction to the UK's contribution due to the abatement would be &#163;1,425 million in 1998.

Figures for total contributions and UK gross contribution before abatement (mecu) taken from: 1996 Supplementary and Amending Budget; 1997 draft Supplementary and Amending Budget: 1998 Draft Budget. The sterling equivalent of the UK figures have been derived by converting at the following exchange rates:<P>

1996 &#163;1 = 1.2467 ecu; 1997 &#163; = 1.3564 ecu; 1998 &#163; = 1.4501 ecu.<P>

<a name="71027w02.html_para5">The UK's net contribution for 1996, expressed in sterling and based on the cash transactions which took place during the year, was &#163;2,352 million. The current estimate on the same basis for 1997 is &#163;1,342 million. These net contribution figures include adjustments and corrections made in respect of our VAT and GNP-based contributions, of our abatement and of Community spending for earlier years. The figures are thus not directly comparable to the gross revenue raised in respect of particular Community budgets.
<P>

<a name="71027w02.html_para6">As is usual, the Government will provide an estimate of the net contribution for the Community budgetary year 1998 in the annual White Paper "Statement on the Community Budget", once the Budget for that year has been adopted and when the revenue and spending requirements for the year are known.

<a name="71027w02.html_para7">The figures in the table and the amounts for the net contribution demonstrate the wide fluctuation to which the UK's contributions to the EC budget are subject. These fluctuations are principally due to a range of technical factors such as the timing of our payments and receipts, adjustments and corrections to our contributions in earlier years, exchange rate movements and changes and corrections in the value of the UK's abatement.

I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the effects of and research into oleoresin capsicum as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.
<BR>
Oleoresin capsicum (OC) is a natural oil of the chilli pepper. Chemically, it is a complex mixture of over one hundred volatile compounds, in which capsaicin is a principle compound. The Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of DERA at Porton Down has not conducted any practical research on oleoresin capsicum, but it has used capsaicin as a positive control in a number of animal tissue studies designed to evaluate the relative sensory irritancy of a number of compounds.
<BR>
As far as the effects of oleoresin capsicum on human health are concerned, it is reported in the technical literature that short term exposure causes pain and irritation of the membranes lining the eyes, nose and mouth. Blistering and a rash have been shown to occur after chronic or prolonged exposure of the skin. Ingestion of capsicum may cause acute stinging of the lips, tongue and mouth, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1997 : Column: 660</I><P>
and may lead to vomiting and diarrhoea with large doses. Inhalation of the vapours may also cause significant irritation of the airways and prolonged cough.
<BR>
In the long-term, a single acute exposure to OC may affect the temperature regulatory mechanisms of the body and can affect the neurological system producing long-term insensitivity to pain.

I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the evaluation of the effects of short-term exposure to mustard gas as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.
<BR>
Mustard gas, (bis (2-chloroeythyl) sulphide), belongs to a group of chemical warfare agents known as vesicant or blistering agents.
<BR>
DERA's evaluation, based on historical evidence including casualty reports from the First World War and more recent nursing of Iranian patients in the UK in the mid-1980s, indicates that short term exposure to mustard gas affects the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Additionally, the evidence available from literature and practical studies is that the gastrointestinal tract, reproductive organs and bone marrow are affected if high doses are absorbed into the body. The effects on the skin consist of reddening followed by blistering; similar effects are seen at the other affected areas. Once the blisters rupture, ulceration of the skin follows; these injuries take a long while to heal. The effects on the eyes, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract are similar to those seen in the skin. Initially the tissues become inflamed and swollen. Eventually, the protective membranes break down and areas of ulceration result.

Lewisite is one of a group of chemical warfare agents known as vesicants or blistering agents.
<BR>
The Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of DERA's evaluation based on US human studies from the 1940s and continuing Porton Down animal studies of the effects of short-term exposure to lewisite are that both liquid and vapour forms result in chemical burns to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Lewisite injuries are immediately painful. The potential for widespread damage to the internal organs is significant.

Since 1967 some research into perfluorisobutene has been undertaken at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of DERA at Porton Down to assess whether its use as a chemical weapon would pose a potential hazard to the UK Armed Forces. This research encompassed: material producibility, material toxicity, an assessment of material dispersion, the performance of UK CBD protective equipment in providing protection against this material and possible methods of providing pretreatment and treatment against poisoning.
<BR>
The bulk of this research was conducted during the 1980s with some research on protective measures had medical treatment still ongoing. It has been concluded that this material does have potential as a possible chemical weapon agent and that it does pose a potential hazard to UK Armed Forces. As a consequence of this research certain equipment modifications have been introduced.

<BR>
The Defence Bills Agency is the Primary bill payment authority for MOD but the Meteorological Office, Hydrographic Office and Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) also undertake specified bill payment action. Set out below is the information you requested for each operating system.
<BR>
The Defence Bills Agency operates a bespoke system, developed in-house, which integrates contract control functionality with the bill payment system. Certain support functions are provided using systems supplied by AVCO Systems Ltd and ROCC Computers Ltd. During 1996-97 the system was operated on an ICL 3965 Dual Node Mainframe. The operating platform has been uprated in 1997-98 to an ICL SX 485-20 to cope with the additional requirements arising from the introduction of Resource Accounting. The operating cost of the system in 1996-97 was &#163;2.4 million (excluding VAT).
<BR>
During 1996-97 the Meteorological Office used a Ross purchase ledger run on a VAX machine. DERA assisted in implementing this system and supported both hardware and software. The operating costs of the systems and processes was &#163;222,000 (excluding VAT).
<BR>
The Hydrographic Office used Prophecy Version 2 running on a DEC Alpha box under UNIX. Software supply, maintenance and development was provided by Radius Computer Systems Ltd. The operating cost of the bill payment systems and processes was &#163;66,000 (excluding VAT) during 1996-97.

 The provision of training for overseas security forces is a valuable tool in furthering the Government's defence and foreign policy objectives. Requests for training are considered on a case-by-case basis. Close contact is maintained between the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and training would not be provided where we considered it would contribute to human rights violations. Even where human rights is not specifically covered, training provided by our military forces supports Government human rights policy by exposing overseas students to human rights standards and helping them develop an understanding of how armed forces operate in a democratic society.

<P>
<a name="71027w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 I am the only member of the Government to have visited Colombia since 1 August. I did not visit any of the camps containing displaced people, although I met and discussed the issue with their representatives.

<a name="71027w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lloyd: </B> 
 The plight of the displaced people of Colombia is a symptom of the internal conflict in that country. During my visit to Colombia last month, I raised with the Colombian Government our concerns about a variety of humanitarian problems resulting from the internal security situation, including that of displaced people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w06.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs when he wrote to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee inviting him to nominate a member to attend the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe conference in Vienna on politico-military aspects of security. [12802]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 I wrote to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 30 July. I invited the Committee to nominate a representative to join the UK delegation to the conference on the code of conduct on politico-military aspects of security in Vienna from 22 to 24 September.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w06.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for what reasons an invitation for a particular parliamentarian to attend the OSCE conference on politico-military aspects of security was addressed to the Foreign Affairs Committee and not to the OSCE delegation. [12803]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The conference in Vienna from 22 to 24 September to review the code of conduct on politico-military aspects of security was the first such conference since the code's adoption in December 1994. I addressed the invitation to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, rather than the UK delegation to the OSCE parliamentary assembly, because the democratic control of the military in Europe is a subject of wider, foreign affairs interest.

<P>
<a name="71027w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will list each of the functions relating to payment for goods or services supplied for which his Department is responsible indicating the management systems purchased, all subcontractors involved in the work, co-operative arrangements with other Departments; and the costs of the systems and processes in the last year for which figures are available. [12566]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w07.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The position in relation to the Department for which I am responsible is as follows:


<BR>
<i>The Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<BR>
The Crown Prosecution Service has 13 geographical areas, a central case work group and a national headquarters. Each area has its own accounts section which is responsible for handling invoices for goods and services received and claims from prosecution witnesses in respect of expense claims for attendance at court.
<BR>
In 1996-97 the CPS employed Chessington Computer Services Ltd. to process and make payments to suppliers and to witnesses. The software used by Chessington Computer Services Ltd. was the management accounting information system, MAISY. The cost of this service was &#163;723,894.




<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1997 : Column: 672</I><P>

<BR>
There are no sub-contractors involved in making payments. The internal process costs could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<BR>
<i>Serious Fraud Office</i>
<BR>
The Serious Fraud Office use a payment processing package known as Purchase Ledger supplied by CEDARDATA.
<BR>
The majority of payments are made through Paymaster by payable order or, if to another Government Department, by transfer. No sub-contractors are involved.
<BR>
The cost of processing payments in 1996-97 is estimated at &#163;32,500.
<BR>
<i>Treasury Solicitor's Department</i>
<BR>
All payments for goods and services supplied to Treasury Solicitor's Department and my own office are processed by the Treasury Solicitor's Department's financial accounting and information system, FAIS, which uses Image software supplied by TABS Ltd.
<BR>
The majority of payments are made through Paymaster by payable order or, if to another Government Department, by transfer. In addition, the Department has recently implemented a facility which enables payments to be made via the bank automated clearing system. No sub-contractors are involved.
<BR>
The cost of processing payments in 1996-97 is estimated at &#163;109,000.

<P>
<a name="71027w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will assess the advantages of the Crown Prosecution Service consulting victims of crime about the progress and status of their cases. [12478]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w07.html_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The victim's charter, a copy of which is in the Library of the House, sets out 27 standards of service that victims of crime can expect from criminal justice agencies including the Crown Prosecution service. These include best endeavours by the police to keep victims informed of significant developments in their case and asking about any fears the victim may have about further victimisation and details of loss, damage or injury. The Crown Prosecution service will taken this information, together with other known views of the victim, into account when making their decisions. Direct consultation between the CPS and victims is not normally appropriate since the victim will in most cases also be a prosecution witness.
<P>

<a name="71027w07.html_para0">Two schemes aimed at improving arrangements for keeping victims informed of progress in their case and ensuring that their interests are taken into account are at present being evaluated. In addition, the independent review of the Crown Prosecution Service will also consider ways to enable the Crown Prosecution Service to inform victims of crime about prosecution decisions.

 The EC programme, "Jean Monnet: European Integration in University Studies", was established in 1989 on the initiative of the European Parliament. It is implemented by the European Commission without direct involvement on the part of EU member states.
<P>

<a name="71027w08.html_para0">The Commission does not publish details of funding allocations to member states under this programme. The 1997 programme vademecum published by the European Commission lists the following criteria for selection:


<BR>
"The proposed project must deal specifically and entirely with the issue of European integration.
<BR>
All teaching activities carried out within the framework of a Jean Monnet Chair must fulfil this requirement.
<BR>
It must be an entirely new initiative, set up for the first time at the beginning of the 1997-98 academic year.
<BR>
Priority will be given to compulsory courses of study (this applies to the "Jean Monnet Chairs" and permanent courses) and to those reaching a wide audience.
<BR>
The proposed project should be clearly inserted into the university's teaching programme and correspond to the academic criteria of quality and feasibility.
<BR>
Priority will be given this year to the creation of new Jean Monnet Chairs and to the development of complementary initiatives which, in the framework of the 1990-92 Jean Monnet Chairs, will lead to the setting up of European centres of excellence.
<BR>
Selection will be made according to the applications submitted (all applications submitted will be taken into consideration) on the basis of the recommendations of the European University Council for the Jean Monnet Project."

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the annual saving to his Department from the abolition of mandatory student grants; and if these sums will be applied to higher education. [12688]

<P>
<a name="71027w08.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the proposals announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 23 July, mandatory student grants will be replaced with increased loans. In the short term, therefore, public expenditure on student support will not be reduced and there will be no savings on the basis of current accounting rules. Savings will be realised in the longer term as graduates begin to

<P>

<P>
<a name="71027w08.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department's new standards for trainee teachers mean that all newly-qualified teachers will understand their responsibilities under the special educational needs code of practice, be capable of identifying children with SEN and be able to differentiate teaching practice appropriately.
<P>

<a name="71027w08.html_para4">An additional qualification, approved by the Secretary of State, is mandatory for teachers of classes of visually-impaired and hearing-impaired children. The Green Paper on SEN, published last week, will address further issues about the professional development of teaching and non-teaching staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what research his Department has evaluated into potential regional variations in provision for special needs children. [12482]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w08.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Morris: </B> 
 The Department is aware, from its contact with parents, teachers, schools, voluntary organisations, local education authorities, and other service providers, that there are wide variations in the access to and the quality of provision available to pupils with special educational needs. That is why the Green Paper on SEN, "Excellence for All Children: meeting Special Educational Needs", which was published on 22 October, announced the Department's intention to:


<BR>
"work to secure a continuum of provision across the country, so that no matter where pupils live and what their needs, an appropriate level of support is available".

<P>

<a name="71027w08.html_para5">We recognise that not all LEAs will be able to provide the full range of support needed to achieve this aim. The Green Paper proposes, therefore, the development of regional planning arrangements for some aspects of SEN provision. We shall be consulting widely on this and other proposals contained in the Green Paper throughout the autumn. In the meantime we are supporting a project, co-ordinated by the Royal National Institute for the Blind, which is examining ways of securing effective regional co-ordination for certain aspects of SEN provision.

<P>

 Children with severe disabilities would normally be given a statement of special educational needs by their local education authority. The LEA must invite the parents of such children to name their preferred

school when they are served a copy of the child's draft statement. The LEA is required to name the parents' preferred school--whether it is a mainstream or a special school--in the statement, provided it is appropriate to the child's age, ability, aptitude, and special educational needs, and is compatible with the interests of other children already in the school and with the efficient use of resources. If the parents' preferred school is maintained by another LEA, the home LEA must consult both the school governing body and the maintaining LEA of the school before naming the school in the statement. The school named in a child's statement is required to admit the child.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 23 September, a package of measures which will allow an extra &#163;165 million to be spent on higher education in 1998-99. The level of funding for the higher education sector in 1999-2000 and beyond will be decided in the light of the Government's current comprehensive expenditure review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what mechanism he plans to introduce to ensure that universities are not financially disadvantaged by accepting students who are exempt from tuition fees. [12603]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w09.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There will be no disincentive to universities to accept students who are assessed as not having to contribute to tuition. For 1998-99 local education authorities will conduct an assessment of income to determine how much students or their parents should contribute to the &#163;1,000 tuition fee. The local education authority will pay the public contribution to the fee directly to the university or college where the student is enrolled. The university or college will be responsible for collecting the contribution from the student. Universities and colleges will retain these funds. The administrative arrangements for later years are still under consideration and will be announced later.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps he plans to take in respect of the introduction of tuition fees to ensure that the resources provided to universities reflect the average tuition costs of the courses they provide relative to the national average, with particular reference to medicine.

 Under our preferred funding option, full-time undergraduates will contribute up to &#163;1,000 a year in tuition fees, depending on family income, with the balance being met from public funds. The maximum payable--&#163;1,000--represents around a quarter of the 



<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1997 : Column: 681</I><P>
average annual cost of undergraduate courses. The remainder will be met from public funds through the teaching grant for universities and colleges allocated by the Higher Education Funding Council. The funding council's teaching grant allocations reflect each institution's student numbers and the relative average costs of providing courses in broad subject categories. Universities and college which provide medical courses will receive considerably more in teaching grant per medical student than the national average per student across all subjects.

<P>
<a name="71027w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister, has made clear that the Government intend to set a target for an extra 500,000 people to enter further and higher education by 2002. We expect that part-time enrolment will contribute significantly to this total.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what representations he has received concerning the effects on part-time students of the reduction in permitted study hours from 21 to 16 per week to maintain jobseeker's allowance entitlement; and if he will make a statement. [12298]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 I have not received representations on this specific issue although my colleagues and I receive correspondence on a range of issues relating to the jobseeker's allowance rules.
<P>

<a name="71027w10.html_para0">The Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 introduced a definition of part-time students. Part-time study had not previously been defined in social security legislation. What is regarded as part-time depends on the type of course and where it is provided. In England and Wales, courses which are funded or part-funded by the further education funding councils of no more than 16 guided learning hours per week are regarded as part-time. This reflects the way in which the sector operates its part-time courses.
<P>

<a name="71027w10.html_para1">We will be reviewing the job-seeker's allowance rules on education and training in the light of the jobseeker's allowance workskills pilots, which we expanded in September this year, and early experience of new deal measures for the long-term unemployed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, how many claimants had their jobseeker's allowance reduced during 1996-97 for <i>(a)</i> two weeks and <i>(b)</i> four weeks for not attending or failing to complete (i) jobplan workshops, (ii) restart courses, (iii) workwise and worklink, (iv) 1-2-1, (v) project work and (vi) non-prescribed Government programmes where referral was under a jobseeker's direction.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 10 July 1997, c.558]:</i> Unfortunately not all relevant data was included in the reply provided by Leigh Lewis, chief executive of the Employment Service.
<P>

<a name="71027w10.html_para2">The third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of the reply should have read as follows:


<BR>
"Unfortunately, information is not available in the form you request. However, it may be helpful if I explain that a total of 17,477 sanction decisions and opinions were given in 1996-97 for:
<BR>
refusal of a place on a training scheme or employment programme;
<BR>
failure to attend a place on a training scheme or employment programme;
<BR>
giving up a place on a training scheme or employment programme;
<BR>
losing a place on a training scheme or employment programme through misconduct; and,
<BR>
neglect to avail of a place on a training scheme or employment programme.




<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1997 : Column: 685</I><P>

<BR>
Schemes and programmes included in this definition are jobplan Workshops, Restart Courses, Workwise, Worklink, 1-2-1, and Project Work. Employment Service statistics do not identify the number of sanctions relating to each programme, nor do they differentiate between two and four week sanctions.
<BR>
The total number of sanction decisions and opinions given in 1996-97 for refusal or failure to carry out a Jobseeker's Direction was 225. It is not possible to say whether any of these related to employment programmes."

<P>
<a name="71027w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The Government do not believe that a requirement for public liability insurance by gas installers would be effective in safeguarding consumers. Compulsory insurance would not, of itself, ensure that installers have the necessary skills, competence and hardware to enable them to carry out their duties effectively and safely, which is the first line of defence for consumers. Gas safety legislation requires all gas installers to be registered with the Council of Registered Gas Installers and requires all gas transporters to ensure that their staff undertaking gas safety work meet appropriate standards.

 The importation into the European Union of goods which infringe trade marks, copyright and design rights is prohibited by virtue of Council Regulation 3295/94 provided that the relevant right holder has lodged an application for action with Customs and Excise, which is responsible in the UK for enforcement. The regulation fulfils the obligations of the UK and the EU under the World Trade Organisation--general agreement on tariffs and trade--formerly GATT agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights but its coverage of "counterfeit and pirated goods" does not embrace patent infringements.

Published tariffs.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

<P>

(5) Based on equivalent of standard tariffs of British Gas and other supply companies. Based on an annual consumption of 17,600 kWh.<P>

(6) Bills relate to the total bill received during the year which for credit consumers covers consumption in Q4 of the previous year to Q3 in year in question and includes all tariff changes and rebates.<P>

(7) Real prices are cash prices adjusted for inflation as measured by the GDP market price deflator.<P>

(8) 1997 bills are provisional in that they only include tariff changes announced up to August 1997 and therefore may be subject to revision if tariff changes occur. The 1997 deflator is an estimate and as such revisions may lead to changes in the real terms bill.<P>

(9) Supply zones are defined as Main: Scottish, North Thames, South Eastern, Eastern, Southern, Wales and South Western; North: North Eastern, North Western and Northern; Midlands: East and West.<P>

(10) Bills for the various trial competition regions are calculated so as to include the fact that those customers who switched supplier would have received their gas, prior to switching, from British Gas and charged BG tariffs for this gas. For example, the Phase 2a and 2b bills are based on the assumption that customers who switched in Phase 2a received gas supply from the new supplier from 10 February 1997, and for Phase 2b from 7 March 1997. Prior to these dates the customers are taken to be on British Gas tariffs (e.g. national or main zone).<P>

(11) Phase 1 covers Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, Phase 2a covers the County of Avon and Dorset and Phase 2b covers Kent and East and West Sussex.<P>

Electricity Association--1980 to 1988; DTI--1989 to 1997, based on published tariffs and rebates from Public Electricity Suppliers.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

<P>

(12) Based on an annual consumption of 3,300kWh.<P>

(13) Bills from 1989 include all tariff changes and rebates but exclude discounts offered by some companies for prompt payment.<P>

(14) Data from 1989 relates to the total bill received during the year, which for credit consumers covers consumption in Q4 of previous year to Q3 in year in question. Specific bills based on tariffs at 1 April are used pre 1989.<P>

(15) Data pre 1989 and post 1988 are calculated on different basis and so are not directly comparable, but do reflect the overall trend.<P>

(16) Real prices are cash prices adjusted for the effects of inflation as measured by the GDP market price deflator.<P>

(17) 1996 bills exclude the National Grid Discount. Customers in England and Wales received a one-off rebate of &#163;54.60 (including VAT) during Q1 1996, following the flotation of the National Grid Company.<P>

(18) 1997 bills are provisional in that they are based on tariffs as at end August 1997. Information for the year may change (for example with rebates) further changes will occur as revisions are made to the current estimate of the 1997 GDP deflator.<P>

(19) From 1989, averages are weighted by the number of domestic customers in 1994-95, prior to which data for each year are used.<P>

 The first table gives an index of BT's telephone charges for the period of 1978-79 to 1988-89, since values for these years are not readily available. From 1988-89, BT started providing values for the median residential bill, which unlike the first set of figures relates to actual use and provides the most accurate view of an average bill. Values for these for 1988 to 1996 are shown in the second table. Statistics for each region of Great Britain are not available. Figures for other operators are not available.

 My Department's employment agency standards inspectorate is responsible for regulating businesses providing supply teaching staff under the terms of the Employment Agencies Act 1973. In addition to investigating complaints, proactive checks of standards in this and other sectors of the industry are conducted from time to time. Any information about suspected breaches of the legislation should be brought to my Department's attention.

<a name="71027w13.html_para0">In the case of leather and synthetic footwear from China, Indonesia and Thailand, it seems likely that the Council will agree to a minimum price regime in November. The duty payable would be equivalent to the difference between a minimum price and the import price, where the import price is lower.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what proposals he has assessed in respect of changes to the Lothian health acute services strategy; when proposed revisions will be made available for public consultation; and when the acute services strategy will be implemented in full. [12751]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 It is estimated that Lothian health board's acute services strategy will be implemented in full once the new royal infirmary of Edinburgh is operating, currently expected to be in 2003. Scottish Office officials are in regular contact with Lothian health board and the relevant trusts so that they are aware of any revisions to the original proposals within the acute services strategy. I would be informed of, and assess appropriately, any revisions which substantially affected the objectives or implementation of the strategy.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71027w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 NHS trusts responsible for individual PFI projects account for the costs they incur in pursuing them. The Scottish Office management executive estimates that costs should not be more than 1.5 per cent. of the capital value of the project.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what has been the total percentage reduction agreed since August 1996 by the European Commission in the level of beef export refunds to South Africa. [12332]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The level of export refund EU beef exports received is dependant not only on the destination, but also the type of cut. Since August 1996, the level of export refunds on beef exports to South Africa has fallen by between 35 per cent. and 43 per cent.

<a name="71027w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We are aware of the report and have noted its contents. As mentioned in my reply to my hon. Friend's previous question, there has already been a large reduction in the level of refunds paid on beef exports to South Africa. We believe however that it is still too early to assess the full impact of these reductions.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the nationality of the fishermen and their projected generated financial gain covered in the European Union-Senegal fisheries agreement; what is the cost to the European Union; what is the financial share of the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the United Kingdom's position regarding fishing rights held by the European Union in third-party waters.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The fishing opportunities available under the EC-Senegal fisheries agreement are allocated mainly to fishermen from France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece who have traditionally fished in Senegalese waters. However, new pelagic fishing opportunities obtained under the new protocol have not been allocated to specific member states. We have no information on the projected financial gain by individual fishermen.
<P>

<a name="71027w15.html_para0">The cost of the agreement to the EU budget is 12 mecu per annum. The UK contributes some 15 per cent. of this amount.
<P>

<a name="71027w15.html_para1">The Government consider fisheries agreements with third countries to be important in safeguarding traditional fishing grounds for EU fishermen. The agreements with Norway and other North Atlantic countries, for example, are important to the UK distant water fleet. However, the Government wish to ensure that fisheries agreements as a whole provide value for money, promote sustainable fisheries and are coherent with general EU development policy.

<P>
<a name="71027w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It will not be possible to carry out a detailed assessment of the impact on the UK fishing fleet of integrating new countries into the EU until we know which countries are to be admitted and the accession terms proposed. However, those applicant countries which have marine fishing interests generally fish in areas, such as the Baltic sea, where the UK fleet is not active. Previous new entrants have, as part of their accession terms, been allocated quotas reflecting the areas and stocks for which they have historic track records. The Government will wish to ensure that similar conditions apply to further new entrants.

[12744]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The European Commission has recently transferred all of its advisory scientific committees to Directorate General XXIV which deals with consumer policy and consumer health protection. It is now in the process of restructuring the committees, the six existing committees being replaced by eight new committees which will deal respectively with food; animal nutrition; animal health and animal welfare; veterinary public health; plants; cosmetic products and non-food products intended for consumers; toxicity, ecotoxicity and the environment; and medical products and medical devices. A restructured overarching committee, the Scientific Steering Committee, is also being set up, the membership consisting of the chairmen of the eight scientific committees and eight additional scientists.
<P>

<a name="71027w15.html_para2">The reorganisation of the committee structure is entirely a matter for the European Commission, but in so far as the intention is to provide a more effective advisory system we are in support, though it remains to be seen how the new arrangements will operate in practice. Advice on food safety issues in the UK continues to be provided by the UK advisory committees, although increasingly legislation on food safety is based on agreements reached in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="71027w15.html_para3">Officials have been in touch with officials in DG XXIV and will continue working to ensure that there is effective interchange of information between the EU and ourselves. We also keep in close touch with day to day developments in the EU scientific committees via the UK contact points, and EU committees will be well aware of the conclusions reached in UK discussions.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71027w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Control of Pesticide Regulations 1986 include general requirements for the use of pesticides, including aerial spraying, and were updated earlier this year. The amending regulations introduced a specific requirement on all users of pesticides to confine the application of the pesticide to the land, crop, structure material or other area intended to be treated. These regulations place obligations on the aerial spray operator to give notice of the intended aerial application to the chief health officer for the district; hospitals, schools and other institutions within 150 m of the intended flight path; and occupants or their agents of all property within 25 m of the boundary of the land to which the pesticide is to be applied.
<P>

<a name="71027w15.html_para4">These requirements will be emphasised in the revised code of practice for the safe use of pesticides on farms and holdings which will be published early in the new year.

 The Minister for Local Government and Housing announced on 25 July that the proposed de minimis threshold for housing management compulsory competitive tendering should be stock based at 4,000 properties. There are no proposals to make any changes to the current definition of a local authority's housing stock. The definition as it stands includes most stock which a local authority provides under part II of the Housing Act 1985. Only hostels and flats which have been bought under the right-to-buy scheme are excluded. Therefore any properties which are managed by either estate management boards or tenant management organisations will count towards the de minimis calculation.

 In the context of the European Environment Agency's work programme, media-oriented monitoring concerns the assessment of the state and trends of the environment by looking at the quality of the various areas of the environment--air, water, nature and soil. Source-oriented monitoring provides an assessment of the pressures on the environment by way of measuring the levels of pollution by source.

<BR>
The Minister for Transport in London has asked me to reply to your recent question about traffic on the A43 through Silverstone over the past ten years.
<BR>
The annual average daily flow at Silverstone in 1996 was 20,500 vehicles with 17 per cent. commercial vehicles including buses. Traffic is regularly monitored on A43 between Wood Burcote turn and the A413 (Annex A). Figures for that site are shown at Annex B.
<BR>
A comparison of the 1996 figures show that the flow at the monitoring site is some 17 per cent. higher than the flow through Silverstone.

<P>
<a name="71027w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Current planning policy guidance on broadcasting masts and transmitting stations is set out in planning policy guidance note 8--PPG8 revised December 1992. That guidance reflects the importance we attach to keeping to a minimum the number of broadcasting and telecommunications masts, and of sites for such installations, while ensuring that there is an effective national broadcasting and telecommunications network.

 Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the conservation agencies have powers to declare national nature reserves. There are now 188 NNRs in England. English Nature, the Government's scientific adviser, has been actively seeking to involve local authorities and other approved bodies in the management of NNRs. It has also assisted local authorities in increasing the number of local nature reserves from 288 in 1991 to 566 in 1997.

<a name="71027w17.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce a fuel tax exemption for those disabled people who have motability vehicles. Such a measure would be administratively expensive and impractical, and there are better ways of assisting disabled people with their transport costs. The main way is through the Government's provision of the disability living allowance which was introduced in 1992 to help people with the extra costs which arise from their care and mobility needs. DLA is increased every year, by law, by the rate of inflation, as measured by the movement in the retail prices index which takes account of the cost of petrol as well as the cost of taxi fares and other motoring costs.

<a name="71027w17.html_para0">For the trunk road network the Highways Agency has an assessment and strengthening programme aimed at ensuring all the bridges meet or are brought up to meet modern standards.

<P>

<a name="71027w17.html_para3">The Minister for Transport in London has asked me to respond to your Parliamentary Question on the possibility of using redundant North Sea oil and gas drilling platforms in the construction of new bridges.


<BR>
Most new bridges are constructed of steel, (steel) reinforced concrete, or a combination of both. The exact type of bridge is usually dictated by cost, aesthetics, the road geometry and the loads that the bridge will have to carry. To achieve the most effective design, the shape and strength of the various components are specifically designed and it is not often that "second hand" components can be incorporated without significant cost. However, second-hand materials can often be used quite economically after they have been recycled. For example, all the steel bars produced in the UK for reinforced concrete are made from recycled scrap steel.
<BR>
Crushed concrete can be used again as an aggregate for concrete but generally it is not suitable for making the high strength concrete needed in bridges. Recycled concrete from drilling platforms is also likely to be contaminated with salt which will cause the steel reinforcement to corrode unless special measures are taken.
<BR>
It is therefore difficult to see how steel or concrete from redundant North Sea oil and gas drilling platforms could be used economically, directly in new bridges. However, salvaged steel from North Sea platforms has already been used in temporary works and we are continuing to carry out research into finding more ways of using recycled materials including concrete.

 The Government have taken positive steps to help reverse the decline in common hedgerow, woodland and farmland bird species. They include:


<BR>
A biodiversity steering group report, published in December 1995, contained costed action plans for bird species, including the song thrush and skylark, and costed habitat action plans for cereal field margins, lowland wet grassland and other important bird habitats. Further costed action plans for other important bird habitats and song bird species are being prepared.
<BR>
The Government are working with conservation and farming organisations to improve the efficiency and targeting of agri-environmental schemes which encourage environmentally sensitive farming.
<BR>
MAFF has commissioned research into the relationship between farming practices over the last 20 years and populations of farmland birds. MAFF also funds research on establishment and maintenance of hedgerows and has large programmes to support agri-environment schemes and to help promote minimisation of the use of pesticides.
<BR>
A comprehensive literature review, recently published, considered the possible indirect effect of pesticides on farmland birds. Further research is planned in this area.
<BR>
An approval system is in place for new pesticides, and existing pesticides are subject to an EU review programme. Older pesticides are therefore reviewed against modern standards.
<BR>
A pesticide's forum, including agricultural, environmental, food and other groups, has recently published an action plan for the responsible use of pesticides.
<BR>
A group has been set up to recommend ways of strengthening the Hedgerow Regulations 1997, so that they give better protection for hedgerows. The group is working towards making its recommendations by the end of December this year.

 There are no immediate plans for a review of the operation of either the order or the direction.

Any changes which we proposed introducing to either the permitted development order or the demolition direction would be the subject of consultation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the suitability of PVC for use in construction of publicly funded buildings. [12594]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 One of the potential problems with the use of PVC materials in construction is the possibility of rapid fire spread, and guidance is given on this aspect in Approved Document B (Fire Safety) to the Building Regulations 1991. These regulations make no distinction between publicly funded buildings and any other buildings.
<P>

<a name="71027w18.html_para1">In the case of fire, building regulations are intended to ensure that a reasonable standard of safety is provided. The protection of property, including the building itself, may require additional measures which are the responsibility of either the building owner or insurers to specify on an individual basis and would be dependent on the particular risk associated with the proposed use of the building.
<P>

<a name="71027w18.html_para2">The approved document recognises that the choice of materials for walls and ceilings can significantly affect the spread of a fire and its rate of growth, even though they may not be the materials first ignited. Guidance is therefore given in the approved document on both the location and spacing of thermoplastic and other materials that do not satisfy the performance criteria of British Standard fire tests.
<P>

<a name="71027w18.html_para3">With regard to the general use of PVC in the construction of buildings my Department has consulted with the Department of Health, the Health and Safety Executive and the Building Research Establishment. It was concluded from this consultation that there are no known serious hazards to human health or the environment associated with the use of PVC.

 We have no plans to do so. Committal remains an important tool for local authorities in their efforts to recover unpaid council tax and community charge, but it is used as a last resort and a debtor can be imprisoned only where a magistrate is satisfied that failure to pay has been due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect. However, the Department has recently issued a consultation paper on the enforcement of council tax debts which, amongst other things, invites views on giving magistrates powers to impose a community service order as an additional enforcement option.

<a name="71027w20.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment his Department has made of the advantages of introducing a requirement for displaying insurance certificates in motor vehicles. [12801]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w20.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Such a requirement could give some assurance that an insurance policy for the vehicle was in force; accompanying provisions to prevent the display of certificates for policies which had been cancelled would also be needed. Display of a certificate would however provide no assurance that the driver was covered by an insurance policy or was complying with policy conditions. The value of a requirement to display would therefore be less in this country than in those countries which have vehicle-related insurance systems, under which cover is taken out for a particular vehicle regardless of who drives it. Although the Government have not discarded the possibility of a requirement to display evidence of insurance, it appears at present that other measures, such as a computerised insurance database, would offer a better approach to the problem of dealing with the irresponsible minority of drivers who fail to take out insurance. The nation-wide introduction of wheelclamping for vehicles for which vehicle excise duty has been evaded will also provide a significant knock on benefit for enforcement of the compulsory insurance requirements.

 In 1995 the Department commissioned Professor W.N. Charman of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology to undertake a thorough review of the research on driver vision standards.
<P>

<a name="71027w21.html_para1">The Department published his report earlier this year and it is available as "Road Safety Research Report No. 2 vision and Driving--A Literature Review and Commentary". I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 A survey carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory 1992 found that about 2.5 per cent. of drivers did not meet the statutory requirement of being able to read a number plate in good light from a distance of 20.5m with glasses or contact lenses if worn. A subsequent survey commissioned by others has suggested a higher figure. It would clearly be difficult to establish how many of the drivers concerned were unaware that their eyesight had fallen below the required standard. The Department strongly advises drivers to check themselves against the number plate standard regularly. Where eyesight is below the required standard, the normal remedy will be to obtain new glasses or contact lenses. Drivers who cannot meet the standard must notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency immediately and stop driving; otherwise they are committing a criminal offence. Drivers who require glasses or contact lenses in order to meet the standard must wear them whenever driving.

<a name="71027w22.html_para1">The receipt of regular maintenance is a key part of the Government's strategy for helping lone mothers into work. All the indicators currently in place show a continuing improvement in the accuracy of assessments. We expect this trend to be maintained both as the result of continued efforts by the agency's staff and as the provisions contained in the Social Security Bill are implemented in due course. These provisions will improve and simplify the decision-making process.

 We are reviewing all aspects of the social security system. We will assess whether sickness and disability benefits are consistent with our overall aims to encourage work, savings and honesty. A key aim is to help people focus on their capacity for work rather than their disability and provide a climate which will help them achieve independence and play a fuller part in society.

<a name="71027w22.html_para3">As part of this we will be looking at a number of eligibility issues including those surrounding the all work test, and will be seeking to ensure the test provides a fair assessment of incapacity for benefit purposes.

 All overpayments of benefit are looked at individually and their recoverability decided upon on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case as known at the time of the decision. However, where the decision to recover an overpayment is subsequently reversed, this will affect only the balance of the overpayment still outstanding.

In opposition we welcomed the recommendations of the Home Affairs Committee on regulation. However, the Committee did not offer a detailed blueprint and in the light of the responses received to the consultation exercise we will consider the industry as a whole to decide what action is needed.

 Our proposals for reform of the youth justice system have been set out in three consultation papers published in the last five weeks. Our aim is a faster, more efficient youth justice system with a clear focus on preventing re-offending. A new final warning scheme will end multiple cautions and ensure that firm action is taken quickly when young people offend. A new court order will require young people to make reparation to victims. We will strengthen community penalties and ensure effective custodial sentences for the most serious and persistent young offenders.

<a name="71027w24.html_para3">Anti-social behaviour also causes alarm and distress and heightens the fear of crime. Tackling this sort of conduct and preventing its escalating into more serious criminal behaviour is a central element in our policy towards making our communities safer. Proposals in the Crime and Disorder Bill which we will introduce later this year will address this directly and we are working with the police on ways to identify and target anti-social behaviour.

<P>
<a name="71027w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 In September 1996, European Union member states adopted a protocol to the 1995 Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the European Communities. The protocol requires all member states to establish a certain minimum level of protection against damage to the Communities' budget by reason of corruption which makes similar provision in the case of corruption of or by national or Community officials. In May 1997, the member states adopted a separate convention on corruption of or by national or Community officials which is not linked to damage to the Communities' budget. These instruments do not cover the corruption of officials from third countries, but member states have, in recent weeks, adopted two common positions under title VI of the treaty on European Union supporting on-going negotiations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Council of Europe on conventions which address this aspect.
<P>

<a name="71027w25.html_para2">The Government strongly support measures to penalise corruption, whether by or of national or Community officials or in the private sector. To that end, they intend to take forward next year, during the United Kingdom's presidency of the European Union, recommendation 6 of the European Union action plan on combating organised crime, which was endorsed by the Amsterdam European Council. This requires the development of a comprehensive Union policy on corruption covering first and third pillar measures and applying to public sector officials and to the private sector.

 Claims under the criminal injuries compensation scheme vary greatly in their complexity. The straightforward ones may be determined in a matter of weeks, but those in which there are evidential difficulties or where the medical diagnosis or prognosis is uncertain may take several years to bring to a conclusion. Some will also be subject to an appeal. There is accordingly no meaningful average time for processing all cases. However, the victims charter sets a standard of 12 months from receipt of a claim to the issue of a first decision. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority advises that, under the new tariff-based scheme, that standard has been met in 90 per cent. of claims received on or after 1 April 1996.

 The review has been completed and I am pleased to say that the papers will be transferred to the Public Record Office and made available for public inspection later this year, subject to minor extractions. The extractions are intended to protect the identities of individual informants who put themselves at risk in the service of the state. It would not be in the public interest to reveal the identities of such individuals, since to do so might deter potential informants from assisting the authorities today. Of course, all the agents named in these records have long since died, but in many cases members of their families will still be alive and particularly in the context of Ireland, where memories can be deep and bitter, publication of the names cold cause unnecessary and gratuitous distress or worse.

 This Government plan to increase the effectiveness of community sentences and the range of options available to the courts.

<a name="71027w27.html_para3">On 1 October, new provisions came into effect allowing courts to impose an attendance centre order on fine defaulters who are aged under 25.

These include provisions allowing for the imposition of a community service order or curfew order on fine defaulters and persistent petty offenders, disqualification of offenders from driving regardless of the offence committed and the imposition of curfew orders of up to three-months duration on offenders under the age of 16.
<P>

<a name="71027w27.html_para4">We are also studying other community sentence options which will reinforce the sentencing armoury, particularly with regards to youth crime.

 We propose to introduce two new bail conditions to deter bailed defendants from failing to appear in court or from failing to take the necessary steps to enable the case to proceed. The first measure will allow for the greater use of securities, to provide a stronger incentive for defendants to surrender to the custody of the court. The second measure will allow the courts to impose a condition of bail requiring a defendant to attend an

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1), pursuant to his statement of 30 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>257</i>, what plans he has to assess the level of public confidence in his proposals for the courts to explain sentence lengths; [12602]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w27.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Our proposal that the courts should spell out what each sentence really means in practice was a manifesto commitment which was endorsed by the electorate. The proposal is to enable the public to know how long an offender will spend in prison, the period of supervision after release, and the period during which he may be recalled to prison.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w27.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It is difficult to draw up a definitive list of offences for which sentencing guidelines are currently available, since the form and content of sentencing guidelines differ and the Court of Appeal also provides guidance on the treatment of offences through its more general cases. However, guidelines providing general guidance to the courts on the treatment of particular criminal offences, and in some cases suggesting starting points for sentences, have been provided by the Court of Appeal for a number of categories of offences, including: most sexual offences, including rape, unlawful sexual intercourse, incest, indecent assault and buggery; drugs offences involving class A and class B drugs; robbery, theft and benefit fraud; public order offences, including riot, violent disorder and affray; and explosives offences.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his statement of 30 July, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>257</i>, (1) if the sentencing guidelines to be prepared by the Court of Appeal will operate in the lower courts in the same way as the sentencing guidelines which have already been laid down; [12703]
<P>
<UL>(2) how the sentencing guidelines to be prepared by the Court of Appeal will affect the Magistrates' Association guidelines on sentencing; [12714]

<P>

 The Government are committed through their manifesto to placing a duty on the Court of Appeal to ensure there are sentencing guidelines for all the main offences. We are currently considering how best to take forward this commitment.

 The judicial inquiry will have powers under section 49 of the Police Act 1996 to summon any person to give evidence, to require the production of documents and to take evidence on oath.

 Nurses' salaries are dependent on a wide range of factors such as grade and length of service. It is therefore not possible to provide the average salary of a nurse with five years' experience. However, current salary rates are published in advance letter (NM) 1/97, copies of which are available in the Library. Additionally, new earnings survey figures for 1996 show that the average gross weekly earnings of a full-time nurse on adult rates was &#163;325.70.

<P>
<a name="71027w29.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list each of the functions relating to payment for goods services supplied for which his Department is responsible indicating the management systems purchased, all sub-contractors involved in the work, co-operative arrangements with other departments; and the costs of the systems and processes in the last year for which figures are available. [12558]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The process for making payments for goods and services forms the latter part of the purchasing process. The Department of Health has developed procurement procedures based upon guidance issued by Her Majesty's Treasury and those procedures are designed to ensure probity and fairness in procurement decisions. The processing of payments and the issue of payable instruments form part of the Department's accounting systems. The procedures for both placing orders and making payments to suppliers requires the necessary certification and authorisation that ensures an adequate separation of duties, thus conforming with Government accounting.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para1">The Department does not use sub-contractors for payment work nor have co-operative arrangements with other departments for the payment of goods and services. The payment of welfare foods benefit does involve both the Benefit Agency in the issue of welfare milk tokens and a contractor to authorise payments against surrendered tokens. The Benefits Agency also authorises payments on the Department's behalf in respect of European Economic Area medical costs.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para2">The Department's accounting system is based on a proprietary accounting package--Sun Accounts--amended by departmental staff to meet specific needs. The Department makes some 180,000 payments a year, which include payments to health authorities, local authorities, non-departmental public bodies and voluntary organisations. Payments to other Government Departments and health authorities are made by means of transfers. Whenever possible, other payments are made by means of bank automated clearing system and the remainder are paid by payable order.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para3">The accounts payable and cashiering applications which support departmental payments form part of the accounting system and specific capital and development costs of the computer systems are not therefore readily available. The salary costs of providing a cashiering service are estimated to be &#163;216,000 for 1997-98.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71027w29.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has announced the setting up of an independent review into clinical concerns raised about the proposals for the transfer of bulk processing and testing of blood from Liverpool to Manchester. Professor John Cash, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and former director of the blood transfusion service in Scotland, is leading that review.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para5">On 8 September, Professor Cash submitted an urgent interim report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in which he advised that, given that the original plans were then largely implemented, and in particular the run-down of experienced and skilled staff in the Liverpool centre,
"it is now in the best interests of patients in Merseyside and the surrounding area that the transfer of bulk blood processing and testing to Manchester goes ahead as planned on 19 September."
On 9 September, the Secretary of State announced his reluctant acceptance of that recommendation on grounds of patient safety.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para6">However, the Secretary of State also made it clear that that was not the end of the matter. Professor Cash is to make a final report in November, when he will advise on how blood services can be developed to meet the needs of people in Merseyside and the surrounding areas as well as the requirements of local clinicians. Meanwhile, two steps have already been taken to aid that development. In line with the interim recommendations made by Professor Cash, the Secretary of State announced in September the appointment of two experts, Professor Alistair Bellingham and Dr. Ian Gilmore, to two critical new posts. Their respective roles are transition director of the Liverpool blood centre, and chair of a Merseyside and area clinical user group set up to monitor the quality of blood services in Merseyside and north Wales. Both Professor Bellingham and Dr. Gilmore have an important part to play in working with local clinicians to ensure the safety and the reliability of the supply of blood components to local hospitals.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para7">We shall decide what further measures may be required when we have seen Professor Cash's final report.
<P>

<a name="71027w29.html_para8">As regards the number of representations which Ministers have received from clinicians on this issue, as I said in my reply to a similar question from my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on 1 July, column <i>145</i>, separate records are not kept of the particular categories of people who make such representations. We estimate, however, that we have received around 24 representations from different clinicians or their professional associations since 1 May 1997. Copies have been passed to Professor Cash for him to consider as part of his review. They will not be published separately.

<a name="71027w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The information requested is available in the statistical bulletins, <i>Statistics of prescriptions dispensed in the Family Health Service Authorities: England 1985 to 1995</i>,<i></i> (statistical bulletin in 1996/17 July 1996) and <i>Statistics of prescriptions dispensed in the community: England 1986 to 1996,</i> (statistical bulletin 1997/15 July 1997), both of which are available in the Library. Before 20 October 1995, the term "elderly people" meant women aged 60 years or over and men aged 65 and over. Since then, however, men aged 60 and over are also included in this group, but the population figures for 1995 are still for men aged 65 years and over and women aged 60 and over. The 1985 to 1990 prescription data are based on fees, while 1991-1995 prescription data are based on items.

 The latest figures on the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, including new variant CJD, in the United Kingdom were published in a Department of Health press release on 6 October 1997, copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71027w30.html_para3">The fifth annual report of the national Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance unit published on 15 September 1997 showed that there has been an increase in the number of cases of classic sporadic CJD recorded in England and Wales for the period 1970 to April 1996, with the greatest increase reported in those over the age of 75. Substantial increases in the reported incidence of classic CJD have also been observed in other countries which monitor the disease, including countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy is rare or absent. These increases are most likely to reflect improved case ascertainment, especially in the older age groups, rather than a real increase in the disease.

These figures are not strictly comparable between regions due to different methods of dealing with likely problems in the setting of budgets. Some regions have a policy of addressing differences between the policy of the health authority and the fundholder to resolve disputes before a formal offer is made. In addition where a multifund (where a larger number of fundholders join together to apply the budget) have appealed en-masse, this might be counted as one appeal, or as individual appeals.<P>

Often an appeal has no definite resolution for either side--elements of both arguments my be accepted, and the decision does not, in reality, come down one way or another. However, where a decision by the RO has been largely in favour of the GPFH this is reflected in the table.<P>

 Following concerns expressed by staff working within the trust, North Staffordshire Hospital NHS trust conducted a management review of maternity services, which reported in May 1997. As a result of this review, a number of improvements have been implemented by the trust to both procedures and staffing arrangements, including the introduction of a new model of woman-centred care, additional staff in community midwifery, and improved cover arrangements at labour suites. There are no reductions in staffing at weekends or on bank holidays. All these changes are aimed at improving maternity services for patients.

<a name="71027w31.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Novelty condoms are not recommended for use as a barrier to HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases or as a contraceptive. The Department of Health advises the public to use only condoms which carry either the British Standards Institute kitemark or the European CE mark. As novelty condoms are not classed as medical devices under the Medical Devices Regulations 1994, they should not carry the CE mark, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health cannot use his enforcement powers under these regulations to restrict their availability. However, any confusion and risk to health caused by novelty condoms being mistaken for genuine condoms would come within the scope of the General Product Safety Regulations 1994, which are enforced by local authority trading standards officers, if there is a significant risk that a novelty condom could be confused with the genuine article and give rise to the transmission of disease then, in the absence of adequate warnings about the hazard, the product could be deemed to be unsafe under the regulations.

 Organ donor cards have been distributed freely by many organisations over the last 25 years. No record has ever been kept of who may possess them. However, public opinion surveys show consistently that around 30 per cent. of the population claim to carry an organ donor card.
<P>

<a name="71027w32.html_para1">At 18 October 1997, there were 3,685,000 English residents on the national health service organ donor register--7.6 per cent. of the population.

 The Government have no plans to introduce a scheme of paid leave entitlements for those donating bone marrow. There are two bone marrow donation registers in this country; the British bone marrow register which recruits from blood donors and is funded

through the national health service, and the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register which is funded and run by the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust. Both registers meet all reasonable expenses of donors, including travelling and accommodation expenses and compensation for loss of earnings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to encourage people to <i>(a)</i> carry donor cards, <i>(b)</i> register on the NHS organ donor register <i>(c)</i> give blood and <i>(d)</i> donate bone marrow; and if he will make a statement; [12904]

 No information is available on Department of Health publicity campaigns before 1989-90. No information is available about the sums spent on promoting bone marrow donation over the last 10 years, but some associated costs may be contained within the blood publicity budget. The information available is provided in the table. Within the organ donation publicity budget, it is not possible to identify separately the amounts spent on individual campaigns.
<P>

<a name="71027w32.html_para2">There are continuing campaigns to encourage positive attitudes towards tissue donation. During this year, the Department is promoting a wide range of measures designed to increase the number of regular blood donors through raising awareness of the need to maintain supplies of blood to hospitals. This includes the launch this year of a new three to five year publicity strategy, designed to increase the current donor base and thereby reduce the need for emergency appeals, and the development of an information pack for secondary schools, for use in association with the national curriculum, which we hope will help to secure the future donor base.
<P>

<a name="71027w32.html_para3">The over-riding aim of organ donation publicity campaigns is to encourage people to discuss their donation wishes with their families. Knowing the views of the deceased in advance makes it easier for relatives to agree that organs may be donated. People are also encouraged to register their wishes by joining the computerised NHS organ donor register, established in 1994. This register builds on earlier work to promote organ donor cards, which are still distributed with the NHS organ donor register leaflets. We are considering how best to use publicity monies to encourage donation.
<P>

<a name="71027w32.html_para4">Bone marrow donors are recruited through two organisations. The British bone marrow register is funded through the NHS and recruits from blood donors at blood donation sessions. The Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust is a charity funded by voluntary giving and recruits donors from the general public through local and national publicity campaigns.

 The rise in smoking by young people, particularly teenage girls, is a grave concern. Measures directed at reducing children's smoking will be set out in the White Paper on tobacco control to be published next year.
