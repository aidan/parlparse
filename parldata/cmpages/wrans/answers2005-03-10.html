November 2004. The council did not do so; instead it has sought to resolve the claim, and a second one in respect of a linked path, by persuading landowners to dedicate the routes as bridleways.

<p><a name="50310w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the processing of slaughter house waste is designated by her Department as a major hazard operation; and whether this designation was required under Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002.  [220249]</p>




<p><a name="50310w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The regulation does not define a major hazard operation. However, in order to ensure that the controls are applied evenly across the country, Defra has issued guidance on how we intend to apply the regulation in relation to intermediate plants. The guidance is the result of our interpretation of the legislation and our assessment of the risks to human and animal health associated with handling animal by-products at intermediate plants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w01.html_para8">
In the guidance we differentiate between loading operations that we regard as a major hazard (e.g. tipping of slaughterhouse waste) and operations that we consider to be a lesser hazard.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1924W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w01.html_para9">
A major consideration is the physical characteristics of the material to be handled. The handling of slaughterhouse waste (containing viscera, bones, specified risk material etc.) is more likely to result in environmental contamination due to spillage of material or associated fluids than the handling of entire carcases.
</p>





<p><a name="50310w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for how long temporary licences will be granted to businesses that need to make changes to their operations to comply with Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002; and whether temporary licences to businesses will take into account the time required to obtain planning consent.  [220250]</p>




<p><a name="50310w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Animal By-Products Regulation has applied in member states since 1 May 2003, and operators have therefore had over 18 months to achieve compliance with its requirements. Continued extension of temporary approvals for non-compliant premises would disadvantage those operators who have invested to meet the required standards, and as a general rule we are not granting such extensions. However, we recognise that in a very small number of cases, short-term approval may be appropriate to allow for specified remedial works to be carried out to an agreed deadline. A temporary approval will only be issued in these circumstances. If the operator cannot provide us with a clear deliverable schedule of works, for example because he has not obtained planning consent, we will not issue a temporary approval.
</p>





<p><a name="50310w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the other ways are in which Intermediary Plants can demonstrate compliance with the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 referred to in the answer to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire of 12 February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1558W; and how many intermediary plants in England have been licensed which demonstrate compliance with the Animals By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 in other ways. [220264]</p>




<p><a name="50310w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 requires Intermediate Plants to have a &quot;covered space&quot; to receive animal by-products. It also requires the plant to be constructed in such a way that it is easy to clean and disinfect, and that floors must be laid down in such a way as to facilitate the draining 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1925W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of liquids. The plant must also have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests, such as insects, rodents and birds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w01.html_para10">
As stated in the answer of 12 February 2004, in our view, the combination of these requirements is such that it would be necessary for the plant to have a roof, walls and a floor before we can approve it. I am not aware of any operator who has been able to demonstrate that their plant complies in another way. However, it is open to them to propose alternative ways of complying with all of the above requirements.

 The information requested is as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w02.html_para3">
<i>(a)</i> The development of disease in individual cattle is variable with no consistent timeframe for those that may go on to develop lung lesions. The period before lung lesions develop depends on factors such as the number of bacilli infecting the lung and the strength of the immune response of the animal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w02.html_para4">
<i>(b)</i> The sooner infected animals are detected the less likely they are to transmit disease to direct contacts or other herds. Local prevalence of bovine TB is reviewed annually, and this is used to determine parish TB testing frequencies. Areas where disease is more established are tested more regularly and yearly testing is carried out in herds at higher risk of infection. In addition, divisional veterinary managers can increase the level of testing in their areas to reflect changes in the local TB situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w02.html_para5">
Testing every six months would detect some infections sooner but there would be resource restraints on such a policy. In order to target resources most effectively, only cattle herds which have recently suffered a TB breakdown are tested after a six-monthly interval.

<p><a name="50310w02.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 7 March 2005]:</i> There is no evidence to suggest that the resumption of reactive culling would reduce the incidence of bovine TB in cattle. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) has continued to collect data from the reactive areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial and recent analyses are consistent with results presented in late 2003, with the confidence limits providing no evidence for a beneficial effect of the reactive strategy over the time scale under study. Further detailed investigations based on the distribution of TB breakdowns in space and time are underway to investigate whether the observed increased incidence was linked to proximity to reactive culling. In addition, as further TB incidence data are obtained, the ISG will continue to analyse data from reactive areas. If the TB incidence rates in reactive and survey areas become more similar over time, this finding would indicate that the observed increase in TB breakdowns in reactive areas, compared with survey-only areas, was associated with reactive culling.

Export refunds bridge the gap, for subsidised exports, between the high EU domestic prices and the lower world price.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w07.html_para2">
Changes in domestic and world market conditions are specific to individual commodities and it is therefore difficult to generalise. However, the EU-world price gap narrowed for a number of important commodities around 2001, primarily due to an increase in world prices (thus reducing the unit rate of export refund required for subsidised exports). Changes in the exchange rate have an impact across commodities: the value of the euro against the dollar declined between 1999 and 2001 thereby reinforcing the affects of the trends in world prices, in euro terms. In addition, domestic institutional prices for cereals and beef were subject to a stepped reduction, starting from 2000, under the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.

Of the radiative forcing due to man-made greenhouse gases experienced in the year 1970, about 65 per cent. was due to carbon dioxide, about 25 per cent. to methane, and about 5 per cent. to both nitrous oxide and the halocarbons. In 2000, about 60 per cent. of the radiative forcing from man-made gases was due to carbon dioxide, about 20 per cent. was due to methane, about 5 per cent. due to nitrous oxide, and the remainder due to halocarbons.

 The project &quot;Exposure of the General Public to Radio Waves near Microcell and Picocell Base Stations . . . &quot; was carried out under the auspices of the LINK Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR) Programme (see www.mthr.org.uk). The project was designed to establish the best methodology for undertaking such measurements and was not a part of a national measurement audit. The project considered those sites with the accepted characteristics of microcell and picocell base stations. Of the 3,000 sites that fall into this category, 20 sites were randomly selected for survey. The study found that exposures at all sites surveyed were well below the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) levels (the highest level recorded was 8.6 per cent. of the ICNIRP public reference level). The study demonstrated a viable measurement protocol.

<p><a name="50310w15.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 On 7 January 2004 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) announced a new regional management structure to help drive forward its work in the regions and develop relationships at a regional level. This has allowed for a more streamlined and effective management structure that avoids additional bureaucracy, and delivers the LSC&#039;s agenda with fewer staff overall. Except in London, each LSC Regional Director also has responsibility for a specific local LSC within their region, and the region itself maps on to the same geographical areas as those covered by the relevant Government Office for the Region.

<p><a name="50310w15.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Willis: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the time that local education authorities and promoters will need to plan and implement proposals for replacement secondary schools resulting from the proposal in the Education Bill to include replacement secondary schools in the secondary school competition arrangements; and what assessment she has made of whether there will be an increase in pressures on staff, parents and pupils subject to the competition procedures while undergoing school reorganisation. [220890]</p>




<p><a name="50310w15.html_spnew6"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 Competitions for replacement secondary schools will take place only where the local authority decides that statutory proposals for a new secondary school are necessary. The time scale will therefore be the same as for any other reorganisation, with the addition of four months for prospective promoters to prepare their bids. We would expect the local authority to take this into account in planning future reorganisations and discussing them with schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w15.html_para2">
Since competitions will take place only where proposals for new schools would be required in any case, there should be no increased pressure on staff, parents and pupils. The competition requirement, and increased time for preparation of possible alternative options and provision for people to comment on those proposals, will together give greater opportunities for staff, pupils and parents to have a say about the type of school that they believe will best meet local needs.

<p>Mr. Lansley: To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what progress is being made in developing a standard form for local pharmaceutical services under the new pharmacy contract;  [216148]
</p>



<p>(2) what the reasons are for restricting the exit payment under the new pharmacy contract to the first year of the contract&#039;s operation;  [216149]

<p>(3) what support will be given to pharmacies dispensing less than 2,000 items per month under the new pharmacy contract.  [216150]</p>




<p><a name="50310w17.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The current essential small pharmacies scheme (ESPS) enables pharmacies dispensing fewer than 26,100 prescriptions per year and located more than 1 km from the next nearest pharmacy to receive financial support. This is currently &#163;43,150 per year. There were 223 ESPS pharmacies in England as at 31 March 2004. National health service primary care trusts (PCTs) can in addition support, or commission services from, other pharmacies with lower dispensing volumes in their area that do not meet the ESPS criteria if they wish to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w17.html_para5">
The new community pharmacy contractual framework, due to go live from 1 April, will include special measures for pharmacies with lower dispensing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1981W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
volumes. The ESPS will continue and in 2006&#150;07, we plan that these pharmacies will be able to choose whether to convert to being a local pharmaceutical services (IPS) pharmacy and retain their current ESPS entitlements or to transfer to the new contractual framework. In addition, a standard form of IPS for other pharmacies, with lower dispensing volumes, is being developed. This may help increase income for such pharmacies where they provide services which meet local health care needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w17.html_para6">
We expect these support arrangements to continue to be in place in 2008. We also expect NHS PCTs will, in reviewing their assessment of pharmaceutical needs, continue to consider what support can be offered to pharmacies with lower dispensing volumes which contribute effectively to meeting such needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w17.html_para7">
Pharmacies dispensing between 1,100 and 2,000 items a month will continue to receive the professional allowance until 31 March 2008. This ranges from &#163;9,300 to &#163;18,000 per year, depending on prescription volume. Pharmacies dispensing fewer than 2,000 prescriptions per year will also receive the new practice payment. Pharmacies dispensing under 1,100 prescriptions per month will receive a payment of &#163;500 per annum as part of the practice payment. Additionally, pharmacies will have the option, during the first year of implementation, to decide whether they wish to relinquish their right to provide NHS services and to receive compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w17.html_para8">
We discussed and agreed as part of our negotiations with the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee that pharmacies would be entitled during the first year of the new contractual framework to claim an exit payment. That framework will enhance the range and quality of pharmaceutical services contractors offer&#151;and which patients will come to expect&#151;in future. None the less, we recognised that some contractors may not wish to continue to provide services though we hope this 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1982W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
number will be very few. We believe we have allowed a reasonable time limit within which contractors should come to a decision. To prolong the period for deliberation risks depriving all patients of the benefits the new arrangements will bring.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w17.html_para9">
We estimate that some 650 community pharmacies in England&#151;or approximately 7 per cent. of the total&#151;will be eligible for these special support arrangements in 2005&#150;06. We have not estimated the number of such pharmacies that will close when these arrangements come to an end in 2008. That is a commercial decision for the contractor concerned. Consequently, we have not estimated any savings that may accrue. We do however fully expect all contractors to take advantage of the significant opportunities the new framework offers to expand the range and quality of services they offer and to be remunerated accordingly.

<p><a name="50310w21.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence has no requirement to retain information specifically relating to the numbers of civilians flown on RAF or chartered aircraft utilized on the South Atlantic schedule. Furthermore, the MOD does not retain air travel booking information longer than the current and previous financial years. No figures are, therefore, available for the period 1997 to March 2003. Booking information for the financial year April 2003 to March 2004 is not all held centrally and detail of civilians is not in a form which could be extracted without disproportionate cost.

While information for the current financial year is not all held centrally, it has been possible to establish the number of fare-paying civilian passengers who have been booked through the Defence Passenger Reservations Centre in the UK and who have flown to/from Ascension Island during the period April 2004 to February 2005: 1,481.

<p><a name="50310w21.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Wideawake is a United States military facility operated under the terms of the 1950 Bahamas Agreement as modified by subsequent Exchange of Notes. The use of Wideawake by civil aircraft was established under an Exchange of Notes in October 2003. Up to four movements (two arrivals, two departures) are allowed a week. Under the terms of agreement, military movements, both UK and US, have priority over civil movements at all times. In times of crisis, civil flights would be allowed only if there is no operational impact.

There has been no assessment of the viability of a free-for-all approach to sea trout fishing in Strangford Lough.

2. If a patient was admitted in one year and their episode carried into the next year the number of bed days are attributed to the year in which the admission took place and the admission is only counted once in the year it occurred.<br>

3. If a patient is admitted when aged less than 18 years and the patient turns 18 years of age during their episode, bed days after the patient turns 18 years of age are included in total length of stay.<br>

4. Where possible the number of bed days was calculated excluding days on leave, however one trust was unable to exclude days on leave from their figures.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what methodology was used to form the equality impact assessment&#039;s view that <i>(a)</i> Protestants and <i>(b)</i> Unionists are likely to bear a disproportionately greater burden of the domestic and sewerage bill under the Government Reform of Water and Sewerage Services; by what percentage he estimates they will be disproportionately affected; and by how much he estimates this would affect the income of the average family in the course of a year, based on each broad policy option.  [221339]</p>




<p><a name="50310w26.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 A spatial analysis methodology was used in the recently published draft Integrated Impact Assessment to assess the equality impact of proposals for domestic charging under the reform of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland. Analysis of impacts in respect of religious belief was performed at electoral ward level using &quot;community background&quot; data from the 2001 census. Analysis of impacts in respect of political opinion was performed at district council level using Electoral Office data based on first preference votes at the 2001 local elections. These data were combined with information regarding recent house sales from the Valuation and Lands Agency. The conclusion that Protestants and Unionists are likely to bear a disproportionately greater burden of domestic water and sewerage charges reflects the fact that there is a markedly higher representation of these groups in those areas of Northern Ireland with higher domestic property prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50310w26.html_para1">
This methodology allows broad assessments to be made, however data are not available on individual properties to enable calculations to be made of the likely average water and sewerage charge for Protestant and Unionist households. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the percentage by which Protestant and Unionist households may be disproportionately affected, nor by how much in relation to the average family income for each broad policy option.

 These targets were agreed as part of the 2004 spending review which covers the period 2005&#150;08. No assessment of progress against these targets has yet been made. However, progress against the similar SR2002 targets was published in December 2004 in the Department&#039;s autumn performance report, a copy of which is available in the Library.
