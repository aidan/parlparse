<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what progress is being made on the review of the minimum funding requirement; and if he will make a statement.  [144495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A wide ranging consultation paper was issued on 14 September 2000 asking for comment by 31 January 2001. We will then study the responses received and consider the best way forward.

<a name="10109w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Disability Living Allowance</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn1"><B> Helen Jackson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what arrangements have been made to process claims for higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance in respect of three and four-year-old children; and if he will make a statement.  [144851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Due to take place from 9 April under the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act, the extension of the higher rate mobility component to three and four-year-olds is expected to benefit 6,000 children in the first year and more in the future. Most children likely to benefit will already be receiving the Care Component of Disability Living Allowance. This means they are already known to the Department and arrangements have been made to write in every case to the person who deals with the child's benefit to invite them to apply for the higher rate mobility component. Once details of a child's mobility needs are known to the Department, then depending on the circumstances of each case, they could be entitled to an extra &#163;38.65 per week and access in some cases to the Motability scheme.

<a name="10109w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Winter Fuel Payments</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) how many people have received all the backdated winter fuel payments to which they are entitled;  [143157]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many men who have an entitlement to a backdated winter fuel payment accrued when they reached 60 years have <i>(a)</i> received the backdated payment and <i>(b)</i> are awaiting some or all of the payment;  [143528]
<P>
(3) how many claims for backdated winter fuel payments were received <i>(a)</i> before and <i>(b)</i> after 3 November.  [143525]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Latest information shows that around one million people, of whom around 980,000 are men, have chosen to claim for past winters and around one million payments have been made, of which around 975,000 have 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2001 : Column: 478W</I><P>
been to men. Almost one million claims were received before 3 November and approximately 50,000 since that date.
<P>

<a name="10109w01.html_para0">We are unable to give precise figures as claims are still being received and processed. It is up to the individual to choose whether to claim payments for past winters. The information campaign, which has been running since April, aimed to ensure that existing and potential customers know about the changes to the scheme and what to do to get a payment.

<a name="10109w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Sheltered Housing</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if the very sheltered housing scheme is intended to provide a replacement for Housing Benefit.  [144187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> Housing Benefit is available to help people on low incomes, including those tenants living in sheltered or very sheltered accommodation to meet their housing costs (ie rent and accommodation-related service charges). Housing Benefit will also continue to help meet service charges for lower-level support until April 2003. From this date, the various funding streams will be drawn together and these support services will instead be met from a single budget--Supporting People--which will be managed by local authorities together with probation services. Service charges for more intensive personal support, including personal care, remain ineligible for Housing Benefit.

<a name="10109w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Minimum Income Guarantee</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many pensioners have applied <i>(a)</i> successfully and <i>(b)</i> unsuccessfully for the minimum income guarantee since the start of the take-up campaign in each Benefit Agency area.  [143524]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The effect of the minimum income guarantee take up campaign will not be known until it comes to a conclusion. There are thousands more claims in the pipeline, and the effects of the last stage of the campaign will impact on claims processed up to January next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer of 13 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 135W, on St. Helena, if she will place in the Library a copy of the draft report resulting from the study of options for sea and air access to St. Helena.

 This is a matter for the St. Helena Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list the projects undertaken for her Department by <i>(a)</i> outside consultants, 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2001 : Column: 479W</I><P>
<i>(b)</i> academic researchers and <i>(c)</i> university departments since 1 May 1997, giving the total expenditure incurred in each category.  [144082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID draws widely on the range of consultancy expertise in order to deliver our development programme.
<P>

<a name="10109w01.html_para1">Since 1 May 1997 DFID has awarded over 7,200 contracts with a value of some &#163;1,043 million. I am placing a list of these contracts in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10109w01.html_para2">Information on the total expenditure classified by consultants, academic researchers or university departments is not available without disproportionate cost.

<a name="10109w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>GATS Negotiations</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her Department's role in the current GATS negotiations.  [143086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department is helping to build the capacity of developing countries to participate effectively in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) negotiations. DFID is contributing to a World Bank Programme on Trade in Services, providing data and information to help developing countries formulate policy for the negotiations. In addition, officials are in the process of drawing up specific proposals to support representatives of developing countries in Geneva responsible for the trade in services issues.
<P>

<a name="10109w01.html_para3">My officials also work closely with other Whitehall Departments to ensure that UK and EU policy on trade in services has a strong development dimension. A successful outcome from the current negotiations on the GATS would offer a number of benefits for developing countries. They could potentially increase their income from individual service sectors, for example, tourism. In addition, progress on issues such as the "movement of persons" (the ability for nationals to work overseas for a temporary period) would offer developing countries new opportunities for export of services. Increased competition in the provision of domestic services which support a country's basic infrastructure, e.g. banking, transport and telecommunications, will contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="10109w01.html_para4">The current negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) offer developing countries the potential to gain access to new markets overseas and to benefit from more efficient and competitive services at home. Developing countries are particularly interested in the liberalisation of sectors where they have the greatest export potential; at present tourism services and movement of persons (i.e. the ability for personnel to spend some time overseas for the purposes of providing a specific service).
<P>

<a name="10109w01.html_para5">We are helping developing countries to participate in the new GATS negotiations, so that world trade in services better contributes to their economic growth and thereby the elimination of poverty.

Since my announcement, the Porton Down Volunteer helpline, which was established in January 1998, has received 120 calls. Volunteers who approach the helpline will obtain full information, by letter, on their own trials, and be offered the opportunity to examine the records for themselves at the site. I also offered volunteers the opportunity of receiving a thorough medical assessment, along the lines of the well established Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. As at 4 January, the MAP programme has received 20 inquiries, of which 14 volunteers have been referred to the MAP for assessment.
<P>

<a name="10109w02.html_para0">We have also received 24 other inquiries, in the form of Parliamentary Inquiries and letters from members of the public, on matters relating to the trials at Porton Down.

 Existing arrangements for the treatment of Service personnel, which include provision for rapid access to hospital out-patient appointments in high priority cases, have recently been supplemented by contracts with private sector providers in order to help return personnel quickly to fully deployable status and so relieve overstretch.

 During the Second World War, British Service personnel who were held as prisoners of war or protected personnel continued to receive their Service pay during their captivity; this was credited to their home pay account. On repatriation, arrangements were made for adjustments to be made to an individual's pay account to resolve any outstanding pay issues in relation to their time in enemy hands. From time to time the Ministry of Defence continues to receive representations from former British Service personnel about matters relating to their pay while in captivity.

 TV Licensing, which administers this concession for the BBC as Licensing Authority, is not able to provide geographical breakdowns of the number of free licences issued.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> Everyone aged 75 or over is entitled to benefit from a free television licence, but licences cover households rather than individuals so households with more than one member over 75 need only a single free licence.

 I intend to publish the guidelines, which have been revised in the light of the public consultation, tomorrow. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10109w02.html_para12">The guidelines explain how the BBC must meet its obligations under the Charter and Agreement. They make clear that the BBC cannot make material changes to the nature of existing services without properly consulting licence payers and that they cannot establish new national services, or go outside the terms of services which I have approved, without my consent. The BBC cannot make fundamental changes to the nature of existing channels, such as the proposals to change BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge into BBC3 and BBC4, without consulting the public.
<P>

<a name="10109w02.html_para13">Individual scheduling decisions are of course a matter for the Governors, but the Guidelines make clear that the BBC must ensure that its services, including BBC1 and BBC2, continue to meet the standards of content and quality set out in the Charter and Agreement. As I recently made clear over the move of the BBC Nine O'Clock News, I shall be looking to ensure that the Governors perform those duties rigorously. And no changes to those standards of content and quality can be made without the consent of Parliament.

 "Public Bodies 2000" is the latest in a series of annual reports on the size, spend and membership of the UK "quango" sector. I am pleased to report that "Public Bodies 2000" was published on 4 January and that copies are available from the Vote Office. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="10109w03.html_para0">This Government are committed to keeping the number of "quangos" (or non-departmental public bodies) to a minimum. I am, therefore, pleased to report that there are now fewer "quangos" in the UK than at any other time over the past 20 years. The latest figure of 1,035 means that numbers have fallen by around 10 per cent. since 1997. Those "quangos" which remain, such as the Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency and the Parole Board, continue to carry out a range of important and essential public services.
<P>

<a name="10109w03.html_para1">The Government are determined to ensure that all "quangos" are open and accountable. To this end, responsibility for hundreds of public bodies has now been transferred to the new, democratically elected bodies in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and London.

This sought opinions on the potential for legislative and voluntary approaches to recycling non-packaging agricultural film. Some 10,000 consultation documents were issued but there was a very limited response to this consultation--only 35. These showed no clear preference for a legislative approach and provided the Government with no clear basis for future action. The issue has been raised again in the context of extending waste management controls to agricultural waste and is being considered currently.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the impact on <i>(a)</i> house prices and <i>(b)</i> levels of homelessness in the south-east region of a decision to allow individual local authorities to decide the overall level of provision of new dwellings over the next 20 years; and if he will make a statement.  [144519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government's policy is to encourage local authorities to work with one another and other stakeholders in order to take a strategic view of housing needs sensitive to the location of jobs and services and to future changes in circumstances. The new framework for the development of Regional Planning Guidance facilitates this approach and helps local authorities to plan, monitor and manage on a more flexible basis than under the former "predict and provide" regime which we have abandoned.
<P>

<a name="10109w04.html_para1">Planning on a purely local basis without this strategic framework would be likely to lead to higher house prices and increased homelessness in areas of high demand, and to other impacts such as skill shortages and longer journeys to work. It would also be likely to lead to inconsistent patterns of provision aggravating problems of shortage in some areas and conversely contributing to low demand and abandonment in others. However, the precise scale of these impacts in the south-east would be difficult to estimate given the complexity of the housing market.

 The independent research did not specifically examine sites in either the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, or Argyll and Bute constituency. However, similar sites in other remote and sparsely populated areas (such as in Wales and the Yorkshire Dales) were studied. The sample of sites chosen was designed to ensure that selected sites were broadly representative of quarries across the country in terms of local population density and outputs. The findings of the research, "The Environmental Costs and Benefits of the Supply of Aggregates" by London Economics, was published in July 1999 and provided the basis for setting the rate of the aggregates levy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his strategy is for combating violent crime is.  [144672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Although violent crime represents a relatively small proportion of all crime, and the British Crime Survey showed that there had been a 4 per cent. fall in total violent crime between 1997 and the end of 1999, it includes those crimes which cause people, particularly those who are most vulnerable, the greatest concern and fear.
<P>

<a name="10109w05.html_para0">The Government are committed to ensuring that the long-term rise in the number of violent crimes is reversed, that the causes of violent crime are addressed and that individuals and communities are protected and feel safe. The Government are therefore introducing a comprehensive strategy to tackle violent crime through action which will prevent violence in the first place, assist the police in their fight against such crime, bring offenders to justice, root out offending behaviour, and support victims and witnesses.
<P>

<a name="10109w05.html_para1">The detailed proposals underpinning the strategy are set out in "Fighting Crime Together: An Action Plan" to be published tomorrow, a copy of which will be placed in the Library.

<P>

<a name="10109w05.html_para2">The United Kingdom ratified the Convention in December 1998 on the basis of the Government's assessment that existing statute and case law in the United Kingdom already ensures compliance with our obligations under the Convention. In our White Paper "Raising Standards and Upholding Integrity: the Prevention of Corruption" issued in June 2000 (Cm 4759) we proposed to put or compliance beyond any doubt by making it clear in statute that the United Kingdom has jurisdiction over bribery offences involving foreign public officials which take place in the United Kingdom. The White Paper also proposed a new provision, implementing an optional provision of the Convention, to give the United Kingdom jurisdiction over bribery offences committed by United Kingdom nationals overseas.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> There are already a number of legislative and regulatory disclosure requirements in relation to stock options. The Companies Act 1985 requires companies to provide information relating to any option to subscribe for shares, including the number, description and amount of the shares in relation to which the right is exercisable and the price to be paid for the shares allotted. Listed companies are required under the Listing Rules to seek prior shareholder approval of an employees' share scheme involving the issue of new shares, and to send a circular to shareholders in connection with the approval including

either the full text of the scheme or a description of its principal terms. The Government have no plans to require additional disclosures by companies in this area.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> The Companies Act 1985 requires companies to state the aggregate wages or salaries, including bonuses and special payments, paid or payable to employees in respect of each financial year. The Government have laid a draft statutory instrument before Parliament under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 which would introduce a corresponding requirement in relation to the sums paid to the employees of a limited liability partnership.

 A key element of our Post Office reform package is the transformation of the Post Office from a public corporation to a public limited company.

Prior to making the Order, the Post Office were consulted, in accordance with section 62(3) of the Act.

<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para0">As required by the Act, this is a company which is wholly owned by the Crown. The Secretary of State is appointing the current members of the Post Office board as the first directors of the company. The memorandum and articles of association of the company are available for inspection in the usual way at Companies House, and copies are being laid in the Libraries of both Houses. As was foreshadowed during the debates on the Postal Services Bill, the articles of association include the special provisions protecting certain rights of the Government, particularly the appointment of the chairman of the company, and the remainder of the board (after consulting the chairman); changes in the remuneration packages of the directors; approval of the strategic plan; and controls on the disposal of significant assets.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para1">The name of the new company was chosen by the directors after careful research by the Post Office into the requirements of a modern postal operator working in the rapidly changing commercial communications environment of the 21st century. The directors are however intent that the traditional and well-loved titles of Royal Mail and Post Office should continue to be used wherever they are currently seen in this country; the name change will therefore have little if any impact on domestic and most business customers. The main marketing use of the new name will be with integrated and international business users. As previously indicated, Her Majesty has graciously consented that the existing Royal connections with the organisation should continue.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para2">The Order also appoints 26 March 2001 as the day on which the transfer of the property, rights and liabilities will be made--this is the day after the end of the Post Office's current financial year and the day on which most of the new provisions of the Postal Services Act 2000 are scheduled to commence. The transformation to a plc will then be complete.

 Licences to export arms and other goods whose export is controlled for strategic reasons are issued by my right hon.

All relevant individual licence applications are circulated by the DTI to other Government Departments with an interest as determined by those Departments in line with their policy responsibilities. These include FCO, MOD and DfID. These Departments give advice to the DTI on whether the applications should be approved or refused in accordance with the consolidated EU and national export licensing criteria announced by the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), on 26 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 199-203W.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para3">Strategic export licensing is a joined-up process.

 The Government's commitments to exporters are set out in a Service and Performance Code published by the Export Control Organisation (ECO). Where, as in almost all cases, the advice of other Government Departments is sought on applications for Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs), the aim is to provide a substantive response within 20 working days.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para7">While the Government have performance targets for processing SIELs, this target does not apply to applications concerning Iran, Iraq or applications for licences to export goods which are subject to control solely because of UN sanctions. This is because there are special licensing procedures for those destinations, which reflect the Government's concerns. But none the less, we still make every effort to process such applications as quickly as possible. Nor do they apply for Open Individual Export Licences because of the very wide variation in the goods and destination coverage of such licences.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para8">The Government's performance figures were not collected on a monthly basis before 1 January 2000. However, the performance for the whole of 1999 can be found in the Government's Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls. The figures from 1 January 2000 are set out in the table.

 Licences to export arms and other goods whose export is controlled for strategic reasons are issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry acting through the Export Control Organisation (ECO) of the Department of Trade and Industry. The ECO issues a range of licences depending on the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para9">Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) generally allow shipments of specified goods to a specified consignee up to the quantity specified by the licence.

<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para10">Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) are specific to an individual exporter and cover multiple shipments of specified goods to specified destinations and, in some cases, specified consignees.

<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para12">All individual export licence applications, including those for repeat orders, are considered on a case by case basis. This is because there may have been a change in circumstances, since the original application was scrutinised, that affects the Government's decision on whether to issue a licence. However, when submitting applications, exporters are asked for details of previous applications to export the same or similar goods/ technology to the same destination(s) so that these may be taken into consideration during the licensing process.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para13">If an exporter makes many SIEL applications for the same or similar goods/technology to the same destination(s), they may in some cases be advised by the ECO to apply for an OIEL which, if granted, would give the exporter the flexibility to meet repeat orders.

 Details of all export licensing decisions taken in 1999 were set out in the Government's Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; copies are in the Library of the House. This report lists by country of destination the numbers of Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) issued and refused in each entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled, which is known as their rating. It should be noted that an OIEL covers multiple shipments of specified goods to specified destinations or specified consignees.
<P>

<a name="10109w06.html_para14">In addition, Open General Export Licences allow the export of specified controlled goods to certain destinations by any company, removing the need for a company to apply for an individual licence. Copies of all Open General Export Licences valid at any time during 1999 were listed in the Annual Report and have been placed in the Library of the House.

 We do all that we properly can to trace British nationals who have been reported missing or are suspected to have died overseas. It would not be possible for British consular staff to physically conduct searches so we approach relatives, local authorities, the police and any other agency which might help in the search.

<a name="10109w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We seek to be as helpful as possible within legal and resource constraints in every case where a British citizen is reported missing or killed overseas. 2,492 British citizens have been reported missing and 239 killed overseas since 1996. Information on the countries concerned is contained in my answer to my hon. Friend's earlier question. The information requested on our interventions and results of our interventions in these cases could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 We have expressed our concerns about Mrs. Athwal to the Indian authorities on numerous occasions and at a high level. Mrs. Athwal's family met the Acting Head of Consular Division in August and will meet Baroness Scotland, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, early in the New Year. Through out efforts the Indian police granted permission for the Metropolitan police to become involved in the investigation, and we arranged for officers to travel to India this year to assist their Indian counterparts in any way possible. The family have a legal representative in India but a court case did not produce the result they were seeking, for lack of evidence. We shall continue to press the authorities to keep up their efforts to try to find Mrs. Athwal.

<P>
<a name="10109w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 In 1997-98 we spent &#163;1 million on a publicity campaign to reduce the number of ticketless fans travelling to France for the World Cup Finals and to explain what consular services were available. Independent monitoring of the campaign showed that it had been effective in increasing awareness among fans of the dangers of travelling without tickets. Before our campaign, 13 per cent. of our target audience said they were likely or very likely to travel to France for the World Cup in the hope of getting into a game with a ticket bought on the black market. After the campaign, those saying they would still travel dropped to 6 per cent. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office did not undertake any advertising campaigns in 1996-97, 1998-99 and 1999-2000, and to date has not done so in 2000-01.

 EU governments have repeatedly stated that the goal of the European defence initiative is to be able to take decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crises.

The NATO Ministerial on 14-15 December confirmed that the objectives of the DCI and of the EU's Headline Goal are mutually reinforcing.

 We are not aware of a UN assessment linking deaths in Iraq with the UN sanctions policy.

Almost $3 billion worth of goods were processed in 2000.

 Any school in England at which full-time education is provided for five or more pupils of compulsory school age, and which is not a school maintained by a local education authority or a non- maintained special school, must register as an independent school. Initially registration is provisional. Final registration is conditional on inspection evidence that the standards at the school meet the requirements of the Education Act 1996 in relation to accommodation, premises, instruction, proprietor and staff, and child welfare in the case of a boarding school.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w11.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> More teachers are entering than leaving the profession. There were 7,500 more teachers in England and Wales in January 2000 than in January 1998. The Teacher Training Agency nevertheless contributed to the costs of a study by the University of North London on teacher supply and retention in London. This included surveying those leaving teaching posts in six London boroughs in 1998-99, including those moving into other teaching jobs.
<P>

<a name="10109w11.html_para0">The most commonly cited reasons for leaving were school management, hours worked, pupil behaviour, lack of opportunities for promotion and school resources. We are addressing these and other issues raised, including through new professional development opportunities for headteachers and improved support for teachers, for example by the planned recruitment of 20,000 full-time (or equivalent) extra teaching assistants by 2002. A total of &#163;174 million was allocated to local authorities on 3 January to help reduce truancy and indiscipline, and funding per pupil will have increased by over &#163;450 in real terms between 1997-98 and 2001-02.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> My right hon. Friend has received a number of representations on the level of education funding in the local government settlement from authorities, schools and parents. We are continuing to increase the general funding available across the country following the Spending Review. In the four years from 1997, funding per pupil will have increased by over &#163;450 per pupil in real terms. Under the last Government, funding per pupil fell by &#163;60 in real terms between 1994-95 and 1997-98.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if it is his policy to reduce the gap between the funding per pupil in primary and secondary sectors in Worcestershire and the respective national average for both sectors; and if he will make a statement.  [144507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w11.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> We recognise that the current formula for distributing funding between local education authorities is far from perfect and that is why we are currently conducting a review of local authority grant distribution. The Green Paper on the future of local authority funding makes it clear that the Government are seeking arrangements which will be fair between different parts of the country; are more transparent; and will provide greater predictability and stability. Our objective is to remove the worst of the disparities that exist across the country, by levelling up, not down. We are continuing to increase the general funding available across the country following the Spending Review. In the four years from 1997, funding per pupil will have increased by over &#163;450 per pupil in real terms. Under the last Government, funding per pupil fell by &#163;60 in real terms between 1994-95 and 1997-98.

<a name="10109w11.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> These are virtues which are a responsibility for parents to inculcate in their children. School subjects like RE, Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health education can reinforce this by teaching children the difference between right and wrong, as well as the importance of being good citizens.

 Knowledge and understanding of the United Nations is already included in the programmes of study for Citizenship education for secondary schools. From August 2002, Citizenship will be part of the National Curriculum and pupils will be taught about the purpose and workings of international organisations such as the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and the Commonwealth in contemporary society. They will be able to explore the role of the UN in conflict resolution, for example through model United Nations projects.

<a name="10109w12.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Kingham: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what quantity of water was released as a result of the opening of the Leigh barrier on the Medway on <i>(a)</i> 12 and <i>(b)</i> 13 October and over what period of time; what estimates were made by the responsible staff at the time of the opening of the barrier as to the effect on the village of Yalding and its surrounding area; what assessment he has made of the level of flooding in the Yalding area had the barrier not been opened; and what evidence he uses to support his assessment.  [144450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> The Leigh Barrier provides relief from flooding in the Upper Medway valley, by allowing floodwaters to be stored in 6km of river valley. This reduces the risk to life and property downstream which would otherwise be exposed to an uncontrolled natural event. The benefit is to all communities downstream of the barrier, including Yalding and its surrounding area, although the degree of flood mitigation reduces downstream due to inflow from unrestricted lengths of the Medway and its tributaries. The Barrier is operated by dedicated and qualified staff of the Environment Agency.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2001 : Column: 523W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10109w12.html_para6">The release of water from the Barrier is a normal function in a flood event as the operation of the Barrier is not to stop outflow but to throttle the flood to an extent which is appropriate to its size, available storage and the capacity of the downstream channel. In extreme events the discharge may exceed the capacity of the downstream channel, and hence flooding occurs, but the extent of this flooding will be reduced by virtue of the stored volume of floodwater.
<P>

<a name="10109w12.html_para7">The flood event of mid-October produced the highest flood peak since the scheme was constructed with peak inflows between 250 and 300 cubic metres per second. The Leigh Barrier was operated from 10.30 on 12 October until 16.00 on 14 October. During this time nearly 5 million cubic metres of floodwater were stored. In the 16 hours from the onset of the flood on 12 October the throttled flow leaving the Barrier varied between 55 and 160 cubic metres per second, a total of 5.76 million cubic metres. On 13 October the throttled flow varied between 155 and 80 cubic metres per second, a total of 8 million cubic metres in 24 hours.
<P>

<a name="10109w12.html_para8">The Environment Agency staff recognised that while the Leigh Barrier could give some relief to downstream communities from the floodwaters in the Upper Medway, floodwaters from the rivers Beult and Teise and the Middle Medway catchment would severely affect Yalding. The peak flood from the River Teise reached Yalding first, followed by the flood peak from the Beult causing extensive flooding through the early hours of 13 October. The floodwaters from the Upper Medway, which had been moderated by the Leigh Barrier, would not have reached Yalding until late evening on 13 October.
<P>

<a name="10109w12.html_para9">The Environment Agency is to produce a full report on the Autumn flooding, in co-operation with local authorities and the emergency services. This will include the way that flood defence control structures, such as the Leigh Barrier, were operated and will identify any lessons to be learned.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> The Government rely on the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) for advice on matters concerning BSE and variant Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD). SEAC has concluded that BSE and vCJD are caused by prion strains that are currently indistinguishable, and considers vCJD to be an acquired prion disease caused by exposure to BSE or a BSE-like agent.
<P>

<a name="10109w15.html_para2">The Government are prepared to consider the funding of any proposals for research into possible explanations for BSE and vCJD, which should be submitted for consideration through the normal channels. Experiments are currently under way to look further into the theoretical possibility of transmission of vCJD via surgical instruments, or via blood. A hypothesis that BSE might be caused by an abnormal immune response is also being investigated. In addition, the Department of Health- funded National CJD Surveillance Unit follows up medical, immunological, occupational and residential histories of vCJD patients, as well as their dietary habits, on an ongoing basis to identify any common factors. The results are published in the unit's annual report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the Government's policy in respect of the regulation of imports of French beef into the United Kingdom.  [142354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w16.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 December 2000]:</i> I am advised on such matters by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for food safety issues in Government.
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para2">So far as imports of beef from France are concerned, the FSA advice is that legally sold, imported beef, poses no greater risk than United Kingdom beef. To be sold legally, imported beef must comply with the Over-Thirty-Months (OTM) rule. In addition, specified risk material (specified risk material (SRM)--that with the highest risk of infection) must be removed from cattle. New EU wide controls on SRM were introduced from 1 October 2000.
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para3">In assessing the safety of imported meat, protecting the public is the FSA's number one priority. As such it applies the following principles:
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Advice is based on the best available evidence. As further information comes to light, the position is kept under review and revised advice will be issued whenever necessary. This is an active process--the FSA is constantly seeking out the latest scientific and other information.
<P>
<BR>
Action should be proportionate to the risk. Risk can never be totally eliminated--food is no different in this respect from other aspects of daily life. Where there is a risk that does not warrant banning, the FSA seeks to provide information and take action to enable consumer choice. Current advice on the safety of imported beef can be found on the FSA website at www.bsereview.org.uk.
<P>
<BR>
There should be full and vigorous enforcement of food law and regulations.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10109w16.html_para5">At the same time, the FSA recognises that individuals may wish to exercise personal preference to reduce as far as possible any risk that may be perceived from imported beef. It has therefore advised consumers that they should:
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Buy their meat from reputable sources
<P>
<BR>
Ask their supplier about the country of origin and source of the meat.
<P>
<P>
</UL></FONT><a name="10109w16.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what investigatory powers the Food Standards Agency has in regard to imported food and, in particular, French beef.  [144313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w16.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> Responsibility for enforcement action under the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food Standards Act 1999 in respect of imported foods, and foods coming into the United Kingdom from other European member states is primarily the responsibility of local authorities and port health authorities.
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para7">The Food Standards Agency has a range of powers under the 1990 and 1999 Acts to oversee and influence this enforcement with a view to ensuring its effectiveness in terms of consumer protection. In exceptional 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2001 : Column: 539W</I><P>
circumstances the agency may be empowered by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health to discharge enforcement responsibilities normally undertaken by local authorities and port health authorities.
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para8">Acting on the advice of the Food Standards Agency, Health Ministers may also prohibit the importation or distribution to the food chain of imported foods likely to involve imminent risks to consumers. However, where the EU has legislated to govern trade in a particular foodstuff or food product, as it has done with meat and meat products, the UK Government's powers to restrict the movement of such goods within the single market are severely restricted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w16.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> BCG vaccine against tuberculosis is currently available in the south-west for those individuals at higher risk of TB. Routine immunisation of all school children at age 10-14 was suspended in September 1999 due to severe manufacturing problems encountered by the sole United Kingdom licensed source, Celltech Medeva.
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para9">The Department is doing all it can to secure a robust supply of UK licensed and batch released BCG vaccine, and will announce as soon as possible when the routine schools programme can resume. All those who missed their BCG vaccination due to the suspension of the programme will be recalled as part of a catch up programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action the Government are taking to ensure that pregnant teenagers receive free impartial advice about <i>(a)</i> abortion and <i>(b)</i> motherhood.  [144185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10109w16.html_spnew10"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> On 2 January I announced 15 Sure Start Plus pilots. These are new programmes in health action zones with high teenage pregnancy rates and where there are Sure Start programmes that will start delivering services over the next few months. In these pilot areas, personal advisers will ensure that pregnant teenagers have access to comprehensive and impartial advice and counselling in the early stages of pregnancy so they are able to make informed decisions, including whether to continue with the pregnancy, adoption or abortion. The personal advisers will also co-ordinate a support package for new parents, both mothers and fathers, tailored to their individual needs, to help them back into education and employment as well as with healthcare and parenting.
<P>

<a name="10109w16.html_para10">In all other areas, local teenage pregnancy co-ordinators will shortly be developing comprehensive service checklists, as part of local co-ordinated teenage pregnancy strategies between health and local authorities. These will be aimed at young people and professionals whose client groups include young people, and will include details of local services that provide early advice and counselling to pregnant teenagers, and services that provide a range of support, including parenting skills, to teenage parents.
