<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many marriage counsellors funded <i>(a)</i> partly and <i>(b)</i> wholly by the Government, there were in the UK in (i) 1970, (ii) 1980 and (iii) 1999; and what was the cost.  [120660]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In the financial year 1999-2000 the Lord Chancellor's Department spent &#163;3.2 million on marriage and relationship support. Grant-in-aid is given to the central bodies of the main marriage support and research organisations towards expenses incurred in the development of training and support to local services, including the selection, training and supervision of counsellors, and administrative costs.
<P>

<a name="00502w01.html_para0">In line with Sir Graham Hart's recommendations in his report on Marriage Support Funding (November 1999), the allocation is being increased to &#163;4 million in 2001-01; &#163;4.5 million in 2002-02; and &#163;5 million in 2002-03. Figures for 1970 and 1980 are not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B>

<a name="00502w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the extent to which the site ion exchange extraction and the enhanced altinide removal waste filtration plants servicing the thermal oxide reprocessing plant facility at Sellafield have met their planned operational functions.

<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency monitors and assesses the performance of the various effluent treatment plant on the Sellafield site including the site ion exchange extraction plant (SIXEP) and the enhanced actinide removal plant (EARP).
<P>

<a name="00502w01.html_para1">During 1998 the Environment Agency report concluded that the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) performed satisfactorily in the removal of plutonium and other actinides from liquid effluent streams. In addition, the report considered that the plant has been reasonably effective for the removal of strontium-90 (Sr-90) and caesium-137 (Cs-137). The Agency considers there is scope for optimising the performance of EARP in line with the best practicable means. The Agency will continue to press for improvements in the effectiveness of EARP in reducing radionuclide discharges.
<P>

<a name="00502w01.html_para2">The Agency also judges that the Site Ion Exchange Plant (SIXEP) has continued to operate satisfactorily in 1998 and has achieved high efficiencies for the removal of both Sr-90 and Cs-137 from the fuel storage pond effluents. The Agency notes that BNFL has made progress in the research and development programme for the optimisation of SIXEP.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to phase out stand-by systems on electrical goods.  [119288]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The approach which the Government have followed, with other EU countries, is not to prevent the inclusion of stand-by systems in such products. In future, more equipment will communicate automatically with other equipment, users and service providers, and this will involve stand-by systems. Therefore, our approach is to ensure that these features incorporate good energy efficiency technology and do not encourage waste. We have been supporting EU initiatives in this field, which recently led to an agreement with manufacturers to reduce stand-by power consumption of new televisions and video cassette recorders. Further initiatives are in hand to reduce stand-by energy consumption in the fast growing areas of "set-up boxes" and power supply packs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Coaker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what funding sources are available to small pockets of deprivation outside the inner cities.  [120124]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) is the main source of government funding for tackling the most deprived areas in England, regardless of whether or not they are in inner-city areas, amounting to some &#163;679 million in 1999-2000. However, 20 per cent. of the SRB resources goes to significant pockets of deprivation in areas which are not in the most deprived areas, such as rural areas, market towns, the former coalfield areas and coastal towns.
<P>

<a name="00502w01.html_para7">In addition, substantial amounts of European Structural Funds will be available for the period 2000-06 amounting to &#163;1,867 million for Objective 1 areas and &#163;2,370 million for Objective 2 areas. A wide range of Government funding is also available, both as match funding and more generally, and this is set out in the DTI booklet, "Match Funding for European Structural Funds", published in March 2000.

<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the Government's strategy for waste management.  [120089]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government published "A Way With Waste", the draft waste strategy for England and Wales, in June 1999. The draft strategy described the need for substantial changes in the way we manage our waste, and the range of actions needed to deliver that change. We will publish the final version shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Ray Michie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he is taking to encourage the fitting of seat belts on minibuses and coaches; and if he will make a statement.  [120261]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Since 1998, all minibuses and coaches used to carry groups of three or more children on organised trips, including home to school transport, have been required to have seat belts fitted. The DETR is currently conducting a public consultation exercise on draft regulations which will require seat belts to be fitted to all new minibuses, coaches and buses which do not carry standing passengers. I understand that many minibus and coach manufacturers are already fitting seat belts as standard equipment to their new vehicles.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Ray Michie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the Government's policy on the introduction of compulsory wearing of seat belts on minibuses and coaches transporting children; and if he will make a statement.  [120262]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 All minibuses and coaches carrying children on organised trips must provide a forward facing seat and a lap belt as a minimum. On minibuses with an unladen weight of 2,540 kgs or less, the law already requires that seat belts be worn where fitted.




<P>
<P><I>2 May 2000 : Column: 4W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00502w01.html_para8">The Government currently have no plans to introduce compulsory seat belt wearing in minibuses above 2,540 kgs unladen weight and in coaches transporting children. The Government recognise the attractions of such a step but problems arise over enforcement and the legal liability of a driver in respect of children under 14. Moreover, the police would not be able easily to enforce seat belt wearing regulations in such large vehicles. Nevertheless, we are keeping this matter under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will publish the results from each local highway authority that were used in the 1998 National Road Maintenance Condition Survey.  [120734]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The National Road Maintenance Condition Survey is designed to produce estimates at the national level but not at the individual local authority level. Accordingly information is collected from local highway authorities on the basis that it is for statistical purposes only and will not be published by the DETR in an identifiable form.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As the Whitley Way is proposed as a local distributor road it is for the local planning and highway authorities to decide whether it should be built. This Department has therefore made no estimate of the associated costs. The Department has received a small number of representations about this road.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what procedures his Department has laid down to be followed when local authorities intend to introduce traffic into pedestrian areas or town centres; and if he will make a statement.  [120386]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Local authorities have powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to regulate traffic on local roads by making traffic regulation orders. These powers can be used to allow traffic into pedestrian areas or town centres. Access can be restricted to certain classes of vehicles and/or times of day. Local authorities are required to follow statutory procedures laid down in "The Local Authorities' Traffic Orders (Procedure)

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Under the arrangements establishing the Royal Travel grant-in-aid in 1997, the Royal Household and the Department decided to consider proposals for alternate use of the Train, when it was in the national interest to do so and as part of the ongoing policy of reducing the cost of official Royal travel. Government Departments were duly advised that the Train, when not being used for official Royal travel, was available for use on a reimbursable basis. To date, the FCO is the only Government Department to have used the Train.
<P>

<a name="00502w02.html_para0">Both the Department and the Household have received preliminary inquiries from several organisations about using the Train but none of these has yet put forward any firm proposals.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning announced on 13 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 249-50W, the publication of a consultation draft of a new Planning Policy Guidance Note 25, "Development and flood risk". This sets out proposals for a strengthening of the existing policy, which seeks to avoid inappropriate development in flood plains or development that increases flood risk. It gives specific guidance on the approach to new housing development. It recognises, however, that there will be occasions when other considerations outweigh flooding issues in favour of development proceeding. In such cases, it emphasises the need for development to be made safe through the adoption of appropriate protection or mitigation measures.

Six of the Agency's seven main budgets have increased, by a total of &#163;12.4 million. The seventh, for Land and Property, has decreased by &#163;11.4 million as a result of year-on-year variation in legally-committed expenditure and in income derived from sales.

<P>
<a name="00502w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In the assessment process for the AWE contract, bidders were required to provide information to demonstrate their safety record. AWE ML provided full information on its parent companies including Lockheed Martin. This information was assessed not only by the Department but by the independent regulators, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) in the context of AWE's existing safety regime, and by the Environment Agency (EA). The NII confirmed before the contract was signed that it was satisfied. The EA confirmed its satisfaction on 9 March when it issued revised discharge authorisations for the AWE sites.
<P>

<a name="00502w02.html_para3">After the contract was placed on 1 December, there was an incident at the Oak Ridge Y12 facility in Tennessee which resulted in the publicity of a number of alleged shortcomings in Lockheed Martin's safety record in the US. As a result the Secretary of State asked the Chief of Defence Procurement to carry out a further review to ensure that none of the Lockheed Martin nominees to AWE ML was connected with the criticisms made.

<a name="00502w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Incidents at nuclear facilities in the US are the responsibility of the US regulators and therefore are not routinely reported to the Department. However, as part of the bidding process for the contract to manage and operate AWE, each consortium had to provide information to demonstrate the safety performance of their parent companies, including Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) routinely review significant safety events even if they take place outside the UK to see if there are any implications for safety at UK nuclear facilities.

 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> At 1 April 1999 there were a total of 13,962 unoccupied properties within the Services married quarters estate in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. This represented some 21 per cent. of total stock.

<a name="00502w03.html_para0">At 1 April 1999 the Defence Housing Executive held a stock of 62,420 married quarters in England, Scotland and Wales, of which 48,852 were occupied and 1,999 were in the course of disposal. Of the balance of 11,569 properties, 2,559 were under offer to Service families and were likely to be occupied within the next two months; 1,035 properties were vacant awaiting future Unit deployments or use as decant accommodation during the refurbishment programmes; 1,931 properties were empty awaiting modernisation and 6,044 were routine empty properties, i.e. a working management margin for some 22,000 family moves each year.
<P>

<a name="00502w03.html_para1">The majority of empty Service quarters are only temporarily so. The large number of Service family moves a year requires a management margin of empty stock ready for incoming occupants. Additionally, an ongoing modernisation programme and Defence reorganisation also demand that a considerable number of properties are empty while work is undertaken and future plans are clarified. Some 2,000 properties were released in 1999 and some 6,500 properties are planned to be released over the next two years.
<P>

<a name="00502w03.html_para2">The majority of the MOD housing stock in England and Wales is owned by Annington Homes. Properties identified as having no long term requirement to the Department are released to that company. Surplus MOD-owned properties are sold through Defence Estates.

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the cost of UK participation in the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS). This matter falls to me to answer within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
As I said in my letters to you of 15 and 21 December 1999, the total programme cost for the twelve currently planned Type 45 warships (including weapon systems) is approximately &#163;6Bn. This includes approximately &#163;1.2Bn for the development, design and build of the first of class ship and &#163;1Bn for the development and initial production of PAAMS. The balance of &#163;3.8Bn contains funding for additional missile procurement and allows for the incremental acquisition of the combat system.

 Following the announcement in 1998 of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), consultation has been an important and regular feature of the process.

This has focused on formal industry bodies such as the National Defence Industry Council (NDIC) and Association of Independent Research and Technology Organisations (AIRTO), although there have been direct representations from individual companies.

 Animal Welfare within DERA is conducted strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under which the Home Office licenses and oversees all such activity. These regulations, of course, apply to all private sector organisations, and will therefore continue to govern the welfare of any animals in defence research, whether in the public or the private sector.

 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2000]:</i> I understand that formal consideration of the possibility of remote operation of the radar at RAF Staxton Wold was first given during the Departmental budgetary planning process which culminated in February 1997. This option was not pursued because a wider review of the then UK Air Defence Ground Environment (UKADGE) was started during the Strategic Defence Review.
<P>

<a name="00502w04.html_para0">Ministers in this Administration have never been advised that the radar at RAF Staxton Wold should be downgraded to remote operation. My predecessor was, however, advised in July 1998 that it would be possible to draw down the Station to minimum manning. Since the overall review of the UKADGE (now Air Surveillance and Control System--ASACS) was still being carried out at the time, he wished to await the outcome of this work and consider any wider implications before making a decision. I wrote to the hon. Gentleman on 9 August 1999 as soon as I had taken a decision (subject to consultation) on our plans for RAF Staxton Wold.

In 1998-99, the last year for which complete figures are available, the average number of working days lost to sickness per Home Department Police Officer in England and Wales was 11.7.

 I have not discussed this directly, but I am aware the ETC have reviewed their pricing structure to ensure it strikes a fair balance between charges for large and small hotels. The inspection fees and other charges the ETC levies against small hotels for joining their accommodation grading scheme are operational matters for the ETC, which aims to break even and not make a profit. The hotelier receives back some of the fee when the inspector pays for an overnight stay.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2000]:</i> The Department of Trade and Industry's policy on advertising on websites follows the guidance in the Central IT Unit's 



<P>
<P><I>2 May 2000 : Column: 22W</I><P>
"Framework policy and guidelines for the use, management and design of public sector websites" (published last December as part of the e-government strategy). These state:
<P>

<a name="00502w06.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government sites are permitted to carry advertising. In designing pages, departments and agencies should ensure that advertisers' branding does not detract from the effectiveness and appearance of their own branding or that of government as a whole. Particular attention should be given to avoiding any implications of endorsement of products or services or of contradiction between government messages and those of contractors.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00502w06.html_para5">On sponsorship, the DTI also follows Cabinet Office guidance. The same policy is applied to websites as is applied to other forms of publication. In summary, sponsorship support can be sought where there is going to be a significant net benefit to the Department, at no detriment to the public interest. Any sponsorship arrangements are dealt with in ways that are even-handed and open, and on the basis that they must not conflict with the Department's regulatory and enforcement functions or appear to endorse a particular company, product or service.
<P>

<a name="00502w06.html_para6">In applying these policies, a number of DTI sites have been prepared in partnership with private sector organisations in return for acknowledgement of this sponsorship on the site. In a number of cases, sites delivering the objectives of the Department are run and financed by private sector companies which are allowed to enter advertising and sponsorship arrangements with others. Compiling a comprehensive list of companies which have been involved in such arrangements to date would incur disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00502w06.html_para7">No direct revenue has been received to date from either advertising or sponsorship.
<P>

<a name="00502w06.html_para8">None of the non-departmental public bodies for which the Department is responsible has accepted advertising or acknowledged sponsorship from companies on its website. I have asked the Chief Executives of the Department's agencies to write to the hon. Member separately where they have a substantive reply.

The agency has a small entry on the main DTI web site. The only web site directly maintained by the agency is that of the Employment Appeal Tribunal although a parallel site for the Employment Tribunals is under consideration.

The NWML website currently does not carry any sponsorship or advertising. The site has been set up to transfer knowledge to NWML's stakeholders-Trading Standards Officers, weighing and measuring equipment manufacturers, DTI, other customers and interested parties.

If in the future NWML was approached by a potential sponsor or advertiser, the idea would be thoroughly considered because it may provide an opportunity to raise additional revenue, however it would not be at the detriment of the quality of information provided to NWML's stakeholders.

I have been asked to reply in respect of the Small Business Service to your recently tabled Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, about advertising and sponsorship on Departmental websites.
<BR>
The SBS website has no plans to allow advertising at present and no adverts have been placed on the site. The site does not carry any references to sponsorship.
<BR>
The Enterprise Zone website is a gateway to business information for SMEs. It narrows down the mass of information available on the Internet to the most relevant, providing a single point of access to useful information. Launched in 1997 by the DTI and supported by Business Links, it is maintained and operated by the Dialog Corporation plc. DTI's agreement with Dialog allows the company to enter into normal, commercial arrangements with advertisers--to which the Department is not a party. The financial details of such arrangements are subject to commercial confidentiality.

<P>

<a name="00502w07.html_para3">PAT15's main task was to improve the access to and uptake of ICTs by the most disadvantaged in society. It carried out an in-depth study of projects already operating in poor neighbourhoods to identify best practice which may be replicable elsewhere. It also commissioned papers to examine how issues associated with disability can be addressed. The consultation process included input from the private sector, particularly through representatives from ICT companies working as PAT members.

These centres will be set up from September 2000, to provide hands on learning for people for example with disabilities or from ethnic backgrounds with little or no ICT skills or access to ICT.

 Following the Social Exclusion Unit's (SEU) 1998 report on deprived neighbourhoods, 18 high level action teams were set up to help devise a new national strategy for neighbourhood renewal. Their main conclusions have now been drawn together in a framework document for consultation (available on the SEU's website: www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/seu).
<P>

<a name="00502w07.html_para8">The report identifies that business has a crucial role and much to contribute in helping to turn around deprived neighbourhoods. It also points out that businesses need recognition and encouragement to become actively involved in projects which aim, for example, to raise education standards, improve health, tackle crime, and help to build communities in deprived areas. The Government are keen to see an increase in the number and range of businesses, including internet businesses, which are actively engaged in addressing the problems of deprived neighbourhoods. The consultation paper seeks views on what the Government could do to encourage business engagement in the community.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w09.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The 80 per cent. discount on the climate change levy is available only to sectors covered by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (IPPC) who enter into negotiated agreements to deliver additional improvements in energy efficiency. This reflects the additional regulatory burden on such firms, who must implement all cost-effective energy saving measures in order to qualify for a discount.
<P>

<a name="00502w09.html_para1">The horticulture industry is not covered by IPPC and is therefore not eligible for the 80 per cent. discount. Nevertheless, the Government recognise the unique position of horticulture as an energy intensive sector exposed to international competition, and where there is scope for energy savings to be made.
<P>

<a name="00502w09.html_para2">The Government therefore intend to give a package of support from the &#163;50 million 'energy efficiency' fund to improve the sector's energy efficiency, and have included thermal screens, which are used in glasshouses, in the list of technologies eligible for the enhanced capital allowance. And the Government intend to offer a temporary 50 per cent. discount to protect the competitiveness or horticulture firms while these energy efficiency measures take effect.

[120630]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w09.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government believe that all sectors of the economy must play their part in helping meet the UK's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>

<a name="00502w09.html_para4">It is not possible to say with precision what the effects of the climate change levy on local authority services will be since that will depend on, among other things, future energy use in this sector. However, local authorities will be overall net gainers from the climate change levy package, since they will gain more from the associated cut in employer NICs than they will pay in climate change levy.

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
You ask about the Agency's budget allocation towards welfare assessments and I have taken the term 'welfare assessment' to mean child maintenance assessments. Unfortunately the information you require is not available.
<BR>
The main role of the Agency is the accurate assessment and collection of child support maintenance and we aim to do this in the most efficient and cost effective way and to ensure that children receive the financial support to which they are entitled.
<BR>
The Agency is funded on outputs that reflect our targets and focus on customer service. The Secretary of State requires the Agency to live within its allocation of cash resources and this has been 



<P>
<P><I>2 May 2000 : Column: 36W</I><P>
achieved. In addition, over the past three years the Agency has improved overall efficiency by 48 per cent. and expects to exceed this figure by 1999-2000.

I hope this is helpful.

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
You asked for details of the cost of running the CSA since its establishment. Details of running cost expenditure are summarised in the attached annex. These figures are based on the Appropriation Account for the Administration and Miscellaneous Services Vote (Vote 3) for each year.
<BR>
You also asked for details of maintenance recovered in each year from non-resident parents. Details of the amount of maintenance collected and arranged are also summarised in the annex. These figures take into account maintenance collected from non-resident 



<P>
<P><I>2 May 2000 : Column: 37W</I><P>
parents and maintenance assessed by the Agency but paid directly by the non-resident parent to the parent with care. You will see that we have been unable to provide figures for 1993/94 and 1994/95. This was because in those years the focus of the Secretary of State's targets was upon annual benefit savings and the total amount of maintenance collected and arranged was not then a target.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 This Department and its Agencies require new employees to provide proof of identity and their date of birth, and the provision of their birth certificate is one means of doing this. However, a birth certificate is only required in the absence of other documentation, usually a passport. The Department and its executive Agencies do not ask for birth certificates from contractors or from those seeking a contract.
<P>

<a name="00502w11.html_para0">The Benefits Agency does not insist on seeing birth certificates of new claimants of Social Security benefits to verify their identity, except when they are claiming certain benefits such as Retirement Pensions and Child Benefit. For other Social Security benefits, other forms of documentation are also acceptable.

 The important issue for the health service in Worcestershire is the number of patients who need to be treated and the appropriateness of their care. In line with this, the current estimate is that following hospital reorganisation there will be approximately 1,400 acute and community based beds available across Worcestershire. In addition, there will be more High Dependency Unit and Intensive Care Unit beds in the new acute hospital for Worcester owing to the investment the Government has made to modernise services in Worcestershire.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence announced its work programme in November 1999. NICE has an agreed work programme of appraisals, clinical guidelines, clinical audits, and GP referral protocols. So far NICE has completed one fast-track appraisal, on the flu drug Relenza, and full appraisals on wisdom teeth and hip prostheses. We are expecting shortly the results of its appraisals on coronary artery stents and taxanes.

NICE will reduce post-code variations by issuing authoritative national guidance based on evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments.

Although there was no equivalent scheme for novel animal feeds, the dossier of information was also considered by officials with expertise on animal feed matters. However, at this time, in the middle of 1996, the application from France under Council Directive 90/220/EEC for European Community marketing consent began to be considered. I am placing in the Library a copy of the advice from the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Plants. This explains, among other things, the animal feed issues considered prior to the granting of EC marketing consent for this crop. I am also placing in the Library copies of correspondence between the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the applicant company culminating in the then Parliamentary Secretary's letter which was based on advice from the ACNFP.

 There are currently 825 National Health Service funded speech and language therapists in training. This figure reflects those who have entered training since 1 September 1998 (the date on which the Department assumed responsibility for supporting new entrants on pre-registration speech and language therapy courses). Students who started their training prior to this date are funded under mainstream student support arrangements, which are a matter for the Department for Education and Employment.

 Good progress is being made. Agreements have been reached with the General Whitley Council and the British Medical Association, to cover all National Health Service staff on nationally negotiated terms and conditions, other than junior doctors who are currently exempt from the working time regulations. The aim of these agreements is to make maximum use of the available flexibilities to allow local arrangements to be established so that the Directive can be implemented smoothly without adversely affecting service provision.
<P>

<a name="00502w16.html_para0">In addition, the NHS Executive issued supporting guidance in November 1998 (Health Service Circular 1998/204).

<P>

 The scientific data on aspartame are kept under continual review by scientific experts within the Food Standards Agency and, when necessary, independent expert advice is sought. In fact the safety of aspartame has been extensively reviewed by independent experts both in the United Kingdom and other European Member States and is considered safe to use for the general population. However, it is a legal requirement for all foods containing aspartame to be clearly labelled as containing a source of phenylalanine.

 It is neither practicable nor appropriate to check on the sources of income of every organisation that makes representations to the Department. In cases where the Department is contemplating financial support for an organisation, checks of this kind are made. It should be noted that the pharmaceutical industry offers support to organisations or their objectives in various ways other than direct financial contributions, and these must also be taken into account.

 This information is not collected centrally. We recognise the contribution nurses make to patient care and we are therefore committed to encouraging them to stay in the National Health Service once they have qualified. NHS employers are becoming more flexible with the working patterns they are offering, thus allowing nurses to balance their lives at work and home. The number of qualified nurses working in the NHS increased by over 5,500 between September 1998 and September 1999.

 The cost of managing the National Health Service has been monitored in a consistent way since 1995-96 and change in the quantum of management costs is used as the basic measure of savings accrued. No additional steps have been taken to monitor and measure the net savings arising specifically from replacement of the NHS internal market.

 The information strategy for the Modern NHS 1998-2005 "Information for Health", called for a number of demonstrator sites to be set up to explore the issues associated with the creation of electronic records. The setting up of these sites is a key component of supporting the delivery of electronic health records throughout the National Health Service.

sites chosen are Cornwall, South Staffordshire, County Durham and Tees. Work will commence once the deliverables have been agreed with each of the sites, on developing the concept of longitudinal care and 24-hour emergency access to clinical records. The sites will also consider emerging issues such as areas of personal rights to control over medical information (European context) and e-health agenda.
<P>

<a name="00502w17.html_para10">A larger number (up to 12) of Electronic Patient Records (EPR) demonstrators will start working in June on specific areas that have been identified as priorities by their local health community. These will include how information can be shared more effectively among members of the primary health care teams and between different organisations for the benefit of patient care. They will also closely support the concept of how information will actually support the delivery of the local Health Improvement Programme. The names of the successful sites will be announced in the next few weeks.

The vision is supported by detailed investment proposals for the organisations involved in the planning and delivery of health and social care services to patients and the public in Shropshire.

 The information requested is not collected centrally.

 General practitioners' lists need to be kept up to date in order to reflect accurately the numbers of patients that they are responsible for. GPs have duties to provide continuity of care to their patients, and also to be able to visit them outside the surgery should the need arise. These responsibilities cannot be fulfilled if patients are resident abroad.

<a name="00502w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We remain concerned at the large amount of Iraqi oil being smuggled through the Gulf and across Iraq's land borders in breach of UN sanctions. That oil should be funding food, medicine and other humanitarian relief for the Iraqi people through the UN programme, not going into the pockets of the regime and middlemen. We therefore regularly stress the need to crack down on sanctions-busting in contacts inside and outside the region, most recently with Turkey, Iran and the UAE. We ourselves remain committed to the Multinational Interception Force in the Gulf. I welcome Iran's recent action against a number of vessels containing smuggled Iraqi oil. We want Turkey to do more: last year we proposed that the trade across its borders be brought into the UN humanitarian programme. The Jordan/Iraq oil/trade protocol, which is acknowledged by the UN in recognition of the importance to Jordan of trade with Iraq, allows Jordan to import Iraqi oil at half the market price in exchange for Jordanian civilian goods. Excluding oil sold under this Jordanian protocol, we estimate that in 1999 Iraq sold approximately 3.2 million metric tonnes of oil in breach of sanctions; for this year we estimate the figure to be approximately 2.2 million metric tonnes.

 We deplore all forms of discrimination, including that based on caste. We are also concerned by incidents of caste-related violence. We and our High Commission in New Delhi continue to follow this issue closely.

<a name="00502w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We take every opportunity to urge India to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, including during the Foreign Secretary's visit to India last month.

<a name="00502w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Spring: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Government are committed to early enlargement of both the permanent and the non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council, including the creation of a new permanent seat for the Asian regional group. It would be for the Asian group to decide who would occupy any permanent seat allocated to them. India would clearly be a contender.

<a name="00502w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Following the return of Macau to Chinese sovereignty, we have reviewed our policy on the control of strategic exports to the Macau Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
<P>

<a name="00502w20.html_para0">We shall consider applications for licensing strategic exports to the MSAR on a case-by-case basis. We will not, however, issue licences for strategic exports to the MSAR for goods which we do not licence for export to mainland China. Our policy on strategic exports to mainland China is as set out by my late right hon. Friend, Derek Fatchett, on 3 June 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 246-47W.
<P>

<a name="00502w20.html_para1">The Department of Trade and Industry will be removing Macau as a destination for Open General Licences which allow the export of Military List goods. Transhipment of goods on the Military List to the MSAR via the United Kingdom without a licence will also be prohibited. Schedule 3 of the Export of Goods (Control) Order (1994) will be amended accordingly.
<P>

<a name="00502w20.html_para2">HM Government's policy on strategic exports to Hong Kong remains as announced by my late right hon. Friend on 14 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 221W.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 As I have told the House on many occasions, we are not conducting a bombing campaign against Iraq. UK and US aircraft continue to patrol the No Fly Zones, established in 1991 and 1992 in response to a situation of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, and in support of UN Security Council resolution 688 which called on Iraq to end its repression of the civilian population. They stop Saddam Hussein using his aircraft against his own people, as he did with such horrific consequences in the past. Since late 1998, Iraq has waged a systematic campaign to shoot our aircraft down. Direct threats against our aircrew have included missile attacks and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Our aircraft only take action when they are forced to do so to defend themselves. I am aware of claims, chiefly from the Iraqi Government, that our aircraft deliberately target civilians and civilian facilities. That is a lie. Only military targets clearly connected with the threat to our aircraft are targeted, and even then only when we are wholly satisfied that the associated risks are minimal. I am confident that our patrols prevent Saddam Hussein from adding yet more crimes to his appalling human rights record.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 6 April 



<P>
<P><I>2 May 2000 : Column: 75W</I><P>
2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 599-600W, (i) how many prisoners released on the Home Detention Curfew scheme were released on the scheme before the end of the requisite period referred to in Section 34A(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 as inserted by Section 99 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, (ii) if any of these prisoners have been recalled to prison to serve the remainder of the requisite period, (iii) if any of these prisoners committed a further offence <i>(a)</i> between the date of their release and the end of the requisite period and <i>(b)</i> subsequently while on the scheme, and (iv) if he will place in the Library the procedure laid down by Ministers for the release of sex offenders on the Home Detention Curfew scheme.  [118806]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 April 2000]:</i> The available information shows that, since the Home Detention Curfew scheme commenced in January 1999, 12 prisoners have been released in error before their Home Detention Curfew eligibility date. This figure includes the sex offender subject to the Sex Offenders Act 1997 referred to in the reply given to the right hon. Member by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on 6 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 599-600W.
<P>

<a name="00502w20.html_para3">I deeply regret all of these errors, but the right hon. Member should note that they represent only 0.06 per cent. of the total of 18,736 prisoners who have been released on the scheme as of 31 March 2000.
<P>

The main reason for this might be the increase in the use of genetically modified animals owing to current scientific advances.

 No revenue has been received for advertising or sponsorship on the Cabinet Office website or that of its current agency--Government Car and Despatch Agency (GCDA); or on that of the Central Office of Information (COI). The Cabinet Office has no executive NDPBs and the figures for its NDPBs are included in the Department's return. The Cabinet Office does not take advertising on its departmental website (www.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and currently has no plans to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w22.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Lansley: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what progress the Government are making on their targets for reducing drug abuse by young people.  [119975]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w22.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Young people are the main focus of the Government's anti-drug strategy. One of our key objectives is to reduce the incidence of drug misuse among the under-25s in order that they can achieve their full potential in society. The Cabinet Office, through the UK Anti Drugs Co-ordination Unit, is working with the relevant Government Departments to ensure that young people receive the help and advice they need to resist drug misuse.
<P>

<a name="00502w22.html_para5">For example, &#163;7.5 million from the Standards Fund is spent each year on drugs education in primary and secondary schools and new DfEE guidance on effective drugs education was published in November 1998. Almost nine out of 10 secondary schools now have anti-drugs policies in place. In April 1999 the Drugs Prevention Advisory Service was created to provide expert advice and support to Drug Action teams and in November 1999 the Drugs Prevention Board was established to help co-ordinate prevention work at a national level. In March a new joint initiative between UKADCU, Sport England and the Youth Justice Board was announced, using money seized from convicted drug dealers and traffickers to fund projects which aim to prevent vulnerable young people from becoming involved in drugs and crime.
<P>

<a name="00502w22.html_para6">Progress against the targets will be measured through the British Crime Survey (16 to 24-year-olds) and the Office for National Statistics schools survey.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w22.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Lansley: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what progress is being made by the Government in establishing a baseline figure from which progress in meeting its targets on reducing drug abuse among young people can be measured.  [119958]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w22.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Baseline figures for the number of young people using drugs will be taken from the British Crime Survey and the new national survey of drug use among young teenagers, which started in September 1999. Baseline figures will be published in the UK Anti-Drug Co-ordinator's annual report in the summer.

 In the financial year 2000-01, the International Consultancy Group (ICG) plans to generate a revenue of &#163;2,300,000. The direct cost of the ICG for the same year is planned to be &#163;1,961,000.

<P>

 The International Consultancy Group (ICG) was established in 1996 to co-ordinate the Civil Service College's developing portfolio of international public service assignments. The current role of ICG, now within the Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS), is to work internationally to help create sustainable capacity for the modernisation of public administration.
<P>

<a name="00502w23.html_para0">ICG's current priorities include the need to develop the skills and capacities of senior civil services in Accession States as they negotiate with and join the European Union; and technical assistance to emerging democracies and democracies in transition as they seek to strengthen central co-ordination and service delivery in public administration.

 The Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS), which was established in June 1999 and incorporates the Civil Service College, is integral to the process of modernising government. The CMPS works to ensure that the Civil Service is cultivating the right skills, culture and approaches to perform its task; to ensure that policy makers across government have access to the best research, evidence and international experience; and to help government to learn better from existing policies.




<P>
<P><I>2 May 2000 : Column: 85W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00502w23.html_para1">Examples of recent CMPS activity include programmes of joint seminars for Ministers and officials; developing a Resource Centre to support policy making, through the use of evidence and research; and comprehensive programmes of training reflecting all aspects of the Modernising Government agenda delivered by the Civil Service College.

 The targets set for my Department are all listed in the publication "Public Service Agreements 1999-2002" (CM 4181) which is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00502w23.html_para2">The work carried out by my Department to meet these targets during 1999-2000 is described in Chapter 2 of the Cabinet Office's annual report to Parliament "The Government's Expenditure Plans 2000-01 to 2001-02" (CM 4618) which was laid before Parliament on 10 April 2000.

 The objective of the new accommodation project is to accommodate the great majority of Cabinet Office staff in 70 Whitehall and one other central London building. The inter-connected Admiralty Arch, Ripley Building and Kirkland House will thus become the Department's second London home. Cabinet Office staff are currently accommodated in a number of central London buildings, some of which are on leases nearing expiry.
<P>

<a name="00502w23.html_para5">The project is an integral part of Sir Richard Wilson's review of the Cabinet Office announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 28 July 1998. As well as providing modern office accommodation, the project also brings into beneficial use three Government-owned buildings (two of which are Grade 1 listed) which had become empty and were in danger of falling into disrepair.

 Most ringfenced funding, including the Standards Fund and funding for capital work, is paid via Local Education Authorities, not directly to individual maintained schools. Non-maintained special schools and voluntary-aided schools do receive some capital funding direct from the Department. For 2000-2001, around 75 per cent. of the &#163;1.6 billion expenditure supported

In addition, schools will receive a share of the &#163;290 million funding increase announced in the Budget and of the &#163;50 million for general support of school budgets. These additional amounts will be paid to Local Education Authorities but must be fully passed on to schools.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2000]:</i> Information on the cost of preparing a statement of special educational needs is not collected centrally. The Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs sets out that LEAs must identify and make a statutory assessment of those children for whom they are responsible who have special educational needs and who may need a statement. However, LEAs and schools do not account separately for special educational provision, including specific information on preparation of statements. The differential between local practices means any estimated costs would be based on assumptions and cost apportionments.

 Between September 1999 and April 2001 we have allocated &#163;140 million to provide an additional 83,000 free early education places for three-year-olds, on the basis of each Local Education Authority's position on the Government's Index of Local Deprivation. A further &#163;250 million has been allocated for 2001-02 to take the total number of new free places created to 190,000 by March 2002.
<P>

<a name="00502w24.html_para0">The methodology that will be used to allocate these places in 2001-02 will be decided once we have had an opportunity to evaluate the progress of the scheme across all authorities this year.

 The Government are making available grants of &#163;390 million over three years (from September 1999-March 2002) to almost double the number of three- year-olds in free early education places. In 1999-2000, the first tranche of Local Education Authorities which benefited from &#163;40 million of this new money funded over 80 per cent. of the new free places in the private, voluntary and independent sectors.
<P>

<a name="00502w24.html_para1">Prior to this new funding being available, as of January 1999, 37 per cent. of three-year-olds were receiving free early education in the maintained sector funded from each Local Education Authority's Standard Spending Assessment budget.

 As responsibility for food safety and standards matters has now passed to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) which reports to Parliament through Health Ministers, I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00502w25.html_para1">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that it recognises the difficulties faced by the meat industry, especially small businesses, as a result of increased veterinary supervision levels and the associated costs. Equally, it understands very well the importance of local slaughtering facilities and it is certainly not its intention to put out of business smaller operations, particularly those specialising in a high quality product.
<P>

<a name="00502w25.html_para2">A number of measures have been put in place to help small and medium sized abattoirs. These include the freezing of Meat Hygiene Service hourly rates in 1999-2000 at 1998-99 levels (worth &#163;7 million) and restricting the increase in 2000-01 to no more than the rate of inflation (2.2 per cent.), and the deferment of charges for SRM controls for a further two years until 2002-03 at the earliest (worth &#163;44 million). Following advice received from the European Commission, the Meat Hygiene Service is reviewing its levels of inspection in individual low throughput (permanently derogated) premises. In the meantime, no increases in veterinary supervision levels in such premises have been made since the Commission's advice was received last May, nor will there be any changes made until that review has been completed.

 As responsibility for food safety and standards matters has now passed to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) which reports to Parliament through Health Ministers, I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00502w25.html_para4">Since publication of the Government's response to the report of the Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and, from 1 April, the Food Standards Agency, has received a number of representations from a wide variety of sources about the future of small abattoirs. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recently replied to an open letter from 136 organisations about the impact of meat inspection charges on small and medium sized abattoirs, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00502w25.html_para5">I am advised that the Food Standards Agency recognises the difficulties faced by the meat industry, especially small businesses, as a result of increased veterinary supervision levels and the associated costs. We also understand the importance of local slaughtering facilities.
<P>

<a name="00502w25.html_para6">A number of measures have been put in place to help small and medium sized abattoirs. These include the freezing of Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) hourly rates in 1999-2000 at 1998-99 levels (worth &#163;7 million) and restricting the increase in 2000-01 to 2.2 per cent., in line with the rate of inflation and the commitment made by us last year. Charges for enforcement of specified risk Material controls have been deferred until 2002-03 at the earliest (worth &#163;22 million). Following advice received from the European Commission, the MHS is reviewing its levels of inspection in individual low throughput (permanently derogated) premises. No increases in veterinary supervision levels in such premises have been made since the Commission's advice was received last May. No changes will be made until that review has been completed.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reason the "Action Plan for Farming", published on 30 March, contains no proposals to assist the re-establishment of abattoir facilities in areas that have lost such facilities; and if he will make a statement.  [117697]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w25.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Assistance for the re-establishment of abattoir facilities was not included in the "Action Plan for Farming" published on 30 March because the Government have already put in place a number of measures to help this sector.
<P>

<a name="00502w25.html_para8">Veterinary supervision levels in low throughput (permanently derogated) abattoirs have been frozen at May 1999 levels pending completion of a review of supervision levels in such plants following advice from the Commission (published by the Government in October 1999). The introduction of charges for cattle passports and MHS enforcement of SRM controls has been deferred until at least 2002-03 (worth &#163;44m). Meat inspection charges for 1999-2000 were capped at 1998-99 levels (worth &#163;7m) and will rise by only 2.2 per cent. in 2000-01, in line with the rate of inflation as previously announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister. As recommended by the Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group (the Pooley Report) a small task force has been set to urgently explore alternative ways of recovering the costs of inspection work, within the framework of Community law. This will report and make recommendations to the Food Standards Agency who now have responsibility for meat hygiene.

 <i>[holding answer 11 April 2000]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00502w26.html_para0">The ban on over-thirty-month cattle entering the food chain is one of a number of BSE controls to be reviewed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). This was announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister at the agriculture summit on 30 March. The FSA has been asked to consider the controls to ensure that they adequately protect the consumer, and their proportionality to the assessed risk. The FSA will submit a published report to UK Health and Agriculture Ministers by the end of October or as soon as possible afterwards taking account of the report of the BSE Inquiry. Ministers will then consider whether there should be any change in the ban on over-thirty-month cattle entering the food chain in the light of the FSA's report.

 No formal assessment has been made. The hazard of infertility associated with the Inverdale gene is well understood. It is for the sheep breeding industry to assess whether the benefits of introducing the gene into UK breeding flocks through the importation of semen or animals outweigh the risks of infertility.

 The only livestock compensatory allowances paid in the UK are paid under the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance Schemes.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the effects on sheep farming of <i>(a)</i> the Groundwater Directive, <i>(b)</i> abattoir closures and <i>(c)</i> the costs of the proposed identification scheme.  [118332]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w26.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The information is as follows: <i>(a)</i> Under the Groundwater Regulations 1998, which implement the Groundwater Directive, sheep farmers wishing to dispose of any listed substance (including sheep dip containing such substances) to land will normally require a groundwater authorisation from the Environment Agency. Under the agriculture strategy package announced recently it is proposed to restrict charges to a single application fee (currently &#163;92) for the first four-year period of an authorisation, rather than for farmers to have also to pay an annual charge. This will result in an estimated saving for sheep farmers of &#163;428 at 1999 prices in respect of the annual charge.
<P>

<a name="00502w26.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> None. There remains considerable over-capacity in the mainstream sheep-slaughtering sector and as a result there is unlikely to be any measurable effect of abattoir closures on the majority of producers.
<P>

<a name="00502w26.html_para2"><i>(c)</i> We estimate that the initial cost of tagging all sheep in Great Britain will be a maximum of &#163;12 million; in subsequent years this falls to &#163;6 million. For around 80 per cent. of sheep holdings in Great Britain the cost of tags for the entire flock will be less than &#163;200 in the first year.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00502w26.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 A number of comparative studies have been funded by the Ministry. A desk study was completed in 1998 which compared the effects on biodiversity of conventional, organic and integrated farming systems. This summarised the results of previous field-based research, and concluded that organic regimes showed an overall benefit for biodiversity at the farm level. A new field-based project started in 1999 to determine to what extent any biodiversity differences between organic and conventional farms are caused by differences in non-crop habitats.
<P>

<a name="00502w26.html_para3">Other recent research includes projects to assess the impact of conventional agriculture on farmland bird populations, the effects of pesticides on non-target species (including indirect effects on birds), the causes of changes on botanical diversity on farmland, and the causes of changes in brown hare populations. The Ministry is also co-funding the Countryside Survey 2000 project which focuses on an assessment of the extent of changes in botanical diversity on farmland.

 MAFF have funded a large-scale experiment to assess whether embryos collected from cows in the late stages of BSE infection and then transplanted into TSE-free recipient cows from New Zealand, go on to develop BSE later in life. Offspring will be observed for seven years for the development of BSE. The study is due to end next year but so far none of the offspring have shown any signs of BSE. This provides experimental evidence to indicate that BSE is not transmitted to embryos by the maternal route.

<a name="00502w26.html_para4">Similar studies have been performed in sheep infected with scrapie but results have been difficult to interpret because of the complex genetic factors that influence scrapie susceptibility in sheep.
