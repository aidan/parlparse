<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. McCabe: </B> 
To ask the President of the Council what arrangements have been agreed for financial assistance to opposition parties.  [83392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended in October 1998 that financial assistance to opposition parties (known as "Short money") should be reviewed with a view to increasing it substantially, perhaps by as much as three times. Such assistance has been provided to opposition parties since 1975 to enable them more effectively to perform their parliamentary duties. It is claimed in respect of parties' parliamentary business and is largely spent on research assistance for opposition spokesmen, assistance in the opposition parties' Whips' offices and staff for the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>

<a name="90506w01.htm_para0">It has now been agreed that basic Short money will be increased by a factor of 2.7. This means that the opposition parties will receive &#163;10,732.69 for every seat won and &#163;21.44 for every 200 votes cast in their favour at the last general election. The travel fund for party spokesmen will be increased in line with inflation. The Neill Committee also recommended a specific allocation for the Leader of the Opposition's Office and this has now been set at &#163;500,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="90506w01.htm_para1">The maximum sums each party will receive in the 1999-2000 financial year are set out as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Ann Clwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the effects on airline flight crews of organophosphate air pollution on board aircraft.  [82322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 An organic phosphate compound Tricresylphosphate (TCP) is used as a load carrying additive for lubricants in aircraft jet engines. While TCP is toxic, it is not comparable to the organophosphates used in pesticides. While an aircraft is in flight, fresh air is taken in through air conditioning packs using compressed air supplied by the engines. These are designed to ensure that fumes from the engines do not enter the aircraft. However, in the very rare event of the failure of an engine seal, fumes could enter the air conditioning system and therefore the aircraft cabin. If this happens, the air conditioning unit can be isolated or the engine shut down, minimising any exposure to fumes.
<P>

<a name="90506w01.htm_para2">We have no evidence to suggest that fumes from aircraft engines have lead to long term health problems for aircraft crew or passengers. However, we are aware that this issue is being investigated in other countries and will review the situation once those investigations are completed.

It is then for local managers to decide on the scope to use fair trade products, having regard to value for money. Fair trade products have recently been introduced in vending machines in our London Headquarters buildings.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to respond to your recently tabled Parliamentary Question about the sequencing of the traffic signals at the junction of Mill Street and Circular Road in Newtownards.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By way of background, I should explain that, in order to accommodate the laying of a watermain in July and August last year, a one-way traffic system was introduced on South Street. As a result, traffic was diverted along Circular Road and the traffic signals at the junction in question were altered to deal with this additional flow.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On completion of these works, we carried out a detailed assessment of traffic flow at this junction. We concluded that the original traffic light phasing contained conflicting traffic movements which reduced the operational efficiency of the junction. In addition, there was evidence that drivers were using the Scrabo estate as a "rat run" to avoid the junction, particularly during morning peak times. By removing these conflicting movements, the new phasing has improved road safety, increased the junction's capacity and reduced the benefits of using Scrabo Estate as a "rat run". Whilst the length of the queues on some approaches to the junction may have increased during peak times, adjustments have been carried out to increase the number of vehicles passing through the junction.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the circumstances, Roads Service has no plans to revert to the old phasing. There may, however, be some isolated off-peak periods that could benefit from further timing alterations.

 From 1 October 1997 to 31 March 1999, 12,073 Standard Individual Export Licence applications, covering arms and other goods the export of which is controlled for strategic reasons, were circulated to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office by the Department for Trade and Industry for advice, in accordance with the FCO's requirements. In the same period, 924 Open Individual Export Licence applications were also circulated to the FCO, although this figure does not reflect subsequent requests for alterations to either the goods or the consignee schedules of these licences.
<P>

<a name="90506w02.htm_para5">The Government's first Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, which marks a new level of transparency in relation to the Government's export licensing policy, gives details of all licence applications refused in the period 2 May to 31 December 1997, broken down by country and equipment category. Details of licences refused in 1998 will be given in the next Annual Report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many staff were employed in the Standards and Effectiveness Unit of his Department on 31 March; what the budget was of that unit in 1998-99; and what budget has been set for the unit in 1999-2000.  [82015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> The number of staff employed in the Standards and Effectiveness Unit on 31 March was 148. The budget for the Unit in 1998-99 was &#163;4.8 million; the budget for 1999-2000 is &#163;5.9 million. A significant part of the increase in the budget is due to the transfer of four teams covering specialist schools in September 1999. The complement of staff in the SEU is drawn mainly from existing Civil Servants together with a small number of external practitioners, including heads and inspectors, appointed to bring the benefit of their experience to the Department.

 None. Schools are responsible for the maintenance of their furniture, and for utilising their delegated budgets for this purpose as necessary. The Government have supported schools by increasing recurrent provision for local authority education services by &#163;1.1 billion for 1999-2000.

<P>
<a name="90506w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. However, the Government believe it is extremely important that young people should learn to swim. Swimming is therefore a compulsory element of the PE curriculum in all primary schools.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 This Government believe that PE and sport are essential to a rounded education. We have therefore committed &#163;400 million of Lottery money through the New Opportunities Fund to after-school learning, including PE, sports, games and outdoor activities.
<P>

<a name="90506w03.htm_para0">The review of the National Curriculum for the year 2000 is looking at all areas of the school curriculum, including physical education in primary schools. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be consulting widely on draft proposals for a revised National Curriculum during the summer, before final decisions are taken.
<P>

<a name="90506w03.htm_para1">The Government will also be publishing a sports strategy paper later this year that will include the promotion of physical and sporting opportunities for young people as one of its principal aims. The Government also fund Sport England, whose Active Schools programme ensures quality sports provision in schools through a variety of initiatives, including BT TOP Sport, Sportsmark and Sportsmark Gold awards, Coaching for Teachers and the Sporting Ambassadors scheme. Sport England have committed &#163;3.1m to Active Schools this year, in addition to Lottery funding of &#163;7.75m towards TOP Play and BT Top Sport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 It is early days; the national minimum wage has been in operation for only 5 weeks. However, recent independent research shows not only that most employers (almost 90 per cent.) support the principle of the minimum wage but that 40 per cent. had adjusted their pay structures prior to its introduction. There is no evidence of higher costs feeding into higher prices and there were few signs of any demand for the restoration of pay differentials. There was little evidence of significant job losses; in fact, staff levels among smaller firms have increased by 11 per cent. over the past year--staff turnover had fallen in traditionally low paying industries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The national minimum wage, since its introduction in April, has benefited some two million of the lowest paid workers in the country, and their families. The principle of a minimum wage is supported by the vast majority of companies in this country.
<P>

<a name="90506w04.htm_para0">The Inland Revenue are enforcing the national minimum wage, and they supply my Department with data on all matters relating to compliance on a regular basis.

 The Government estimate that nearly 2 million workers have benefited from the introduction of the national minimum wage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government are concerned to ensure that small businesses have access to sources of finance which are appropriate to their needs. The private sector is primarily responsible for designing and delivering finance products to small business and successfully meets their needs in the vast majority of cases. I am aware, however, that some small businesses have faced difficulties in raising the right finance. In particular, there can be problems in securing debt finance where a business has no track record or available security and in raising venture capital in small amounts. We therefore announced, in the Competitiveness White Paper (Cmd 4176), the creation of the Enterprise Fund. As well as continuing to fund the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme, this Fund will also act to stimulate the availability of venture capital for smaller, growing businesses.
<P>

<a name="90506w04.htm_para2">In addition, we are working with the key players in the informal investment or "business angel" markets to stimulate the availability of venture capital from individual investors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> The number of new wind turbines likely to be installed in 2002 depends largely on the size of machines which generators choose to employ. For example, a growth in generation of 300 GWh would require about 220 machines if their average size was 0.6 MW or about 130 machines if their average size was 1 MW.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on progress towards issuing licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act for operators of third-generation mobile communications networks.  [83794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Following extensive consultation and careful consideration the Government have decided to offer five third-generation licences by means of auction. The licences will comprise three of (2x10)+5MHz, one of 2x15MHz and one of (2x15)+5MHz. The largest will be reserved for a new entrant. It believes that this will most effectively allow the benefits of third-generation to the UK economy and consumers to be realised. In particular, it is convinced that these benefits are most likely to be maximised by encouraging market entry and competition.
<P>

<a name="90506w06.htm_para0">The Director General of Telecommunications will shortly issue for statutory consultation draft amendments to existing public mobile operators' Telecommunications Act licences which are intended to provide any new entrants with the right to roam onto at least one second generation mobile network.
<P>

<a name="90506w06.htm_para1">The Government continue to expect that, subject to market and other developments and to final decisions nearer the time, the auction will take place in the second half of the financial year 1999-2000.

 Improving risk management is a priority both domestically and internationally. The G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors have encouraged the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision to finalise its work on revising the Basle Capital Accord so that it better reflects risk. More specifically, following the near-failure of the LTCM hedge fund, the Basle Committee published a sound practices paper setting out ways in which financial institutions could improve their risk management processes. Other international bodies are also looking at issues relating to hedge funds and their work will be coordinated by a working group of the newly established Financial Stability Forum. The Financial Services Authority are working closely with the institutions they supervise to ensure that their risk management processes follow good practice.

<a name="90506w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The higher premium rate for older pensioners was proposed in the 1985 Green Paper "Reform of Social Security Programme for Change" for those most likely to have continuing health problems or to be frail and in need of special support in maintaining themselves in the community. The Green Paper proposed two routes to the premium, one age related, the other for younger pensioners receiving benefits related to disability or continuing incapacity.

 The information is not available in the form requested because the data collected on new claims do not include the length of time a person was unemployed prior to claiming Incapacity Benefit or whether they are receiving Occupational Pension. Such information as is available is set out below.
<P>

<a name="90506w07.htm_para1">Records show that at 31 March 1997, 49 per cent. of Incapacity Benefit recipients had previously been unemployed. It is estimated that around a third of Incapacity Benefit recipients have an Occupational Pension.

<P>
<a name="90506w08.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Viggers: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 28 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>165-66</i>, on pensioner incomes, what would be the difference in income between a single man of 65 with no savings or resources and the income of a single man of 65 who has resources of at least &#163;16,000 but no additional pension from SERPS; and what amount of money would be required to purchase an annuity to fund this difference.  [83178]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The amounts of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit that a person receives depends on local factors as well as personal circumstances. As an illustrative example, a hypothetical 65-year-old man with no savings or resources who receives the average Housing Benefit and average Council Tax Benefit received by those on Income Support aged 60 or over would receive &#163;127 a week in Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
<P>

<a name="90506w08.htm_para0">The amount is &#163;60 more than the full basic pension and, at February 1999 annuity rates, a lump sum of &#163;43,000 would be required to fund this difference.
<P>

<a name="90506w08.htm_para1">It is, however, extremely unlikely that a person would receive the full basic pension and have &#163;16,000 in savings without having any second-tier pension as any employee who earns over the Lower Earnings Limit for National Insurance contributions automatically builds up rights to a second-tier pension. Furthermore, information from the 1996 General Household Survey suggests that half of those who are self-employed are currently contributing to a personal pension and a further 10 per cent. have contributed in the past.

 We carried out a thorough assessment in 1998 of whether it would be right to introduce a special payment scheme for people infected with hepatitis C through National Health Service treatment.

 The civil society unit, which was formerly called the NGO Unit, will continue to administer the Joint Funding Scheme, and will administer its successor, the new Civil Society Challenge Fund, and new Partnership Programme Agreements. The Civil Society Challenge Fund will have a focused approach to strengthening civil society in developing countries and will be open to a wide range of UK civil society groups. Partnership Programme Agreements will set out shared objectives with organisations engaged in a range of the Department for International Development's strategic concerns and will provide strategic funding links with the Department. More generally, the Unit will seek to widen our relationships with civil society organisations in the UK who share our objectives of the elimination of world poverty.

 The Department for International Development may ask to see a birth certificate as a proof of identity when recruiting staff directly.

<P>

<a name="90506w09.htm_para1">We require proof of date of birth before determining eligibility for a colonial pension. However, in almost every case the claimant's birth certificate had been seen many years earlier by the relevant employer and/or pension authority. The requirement to produce a birth certificate in support of such a claim is therefore very rare.

 The situation is much better than last year. People are in better condition and prospects for the 1999 cereal crop look good. However, southern Sudan is a food deficit area. The UN World Food Programme estimates that in 1999 there will be a 10 per cent. deficit between local food availability and total anticipated needs. This is estimated at 90,000 tonnes of food which includes 20,000 tonnes to support the most vulnerable.

 Fish is an important element of the diets of vulnerable people in southern Sudan. We are willing to consider supporting, at the appropriate time of the year, well constructed and viable proposals for the provision of fishing tackle.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90506w09.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Information is not collated either centrally, or in Departments, on the average cost of supplying information under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>

<a name="90506w09.htm_para4">In most cases, requests under the Code are for information which it is necessary for the public to have as part of the fair and accountable performance of the functions of Government. Such requests are dealt with in the same way as general correspondence and separate accounting is not systematically undertaken.
<P>

<a name="90506w09.htm_para5">In order to provide a range of estimates for the cost of meeting requests for information under the proposed Freedom of Information Bill, a low cost estimated of &#163;62 (the average cost of replying to a Parliamentary Question) and a high cost estimate of &#163;350 (reflecting additional work needed to collate an extensive range of information) was used. These are typical costs of responding to Code requests, but are not average costs.
<P>

<a name="90506w09.htm_para6">Where information is provided in order to meet a specific individual request, which is not in the course of a Department's normal day-to-day business, a charge may be made to help defray the costs. Where charges are made, Departments are required to strike a balance between the interests of the applicant and those of the taxpayer. Individual Departments decide how best to apply this principle to their particular circumstances, and charges will not necessarily reflect the actual cost to the Department of supplying the information.
<P>

<a name="90506w09.htm_para7">The charging schemes for each Department are set out at Appendix 5 of the 1997 Report on the Code of Practice, a copy of which is available in the Library. In that year charges were levied in 242 cases out of 3,772 requests logged as Code requests (6.4 per cent.).

 The Fire Brigades Union discussion document, Safety in Partnership, which sets out proposals for a strategic forum to consider fire safety matters will be considered by the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council at its meeting on 18 May. I have already made it clear that the concepts of developing policies around shared goals, making sure those policies are inclusive, involving those outside government and becoming more forward and outward looking are absolutely right. This approach also ties in with the Better Regulation Task Force's recent review of enforcement, which suggested that fire safety initiatives should be coordinated by a national forum representing government regulators and stakeholders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he intends taking to increase public confidence in, and awareness of, the Crimestoppers system of reporting suspected criminals; and if he will publish a copy of his reply to the Director of the Crimestoppers Trust in response to the Trust's offer to help any Government initiative to raise the profile of Crimestoppers.

 The Government fully recognise the great value of Crimestoppers. Ministers attend Crimestoppers Trust events to support its work as other commitments allow. I have recently written to the Director of Crimestoppers Trust to outline my support for exploring further the idea that the Home Office and Crimestoppers Trust might work together to raise the profile of Crimestoppers Trust to encourage the use of Crimestoppers by members of the public. Officials will shortly be meeting the Director of Crimestoppers to take matters forward.
