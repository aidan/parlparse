 Mine clearance programmes in Angola funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) cleared around 6,000 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in 2005, 8,000 in 2006, 11,500 in 2007, 12,000 in 2008 and 7,000 in 2009. From 2009, work was concentrated in Kuando Kubango province, with smaller programmes in Bie, Huambo and Benguela. In addition DFID has funded clearance in Moxico province, clearing a further 3,059 items in 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="101125w0001.htm_para14"><a name="10112536000150">The demining work DFID has supported in Angola has made large areas of land accessible to local civilian populations. It is our assessment that the majority of mines remaining in Angola are in more remote areas where there is less impact on civilian populations. Angola's Inter-sectoral Commission on Demining and Humanitarian Assistance (CNIDAH) reported that annual casualties decreased from around 250 per year in 2002-05 to around 50 by 2008. Landmine Monitor 2010 identified 28 casualties in Angola, a relatively small percentage of the worldwide total of 3,956.</p>

Our work aims to support demining that contributes to development, help Governments assume increasing responsibility for resolving problems caused by mines and improve value for money through increased efficiency. Ceasing funding to Angola will allow us to allocate more resources to mine-affected countries where our funding will have greater development impact.</p>

 In July 2010, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff), set out the five criteria against which future equipment programmes will be assessed. One of the criteria is exportability: making sure we consider the export potential and viability when considering new project requirements. This is now embedded in the Project Start Up/Foundation process, as part of the Ministry of Defence's acquisition cycle. Where appropriate, we will then consider how adjustments can be made to our own procurement programme to support export prospects. This may include more modular design or acquisition options which provide greater flexibility to meet export requirements at minimal cost, for example, while ensuring the UK still obtains the capability it needs.</p>

 I have received a number of letters from schools, other education providers and individuals recently and I am aware of the effect of many of the outreach activities it supports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="101125w0001.htm_para68"><a name="10112536000355">In 2004, Aimhigher's funding for the year was Â£136 million. By the time Labour left office, its annual funding had been reduced by 43% to Â£78 million. We have been very clear about the importance of widening participation and improving fair access in higher education-all those with the ability should have access to higher education irrespective of family income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="101125w0001.htm_para69"><a name="10112536000356">This is why the Coalition is taking a new and different approach that builds on existing best practice, while developing it further. We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation; and greater Government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Within this context, the Aimhigher programme will cease at the end of this academic year (July 2011).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="101125w0001.htm_para70"><a name="10112536000357">In the future institutions will be accountable for the steps they take to widen participation. Those wanting to charge more than a Â£6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new Â£150 million National Scholarships Programme. This work will be further supported by the Â£2.5 billion pupil premium to turn their school-based achievement into success at university. Universities and schools have learned a lot from the Aimhigher programme about "what works" in raising the aspirations of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Much of this knowledge is now embedded in the sector. It is right  <br>

that universities have the freedom and flexibility to decide how to spend their resources on promoting access in the ways that will have the most impact for that institution, including through partnerships. This freedom will be accompanied by a regime of sanctions. Access will remain a focus for all institutions, who will continue to submit a Widening Participation Strategic Assessment to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. We are putting student choice at the heart of the system and will support this by ensuring institutions provide prospective students with clear and comparable information about course content, teaching methods and the employment outcomes of previous students.</p>

The previous rate of 6.08% was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers.

But overall, a higher proportion of service children achieve expected levels in English and mathematics at key stage 1 and 2 than their peers; and a higher proportion achieve five A*-C GCSEs.

 We anticipate funding local authorities with a total of Â£8.6 million of diploma formula grant for the engineering diploma in 2010-11 for 14 to 16-year-olds, based on the forecast key stage 4 diploma student numbers that they submitted to the Department in July 2010. This funding is in addition to mainstream funding for schools. Places for engineering diploma students aged 16 to 18 are fully funded by the Young People's Learning Agency, as with all accredited qualifications, but their allocations to institutions are not made on the basis of specific qualifications and as such we cannot say how much will fund the engineering diploma in 2010-11. Further details on funding for 2011-12 will be made clear when the Department for Communities and Local Government announces local authority allocations and on the publication of the statement of priorities for the Young People's Learning Agency.</p>

 The annual PE and sport survey has collected data relating to PE and school sport since 2003. The 2009-10 survey showed that, after investment of Â£2.4 billion of Exchequer and lottery funding and seven years of work, only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools. The coalition Government are committed to creating an annual Olympic-style school sport event to encourage more competitive sport in schools. Our approach differs fundamentally from that of the last Government. While the network of school sport partnerships helped schools to increase participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, the proportion of pupils playing regular competitive sport has remained disappointingly low.</p>

 We recognise the importance of preserving access to a local school for rural communities. We, therefore, plan for the presumption against closure of rural schools to continue. The presumption does not mean that a rural school will never close, but the case for closure should be strong and in the best interests of educational provision in the area.

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para15"><a name="10112551000033">We are urging all member states and EU institutions to take the opportunity through reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) to radically overhaul the way we manage fisheries in order to overcome the CFP's serious failures, not least in addressing discards. We want a reformed CFP to provide the incentives and regulatory framework to enable us to catch less but land more, for example replacing landing based quota with catch quotas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para16"><a name="10112551000034">The UK has been piloting an alternative quota management system for cod based on catch quotas (a quota for what you catch rather than land at port). Interim results from these trials are positive; discards of cod are low (1-7%) and fishermen are fishing more selectively in order to maximise the value of their catches. The interim report is available from the CEFAS website at:</p>
<a name="101125w0003.htm_brev12"><a name="10112551000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">http://www.cefas.co.uk/</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_460"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para17"><a name="10112551000035">An expansion of this scheme, both in terms of the number and type of vessel participating and the number of species, is essential to gain further evidence on the wider application of catch quotas in mixed fisheries. The European Commission and its technical advisers (The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries) are supportive of our intentions to expand the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_461"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para18"><a name="10112551000036">Discussions regularly take place with representatives of the fishing industry on reducing discards through improving gear selectivity and altering fishing practices. For example, the Discard Action Group is a forum, facilitated by seafish, that brings industry, managers, scientists, and seafood organisations together to discuss research, share knowledge and come up with novel ways to reduce discards. The industry has been encouraged through such groups to use gear modifications or methods which are successful at reducing discards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para19"><a name="10112551000037">There are many examples of collaborative work to reduce discards which have been carried out by the UK fishing industry in partnership with the UK fisheries departments. The Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) is one example of a continuing initiative to encourage industry-led research on a range of subjects, including the trials of alternative fishing gears, eg square mesh panels used to reduce the bycatch of cod in other whitefish and prawn (Nephrops) fisheries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para20"><a name="10112551000038">The UK has been at the forefront of encouraging uptake of measures to reduce discards of cod. For example, this has been achieved through the Scottish Conservation Credits Scheme and English/Northern Irish equivalents. Incentives of extra days at sea for the industry are used to encourage uptake of selectivity measures (eg increasing mesh sizes) to reduce the bycatch and subsequent discarding of juvenile cod. Since 2009, this scheme has been enhanced with mandatory real time closures (RTCs) in operation throughout the cod recovery zone. We believe that localised RTCs provide the necessary protection for local aggregations of fish, and that these closures are beneficial for the health of the protected stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para21"><a name="10112551000039">The industry has also been involved in targeted regional pilots like 'Project 50%'. On average vessels participating in these trials managed to reduce discards in the South West beam trawl fleet by an average of 52%.</p>

There is a saving to the UK Border Agency in terms of caseworking costs and potential transfer to and detention in an Immigration Removal Centre, at a cost of Â£110 per night, if deportation cannot take place immediately at the end of an individual's sentence. The scheme offers an incentive for foreign national prisoners to comply with the travel documentation process, and to leave the UK before the opportunity arises to frustrate removal with various legal barriers.

 From 12 November 2010 the following events have been planned by the Government Equalities Office to take place in 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para57"><a name="10112557000020">On 17 November the Minister for Women and Equalities gave a major speech to key partners on equality setting out the Government's new approach to equality and fairness. We estimate the cost of this event at about Â£700 which covers the cost of the venue and audio equipment. Three GEO staff members were involved in its organisation.</p>

We estimate the cost of this event to cost Â£226 and two members of staff will be involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="101125w0003.htm_para59"><a name="10112557000022">On 29 November, 8 and 9 of December we are organising three informal consultation roundtables to seek the views of women's organisations on the Government's new approach to engaging with women. This follows the abolition of the Women's National Commission. We estimate each event will cost about Â£320.00, with the involvement of two members of staff for each event.</p>

October. The review was conducted in order to deliver our commitment, as set out in the coalition agreement, to reduce the cost and number of quangos. As part of that review, it has been decided that the Women's National Commission will be closed down at the end of this year (2010) and its core functions brought into the Government Equalities Office (GEO).</p>
