In the course of its review of London City Bond-related convictions last year Customs continued to trawl all areas of the Department for any material of potential relevance both to ongoing appeals against conviction and to the issues examined by Mr. Justice Butterfield. Further disclosable material that was uncovered was passed directly to the Metropolitan Police to assist their investigation into the circumstances of the collapse of the London City Bond cases and to Mr. Justice Butterfield for his consideration.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), of 6&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1082&#150;83W, on ivory seizures, for what reasons no prosecutions have been initiated by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise.  [154812]<P>

<P>
<a name="40212w02.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Customs will normally prosecute in those cases where a deliberate or organised attempt has been made to evade or breach for commercial gain the controls on ivory. Customs would look carefully at the circumstances of any case where seized ivory is either antique or harvested legitimately prior to the ban imposed on commercial trade in ivory from African elephants in 1990. Such ivory can be lawfully traded provided that it is accompanied by the appropriate documentation issued by the competent authorities.
<P>

<a name="40212w02.html_para4">Many seizures of ivory involve a small quantity found in the possession of members of the travelling public who are shown after inquiries to have breached the controls unwittingly&#151;for example by importing items which were on open sale and were bought in good faith, or by exporting items that have been held in the UK legitimately for some time.
<P>

<a name="40212w02.html_para5">Two detections in 2001 involved commercial quantities of ivory which had been deliberately concealed.

 The Large Business Office (LBO) IT system was developed by a partnership of EDS and the LBO between October 1996 and November 1997 with a commercial software package, 'Composer'. The system cost &#163;1.92&nbsp;million including equipment and software licenses. The number of staff days of development is not now known. The system enabled the LBO to support and monitor their casework; it was formally accepted in 1998 by senior management of the LBO.

<a name="40212w02.html_para6">There was a credibility check of the data provided early in the use of the system, and in 2000, LBO senior management asked questions about data on some individual cases. The Director asked the Inland Revenue's internal auditors to review the accuracy of data for 2001&#150;02. Their interim report enabled some adjustment to be made to the reported figures for that year and errors in reporting future years' tax effects were eliminated for 2001&#150;02 onwards. A follow up review of processes commissioned in 2003 revealed that some LBO caseworkers were not reporting yield in line with departmental guidance.

 We have received no guidance from the European Commission regarding the definition of "covered space". However, the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 requires Intermediate Plants to have a "covered space " to receive animal by-products. It also requires the plant to be constructed in such a way that it is easy to clean and disinfect, and that floors must be laid down in such a way as to facilitate the draining of liquids. The plant must also have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests, such as insects, rodents and birds. In our view, the combination of these requirements make it necessary for the plant to have a roof, walls and a floor before we can approve it. The application form for approval of an Intermediate Plant provides guidance on the requirements of the Regulation, and states that

<P>
<P>

 Central Science Laboratory studies suggest that body weight in badgers is density dependent, with lower average weights occurring as group size approaches carrying capacity. The association between body weight and badger density suggests that food is a major factor limiting badger numbers.
<P>

<a name="40212w03.html_para3">The notion that badger populations are "over-populated" is erroneous. Badgers display a sophisticated regulatory mechanism, where fecundity and mortality are in equilibrium to maintain the population at a level which the habitat will support.
<P>

<a name="40212w03.html_para4">There is no information linking the health status of badgers to population density.

 Like most terrestrial mammals, domestic cats are susceptible to infection by <i>Mycobacterium bovi</i>s (<i>M. bovis</i>).

TB in cats is not notifiable although it is good practice to contact the State Veterinary Service (SVS) if it is suspected.

<P>

<a name="40212w03.html_para5">The infection can be transferred to man, therefore, if a confirmed case of <i>M. bovis</i> infection in a cat comes to the attention of the SVS, the Divisional Veterinary Manager will inform the Consultant in Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) of the local health authority. Investigation of the TB status of any human contacts is the responsibility of the CCDC.

 The badger benefits from legal protection introduced to outlaw cruelty towards animals. For example, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which among other things, made the baiting of animals illegal, and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, which made certain specified acts of cruelty illegal.
<P>

<a name="40212w03.html_para11">In addition, there are legal restrictions on the range of methods that can be used to kill or take badgers. This protection was introduced to outlaw inhumane and/or indiscriminate methods of control. The key legislation in this respect is the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Some of these restrictions apply to all animals, while others apply only to animals, like the badger, listed on schedule 6 of the Act.
<P>

<a name="40212w03.html_para12">There have also been specific laws to protect badgers. These were introduced as a welfare measure to combat illegal badger baiting, and also as a conservation measure in response to declines in badger numbers in the 1970s and 1980s. The various statutes specifically relating to badgers were consolidated under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992.

 The abundance of wild animals is ultimately limited by the availability of key resources. In the United Kingdom, food and suitable sites for setts are likely to be the key constraints on the size of the badger population.

This was approved by the European Commission following representation by the Government, and came into effect on 1&nbsp;November 2003. My Department is sponsoring research to reduce the uncertainties associated with these emissions, and the Department of Trade and Industry has commissioned a study into possible ways to encourage the control of these emissions. The Government will consider what further action to take following the publication of this report, which we expect to be available in March.

 As previously mentioned in the answer given to the hon. Member on 26&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1W, the animal species listed on schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are reviewed every five years. My previous answer details the criteria used for assessing whether species should be added to the schedule for the Fourth Quinquennial Review, which will be consulted upon in 2004. The Quinquennial Review criteria relate only to taxa that are endangered or is likely to become endangered.
<P>

<a name="40212w04.html_para0">Endangered species are also identified through inclusion in Red Data Books, where the threats to survival of species are assessed using internationally recognised criteria.

<P>

<a name="40212w04.html_para1">Part of the Quinquennial Review process is also used to assess whether the species that have been protected by listing on schedule 5 still merit protection. The criteria used are the same as those given in my previous reply of January 26.

 Meetings of the Fisheries Council and all other formations of the Council are convened by the incumbent Presidency (currently Ireland) which publishes a schedule of planned meetings in advance. Any member state or the commission can request the Presidency to call a special meeting of the Council, in addition to the planned schedule of meetings, but such requests are rare. The Irish Presidency has already scheduled meetings of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council for February, March, April, May and June 2004.

We support the proposal on the basis that it is more transparent than existing legislation. We have, however, consistently set out our concern that any uncertainty about the impact of the Energy Chapter could undermine investment in North sea oil and gas. With that in mind, we proposed a series of amendments to this part of the Treaty with the aim of ensuring that European member states would retain the right to control the exploitation of their natural resources. Maintaining unanimity in relation to tax proposals remains part of the Government's "red line".

 The Community Sports Coach scheme (formerly known as Coachmatch) will see a first phase of some 100 full-time coaches employed by the end of 2003&#150;04.

<a name="40212w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Coaching awards in swimming, gymnastics, orienteering and angling are eligible for funding from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in England. In addition, if a sport offers an NVQ the LSC will fund the employer and the training provider directly rather than the individual. The value of any LSC grant depends on the length of the course. Typically a coaching qualification in the above sports taking between 60&#150;90 hours to achieve can attract funding of approximately &#163;400 per candidate, irrespective of employment status.

 DFID is closely following events. Early season rainfall was well below normal in much of central and southern Mozambique, raising concerns of a third consecutive drought year. Recent rains may still spark crop recovery in the centre of the country, but many areas of southern Mozambique are likely to experience crop failure. Steep price rises in maize, the main staple food, are also probable in southern areas due to crop failure in South Africa and other neighbouring countries. A national assessment of vulnerability and hunger will be made in March after the first harvests have started, and a full needs assessment will be published by April. This will provide sufficient time for DFID and others to look carefully at the assessment and respond as required.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what measures he has taken to ensure that development budgets for Uganda are not diverted to defence.  [153525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Uganda has a well-developed and consultative process for deciding the Government's annual budget. Donors are involved throughout, and have an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual public expenditure review. This level of consultation allows partners, including the UK, to ensure Government meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. Allocations to the Government's "Poverty Action Fund" (PAF), for example, have risen from less than 20&nbsp;per cent. to over 37&nbsp;per cent. of the Government's budget in the past six years. These allocations have been fully protected during budget execution. Our budget support, and that of other donors, is conditional on our endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution.
<P>

<a name="40212w08.html_para0">The level of defence spending is a major element of this consultation. The UK has supported a defence review, which is about to conclude. The review's purpose is to develop a long-term strategy for the Army, setting out how roles and capabilities should be adapted to meet the security challenges Uganda faces. It will provide the basis for making well-informed and affordable decisions on the defence budget in the future. We are impressing upon Government the need for consultation around the review's recommendations before future levels of defence expenditure are set. Our aim is to ensure its affordability, and guarantee expenditure for core poverty reduction programmes is not displaced. We will monitor this issue very closely, especially in the context of our budget support.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation caused by the conflict in northern Uganda, now in its 18th year. Insecurity prevents normal development activities, resulting in 63&nbsp;per cent. of households in the north living below the poverty line compared with 38&nbsp;per cent. nationally. Our immediate concern is the plight of the large number of displaced people across the region. This group of over 1.3&nbsp;million faces declining levels of food security due to disruption of the planting and harvesting seasons. They also face serious problems of lack of shelter and physical insecurity. A number of local and international organisations are working to address the emerging needs.
<P>

<a name="40212w08.html_para1">We have provided &#163;7.3&nbsp;million of humanitarian assistance over the last 12 months. This has been channelled through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Uganda Red Cross Society. We are currently allocating a further &#163;1.1&nbsp;million. Linked to this we are financing UNICEF personnel working on the protection of women and children. We have also provided Save the Children Fund with a grant to improve conditions for the increasing number of 



<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2004 : Column 1580W</I><P>
unaccompanied children who are sleeping in town centres at night to avoid abduction by the LRA. We are working hard, in partnership with others, to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches all those in need despite some access difficulties across the region.
<P>

<a name="40212w08.html_para2">The Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and I raised the conflict and its humanitarian impact in our discussions with President Museveni during his recent UK visit. We, along with our partners in Uganda and the international community, will continue to encourage the Government of Uganda to bring about a sustainable resolution to the conflict.

<P>

<a name="40212w08.html_para3">We are working with the Learning and Skills Council, further education colleges, and advice and guidance agencies in the 10 pilots to promote this new grant. At this stage, the main focus is on promoting the grant to new learners who started courses during January 2004 and to existing learners who may be eligible but have not applied.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 It is estimated that lower skills contribute up to 20&nbsp;per cent. of the UK's productivity gap with France and Germany. The key to productivity is a highly skilled workforce. The Skills Strategy published in July sets out our programme to raise our skill levels to compete with the best in the world. It will be driven forward by the Skills Alliance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Employers at primary schools must ensure so far as is reasonably practicable the health and safety of staff, pupils and visitors to the school site. The employer will usually be the local education authority. In practice the associated tasks are usually delegated to the school staff, for example ensuring drinking water taps are labelled.

The guarantee will also operate in the 2005&#150;06 financial year, on a basis to be finalised when we have reviewed the way it is working in its first year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The income-contingent repayment scheme for student loans already recognises the needs of graduates who take and remain in poorly paid jobs. Repayments will be 9&nbsp;per cent. of salary above &#163;15,000 from 2005, and will stop whenever the graduate's salary falls below that threshold. In addition, we propose to write off the outstanding loan after 25 years&#151;that too will benefit graduates in low paid jobs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is no relationship between student loans and household debt. Student loans are repaid on an income-contingent basis. We intend that graduates only pay 9&nbsp;per cent. of their income beyond &#163;15,000 per year. If it falls below &#163;15,000, their repayments stop. Student loans are subsidised by the Government with no real rate of interest&#151;so the burden does not increase, however long the repayment period. The Government propose to write off any outstanding student loan amount after 25 years.

<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many charges and of what value have been made in error to graduates whose income did not reach a level where repayment was required for failure to make repayments of student loans.  [154001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w08.html_spnew10"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Borrowers with the old, mortgage style, loans may be charged administration fees if they fall into default. This can happen if a borrower's income is below the deferment threshold but they neither apply to defer their loan repayments nor make loan repayments.
<P>

<a name="40212w08.html_para5">Different arrangements apply to the income-contingent loans, where repayment is triggered automatically by the Inland Revenue when the borrower's income exceeds the repayment threshold. Borrowers outside the UK who fail to repay these income-contingent loans to the Student Loans Company when they should, may incur financial penalties.
<P>

<a name="40212w08.html_para6">Where charges are made in error, the Student Loans Company will refund them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The use of the private finance initiative in schools has been a popular and successful programme. Popular because more than 100 of the 150 local education authorities in England have applied to take part. Successful because we have progressed from one contract covering one school in 1997 to 66 contracts covering over 600 schools today. Services have started under 40 of these contracts and they represent a private sector capital investment of &#163;1.8 billion.

 The White Paper, The Future of Higher Education, signalled that in order for teaching in HE to be treated seriously as a profession its own right, national professional standards designed and agreed by the sector should be introduced. Training to meet the new standards should be possible through a wide range of programmes and courses. It is expected that all new teaching staff will be required to obtain a teaching qualification that meets the standards. Qualifications will be awarded by HEIs and could be existing qualifications, adapted and developed as necessary, or newly developed qualifications. The development of the standards and the accreditation of the qualifications are being taken forward by the new sector body, the HE Academy.

 The fifth annual 'Opportunity for all' (Cm 5956) report sets out the latest assessment of progress in tackling child poverty, showing significant progress.
<P>

<a name="40212w11.html_para1">As set out in "Tackling Child Poverty&#151;Giving Every Child the Best Possible Start in Life", published in December 2001, the Government's strategy for tackling child poverty involves ensuring decent family incomes, with work for those who can and support for those who cannot, and providing support for parents. It also involves delivering high quality public services and harnessing the power and expertise of the voluntary and community sectors.
<P>

<a name="40212w11.html_para2">Based on the latest outturn data (for 2001&#150;02) we have made significant progress on our PSA target to reduce the number of children in low-income households by a quarter by 2004&#150;05. The 2003 Pre-Budget Report announced that the per child element of the Child Tax Credit will increase from April 2004 by &#163;180 to &#163;1,625 a year, equivalent to a weekly increase of &#163;3.50.

<a name="40212w11.html_para3">As a result of this new investment, the Government is on track to meet its PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children in low-income households by 2004&#150;05 on a before housing costs basis. The target is

more challenging on an after housing costs basis. The nature of the target means that there are uncertainties either way. This extra investment will enable the Government to make progress step by step towards its goal to halve child poverty by 2010 and eradicate it by 2020.

<a name="40212w11.html_para14">Estimates of the amount of council tax benefit left unclaimed in Great Britain are available in the Department for Work and Pensions/Department of Social Security annual report entitled "Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up". Statistics are presented on a financial year basis; the latest estimates relate to 2000&#150;01. Copies of the publications are available in the Library.

<P>
<a name="40212w11.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;cost and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;number of beneficiaries of abolishing the upper capital limit on council tax benefit for people aged 60 years and over; and what plans he has to introduce this change;  [152795]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the basis is for setting the council tax benefit upper capital limit at &#163;16,000 for pensioners; and when the limit was last uprated.  [152796]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 Council Tax Benefit has lower capital limits above which benefits are reduced and upper limits above which benefits cannot be paid. When the present scheme was introduced in April 1988, the upper capital limit was set at &#163;6,000. It was subsequently increased to &#163;8,000 on 30&nbsp;May 1988 and to &#163;16,000 on 1&nbsp;April 1990.
<P>

<a name="40212w11.html_para15">The estimated annual cost of abolishing the upper capital limit is approximately &#163;50&nbsp;million, with around 100,000 beneficiaries. We have no current plans to change these arrangements; however, under the new Pension Credit, there is no upper capital limit.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>i. Costs are rounded to the nearest five million, beneficiaries are rounded to the nearest 25,000.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ii. Each beneficiary represents a benefit unit, which can be a single claimant or a couple; where the benefit unit is a couple, at least one member is aged 60 or over.</FONT></UL>

Costs are estimated using the DWP Policy Simulation Model for 2004&#150;05; this model is based on the 2001&#150;02 Family Resources Survey data, uprated to 2004&#150;05 prices, benefit rates and earnings levels, and is calibrated to latest published forecasts and policies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>iv. Costs arise from cases becoming newly entitled to council tax benefit as a result of abolishing the upper capital limit.

 This is not a new development. Staff in the Department for Work and Pensions were originally advised in a letter from the Permanent Secretary in October 2002, that as part of the Department's modernisation programme, staffing levels would be reduced between 2003 to 2006.

 We want all eligible pensioners to take up their entitlement and initiatives are in place to encourage them to do so.




<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2004 : Column 1596W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para2">We are currently in the main phase of our marketing campaign for pension credit and aim to have at least 3&nbsp;million households in receipt of pension credit by 2006. By June 2004, we will have written to all pensioner households, to explain about the new entitlement. Direct mail is being supported by extensive TV and press advertising. From May, we intend to focus campaign activity on those pensioners who are likely to be entitled but who have not responded.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para3">The Pension Service Local Service is playing a key role, particularly in encouraging pensioners who are less likely to take up their entitlement to apply. We continue to work closely with organisations such as Help the Aged and Age Concern/at both national and local level, and with local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para4">Local authorities have a statutory duty to promote take up of housing benefit and council tax benefit. In order to encourage take up of council tax benefit, which has historically been lower than for other income-related benefits, we have launched a take-up campaign to help support local authorities in encouraging those who may be entitled to claim.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para5">The introduction of pension credit also means around 320,000 pensioner households will be newly entitled to council tax benefit. To help facilitate take up of housing benefit and council tax benefit applicants for pension credit who also want to claim these benefits are sent a claim form to return to their local authority. We have also recently introduced a shortened version of this claim form for pensioners to make the process of claiming even easier.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para6">Those pensioners who are entitled to the pension credit guarantee credit have linked entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit which can meet up to 100&nbsp;per cent. of their rent and council tax liability. The Department is improving the take-up of attendance allowance in a targeted and well directed way. We have removed a major barrier to people claiming attendance allowance by introducing a new claim form that is much shorter, personalised and more responsive to customer needs. New information technology has been introduced throughout the organisation to speed up the decision making process and enable a better and more professional service.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para7">We are also working closer with partners such as local authorities and welfare rights organisations who are able to advise people about disability benefits in a far more targeted way than would be possible through any mass disability awareness campaigns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w12.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement' reinforced our commitment to extend employment opportunities for older people, with a range of proposals including providing extra back-to-work help for over 50s, and a number of changes to tax and pension rules which will give individuals more choice and opportunity to stay in work longer. We have 



<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2004 : Column 1597W</I><P>
pledged to tackle age discrimination in the workplace, and we will be introducing age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006. We have also made it clear that in the forthcoming age legislation compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful, unless employers can show they are objectively justified. Employers will therefore need to adopt more flexible approaches to retirement.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para8">We are already encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices through our Age Positive Campaign. The campaign raises employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and encourages a flexible approach to retirement to open up choice and opportunity for individuals to stay in work longer.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para9">In 2002 we published an updated version of the Code of Practice 'Age Diversity at work: a practical guide for business'. This sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. The code was first developed in 1999 with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27&nbsp;per cent. to 13&nbsp;per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14&nbsp;per cent. to 7&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para10">Since then we have continued to promote the business case for recruiting, training and retaining older workers through the Age Positive campaign and website, www.agepositive.gov.uk, and workshops for smaller businesses. Our research publications include 'Good Practice in the Recruitment and Retention of Older Workers' (December 2001), 'Flexible Retirement: A Snapshot of Large Employers' Initiatives' (June 2002), 'Working after State Pension Age' (2003) and 'Factors affecting the Labour Market Participation of Older Workers' (2004). Copies of these reports are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40212w12.html_para11">From Spring 1997 to Spring 2003 our policies have helped increase the employment rate for people aged 50 to State Pension age from over 64&nbsp;per cent. to over 70&nbsp;per cent., with nearly 900,000 more people aged 50 and over in work. This increase has been faster than the increase in the overall employment rate. Under New Deal 50 plus over 98,000 people aged over 50 have moved off benefits and gone back to work from April 2000 to March 2003, claiming the programme's financial help.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will enable recipients of income support to put aside some of their benefit to save for the purchase of a Motability vehicle without their savings affecting their entitlement to income support.  [151783]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 Income-related benefits are intended to target help on those with the least resources. It is a long established principle that substantial amounts of capital should not be ignored when deciding entitlement to a benefit based on need, and it is for this reason that all savings are counted as capital. Claimants are free to spend their capital as they wish, so it would be inappropriate to have different rules for the treatment of capital based simply on a declaration of its intended use.
<P>

<a name="40212w13.html_para3">However, there will not usually be a need for a person to have significant savings in order to lease or purchase a suitable vehicle through the Motability scheme. Generally, the cost of a suitable vehicle is met through the higher rate mobility component of their disability living allowance or war pensioners' mobility supplement. In some cases, where the cost of the chosen vehicle cannot be met from the weekly benefit payments, an advance payment must be made at the start of the relevant agreement. Motability has funds available to make discretionary payments to help meet the cost of an advance payment where Motability considers the extra cost is necessary to provide a vehicle to meet a person's basic mobility needs.

 The Department for Work and Pensions was created in April 2001 from a merger of the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. One of our key priorities is to make the best possible use of taxpayers' money. Around 1,100 Jobcentres and 400 social security offices inherited from the former Benefits Agency and Employment Service are being replaced with a network of around 1,000 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices. By bringing together two organisations we can derive a merger dividend because it is possible to upgrade services and teams such as HR, Finance and Management Support.

 We have introduced the state second pension (S2P) which reformed the state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) in April 2002. Compared to SERPS, S2P gives more help to employees on low or moderate earnings (&#163;4,004 to &#163;25,600 in 2003&#150;04 terms). It also helps certain carers and disabled people whose annual earnings are below &#163;4,004, or have no earnings at all. So it will provide extra income in retirement for some part-time workers.

Under these regulations part-time workers have the right in principle not to be treated less favourably than full-time workers of the same employer who work under the same type of employment contract.

There is a growing consensus among business surveys pointing towards a continued strengthening of business activity in Scotland in both services and manufacturing.

 The best source of information on this topic are the large number of studies which have already been undertaken by international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD and the OECD, and by charitable organisations such as Oxfam. The work of these organisations demonstrates through individual case studies the severe adverse effects which dumping of subsidised agricultural products on world markets can have on developing country economies. It remains, however, very difficult to make an accurate quantitative economic assessment of the overall impact of dumping of subsidised agricultural produce on developing country markets. The World Bank have, however, estimated that the comprehensive reform of all aspects of agricultural policies in developed countries could boost the income of developing countries by as much as $100 billion.

sector, as well s others through the work of a new dedicated Resource Centre for Women in science, engineering and technology (SET). The Resource Centre is part of the Government's Strategy, published in April 2003 as a response to Baroness Greenfield's SET Fair Report. The Government will look to the new Resource Centre to carry out specific tasks in support of its overarching objective to work with employers to improve the position of women in SET: recognition for good SET employers; the sharing of good employment practice; disseminating and sharing information; setting up and maintaining an expert women's database; maintaining and disseminating statistics; raising the profile of women in SET; pump-priming innovation through developing, with others, support for initiatives such as mentoring, networking, speaker's bursaries and mobility issues; supporting returners; and coordinating the work of women in science organisations. It will draw on the experience of women and women in science organisations to do this and co-ordinate their activity to achieve critical mass.

The Government is providing funding of &#163;800,000 per annum to cover all the activities of the centre. Additional funding of &#163;500,000 is available to the resource centre for a returners' scheme, to gather feedback on existing schemes as soon as it can, and develop a strategic plan for the future investment of these additional funds. DfES will also contribute &#163;200,000 to the Resource Centre for schemes aimed at undergraduates. The Consortium members proposed to deliver a Resource Centre that represents all sectors in which there are high levels of occupational segregation for women in science, engineering, technology, and the built environment and intend to be relevant to all women whether working at professional, technician or craft level.

The new centre will be expected to raise funds from other sources both private and public. It is expected that organisations that want partnership with an support from the resource centre will contribute resources, both to specific projects and to allow the centre to operate more widely, to maximise the leverage of the initial public finding to the centre.

The Government have allocated resources to promote enterprise in disadvantaged areas and under-represented groups. In England, that allocation has been designated as the Phoenix Fund. The devolved Administrations, who have responsibility for business support in their own countries, have made separate arrangements for using their allocations. However, for reasons of economy of scale and to ensure consistency with other existing provision, a limited number of elements of the Phoenix Fund provision to support Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) apply across the whole of the UK.<P>

<a name="40212w21.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what discussions she has had with her counterparts in the United States since the breakdown of the World Trade Organisation ministerial conference in Cancun about the likely impact of the United States Farm Bill on the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;economies of, and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;living standards in, developing countries.  [149115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government conducted intensive discussion with the United States officials and Ministers when the US Farm Bill was first introduced in 2002. Since Cancun there has been on-going contact between UK and US officials about all aspects of the WTO Round, including on the question of US domestic subsidies and their potential impact on the livelihoods of producers in developing countries.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w21.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will identify the ways in which representatives of developing countries at the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference at Cancun judged that the transparency of the negotiating process was better than at Seattle and Doha.  [149124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Wider consultations by the Chairman of the General Council in the months leading up to Cancun, daily meetings for all Heads of Delegation and an open structure for the discussion sessions at the ministerial conference in Cancun itself gave considerable opportunity to make views clear. We need to maintain the benefits from these changes of process at future WTO ministerials.

 The United Kingdom strongly supports the further expansion beyond Kabul of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) under NATO, and will play its full part in helping the Alliance to make that goal a reality. In particular, and subject to the agreement of our partners in NATO and the ISAF, we are ready to build upon the success of our Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Mazar-e-Sharif and play a leading role in expanding the ISAF in Northern Afghanistan. Final decisions on the nature of our future

 As at January 2004, 58&nbsp;per cent. of our Challenger II Main Battle Tanks available for operations were classed as 'Fit'. Equipment is deemed to be 'Fit' if it meets the inspection criteria stated in the relevant Army Equipment Support Publication Inspections Standards for all operational and peacetime legal and safety requirements. Many of the tanks classified as not 'Fit' require only minor work in terms of spares or labour to rectify the problem, and many of these would be able to undertake their prescribed role in an operational environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In an assessment undertaken in December 2001, the Department welcomed the York University report on the costs and benefits of defence exports, and endorsed its broad conclusions, while expressing reservations about some of the assumptions made.
<P>

<a name="40212w22.html_para2">Estimates of UK employment dependent on defence exports are published annually in the UK Defence Statistics and on-line at: www.dasa.mod.uk. The Defence Export Services Organisation fulfils a fundamental role in implementing the Government's policy of supporting legitimate UK defence exports. In 2002, the UK defence industry signed export sales orders worth just over &#163;5 billion and successive customer Satisfaction Surveys of the UK defence industry have revealed that over 75&nbsp;per cent. of this business would not have been achieved without the assistance of DESO.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 27&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 245W, where information on the foreign aircraft hired by his Department is held; on what basis the decision was reached that information on the use of foreign aircraft could be provided only at disproportionate cost; who took this decision; and whether the Department has previously provided information on hire of foreign aircraft.  [154260]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Information relating to the charter of the majority of aircraft for the Ministry of Defence is held by the Defence Transport and Movements Agency (DTMA). As the Department operates disaggregated budgets, it is possible that other parts of the Ministry of Defence could have chartered aircraft over the last five years and in that event, such information is not held centrally. The Department has no requirement to record specifically information relating to makes, types and origins of aircraft chartered. The Department competes its charter business in accordance with European rules and often through a broker in order to achieve value for money. Safety is of paramount importance and the nationality of the aircraft is but one consideration in the assessment of suitability for task.

<P>

<a name="40212w23.html_para0">The decision that information on foreign aircraft chartered could be provided only at disproportionate cost was made by the Chief Executive of the DTMA. It was based on a calculation that the exercise would entail one member of DTMA being removed from normal duties to work only on this task for a minimum of five working days. This period would exceed the cost threshold of &#163;600 and have a detrimental effect on the daily work of air movements. DTMA would also have to contact all other parts of the Department, and re-engage with brokers, in order to identify all foreign charters. This would be at additional cost.
<P>

<a name="40212w23.html_para1">Some information on chartered aircraft has previously been provided in answers to Questions from hon. Members, where such information was available centrally and did not involve disproportionate cost to recover it.

 I refer my hon. Friend to my answer of 6&nbsp;November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770. The SIB investigation is still ongoing and we cannot put a timeframe on how long the investigation might take. Once it has been completed a full report will be given to the families concerned. I will make public as many of its findings as possible, subject to operational and other security constraints. We are providing as much information to the families as we are able, consistent with the need to maintain the integrity of the investigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many UK representatives there are on the Iraq Survey Group; how many there have been in total since the Group was established; what the cost to date has been of UK representation; and what estimate he has made of the total cost of UK participation in the Group.  [154455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are currently 55 United Kingdom representatives on the Iraq Survey Group. There have been a total of 140 UK representatives who have served in the Iraq Survey Group, 94 Service personnel and 46 civilians. The maximum number at any one time was 76 in October 2003.
<P>

<a name="40212w23.html_para5">The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of Operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs that the Department would have incurred regardless of the operation taking place, such as wages and salaries, are not included. Savings on activities that have not occurred because of the operation&#151;training exercises for example&#151;are taken into account in arriving at the net figures.
<P>

<a name="40212w23.html_para6">The net additional costs incurred by UK personnel attached to the Iraq Survey Group cannot be differentiated from the total net additional cost of UK personnel deployed to the Gulf region.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All soldiers deploying on Operation Telic were, and remain, mandated to have completed individual training that prepares them for surviving and lighting in a nuclear, biological or chemical environment. They also received a familiarisation briefing immediately prior to deployment on Collective Protection, which focused on how to operate within such an environment.
<P>

<a name="40212w23.html_para7">In addition, Unit Commanders attended a Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defence Cadre, focussing on the threat and possible countermeasures, the lessons of which were then cascaded down to their soldiers.
<P>

<a name="40212w23.html_para8">Building on this foundation of individual training, units reinforced this preparation both before and during deployment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 United Kingdom forces are training and mentoring the Iraqi civil defence forces including the Iraq Civil Defence Corps and the Police. To date, in the Multinational Division (South-east) area of responsibility almost all of the ICDC's personnel and approaching half of the police have been trained. In addition 20 Armoured Brigade and the Royal Military Police each have embedded personnel in the respective Iraqi organisations as part of the mentoring process.

<a name="40212w23.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 4&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 887W, on the Iraq Survey Group, how many personnel were employed in the Iraq Survey Group in June 2003, broken down by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;nationality and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;speciality; and what the projected figures are for the end of 2004.  [154239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The formation of the Iraq Survey Group was announced on 14&nbsp;April 2003, and there was a period of transition while elements were being moved into place. We do not hold figures for the transition period that can be broken down by nationality or speciality, but we estimate that there were approximately 450 personnel in the Iraq Survey Group in early June. The United Kingdom contribution would have been Headquarters Staff, interviewers/interpreters and scientific and technical specialists. The current planning assumption is that Iraq Survey Group numbers will remain broadly in line with current numbers for as long as is necessary to complete the Group's task.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;each of the types of weapons of mass destruction that exist in the world and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the countries which possess them; and how many weapons are held by each country.  [154283]<P>

<P>
<a name="40212w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no universally accepted definition of the phrase "weapons of mass destruction", but it is generally held to refer to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
<P>

<a name="40212w25.html_para0">Under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, China and Russia are recognised as nuclear weapon states, as defined in Article 9(3) of the Treaty. Additionally, India and Pakistan have tested nuclear devices. As set out in the Strategic Defence Review 1998, the UK has fewer than 200 operationally available nuclear warheads. None of the other states have publicly confirmed the size of their nuclear weapon stockpiles.
<P>

<a name="40212w25.html_para1">There are five States Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) (US, Russia, India, Albania and one other State Party) that have declared possession of chemical weapons. They are currently in the process of destroying them in accordance with their obligations under the Convention. The amount of chemical weapons originally declared is 69,869 metric tonnes, of which 27,773 metric tonnes is from the US, 40,000 metric tonnes from Russia, and 2,096 metric tonnes from the other states parties.
<P>

<a name="40212w25.html_para2">We welcome Libya's recent announcement that it is renouncing its WMD programmes. It has acceded to the CWC and the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention. It has announced its intention to sign an Additional Protocol with the IAEA and has undertaken to act in accordance with its provisions pending ratification.
<P>

<a name="40212w25.html_para3">We do not yet have a complete picture of Iraq's WMD programme related activities. The Iraq Survey Group's work is by no means completed. It remains our best means of discovering the truth about Iraq's WMD programmes. We have long had concerns about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's development of WMD, especially their capability to produce and develop nuclear weapons. We are actively supporting

the major diplomatic effort to try and resolve international concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The UK remains concerned by the scope and scale of Iran's nuclear programme, and the state of its technical knowledge, which could assist in the production of both chemical and biological weapons. We are also aware of persistent reports that Syria is pursuing programmes to develop WMD and the means for their delivery.
<P>

<a name="40212w25.html_para4">We continue to encourage Israel to resolve international concerns about its nuclear status by acceding to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, as a non-nuclear weapons state.

<a name="40212w26.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The allocation legislation requires that housing authorities ensure that reasonable preference for an allocation of accommodation is given to certain categories of persons. These include people living in insanitary, overcrowded and unsatisfactory housing conditions. The Office of the Deputy Prime minister has issued statutory guidance that provides housing authorities with examples of indicators which might be taken into account in determining whether people are living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. These include children in flats or maisonettes above the ground floor. There is nothing to prevent housing authorities devising their own local indicators in addition, or in place of this.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his oral answer of 4&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 748, how many of the 790,000 council homes have been transferred to arm's length management organisations; and what proportion of the extra &#163;8 billion private investment to which he referred has been attracted to ALMOs.  [154311]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w26.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The figures quoted relate to transfer of homes to registered social landlords under the large scale voluntary transfer option, rather than homes managed by arm's length management organisations (ALMOs). ALMOs currently in the programme cover just under 500,000 dwellings and have been allocated nearly &#163;900&nbsp;million of public funding to bring homes up to the Decent Homes standard.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Information on full-time and part-time employee jobs in English local authorities is held by the Employers Organisation and data on the population in each English authority are available from the 2001 census. Using these data the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has calculated the proportion of local authority employees to total population in the categories of local authority requested. A table showing these data is available in the Library of the House. It should be noted that the population figures refer to the total population of each authority rather than just the adult population.

We strongly support the efforts of the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights, Sergio Pinheiro. The EU has repeatedly condemned Burma's lack of progress on forced labour, most recently at the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) meeting in Geneva on 20&nbsp;November 2003.We fully support the work of the ILO and have called upon the Burmese authorities to end permanently the use of forced labour.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 26&nbsp;February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 588W. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Telecommunications Network (FTN) has now been successfully rolled out to 192 posts. Beyond the contracts for FTN and "Prism", the only ICT project which has cost the FCO collectively in excess of &#163;20&nbsp;million in the last ten years has been our global IT infrastructure, Firecrest. The Firecrest project was led by our principal internal service provider, FCO Services, and was completed in October 2003. The internal costs of the project are considerably greater than original 1997 estimates, reflecting the FCO's decision to expand Firecrest from a limited deployment to some 71 posts into a single, global IT platform for over 200 posts. The replanned project stages were completed on time and budgets were subject to proper internal approvals.

 The Government provides funding for off peak concessionary travel for all pensioners (women over 60, men over 65) through the annual grant settlement to local authorities. This funding also includes concessions for off-peak travel for men aged 60&#150;64 and for disabled people. Local authorities must provide at least half fare concessions on local bus services with no charge for the pass and are free to offer alternative and more generous schemes. Local authorities in England spent around &#163;500&nbsp;million on concessionary travel in 2002&#150;03. This figure takes account of the extra &#163;54&nbsp;million we provided to local authorities in 2001&#150;02 to cover the costs of implementing the statutory half fare minimum requirement. We provided a further &#163;50&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04 to cover the additional cost of extending concessionary travel to men aged 60&#150;64.

 Where the passage, or the passage in any direction, of vehicles is restricted by a traffic regulation order Sections 92 (outside London) and 94(2) (London) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 permit the placing of such bollards or other obstructions, at the point of restriction, as a traffic authority consider appropriate for preventing their passage. Collapsible plates are normally used to protect entrances to facilities off the public highway such as car parks. Whether their use on a public highway to control the direction of traffic flow is practicable and safe would need very careful consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action he is taking in conjunction with <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the Highways Agency and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other interested parties to facilitate access to the Silverstone circuit for the next Grand Prix weekend, with particular attention to hours of peak traffic flow on each of the three days of the meeting.  [152565]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Highways Agency is working closely with all agencies involved in the Silverstone Grand Prix to produce a traffic management plan that meets the needs of those travelling to and from the Circuit as well as local communities and other road users.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport in what way the Highways Agency takes account of the views of neighbouring local authorities when major changes to trunk roads are under consideration.  [154760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w30.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Major changes to trunk roads normally arise from the Government's programme of multi-modal or road based studies and this process involves full local and region wide consultation with statutory bodies and local stakeholders. This would include both the local highway and planning authorities. 



<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2004 : Column 1664W</I><P>
Once the Highways Agency is asked to develop schemes in more detail local public consultation is carried out into options.
<P>

<a name="40212w30.html_para0">Neighbouring authorities would normally be invited to comment on proposals if the road changes could significantly affect traffic in their area. Should orders under the Highways Act be required there would be further opportunity for comment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> The Bredgar section of the M2 meets the criteria for the Government's &#163;5&nbsp;million annual ring fenced noise mitigation budget but due to the number of other pressing cases, has a lower priority. However this section of the M2 will shortly require resurfacing for maintenance reasons, using the quieter surfacing materials that will help reduce the traffic noise. The Highways Agency will aim to resurface this section of the M2 in the 2005&#150;06 financial year, subject to funding being available.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has produced a 'Capacity Utilisation Policy' which aims to make the most efficient use of the existing network. A copy of the document is posted on the SRA's website at www.sra.gov.uk. Individual 'Route Utilisation Strategies' will now be developed, and these will help to inform the need for any future infrastructure enhancements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The values currently used to estimate the benefits of the avoidance of road accidents are set out in the "Highways Economic Note No.1: 2002 Valuation of the Benefits of Prevention of Road Accidents and Casualties" a copy of which is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="40212w30.html_para1">These values, based on 2002 casualty data, were <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;fatal &#163;1,447,490, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;serious &#163;168,260, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;slight &#163;16,750. These amounts are the values to be used in cost benefit analysis. They take account of medical costs, lost production, human costs based on willingness to pay for reduction of risk, the costs of police and courts, insurance administration, and property damage. Included within these values are the cost to public funds for hospital and ambulance costs and the costs of police and courts. In 2002, these costs were &#163;6,860, &#163;11,900 and &#163;1,020 for fatal, serious and slight accidents respectively. The lost production element includes social security costs but these are not separately estimated. The equivalent estimates for 1994 for the avoidance of road accidents were <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;fatal &#163;913,140, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;serious &#163;108,080, and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;slight &#163;10,630. In 1994 the costs for hospital and ambulance and police and courts were &#163;5,120, &#163;8,330 and &#163;700 for fatal, serious and slight accidents respectively.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40212w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 From information provided by the Essex Safety Camera Partnership, the first speed camera to be used in Prittlewell Chase was a mobile unit in February 2001. A second mobile site location was subsequently approved and was first used in March 2001. The first speed camera introduced on the A127 was a fixed unit placed in 2001. A further four fixed cameras were introduced during 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> The Highways Agency has studied the feasibility of installing signals at the A249 Cowstead Corner junction. The Study concluded that the installation of traffic signals would increase queuing times during off peak periods and recommended that this scheme should not go ahead. However an improved roundabout junction at Cowstead Corner will be provided as part of the new A249 Iwade Bypass to Queenborough Scheme. Work is due to start in spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="40212w30.html_para2">Given the frequency of routine studies of this kind, it is not usual for them to be published. If demand requires, the Highways Agency will make the information available on request. However decisions on this will be on a case by case basis and dependent on the commercial sensitivity of the report produced.

Unfortunately, data is only available for Great Britain and not for the UK. Gas refers to vehicles powered by gas, petrol/gas, gas/bi-fuel and gas/diesel, as available data is not broken down by liquefied petroleum gas or compressed natural gas.

 There are 24,419 magistrates in England and Wales excluding the Duchy of Lancaster (where the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is responsible for appointments). There are 3,925 magistrates in the Duchy of Lancaster bringing the overall total of magistrates to 28,344. In England and Wales (excluding the Duchy) 1,490 magistrates declare themselves to be from a black and ethnic minority (BME) group, which is 6.1&nbsp;per cent. In the Duchy of Lancaster there are 219 magistrates from BME groups, which is 5.6&nbsp;per cent. Therefore the overall total of magistrates from a BME group is 1,709 which is 6&nbsp;per cent. As at 1&nbsp;January 2004, of 3,613 judicial officers in England and Wales (excluding tribunals), 130 declared themselves to be of minority ethnic origin.

 It has been scientifically established that the strains of agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are indistinguishable, and the most plausible explanation, although not yet proven, is that BSE transmitted to humans via contaminated meat or meat products. In 2002, the World Health Organisation published consumer information, which states that the consumption of contaminated meat and other food products from cattle with BSE is presumed to be the cause of vCJD in humans.
<P>

<a name="40212w33.html_para7">The United Kingdom has in place stringent controls to minimise the risk of the BSE agent getting into the food chain. These include a ban on mammalian and other processed animal proteins being fed to farmed livestock; the specified risk material (SRM) controls that prohibit from human consumption those parts of the animal that might harbour BSE; and the over 30 months rule that does not permit most older animals to enter the food chain. The Beef Assurance Scheme does allow a few older animals into the food chain, if reared from grass in beef herds, subject to special rules. All measures currently in place are rigorously enforced, for example by members of the Meat Hygiene Service supervising activity at abattoirs.
<P>

 An increase in deaths in the United Kingdom from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from about 10 per year in 1970 to about 40 a year in the 1990s has been reported. These rates are comparable to those observed elsewhere in the world, including countries free of bovine spongiform

<P>

<a name="40212w33.html_para10">A laboratory study in an animal model published in 2002 (Asante et al 2002.

The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), the independent, international group of experts that advises the United Kingdom Government on all matters connected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, considered this paper in February 2003 and acknowledged that it was plausible but considered that the new work did not provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis.

 The National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England has identified those in touch with mental health services as a group at high risk of suicide. The strategy sets out a number of actions mental health services need to take to reduce the risk of suicides within this high risk group. The first annual report of the suicide prevention programme sets out progress made so far and further action that needs to be taken in the medium and longer term.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) funds the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness to ensure that everyone involved in mental health services learns and implements lessons from the factors associated with serious incidents. The inquiry team published Safety First: Five Year Report in 2001. The key findings and recommendations outlined in this report also helped to develop the national suicide prevention strategy. The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) has developed a toolkit to help mental health services implement the report's recommendations.

 Safety First, the five year report of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness, highlighted substance abuse as a risk factor in incidents of suicide by people under the care of mental health services and set out recommendations for local services based on these findings. These included local strategies for dual diagnosis covering training on the management of substance misuse, joint working with substance misuse services, and staff with specific responsibility to develop the local service.

 The Department's strategy on sustainable development and the environment is in line with the Government's overall sustainable development strategy, in which health ("expected healthy years of life") is one of the 15 key headline indicators.

NHS PASA has a sustainable development policy which it published in February 2003. This policy describes the framework within which NHS PASA will conduct its activities in order to contribute towards global pursuits of sustainable development.

 The Department is currently co-funding a project at the University of Leeds to explore methods for the collection, storage and management of a national archive of human milk samples. The other funders are the Food Standards Agency (which leads), the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Health and Safety Executive. A human milk archive would provide a resource, which could be used to monitor levels of cumulative chemicals. This, in turn, will inform decisions by regulatory bodies on the need for strategies to reduce the use of cumulative chemicals and their levels in the environment and in food. The report of the project is expected later this year.

The document was also posted on the Home Office website making it more widely available. The consultation period was from 3&nbsp;May to 23&nbsp;July 2001, which included 27 consultation events around the country with a speaker from the Active Community Unit.

 There is no joint inspection regime for Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs). However, local authorities and the police, both of which are named as responsible authorities under section 5 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, are subject to independent examination. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is charged with examining and improving the efficiency of the Police Service in England and Wales, and the Audit Commission looks at how well local councils deliver their services under the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA). Inspections of English district councils include community safety and community cohesion, and from 2005, the Audit Commission propose that this should also form part of the CPA for all councils where it will be covered under the councils' Corporate Assessment.

<P>

 Writing graffiti is an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971. Where the value of the damage is below &#163;5000 the offender will be tried in a magistrates' court. The offender will then be subject to a maximum sentence of three months imprisonment or a &#163;5,000 fine. If the value of the damage is above &#163;5,000 the offender will be tried in a Crown Court and be subject to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine. At either court, community punishment is available for use where the court considers that the offence merits more than a fine but is not sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="40212w43.html_para5">In addition the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 provides for local authorities to issue Fixed Penalty Notices for graffiti and fly posting. This power will be brought into force in March. Offenders will have to pay a &#163;50 penalty or be prosecuted through the courts.

 The removal of graffiti is one of the tasks carried out by offenders who are sentenced to community punishment, the new name for community service. Community punishment is a sentencing option available to magistrates when convicting those who graffiti. The work done by offenders on community punishment orders is decided locally within the framework of the national standards for the supervision of offenders in the community. Dedicated litter and graffiti squads exist in a number of probation areas.

 The Prison Service does not collate information separately on resources directed at rehabilitation for adult prisoners aged 25 and under. The Government have invested extra funds in improving regimes for prisoners and in programmes that will assist rehabilitation and resettlement. These include offending behaviour programmes, drug treatment programmes, education to improve basic and key work skills and the Custody to Work initiative which seeks to increase the number of prisoners getting jobs or education or training places after release.
<P>

<a name="40212w44.html_para1">In the Spending Review 2000 settlement additional funding of &#163;162&nbsp;million was allocated over the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 to strengthen work on resettlement and rehabilitation. In addition the funding for education and training for prisoners rose from &#163;57&nbsp;million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;66&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;97&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04.

 The Prison Service does not restrain prisoners in 'Solitary Confinement'. Prisoners and Young Offenders can either be subject to segregation procedures, or they can be held in 'Special Accommodation' (special cells or unfurnished cells).
<P>

<a name="40212w45.html_para13">The Prison Service does not centrally monitor the use of segregation.
<P>

<a name="40212w45.html_para14">The forms used to authorise the use of Special Accommodation are in the process of being reviewed, along with a general review of the policy on Use of Force. Unfortunately, the current forms require very little detail about individual incidents, and therefore there are no data for how long prisoners and young offenders have been held in special accommodation. However, very few prisoners are held in special accommodation for periods exceeding 24 hours.
