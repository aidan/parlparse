 The annual track mileage completed for each vehicle type is given in the table. Given the disposition of the vehicle fleet, the mix of operational and training deployments, average figures would be unrepresentative for the fleets as a whole.

<a name="10110w01.html_para0">Track mileage usage is collated centrally, based on records submitted by each unit and can serve only as an indicator of trends rather than a detailed comparator. Individual vehicle usage may vary considerably depending on operating environments. Annual allocations are used as a planning tool only and a shortfall or excess in the actual total usage is not uncommon. The one significant usage shortfall in the above figures concerns the CVR(T). This was due, in the main, to the high level of operational activity experience in 1999-2000 which resulted in less routing training activity.

 My Department has only a small presence in the Blackpool, South constituency. Blackpool, South constituents have gained significantly from defence establishments and defence industry in the surrounding area, and the associated benefits that they bring to the local economy and employment. In particular, the Government's commitment to the Eurofighter programme has sustained many thousands of jobs in the area--especially at BAE Systems at Warton--and will continue to do so for years to come during production.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what access criteria he uses for determining whether <i>(a)</i> remote and <i>(b)</i> rural areas are adequately served by petroleum distributors; and how these criteria are employed.  [144653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The distribution of petroleum products is a commercial matter for individual companies. Local planning authorities can encourage the provision of developments such as petrol stations through the local plan, but it is for private developers to bring such proposals forward.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action he takes to ensure that pricing policies of petrol wholesalers do not disadvantage independent retailers.  [144655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Under UK competition law, it is the responsibility of the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour and possible abuses of market power. The DGFT can act if pricing levels are the result of anti-competitive behaviour but he has no powers to act in relation to prices as such. On 21 November, the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) announced the findings of his inquiry into wholesale petrol and diesel prices. He said that a combination of high world oil prices and public pressure on UK retail prices had resulted in a squeeze on diesel and petrol margins in recent weeks, rather than anti-competitive behaviour on the part of the major oil companies.
<P>

<a name="10110w01.html_para5">The DGFT said the Office of Fair Trading will continue to monitor the UK motor fuels market very closely and will not hesitate to take action if it finds that firms in the industry are deliberately damaging competition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of motor fuels was marketed by <i>(a)</i> each of the major suppliers, <i>(b)</i> hyper and supermarket chains and <i>(c)</i> independent retailers in each year from 1996.  [144656]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> My Department conducted a consultation exercise on possible changes to the criminal provisions in intellectual property law early last year and as a result the Government have decided to amend the law to bring about some rationalisation of and improvement to the provisions relating to these crimes. More specifically, we intend to raise the maximum penalties for the most serious copyright and related offences to the same levels as currently exists for the trade mark offences--an unlimited fine and/or up to 10 years in prison--improve the police powers of search and seizure across the board and introduce provisions on forfeiture of infringing goods in criminal in the copyright area matching the existing provisions in the trade mark area.
<P>

<a name="10110w02.html_para5">Overall, these changes should provide a significant deterrent effect as well as improve the tools available to those who enforce the law relating to theft of intellectual property. These legislative proposals, which will be brought forward as soon as Parliamentary time allows, are in addition to other approaches to achieve a reduction in intellectual property crime, such as the work in the Counterfeiting and Piracy Forum to identify co-operative and other initiatives involving public sector enforcers, right holders, retailers and consumers. Raising awareness of the issues, such as links between intellectual property and other serious organised crime, the effects of dangerous or damaging fake goods and the impact of intellectual property crime on local employment opportunities, in order to persuade consumers not to buy fakes is another important area of our work.

<P>

<a name="10110w02.html_para6">As I said in my previous answer on 6 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 13W, the immediate cause of the rise is oil related gas contracts in Europe which tie the gas price to the oil price. This has brought about a sharp rise in North West European gas prices. This in turn has set the bench-mark for GB prices through trade across the interconnector. My Department continues to monitor the UK market and will not hesitate to refer anti-competitive behaviour to the appropriate competition authorities.
<P>

<a name="10110w02.html_para7">In the longer term, the key to the problem is the rapid introduction of liberalisation and competition in Europe to break the link between gas and oil prices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures he is taking to improve doctor/patient ratios within the area covered by the Easington Primary Care Group; and if he will make a statement.  [144294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The average list sizes for general practitioner principals in the Easington Primary Care Group (PCG) area is 2,085 patients per GP. While this is larger than the national average of 1,845 patients per GP, it does not take into account the number of non-principals working in the area. If salaried doctors and GP principals are taken together, the current ratio of doctors to patients in Easington is 1,967.
<P>

<a name="10110w03.html_para0">Currently salaried doctor (non-principal) recruitment has largely taken place in those practices with Personal Medical Services (PMS) pilots. Since the first pilots commenced in Easington in October 1999, 2.8 whole time equivalent salaried GPs have been recruited to the area. Approval for five more practices to become PMS pilots has been announced and this will lead to the recruitment of four more salaried GPs for an October 2001 start. Following this planned recruitment the average GP list size for Easington would fall to 1,849 which meets the national average and would better help the PCG address the health needs of its population.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what sanctions will be applied under the proposed arrangements for clinical governance to clinicians who refuse to take part in audit and clinical governance arrangements.  [144439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Clinical governance requires all National Health Service organisations to put in place a range of mechanisms, including clinical audit, which enable them to monitor and assure the quality of their clinical services. It does not impose sanctions on individuals. The Commission for Health Improvement will provide an independent and external check on progress in implementing these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="10110w03.html_para1">However, the NHS Plan proposes that, subject to Parliament, all doctors working in primary care will be subject to clinical governance arrangements and we are working with the profession to finalise these proposals. We intend to introduce participation in clinical audit and annual appraisal as a contractual requirement, and general practitioners should, therefore, participate fully and positively in the process. Refusal to take part would be a disciplinary matter to be dealt with, where necessary, under disciplinary procedures. These procedures will be speeded up, with health authorities given a greater role in dealing with individual cases.
<P>

<a name="10110w03.html_para2">From 1 April 2001, appraisal will be a contractual requirement for all hospital consultants, and must be carried out annually. Consultants will be expected to participate positively in the appraisal process. Refusal by a consultant to participate will be a disciplinary matter to be dealt with, where necessary, under the employer's disciplinary procedures. Additionally, the chief executive will report the matter to the Discretionary Points and Distinction Award Committees, and the consultant will not be considered for an award until he or she has agreed to participate fully in the appraisal process.
<P>

<a name="10110w03.html_para3">The General Medical Council makes clear in "Good Medical Practice: Duties of a Doctor" that doctors should take part in regular and systematic medical and clinical audit. Indeed, clinical audit results will be a major factor for the GMC in considering whether individual doctors have met the requirement of their new revalidation system which will follow on the introduction of appraisal. This will be a powerful tool in ensuring participation in clinical audit.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> Government guidelines issued last year make clear that if the place of origin of a food is not the same as the place of origin of its ingredients, additional information may need to be provided on the label to avoid misleading consumers. Failure to do this may result in contravention of existing legislation governing false and misleading labelling and presentation. The guidelines make clear in particular that products containing meat should not be described as "British" if they contain imported meat, but could be described as "made in Britain from . . .

 On 12 December, at about 1.45 pm, the British Consul General in Jerusalem, his wife, his driver and one of the Consulate General's staff were threatened, and the Consul General's car damaged, while detained at a temporary Israeli Defence Force (IDF) checkpoint just north of Halhoul on the West Bank.

<P>

<a name="10110w04.html_para1">The Consul General's official car was stopped by the IDF when it approached the checkpoint. Also present were a group of armed civilians who had partially blocked the road with a bus. While the Consul General's car was stationary, the armed civilians made threatening gestures towards the car and its occupants, and one threw a rock at the car, damaging the rear window. The IDF personnel who were present did nothing to prevent these events from taking place.
<P>

<a name="10110w04.html_para2">The British Embassy in Tel Aviv has made a strong protest to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has demanded an explanation of the IDF's failure to intervene during the incident. We have been assured that the IDF will conduct a thorough investigation. We continue to press the Israelis for a response to our protest.

 <i>[holding answers 8 January 2000]:</i> We have frequent contacts with the UN Secretary-General's Personal Representative, Francesc Vendrell, and other members of the UN. We continue to underline our strong support for UN peace efforts in Afghanistan. We welcome the agreement brokered by Mr. Vendrell on 30 October in which the Taliban and Northern Alliance gave their written agreement to peace talks. We were disappointed, however, that the Taliban withdrew from this process in protest at the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1333 on 19 December. We urge both sides to co-operate with the UN and enter genuine peace negotiations for the sake of the long-suffering people of Afghanistan.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> We remain deeply concerned at the tragic situation in Afghanistan where years of warfare have had a devastating effect on the country as its people.

We are particularly concerned that the Taliban continue to support terrorism, benefit from the drugs trade and violate human rights, especially those of women and girls. We support UNSCRs 1267/99 and 1333/00 which impose targeted sanctions on the Taliban because of their refusal to hand over to justice Osama Bin Laden and their continued support for international terrorism.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for North Essex on 14 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 201W, on implementation of VED rates for commercial vehicles, <i>(a)</i> if rebates on existing vehicles and <i>(b)</i> the revised rates of VED on re-registered vehicles will be available to vehicle operators before 1 January 2001; and if it is his policy (i) to increase VED rates immediately and (ii) to delay the implementation of VED reductions until the Budget.  [144091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Application forms for operators to apply for the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rebates announced in the pre-Budget Report are currently being sent out to operators by DVLA. A number of payments have already been made. It is expected that payments will be despatched no more than four weeks after receipt of the completed application form by DVLA. The deduction of rebates from the statutory VED rates at source has meant that those taking out licences from December 2000 have, in effect, been paying the new VED rates announced in the pre-Budget Report. This reflects our intention to implement both the new rates and the payment of rebates at the earliest opportunity after the announcement of the pre-Budget Report.
<P>

<a name="10110w07.html_para1">The Government have issued a consultation paper on the future VED for goods vehicles, seeking views on a number of proposals including fewer VED rate bands, greater flexibility of vehicle configuration within each rate band, better environmental signals and reduced tax on vehicle ownership. The consultation closes on 12 January.

In August 2000 over 25,000 disabled workers were benefiting from DPTC--37 per cent. more than were receiving Disability Working Allowance in July 1999. From October 2000, a new fast-track to DPTC was introduced to help people who have been sick for 20 weeks or more to remain in work.

<a name="10110w08.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reason he is unable to provide a disaggregated cost of the three measures outlined in paragraph 6.80 of Cm 4917; and what estimate he has made of the time that Customs and Excise staff will have to spend in ensuring that enhanced relief does not subsidise high value properties.  [142251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 These measures are part of a package worth &#163;80 million. Customs and Excise estimate that the cost of the reduced VAT rate for work on converting residential properties into a different number of dwelling units will be around &#163;70 million and that the cost of the adjustment to the zero-rate of VAT for the sale of refurbished vacant dwellings could be around &#163;10 million in 2001-02. Inland Revenue estimate that the cost of the measure giving tax relief for the costs of converting redundant space over commercial premises into flats for letting will be negligible in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="10110w08.html_para2">Customs will not need extra staff to assure the package of measures for property conversions. The tax relief for converting flats over shops will exclude high value properties. The VAT proposals in the package will not, but their main benefit will be to smaller families, single people and the less well-off, by encouraging the creation of a greater number of good quality and relatively affordable homes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10110w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I am writing today to the Chairman of the Service Authority for the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and National Crime Squad (NCS) to inform him of my decision on the proposals for increases in the levy for the two organisations.
<P>

<a name="10110w09.html_para2">In reaching my decision, I have taken into account the proposals put to me by the Service Authority, as well as representations made to me by the Association of Police Authorities, Association of Chief Police Officers and others as part of the process of consultation over the levy proposals. I have considered all this against the background of the overall settlement for the police service, from which the levy for the two organisations is funded. I have also taken account of the funding which NCIS and NCS receive from other sources.
<P>

<a name="10110w09.html_para3">I have decided to award an increase of &#163;5.33 million or 4.9 per cent. to the NCS in line with the average police settlement for England and Wales. This increases the levy for 2001-02 to &#163;114.05 million.
<P>

<a name="10110w09.html_para4">In the case of NCIS, I have taken particular account of the increasing importance which good quality intelligence plays in fighting the criminal organisations behind much of the serious criminal activity in the United Kingdom; and the vital role which NCIS plays in working with police forces, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and other organisations both nationally and internationally to tackle the problem. I have therefore decided to increase the NCIS levy by &#163;9.2 million to &#163;49.5 million in 2001-02, which amounts to an increase in the levy of 23 per cent.

 Ruth Wyner and John Brock were convicted under Section 8 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) because they failed to take reasonable steps to prevent drug dealing on the premises for which they were responsible. In upholding the convictions, the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge's summing up was fair and balanced and contained an accurate review of the evidence, including a faithful rehearsal of the appellants' denials that they were aware of the scale of the drug-dealing. The Court of Appeal noted that on the evidence before them, the jury could only have concluded that both appellants were aware of, or shut their eyes to, an obviously significant level of dealing. It would be quite wrong to amend the law to permit managers of premises, be they charity workers or not, to act in this way.

 The UK Government are working to help to achieve the International Development Target of a reduction by three quarters in maternal mortality by 2015. Significant progress is being made in much of Asia, but progress is slow in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV is a significant factor in increasing maternal mortality rates. Progress has also been slow because safe motherhood requires investment beyond primary health care, tackling health, education, transport and gender.

<a name="10110w10.html_para3">DFID is taking a leadership role in supporting comprehensive, multi-sectoral Government-led safe motherhood programmes in Malawi and Nepal. More work is planned in Tanzania and Kenya. We are encouraging other bilateral and multilateral donors to include maternal health as a key component of health sector strengthening packages, using World Health Organisation standards for better pregnancy care.

 The UK worked closely with many others in the international community last year, to achieve--and exceed--our target on implementing the HIPC Initiative. By the end of 2000, 22 countries had qualified for debt relief. We will continue to work with others to secure the full implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. However, many of the remaining countries are affected by conflict. These countries need to establish peace in order to make a commitment to poverty reduction, and to qualify for HIPC relief.

<a name="10110w10.html_para4">Ensuring that debt relief benefits the poor is central to the HIPC Initiative. We are working closely with a number of HIPC countries on their national poverty reduction strategies, which will provide a framework for all development resources, including debt relief savings.

 I am pleased to report that 22 countries have qualified for exceptional debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, exceeding our target of 20 countries qualifying by end of 2000. This has resulted in over $50 billion in debt relief being agreed for these countries, which will reduce their debts by almost two-thirds on average. We hope that a number of other countries will qualify for relief this year, but for many of the remaining HIPC countries conflict is a major barrier to making substantial further progress.

 In our White Paper on making globalisation work for the poor, published on 11 December 2000, we announced that from 1 April 2001, all UK development assistance will be untied.
<P>

<a name="10110w11.html_para3">Improving the effectiveness of development assistance is essential if we are to reduce the proportion of people living in absolute poverty. This means helping developing countries to establish and implement poverty reduction policies, finding ways of overcoming critical constraints and ceasing to finance projects that have no strategic impact. It also means donors working closely together and ending inefficient practices. Aid tying is a notable example. Donors must also develop common procedures to reduce the administrative burden on recipient governments.
<P>

<a name="10110w11.html_para4">Ring-fencing contracts for national suppliers not only reduces the value of aid by around 25 per cent. but is also grossly inefficient and inhibits efforts to integrate donor strategies and procedures. By untying we will be able to make better use of resources available to tackle poverty. Our action also strengthens our position in pressing vigorously for untying by others both in the OECD and in the European Union.

 Development assistance from the international community has contributed to economic development in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent years. As part of this wider effort the UK is working within the context of the Middle East Peace Process to support the building of a Palestinian nation that encourages economic and social development that benefits the poor. DFlD's support includes technical assistance to increase Palestinian capacity to negotiate with the Israelis on economic and other issues. Monitoring of initiatives by DFID and the Palestinian Authority have confirmed that this assistance is having a worthwhile impact. However, economic and social benefits are being eroded by the continuing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In a recent report the Office of the United Nations Special Co-ordinator has estimated that the confrontations, mobility restrictions and border closures are costing the Palestinian economy at least US$8 million per day.

 The new White Paper "Eliminating Poverty--making Globalisation work for the poor" stands alongside our first White Paper published in 1997. It reaffirms our commitment to the elimination of poverty and the achievement of the International Development Targets.

The future is not pre-determined. It is a matter of will and choice. The White Paper is designed to help mobilise a stronger international effort to systematically reduce poverty.

 There have been a number of welcome steps in recent months to improve the management and focus of EC development programmes.

These measures were essential to tackle the very poor performance of EC development programmes. But a great deal remains to be done before we see improved impact on the ground. We are working closely with the Commission and other member states to ensure that the reforms that have been agreed are implemented effectively.

 Helping to control the spread of HIV/AIDS in India is a high priority for my Department and we are committing substantial resources in this area. We are currently implementing three projects, at a total cost to DFID of &#163;37 million, through the Government of

<P><I>10 Jan 2001 : Column: 583W</I><P>
India's National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and through non-governmental organisations. Between them, these projects cover some of the worst affected areas in the country, and those most vulnerable to HIV. We are now urgently considering a proposal to channel all our support through NACO and to increase our commitment to &#163;80 million to support the second phase of the National Aids Control Programme.

<a name="10110w12.html_para7">In addition, contributions are made by the European Union, through the European Commission. The EC operates according to a calendar, rather than a financial year. In 2001, the EC plans to contribute 275.1 million euros, which is approximately &#163;168.6 million, to these three countries. The UK provides 19.6 per cent. of this contribution, which is approximately 53.9 million euros or &#163;33 million. Accordingly, the UK's contribution through the EC, in calendar year 2001, will be approximately 5 million euros (&#163;3.1 million) to Pakistan, 22.7 million euros (&#163;13.9 million) to India, 19.4 million euros (&#163;11.8 million) to Bangladesh, and 6.8 million euros (&#163;4.2 million) for regional economic co-operation in all three countries.

<a name="10110w12.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The global eradication of polio is achievable by 2005. The UK has contributed around &#163;165 million towards this end since 1995, and this has directly contributed to a significant fall in the incidence of polio. We are now in the final phase, which requires intensified efforts to interrupt transmission in all remaining reservoir countries by 2002, and subsequent surveillance to ensure certification of eradication by 2005. I have recently agreed &#163;35 million in support of the World Health Organisation's final eradication effort. This is aimed at the areas of greatest need and at catalysing support from other donors.
