<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We are committed to constructing a compensation scheme that is effective and properly meets the needs of those affected. Discussions are under way with the legal representatives of the families affected. In the meantime we will be making interim payments of &#163;25,000 when regulations have been put in place to ensure the payments are not taken into account in the calculation of income-related social security benefits and are exempted from the provisions of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997. We intend to present this legislation to Parliament as soon as possible. Details of the full compensation package are still under consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on UK aid to North Korea.  [150311]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UK has provided humanitarian assistance in North Korea by channelling modest and well-targeted contributions through UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations--over &#163;2.5 million since 1998. The programmes we support have primarily focused on agricultural rehabilitation and food security. In addition, the UK share of humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the EC was approximately &#163;0.5 million in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="10214w01.html_para0">Our engagement with North Korea through provision of humanitarian assistance has been instrumental in opening the country up to external influences. It has allowed us to maintain a dialogue with the North Korean authorities on issues of concern such as human rights abuse, the misappropriation of aid, and the problems of

<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Brahimi report makes a number of fundamental recommendations on improving the way the UN and the international community tackle peacekeeping, conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and on clarifying the mandates of UN agencies involved in tackling crises and conflict situations. The UK is very supportive of the Brahimi report and is working with the UN and other member states to take rapid and decision action on its speedy and effective implementation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will calculate the extra cost if state retirement pensions had been linked to earnings since 1997.  [149082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 If our policy had been only to link the basic pension to earnings we would have spent &#163;5.2 billion less over a five-year period. Instead we will have spent an estimated &#163;8.5 billion extra in the five years since 1997-98 as a result of our discretionary measures for pensioners. This is over &#163;5 billion more than uprating the basic state pension by earnings since April 1998.

2. Sure Start Maternity Grant replaced the Social Fund Maternity Payment from 27 March 2000 for confinements/adoptions on or after 11 June 2000. The Social Fund Maternity Payment was &#163;100 per child and the Sure Start Maternity Grant was initially &#163;200 per child. This was increased to &#163;300 for babies due, born or adopted from 3 December 2000. The amount of the SFMP or SSMG is reduced on a pound for pound basis by any savings over &#163;500 held by an applicant or partner (&#163;1,000 for applicants aged 60 or over).<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many modified sub-post offices there are and how many are run by interim sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  [150259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I understand from the Post Office that at the end of the third quarter of its current financial year, there were 655 modified sub-post offices. Of these, 33 were, at that date operated through temporary agents as a result of the resignation or termination of contract of the previous agent. In all such cases, the Post Office seeks to avoid any break in service and to ensure that standards of service are maintained until a new permanent agent can be appointed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Page: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many sub-post office closures there were in the third quarter of 2000; and how many closures there were in total up to the end of that quarter in 2000. [148213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2001]:</i> 135 sub-post offices closed in the third quarter of the financial year 2000-01. Between April and December 2000 closures totalled 434, of which four are permanent following consultations under the Code of Practice. The figures reflect a snapshot position on one single day and many of these closures will be of a temporary nature only. The Government recognise that this is a serious issue for the communities concerned and a range of measures will be implemented in the near future to address it. Recent research by the Post office into the reasons for sub-postmasters' resignations makes clear that personal circumstances, such as retirement and health, are the main reasons for resigning. Fewer than 10 per cent. cite financial reasons.

 Claimants in the Leicestershire region are most likely to attend centres in Coventry, Nottingham or Cannock. For claimants in the South Derbyshire region, the centres at Nottingham, Mansfield and Chesterfield are usually suggested. To date, these centres have assessed through the full Medical Assessment Process, MAP, over 1,300 claimants, with a further 511 appointments made.

However, claimants are given the option to attend a different centre if a more suitable time is available. For those claimants who are not able to travel to a centre, and have a letter from their doctor, Healthcall carries out home visits.

 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2001]:</i> An initial consultation visit under the Farm Business Advice Service, which is being delivered for MAFF by the Small Business Service, is conducted by a Farm Business Adviser (FBA) and lasts approximately half a day. The FBA will look round the farm and discuss with the farmer the way the business is run and managed, financial matters and the aspirations for the business of the farmer and his/her family. Information required to undertake a business health check and to prepare a current farm balance sheet will be collected, which the farmer will normally have been forewarned to have ready, to help the FBA prepare an action plan following the initial visit.

<a name="10214w05.html_para6">However, the number of laden tankers over 10,000 gross tonnage using the Minch route remains low and only 18 were recorded during 2000. In the majority of these cases, the reason given by the vessel's master and accepted by the MCA was forecast adverse weather in the deep-water route to the west of the Outer Hebrides. Where there appears to be no justification for using the Minch, MCA contacts the vessel's operators for an explanation.
<P>

<a name="10214w05.html_para7">On occasions where large laden tankers do use the Minch, the Minch Emergency Towing Vessel (ETV) endeavours to escort such laden tankers to minimise any risk involved. At present, the ETV is on station in the Minch during the winter months only (October-March), but, with effect from October 2001, there will be ETV cover all year round.
<P>

<a name="10214w05.html_para8">With the phased introduction of automatic identification systems (AIS) under the revision of Chapter V of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, all tankers on international voyages must have such equipment fitted not later than the first annual safety equipment survey after 1 July 2003, unless they are scheduled to be scrapped within two years of the implementation date. This requirement should further enhance the level of reporting in this particular area.

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment was undertaken of the then proposed Waste Incineration Directive, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has since commissioned a study by ADAS Consulting to assess more accurately how many small animal carcase incinerators are in operation. A preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment was issued by MAFF last November for the draft EU Animal By-Products Regulation. In addition, AEA Technology has been commissioned by MAFF to measure emissions at a representative sample of small animal waste incinerators to provide a firm basis for determining proportionate standards. MAFF will be making available the two studies when they are completed, subject to commercial confidentiality considerations.

 This is an operational matter for local planning authorities' own discretion. The Local Government Association's "Probity in Planning" includes guidelines for officer reports to planning committees.

 There is no centrally-prescribed method for recording breaches of codes of conduct.

 It is for applicants to decide when to make a formal planning application to the local planning authority. This may or may not follow pre-application discussions. All applications made to an authority are recorded in that authority's planning register. The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 requires local planning authorities to give an applicant notice of their decision within eight

<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w06.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, all planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan for the area unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972, as amended, provides for planning applications to be determined by an officer on behalf of the council, in accordance with clearly stated and published rules. Elected members decide the policies in the development plan and determine the framework of other policies, standards and guidance within which applications are considered. Elected members also set the terms of any delegation agreement, including the circumstances in which an officer's delegated power to make a decision may not be exercised. The Local Government Association's "Development Control: Delegation Arrangements" advises that common exceptions to delegated powers will be applications which are contrary to the policies in the development plan for the area and contrary to approved council policies.

<P>

<a name="10214w07.html_para0">Most of the differences reflect revisions to UK energy projections made following the consultation process described in Energy Paper 68 (see section 1.2, page 8). The main factor influencing the projection for 2000 is a lower expectation of nuclear output together with a higher coal burn. In subsequent years higher power station emissions are outweighed by lower emissions from industry and refineries. Industrial emissions are projected to be lower than previously estimated partly due to lower estimated emissions from offshore activity. Projected emissions from land use change have also been revised downward slightly because of methodological improvements and minor updates resulting from emissions data in the latest greenhouse gas inventory. Provisional data on actual emissions in 2000 will be available in March.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> The European Commission is currently drafting a document in order to clarify the borderline between the Biocidal Products Directive and the Cosmetics Directive. An expert working group that includes experts from member states (including the UK) and industry has discussed it. The working document is being modified and a final version has yet to be put formally to member states for comment. It is anticipated that member states will discuss a final draft next month.

 A review of UK emergency towing provision has now been completed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and recommends that the current winter-only arrangements for UK provision in the South West Approaches, Dover Strait, Minch, and Fair Isle should be increased to all-year-round cover. I have accepted this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="10214w08.html_para0">The new arrangements will start from 1 October this year, with the exception of the Dover Strait, which will commence earlier on 1 April. The Dover Strait provision builds on the partnership arrangements introduced last year with our French maritime colleagues.
<P>

<a name="10214w08.html_para1">The report also considered emergency towing provision for the Irish Sea and St. George's Channel area. Although the report concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support an emergency towing vessel for the area on an all-year-round basis by the UK alone, it recommends that provision could be made in partnership with the Government of Ireland. I have accepted this recommendation, dependent upon the Irish Government providing an emergency towing vessel in which the UK Government can share. A dialogue will be maintained with the Irish Government.
<P>

<a name="10214w08.html_para2">These improvements to the UK emergency towing vessel provision are good news for the safety of the UK environment and the seagoing community, and demonstrate this Government's commitment to preventing maritime pollution.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2001]:</i> In pursuing a very innovative New Deal for Disabled People it is important to evaluate how effective the programme is in bringing people on incapacity benefit into work. The most robust methodology available is one based on random assignment and this will be used to evaluate the NDDP national extension. Once the programme is established one in five clients who register with job brokers will be allocated to a control group and have their eligibility deferred. The deferral period will last for 12 months, after which time members of the control group will be invited to take part in the NDDP extension.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2001]:</i> The Department for Education and Employment funds both the Aiding Communication in Education (ACE) Centre (North) and the Aiding Communication in Education (ACE) Centre Advisory Trust through the British Education Communications and Technology Agency.
<P>

<a name="10214w09.html_para1">We are currently working with the ACE Centre (North) to support its transition to charitable status. We will continue to support the valuable work of these centres in providing services for children and young people who use communication aids.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what take-up there has been of the entitlement to paid educational leave for 16 to 17-year-olds since it was introduced; what the estimated cost has been to <i>(a)</i> state and <i>(b)</i> private employers; and if he will make a statement.  [149611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. The right to time off for study or training is employment legislation which protects and encourages 16 and 17-year-old employees who have not already achieved level 2 qualifications as defined by the regulations. At the end of 1999, there were an estimated 100,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England in employment but not qualified to level 2, and not working towards a level 2 qualification.

<a name="10214w09.html_para2">Evidence from our initial evaluation (DfEE Research Report RR221 "Time Off for Study or Training: Preliminary Evaluation of the Implementation of the Employment Right") suggests that the right has stimulated activity to promote training to young people, and has had a positive effect on recruitment into modern apprenticeships, but this remains difficult to quantify.

 The Quality Assurance Agency assesses the quality of teaching in higher education institutions; and the research assessment exercises of the Higher Education Funding Council for England look at both the volume and quality of research. However, there is no direct measure of the productivity of higher education teaching staff.

[150063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Core funding of &#163;23 million has been allocated for education business link (EBL) activity in 2001-02. The funding will go via the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), which will contract with consortiums in each of the local LSC areas for delivery of education business links. Of this &#163;23 million, &#163;9.8 million is for work experience placements for Key Stage 4 pupils; and &#163;1.8 million is for professional development placements for teachers. In addition, the LSC will be able to make allocations from its discretionary local initiatives fund (&#163;90.3 million in total) to support EBL activity.
<P>

<a name="10214w09.html_para3">It is estimated that in 2000-01 training and enterprise councils (TECs) provided discretionary support of &#163;17 million in total to EBL organisations.

<P>
<a name="10214w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his answer of 7 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 579W, what arrangements will be made to allocate unique pupil numbers to pupils in England who <i>(a)</i> commence their

education in the non-maintained sector and <i>(b)</i> move between maintained and non-maintained sectors during their school career.  [150086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10214w10.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department is discussing with the Independent Schools Council the possibility of the unique pupil number (UPN) system being extended to pupils in independent schools, although no decisions have yet been taken. For as long as it remains the case that UPNs are allocated only to pupils in the maintained sector: <i>(a)</i> pupils who commence their education in the non-maintained sector will not during that period have a UPN, but will be allocated one by the first maintained school they enter;
<P>

<a name="10214w10.html_para0"><i>(b)</i> pupils who move between maintained and non-maintained sectors during their school career should be allocated a UPN at the beginning of their first spell in the maintained sector and retain that for each subsequent spell, even though the UPN will be inactive during intervening periods in the non-maintained sector. There is inevitably a risk in these cases of the thread being lost, and new UPNs being allocated to pupils who already have one. However, the central pupil database described in my earlier answer, 7 February 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 579W, (ref. 148383) will, once established, be able to provide LEAs and schools with a "tracing service" for lost UPNs.

In total, since 1997, Norfolk local education authority has received some &#163;55.559 million of funding for capital investment in school buildings.

 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2001]:</i> The Department has had no discussions with other Departments relating to the evasion of work permit regulations by overseas footballers wishing to play professionally in the UK. The Home Office is responsible for deciding whether overseas nationals may enter the country to work based on the passport they hold or whether they require a work permit.

<P>

<a name="10214w11.html_para1">The information on detective numbers has been provided by Her Majesty's Inspectorate. The inspectorate made changes to its classification system for different police functions in 1999-2000. It is not therefore possible to identify from the new classification the number of officers that would have been classified as Criminal Investigation Department (CID) under the old rules and who are now recorded under other classifications. The change in classification accounts for some of the reduction in CID strength. The information in the tables has therefore been provided on the basis of non-CID officer numbers and CID officer numbers for March 1997 and March 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the compatibility of the systematic detention of asylum seekers coming directly from their country of origin or an unsafe third country with the 1951 UN convention on refugees and the 1999 UNHCR guidelines on applicable criteria and standards relating to the detention of asylum seekers; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> Detention of asylum seekers is used as a last resort and no one is detained simply because he or she has claimed asylum. However, detention may be appropriate in the following circumstances; in order to establish identity or basis of claim; where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the subject will fail to comply with the terms of temporary admission or release; or where removal is imminent.

 All asylum applications, regardless of the applicant's nationality, are considered in accordance with the criteria set out in the 1951 United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees. To qualify for asylum a person must be outside his/her country of nationality and have a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social

Those who meet these criteria are granted asylum; those who do not meet the requirements of the 1951 convention may nevertheless be granted exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom if there are exceptional compelling humanitarian reasons why they should not be required to leave.

<a name="10214w12.html_para5">Those who do not qualify for asylum or exceptional leave to remain and have no other basis on which to remain are required to leave the United Kingdom.

<a name="10214w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 introduced new support arrangements for asylum seekers. Under these new arrangements all new eligible destitute asylum seekers may be supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). This support is mainly in kind and includes accommodation where requested. Asylum seekers whose claims have been finally determined as unfounded are not eligible for NASS support. However, families with children under the age of 18 will be supported by NASS until they leave the country.

Effective delivery of the strategy at local level is essential if we are to succeed. In support of this, we are realigning Drug Action Teams along local authority boundaries. This means that Slough now has its own DAT. This should help address local priorities such as outreach services for young misusers; and develop better links with other outer-London Boroughs, which are far more similar in terms of drug and social exclusion issues, than the majority of Berkshire.
