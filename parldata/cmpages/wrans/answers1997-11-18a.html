 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met the United Kingdom Sports Council on 14 November and agreed the basis on which the competition will be completed. I have arranged for copies of his announcement and the paper which was considered at that meeting to be placed in the Library. I expect an announcement on the location of the United Kingdom Sports Institute to be made before Christmas. Team sports will be embraced by the Institute. The distribution of training facilities for team sports between the Headquarters, sports specific institutes, and network institutes, will be decided over time with the governing bodies concerned.

 There have been three minor accidents, involving three people in all, since construction started at the dome site. None of the incidents were classed as "major" injuries under RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries; Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995). Although all those involved were back at work within a week or less, all three incidents were reported to the HSE as the time off work in each case exceeded three days.

 We support the broad intentions of the important human rights standards contained in these United Nations texts. The United Kingdom joined consensus on their adoption. However, these instruments are not legally binding. As their wording shows, they are recommendatory in nature. There is therefore no mechanism by which States can become party to them.

The majority of London local authorities have adopted licensing powers which enable them to set licensing conditions, including the qualifications of persons offering cosmetic body piercing. Local authorities outside London do not have similar powers. In October 1996, the Department consulted on a proposal to give local authorities outside London powers to control cosmetic body piercing businesses. We are currently considering the outcome of the consultation exercise.

 <i>[holding answer 17 November 1997]:</i> It is not possible to be sure of the effect for the UK's abatement without making further hypothetical assumptions, since a range of other factors could influence the outcome. For example, if there were a transfer of provision to another programme within the Community Budget from which the UK were to gain equal benefit, there would be no consequences for the amount of out abatement. Any effect would however be reflected in the abatement only in respect of the following year.

Increased sampling in the June and December surveys, together with use of administrative data, will save on the issue of over 25,000 forms this year. About 25 per cent. of farmers contacted in the June 1997 census received a simpler form.

 The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No. 731) require that animals are stunned so that there is immediate loss of consciousness which lasts until death. This applies to the slaughter of all animals other than when, for reasons of religion, slaughter is carried out without prior stunning. Information is not held separately on the numbers of animals killed without prior stunning by the Jewish or Muslim methods.

 Our records show that 112 radioactive miss-distance indicators were dumped in the Holyhead Deep in the second half of 1974. The Ministry of Defence has advised that the dumpings took place on 14-15 August 1974. The disposals were authorised by the Ministry of Defence and the records show that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was informed. I am advised that these disposals do not have any significance for human health or the environment. Nevertheless, as I explained in my earlier reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), I have passed the details to the National Radiological Protection Board for an independent assessment, the results of which I expect to announce shortly. I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the one original archive document identified by this Department which relates to these disposals.

Speed cameras are particularly good at reducing vehicle speeds in some circumstances. Twenty one cameras placed on roads in West London have shown a 70 per cent. reduction in fatal accidents between 1992 and 1995. A Home Office study of cameras in 10 police forces undertaken between November 1995 and March 1996 showed that accidents reduced by 28 per cent. and average speeds by 4 mph at speed camera sites. However, the effects of cameras are localised, so we recommend that they are used at sites with a history of speed related accidents where they can successfully reduce the likelihood of further incidents.

A Home Office study of cameras in 10 police forces undertaken between November 1995 and March 1996 showed a 28 per cent. drop in accidents and a 4 mph reduction in speed at camera sites.

The Health and Safety Executive is of the opinion that effective control of medium density fibreboard (MDF) dust, coupled with good general ventilation, will adequately control exposure to formaldehyde vapour. British Standards restrict the amount of formaldehyde that can be used in making medium density fibreboard. An HSE survey monitoring exposure to formaldehyde during the machining of MDF has found levels to be substantially below the current maximum exposure limit for formaldehyde. Low or zero formaldehyde emission board use other binding resins which may contain hazardous components.

<P>
<a name="71118w13.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions recognises that children, especially pedestrians, are a particularly vulnerable group of road users and as such are a road safety priority. Road safety education both inside and outside school is an integral part of our approach to reducing road accidents amongst children complementing publicity, enforcement and engineering measures.




<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1997 : Column: 135</I><P>

My Department works closely with local authority road safety professionals, voluntary and commercial organisations and other Government Departments to encourage road safety education. In 1995, the Department produced Good Practice Guidelines for Road Safety Education in Schools and we are, at present, carrying out a review of the provision of road safety education in schools throughout Great Britain.
Despite a good overall road safety record, Great Britain has a relatively poor child pedestrian safety record. Research has shown that practical approaches to child pedestrian training, in small groups at the roadside, are the most effective at improving child pedestrian skills. My Department has used this approach to develop and evaluate two practical child pedestrian training schemes--"Let's Decide Walkwise" and "Kerbcraft". In addition this Department and the Department of Health have jointly funded the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to produce a video resource--Step Forward--to encourage schools and adult volunteers to participate in local authority pedestrian training schemes.
The Government are committed to reducing car dependency, and in particular, the number of children being driven to school. We are supportive of projects which encourage children to walk and cycle in safety and take the bus to school. The DETR is currently funding research in this area. We are also providing capital resources to a number of local authority transport packages which include safer routes to schools projects. The current fundamental review of transport will be examining journeys to school in conjunction with other Government Departments.

<P>
<a name="71118w13.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
The Department's Cycle Safe campaign includes the production of posters and educational literature which promote the wearing of cycle helmets. Publicity is distributed to local Road Safety Officers, teachers and the police. Advice to wear helmets is contained in the Highway Code and the Highway Code for Young Road Users. One million copies of the Young Road Users Code are distributed free each year to schools.
We encourage local authorities to co-ordinate what they are doing on cycle safety publicity with the Department's campaign so that the messages are reinforced. We will continue to review ways of promoting the wearing of cycle helmets and wearing rate surveys will be made to determine the success of local and national campaigns.

Each year both the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the voluntary agencies work closely with the Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (PACE), and other Government Departments, to identify suitable buildings from the Government estate for use as winter shelters for rough sleepers. It is particularly important to locate suitable buildings which will ensure a wide geographical spread of winter shelters.
We are currently assessing the bids we have received from the voluntary sector for funding to manage winter shelters as part of the Rough Sleepers Initiative and will make an announcement shortly on the bids which have been successful.

<P>
<a name="71118w13.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
The Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 requires local authorities to implement strategies for improving domestic energy efficiency in all sectors by 30 per cent. over a 10-15 year period. The Government and Energy Saving Trust will continue to support them in this through pump-priming assistance for innovative approaches, and through disseminating advice and best practice. The Trust has also established an energy efficiency programme, involving all sectors of the industry in providing financial incentives, information and advice for householders, and a comprehensive training package for installers and retailers.
Over 2.5 million low-income, disabled and elderly households have been helped to improve their homes through grants under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme. We will continue to build on this in tackling fuel poverty through a range of policies. Energy conservation has been specified as a priority area in the design of the Environmental Task Force option of the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds, and in the capital receipts initiative for local authorities.
Our current review of the Housing Fitness Standard includes consideration of how best to incorporate energy efficiency requirements. We have also just initiated a review of Part L of the Building Regulations, which deals with energy efficiency of new homes. The aim of the review is to establish the maximum possible contribution that can be made by the Regulations to the Government's target of a 20 per cent. reduction on 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by the year 2010, whilst observing proportionality and flexibility for designers, and avoiding

unreasonable technical risks or excessive cost. The review will be wide ranging, encompassing not just homes, but non-domestic buildings as well.

Local authorities already give grants for repairs to owner occupiers. Renovation grant under Part I of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 is available at the authority's discretion for making property fit and for other works of repair or improvement which go beyond making a property fit. Such grants are subject to a means test. Under separate provisions, certain classes of defective properties, designated as defective under sections 528 or 559 of the Housing Act 1985, are eligible for assistance under Part XVI of that Act. However, works to address the defects in such properties are not eligible for grant under the 1996 Act.

The saving in benefit subsidies previously paid to local authorities in respect of these highest levels of care will be applied within Class XII, Vote 2, to underwrite the compensation scheme and will be paid on an extra-statutory basis.

<a name="71118w15.html_para4">The Secretary of State for Scotland has asked me to reply to your two Questions about Forestry Commission land which was offered for sale during 1996 and in 1997 (before and after 1 May) and which we are considering for sale.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I therefore enclose a list of Forest Land which was first offered for sale on the Open Market between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1996 and 1 January 1997 and 19 March 1997. On 19 March 1997 all Forestry Commission sales were suspended during the General Election. After the Election the Government placed a Moratorium on all Forestry Commission forest land sales in accordance with the Manifesto Commitment. Consequently no forest land has been offered on the open market after 19 March 1997, and we are not considering the sale of any forest land.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he has taken legal advice on the Local Government Act 1988 (Competition) (Scotland) Regulations 1997, S.I. 1997, No. 197, following the reporting of these Regulations by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on the ground that they may be ultra vires (16th Report, HC29-xvi, Session 1996-97); and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 13 November 1997]:</i> The Local Government Act 1988 (Competition) (Scotland) Regulations 1997, S.I. 1997, No. 197, which were made by the previous Secretary of State, have no practical effect at present. Amendments were made to them by S.I. 1997/1436. This is part of the continuing moratorium on Compulsory Competitive Tendering in Scotland while a Best Value regime is being developed. The Government will re-examine these regulations if CCT under the Local Government Act 1988 has to be reimposed on any Scottish council.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 1997]:</i> The Scottish Office provides a block grant for teaching in higher education to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. SHEFC funding supports about 118,000 full-time equivalent places in Scottish higher education institutions. These places are filled by students from any part of the European Union, including Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and the provision includes among other things all years of the Scottish first degree courses, including the fourth year of Scottish Honours courses. Broadly speaking, the funding from the Scottish Office for the fourth year of English, Welsh and Northern Irish students is about &#163;15 million.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You will recall from my reply to your earlier question about the ocular effects of mustard gas that case reports from the United States suggest that doses of between 400 and 800 milligrams per cubic metre per minute of mustard vapour result in corneal damage with ulceration and scarring of the conjunctiva. As far as recurrent corneal ulcerative disease is concerned, it has been reported that some individuals who experience acute eye injuries following exposure to high doses of mustard gas, particularly with liquid contamination of the eye, may exhibit clinical eye problems after their initial injuries have subsided. Sometimes recurrent and persistent corneal ulceration may occur after latent periods.

Before that date, however, where a court-martial had found an accused guilty, he was able to submit a petition to the Defence Council asking for a review of finding and/or sentence. If an applicant was granted the relief he sought at this stage there was no case to go forward to the CMAC. However, Service personnel were able to appeal to the CMAC against finding and sentence but not against sentence only. Since 1 April this year, the Reviewing Authority now automatically reviews all cases, whether a petition is submitted or not. Additionally, Service personnel can now appeal to the CMAC against finding and/or sentence.

<a name="71118w17.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The decision to increase the minimum age for eligibility for Boarding School Allowance was made by the previous Administration in response to the recommendations made in Sir Michael Bett's review of Armed Forces pay and allowances. These recommendations were made in light of the recognition that, whilst excessive turbulence can damage a child's educational progress, it was also recognised that some degree of mobility need not be harmful. A list of the organisations and agencies consulted during the review are listed in Sir Michael's report to the then Secretary of State for Defence, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="71118w17.html_para2">Service personnel and other interested parties were informed of the changes in the regulations through the publication of the Information Document issued in February of this year. This publication was accompanied by an announcement by the then Minister for the Armed Forces, and the changes were also given wide publicity through the normal Service channels. It is the responsibility of individual parents to inform schools if the change in regulations is likely to affect the attendance of their children at school.
<P>

<a name="71118w17.html_para3">The amended regulations will come into force on 1 December 1997. There are no plans to postpone the implementation date.
<P>

<a name="71118w17.html_para4">Parents who are currently in receipt of BSA in respect of children under the age of eight will retain reserved rights to the allowance and will not , therefore, be directly affected by the change in the regulations. There are currently 80 children between the age of five and seven whose parents are claiming BSA, and the majority of these are either welfare cases or cases involving children with special educational needs. It is our policy that cases in these categories will continue to be viewed sympathetically. In view of the small number of children in the affected age group, and as many of these are receiving BSA for welfare reasons, the withdrawal of entitlement to BSA for children aged less than eight will have a marginal impact on public spending, and it is not 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1997 : Column: 151</I><P>
anticipated that the changes will have any significant effect on recruitment and retention levels in the Armed Forces.
<P>

<a name="71118w17.html_para5">Service parents who believe that they fall into a category that warrants special consideration may seek advice in preparing their application from their unit administrative staff, who will have experience of preparing such cases; from the Service Childrens' Education agency--an organisation tasked specifically with the educational needs of Service children; and from the personnel and welfare staffs of the three Services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the total cost to his Department of boarding school allowance for the academic year 1996-97 together with the total average number of children for whom boarding school allowance was claimed in that year and the average number of children whose parent is of <i>(a)</i> officer and <i>(b)</i> other rank; and if he will place in the Library a copy of the current admissible schools list. [16365]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w17.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 November 1997]:</i> Costs for Boarding School Allowance are not held centrally for academic years. However the total cost to my Department of Boarding School Allowance in financial year 1996-97 was &#163;87.5 million. The total average number of children for whom the allowance was claimed in the same year was 9,833, of whom 6,538 were the children of officers and 3,295 were the children of other ranks.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w17.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the future of the boarding school allowance. [16361]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w17.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer Monday 17 November 1997]:</i> My Department remains committed to the principle of providing a stable educational environment for the children of Armed Forces personnel. Boarding School Allowance is a central part of this provision and we remain confident that payment of this allowance is an effective way of ensuring continuity of education for the children of personnel who are subject to frequent postings throughout their Service careers.
<P>

<a name="71118w17.html_para6">With effect from 1 December 1997 certain changes will be introduced to the way in which BSA is regulated. These will help to target the allowance more accurately at those members of the Armed Forces who most need support in providing a stable education for their children. These changes were introduced in response to the recommendations made in Sir Michael Bett's report on pay and allowances in the Armed Forces, and were originally announced in the Information Document published by the previous administration in February of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much was paid in compensation to the Ministry of Defence in 1995 by Textron Lycoming in connection with the manufacture and supply of fully automated digital engine control systems for RAF Chinook helicopters. [14782]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence had no claim against, and therefore in 1995 received no money in compensation from, Textron Lycoming for the manufacture and supply of fully automated digital engine control systems for RAF Chinook Helicopters.




<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1997 : Column: 152</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71118w18.html_para0">However, compensation totalling just over $3 million was received from Textron Lycoming in November 1995 in respect of damage caused to an RAF Chinook HC Mk1 aircraft during development testing of a pre-production Full Authority Digital Electronic Control system.

<a name="71118w18.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the outcome of the case against Boeing brought by the Ministry of Defence in United States courts in connection with the manufacture and supply of fully automated digital engine control systems for RAF Chinook helicopters; and when the case was <i>(a)</i> commenced and <i>(b)</i> concluded. [14783]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence brought no case against Boeing in United States courts in connection with the manufacture and supply of fully automated digital engine control systems for RAF Chinook Helicopters.
<P>

<a name="71118w18.html_para1">However, an RAF Chinook HC Mk1 aircraft was damaged in January 1989 during development testing of a pre-production Full Authority Digital Electronic Control system. The Ministry of Defence held that both Boeing and Textron Lycoming were responsible. A settlement was made by Being as a discount on a separate contract placed in September 1993.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what independent assessment was made, and by whom, of the performance and reliability of the software used in 1994 on RAF Chinook helicopters including aircraft ZD 576; and what were the conclusions and recommendations. [14779]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 FADEC software was subjected to an independent review by EDS Scicon Ltd. in July 1993. This review was commissioned because A&AEE, Boscombe Down (now part of DERA) was concerned with the method of software qualification used by the FADEC Design Authority, Textron Lycoming.
<P>

<a name="71118w18.html_para2">EDS Scicon were contracted to verify the software using a State Code Analysis (SCA) technique recommended by Boscombe Down. However, the contracted software documentation was not amenable to such analysis, so the work stopped after only 17 per cent. of the code had been reviewed; 485 observations were made, but none was considered safety critical and most related to errors in the documentation. The EDS final report did not make recommendations.
<P>

<a name="71118w18.html_para3">In October 1993, EDS Scicon made preliminary proposals to carry out a limited rewrite of the software to make it more compatible with SCA verification. This proposal was not accepted, but to satisfy Boscombe Down's concerns and provide improved maintainability for any future update of the software code, the Ministry of Defence decided to re-document the software to make it suitable for SCA. Textron Lycoming were contracted on a shared cost basis and the software re-documentation work was eventually completed in 1996.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many incident signals have been issued relating to the fully automated digital engine control system on Chinook Mark II aircraft since they were introduced into squadron service with the RAF. [14780]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Incident Signals are raised for both ground and air incidents. Some incidents may be spurious; that is to say a fault is indicated in some way which has not actually occurred; some may occur through use other than as recommended by the Aircraft Design Authority; some will be unconfirmed, which is to say no faults found on a subsequent examination; and some will be due to system faults.
<P>

<a name="71118w18.html_para4">With regard to the Chinook HC Mk2; there have been a total of 519 Incident Signals, of which 70 have been FADEC related. Of those FADEC related signals, seven were spurious, 24 arose through carrying out engine overspeed tests other than as designed, three were unconfirmed, and 36 were attributed to system faults. Of the 36 attributed faults, 14 were due to mechanical failure, five were due to electrical failure and 17 were software faults.

This is in line with experience here.

 We have no plans to do so. We encourage schools and other educational establishments to decide their won policies, bearing in mind the needs of both the students and staff. An increasing number of schools already prohibit smoking entirely on their premises, or limit it to a designated area for all teachers, non-teaching staff and visitors. Research conducted this year by Ofsted, via a questionnaire sent to 1,500 schools, found that 88 per cent. of primary schools and 79 per cent. of secondary schools already have no-smoking policies in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what was the cost to the National Health Service in the last year for which figures are available of providing health care for people suffering from hearing difficulties, separately identifying the cost of providing hearing aids. [15677]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71118w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The National Health Service does not collect figures for the health care costs of people with hearing loss or for the cost of providing hearing aids. However, we know that more than half a million hearing aids per year are purchased from the NHS Supplies Authority. Audiology departments also purchase some hearing aids from commercial suppliers.

 We have not issued any guidance on this subject. We would expect that where professional sportspeople turn to the National Health Service for treatment the priority they are given will depend on their clinical and other needs compared with those of other patients waiting for treatment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w22.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Royal College of Nursing briefing paper "The Cost of Continence" provides a useful summary of the problems experienced by people who are incontinent and the social, psychological and financial costs of this distressing condition. I have already had a brief discussion about the report with Christine Hancock, the General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, and officials of the Department of Health would be happy to meet RCN officials for further discussion.
<P>

<a name="71118w22.html_para0">The &#163;269 million additional funding for the National Health Service in England, which we have recently announced, is aimed partly at helped hospitals cope with medical emergencies, reducing delays in discharging patients and reducing the need for people to be admitted to hospital in the first place, for example by providing more specialist nursing and community services, such as continence services, for people--particularly older people--in their own homes. We are considering what further action it may be possible to take in this area.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w22.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have given a commitment to reimburse local authorities for their expenditure in supporting asylum seekers for the current year. Whether or not local authorities will need reimbursing in 1998-99 depends on both the outcome of the forthcoming House of Lords appeal against the Court of Appeal ruling that the National Assistance Act 1948 applies to adult asylum seekers, and on the outcome of the current cross-departmental review of the whole asylum process which will report early in the new year.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71118w22.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Three special grants will be made available to local authorities for 1997-98, subject to Parliamentary approval, in respect of their expenditure on support for asylum seeking: adults, families and unaccompanied children.

<a name="71118w22.html_para1">For adult asylum seekers, local authorities will be able to claim their full costs up to a limit of &#163;140 per week, averaged out over the year, for each asylum seeker supported. Local authorities will also be able to claim an additional &#163;10 per week for each asylum seeker accommodated in specially commissioned or re-commissioned premises.
<P>

<a name="71118w22.html_para2">For the Families with Children Grant, local authorities will be able to recover 80 per cent. of the additional cost above the threshold set in council tax band D. This is in recognition of the additional burden on local authorities as a consequence of a change in legislation. The grant

<P><I>18 Nov 1997 : Column: 174</I><P>
recognises that services for children and families have always formed a core part of social service functions, and so it would not be appropriate to meet costs in full. This grant will compensate local authorities for their additional costs.
<P>

<a name="71118w22.html_para3">Responsibilities for unaccompanied asylum seeking children and associated costs have fallen on a limited number of authorities. In recognition of these costs, a special grant of &#163;3 million will be made available to local authorities. The grant is intended as a contribution towards helping local authorities meet their spending on unaccompanied asylum seeking children and it was never intended that the Government would be responsible for meeting the full costs.

 Health authorities are responsible for determining the most appropriate balance of health services for their populations. However, we are currently examining national policy on effective service configurations, including the balance between acute hospital care and more community based services. The role of community hospitals is one element of a review of intermediate services currently being carried out by East Norfolk Health Authority. No short-term measures will be taken in respect of community hospitals in North Norfolk, which would prejudice debate on their longer-term future.

 In addition to carrying out their duties to advise and befriend care leavers, local authorities make use of their powers under the Children Act 1989 to provide individual care leavers with assistance in kind or in cash to supplement any income that the young person receives whilst in training, education, employment or from state benefits. The Government are aware, however, of the social exclusion experienced by many care leavers and consider that the question of providing cash or material assistance cannot be separated from issues of housing, education, training and employment and Income Support. These are all matters which the Government intend to address as part of preventing social exclusion and we have no plans at present to amend.
