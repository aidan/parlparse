<a name="80521w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Our Green Paper, "New Leadership for London" (Cm 3724), invited views on a range of proposals for an environmental role for the new Greater London Authority. Our White Paper, "A Mayor and Assembly for London" (Cm 3897), sets out our detailed proposals, taking into account consultation responses.
<P>

<a name="80521w01.html_para5">Under our proposals, the Greater London Authority will have extensive environmental responsibilities. It will be placed under a duty to promote the environmental, economic and social well being of Londoners. It will also be placed under a duty to promote sustainable development. The Mayor will also be placed under a duty to produce an air quality management strategic plan and an integrated municipal waste strategy for London, and to take action to promote efforts to reduce the impact of noise. The Mayor will have power to promote Local Agenda 21 and biodiversity within London. The Mayor will produce a report every four years on the state of the environment in London and, in consultation with the boroughs, will produce a further report every four years on the contribution made by London towards the Government's national programme for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The comparable figures for pedal cyclists were 881 and 611 for pedestrians. Motorcycle use, like other modes of transport, will be addressed in the Integrated Transport Policy White Paper.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what percentage of drivers randomly tested were found to be over the legal alcohol limit in the last year for which figures are available.  [42714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w02.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The police do not have powers to take breath samples from motorists on a random basis. Motorists may be breath tested following an accident, when they appear to have committed a moving traffic offence or where there is a suspicion of alcohol use.
<P>

<a name="80521w02.html_para0">In 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, 781,100 breath tests were administered in England and Wales and in 13 per cent. of those, either the test showed a positive (over the limit) reading or the driver refused to provide a sample.

<P>
<a name="80521w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his Department's policy on the amount of alcohol which may be safely consumed by those intending to drive; and if he will make a statement.  [42715]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The limit up to which a person can legally drive after consuming alcohol is 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. However, alcohol affects people in different ways according to factors such as the person's sex, body weight and whether food has been consumed. Even a small amount of alcohol can impair performance. The Department's advice, which is endorsed by its current drink-drive publicity campaign, is therefore not to drink and drive.

<a name="80521w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have no plans to change the existing arrangements under which motorway service area planning applications are dealt with in the same way as those for any other development. Applications which are called in for determination by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, or are the subject of an appeal by the intending developer, will normally be considered at a public inquiry before an independent Inspector. In such cases, the Inspector reports to my right hon. Friend who takes the final decision. In all other circumstances, the decision rests with the local planning authority.

We are considering whether there is any need to amend that advice but we have no plans to review the underlying policy that, within the constraints set by the spacing guidance, identification of specific sites for proposed new MSAs is a matter for the private sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress he has made in drawing up proposals to address the problem of fair rent increases affecting tenants under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1967 and the Rent Act 1977; and if he will make a statement.  [43437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Government are very concerned that private tenants with regulated tenancies and secure tenants of registered social landlords have faced exceptional rent increases in recent years. After market rents were introduced in 1989 for all new lettings, these tenants continued to have the protection of the fair rent system. However, they could never have anticipated the high level rent increases that some of them have faced. Many of them are elderly and on fixed incomes. They have planned their affairs on the basis that they would be able to remain in their present homes and are now faced with real financial difficulties. My Department is today issuing a public consultation paper setting out how we propose to tackle this problem.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para1">The proposals would apply to those private tenants and secure tenants of Registered Social Landlords who have a fair rent registered under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 or the Rent Act 1977. Increases would be limited by an Order made under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. The limits would be RPI plus 10% for the first re-registration after the Order comes into effect and RPI plus 5% for subsequent re-registrations. The limits would not apply if the rent had not previously been registered or a substantial increase in rent was due as a result of repairs or improvements by the landlord to the property. The limits would not apply to rent increases for assured and assured shorthold tenancies.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para2">Comments on the proposals are invited by 24 July. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Library. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales is issuing a similar consultation paper in Wales.

 I am pleased to announce the publication of an updated list of ferries operating to and from UK ports detailing the dates by which they must comply with the higher survivability standard specified in the Stockholm Agreement. We believe that it is important to continue to provide public information on ferry safety and will publish further lists when there are significant changes.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para3">Officials from my Department recently attended a conference hosted by the Swedish Government in Stockholm to consider the Report of the Joint Accident Investigation Commission of Estonia, Finland and Sweden into the loss of the ESTONIA in September 1994. The conference was a welcome initiative from the Swedish Government and I thank them for it. It considered whether or not international action since the ESTONIA tragedy had sufficiently addressed the Report's recommendations. It was agreed that most issues, particularly the potential problem of capsize due to water entering the car deck, had been satisfactorily addressed, confirming the significant progress which has been made in recent years. The conference also agreed that there were areas where research might identify further potential safety enhancements. We will look closely at these to establish whether there are any further measures we can take to enhance the already very high safety standard of ferries operating to and from UK ports.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Building Regulations Advisory Committee is a statutory advisory non-departmental public body constituted under Section 14(1) of the Building Act 1984. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions is statutorily obliged to consult the Committee on Building Regulations and other subjects connected with those regulations. The regulations apply in England and Wales. Appointments to the Committee are made jointly by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and by the Secretary of State for Wales.




<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 446</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para4">The Government are continuing a programme of regular "Financial Management and Policy Reviews" of non- departmental public bodies. Under that programme, I have now received and accepted a Financial Management and Policy Review report relating to the Building Regulations Advisory Committee for the period 1992-96.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para5">The report traces the history and policy development since the establishment of the Committee in 1962. In particular, it traces the evolution of the early Building Regulations--which provided a very prescriptive regime of building control--to a far more flexible process based on functional requirements. The report also highlights some of the more important procedural and technical areas which have evolved over the years--for example, providing for private sector involvement in the building control process at the election of applicants, and the rise in concern within the regulations for energy conservation and access and facilities for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para6">Financial Management and Policy Reviews are essentially concerned with assessing and reviewing the policy relevance and the cost-effectiveness of the body concerned. I am happy to say that BRAC scores high on both counts. I have no doubt that its experience with examining the core relevance of regulations will be of great value to this Government's policy of "better regulation".
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para7">As the report illustrates, the fact that members of BRAC are unsalaried, and that many willingly put in many hours in working parties, means that the cost effectiveness of the Committee is excellent compared with what could be achieved by contracting out to consultants for the provision of expert advice. As the report also indicates, consultants in this context would not necessarily provide the full breadth of expertise I have to hand on BRAC and could also not necessarily provide the continuity of knowledge which is so essential.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para8">Members are appointed to the Committee usually for terms of two or three years. The Committee's numbers had dwindled over the last year or so and, in addition, some appointments came to an end at the turn of the year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I therefore had the opportunity of appointing fresh blood to the Committee--thirteen members in total. We have also within the discipline of the Nolan recommendations considered it right for the benefit of continuity and the excellent public service which has been offered, to re-appoint five existing members. Details of the new Committee membership were released in a letter dated 20 April 1998 to Editors of the Construction and Property Press.
<P>

<a name="80521w03.html_para9">I had the opportunity to meet the new Committee in February and was able to say in person how much the Government valued the work of BRAC. I was also able to thank all those members who had served, or who were continuing to serve, on the Committee. In giving a particular welcome to the new members I expressed the view that they should find the Committee an interesting one to serve on. Having now studied the FMPR, I have no doubt about the on-going importance and relevance of the Committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his policy on proposals from the forensic science community for the creation of a Registration Council for Forensic Practitioners; and if he will make a statement.  [43620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce the Government's support for the creation of a Forensic Science Registration Council, in line with the central recommendations made by the industry's own Working Group in December 1997. The Working Group, which was chaired by Lord Lewis, was established following an initiative by the Forensic Science Service.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para0">The Council's aim will be to promote and maintain high standards of competence, practice, discipline and ethics amongst forensic science practitioners. It will be non-statutory, self-financing, self-regulating and independent, with input from users. The Council will operate on a three tier basis, comprising:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a Council, to include legal, lay and expert members, and incorporating a disciplinary panel;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an Executive/Registration Board, which would set the criteria for registration and operate the register; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Assessment Panels, which would assess qualifications and competence for each specialism within the forensic science community.</FONT></UL>
</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para1">The Council will build on and incorporate existing expertise and infrastructure using the experience of a wide range of professional bodies which already operate in this field.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para2">While considering the Working Group's recommendations on this issue, the Government also looked at the other outstanding proposals for the oversight of forensic science put forward by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (which reported in 1993) and by Professor Caddy in his report of December 1996 into the contamination incident at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory. The Royal Commission and Professor Caddy recommended the establishment of a Forensic Science Advisory Board and an Inspectorate of Forensic Science Services respectively.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para3">The Government considered all three sets of proposals very carefully. In light of the progress made in recent years by the forensic science industry to promote quality and standards, including the external accreditation of laboratories by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service and the British Standards Institute, we believe that the 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 450</I><P>
Registration Council offers the most practical way forward. The Registration Council would undertake a number of the tasks proposed for the Advisory Board and Inspectorate, but would do so in a way which complemented existing structures for maintaining standards in the industry. We share the view of the previous Administration, as set out in their final response to the Royal Commission (published in June 1996), that there is no need for the far wider remit envisaged for the two alternative oversight bodies. Many of the functions identified for the Advisory Board and Inspectorate could be fulfilled effectively only with some form of statutory regulation which the Royal Commission itself did not see as justified. The Government concur with this view.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para4">It is important that any new arrangements for oversight command the support, not only of forensic practitioners, but the end users of their services. I am pleased that the proposals to establish the Registration Council for Forensic Practitioners have received the overwhelming support of the forensic science community, as well as considerable backing from those in the wider criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para5">Once fully established, the aim would be for registration with the Council to become expected of those presenting expert forensic evidence in court. This would not preclude those who are unregistered from giving such evidence, although I believe such instances will become rare. It will also remain open to the courts to hear evidence from non-registered persons whose expertise is in a field outside the normal range of forensic science. As now, such decisions will remain a matter for the court to determine.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para6">Although it is the intention that, once fully established, the Registration Council will be self-funded, the Government have agreed that it will provide financial support to help with the start-up costs. Such funding will be for an initial period of two years.
<P>

<a name="80521w04.html_para7">The setting up of the Registration Council will be a significant step forward in further raising quality and standards in the forensic science industry. Taken together with the other measures already taken by the industry, the Council will do much to enhance the standing of forensic science in the criminal justice process.

<a name="80521w06.html_para4">Contributions from police authorities in 1997-98 are listed in the following table. Before 1996-97, ACPO was organised differently with a limited central function. Work undertaken in the ACPO cental office from part-way through 1996-97 was previously carried out in forces for which no specific costs are available. Police authorities contributed &#163;330,000 as a part-year cost for setting up the reorganised ACPO in 1996-97. In 1994-95, the police authorities' contribution was 49 per cent. of the total net cost of all common police services, of which the contribution to the costs of ACPO was a small part. This was apportioned between police authorities on the basis of a per capita charge based on the authorised establishment of each force. From 1995-96 to 1997-98, the costs of

 We work with the Treasury to seek to mobilise increasing international commitment to assist heavily indebted poor countries. In addition, we have contributed $10.5 million to help the African development bank meet its costs of providing debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative, and are encouraging other donors to do likewise. We have signalled our readiness to contribute $10 million to an international fund for Mozambique, an action which helped break the impasse among creditors earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="80521w06.html_para5">I convened an informal meeting of donors to Rwanda in Brussels on 19 May, which considered among other matters ways of helping resolve that country's debt problems. At the donors' meeting in Stockholm on 2-3 June, Britain will announce a significant contribution to the multi-donor debt trust fund, which will provide debt relief to Rwanda over the next few years. We are providing nearly &#163;500,000 in the form of technical assistance to help developing countries improve the management of their debt portfolios. We are continuing to urge other donors to follow the UK's example and write off their aid loans to the poorest developing countries.

 We recognise that trauma counselling is an important component of health care in post-conflict situations. We support a number of projects which provide direct assistance to children affected by conflict, including after-care for traumatised children. In the past, we have supported a major social rehabilitation programme with World Vision for children abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. More recently, we have provided assistance to non-governmental and UN agencies working in Liberia.

 The majority of board members of non-departmental public bodies give their time and services voluntarily and receive no payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where members do receive remuneration, this can vary between an annual salary, an honorarium or an attendance fee (which itself can be a daily rate or a half-daily rate, or calculated on a per meeting or per case basis). Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable. Full details of all payments to board members of non-departmental bodies,

 My Department seeks to develop long-term partnerships with countries that are committed to the elimination of poverty and are pursuing appropriate economic, social, environmental and political policies. In considering the opportunities for partnership, we take into account a wide range of factors.

 The main element of the Mauritius mandate is to press for faster implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative. To help achieve this aim, the Department for International Development is prepared to contribute to international efforts to ensure speedy debt relief to HIPC countries. We have contributed $10.5 million to help Uganda, have pledged $10 million to help Mozambique, and may contribute to others, but at this stage it is not possible to quantify the total likely cost.

<a name="80521w07.html_para1">As part of the mandate, I indicated that I was willing to cancel the remaining aid debts owed to the UK Government by lower-income Commonwealth countries, provided the poor benefited from this action.

 The new deal is about meeting individual needs, and therefore expenditure will be determined by the number of eligible people taking-up the opportunities and the nature of their requirements.
<P>

<a name="80521w10.html_para0">On the basis of the planning assumptions for 1998-99, we anticipate expenditure in Wales on the new deal for 18-24 year olds to be around &#163;20 million to &#163;25 million.
<P>

<a name="80521w10.html_para1">Expenditure on people with disabilities is more difficult to estimate at this stage because the new deal for disabled people includes a number of initiatives which are currently under development.

 The training and enterprise council (CELTEC) and the Employment Service in North Wales are liaising with both companies' consultants to see what help can be given to the staff who are to be made redundant. As a "significant redundancy", employees from both companies can be considered for training for work immediately rather than having to wait six months.

 Following a re-examination of the Roads Service market testing commitments in the light of the Best Value principles, it has been agreed that the Roads Service should adopt a Best Value approach to the delivery of its services, based on performance measurement and the benchmarking of costs and quality of service with other organisations. This is now being developed in conjunction with the restructuring of the Agency. If internal costs prove to be uncompetitive and cannot be improved sufficiently then market testing and contracting out remain as options.

 Most board members of non-departmental public bodies given their time and services voluntarily and receive no payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where remuneration is payable, it can take the form of an annual salary, an honorarium or an attendance fee (which itself can be a daily or a half-daily rate, or calculated on a per meeting or per case basis). Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable. Full details of all payments to board members of non-departmental bodies, by gender, are, however, given in the Cabinet Office publication "Public Bodies".

 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non rational institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.

The responses show widespread support for the general thrust of our proposals.
<P>

<a name="80521w13.html_para9">The many useful comments we have received will inform the preparation of draft legislation, which will be published later in the summer for a final round of public consultation. We will also issue a detailed paper for separate consultation on the proposal to charge the food industry for a greater proportion of food safety costs. The Government are considering, alongside the White Paper responses, the comments made by the Agriculture Select Committee in its recent report on food safety, and will publish its response in due course.
<P>

<a name="80521w13.html_para10">I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of those responses to the White Paper for which confidentiality was not requested by the respondent. These are accompanied by an alphabetical index and a summary of comments on individual parts of the Government's proposals. All will be available in the Library for the next six months.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will set criteria to govern the priorities of the research programme of the proposed Food Standards Agency.  [42620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The proposed Food Standards Agency will have a substantial research budget to support its work on food safety and standards. It will be for the Agency to establish its research priorities, although it will no doubt wish to consult a wide range of interested parties.

<a name="80521w13.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which are the first five applications he has received for National Seed Listing of genetically modified varieties for which his Department will make a proposed listing decision; and when such decisions will be taken.  [42970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The timing of applications for addition of plant varieties to the National List depends on crop species. Applications for the addition of two genetically modified spring oilseed rape varieties were submitted in December 1995, under the names "Socrates" and "Archimedes". At the same time, applications for plant breeders' rights were submitted for these two varieties. Applications for plant breeders' rights were also submitted for a further three varieties of spring oilseed rape in December 1995 (reference numbers AFP 35/853, 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 484</I><P>
35/957 and 35/958), but no applications for addition to the National List were submitted in respect of these three varieties.
<P>

<a name="80521w13.html_para11">Addition of a genetically modified plant variety to the National List does not, on its own, permit marketing. Appropriate consents must also be obtained in accordance with Council Directive 90/220/EEC on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. A decision about whether to add the varieties "Socrates" and "Archimedes" to the National List will not be taken until the necessary marketing consents have been promulgated by the French Competent Authority, to whom the marketing application was submitted.

 The statutory payment deadlines for schemes administered by the Department, which require annual claims to be made, are as set out. (These do not include scheme payments by the Intervention Board).
<P>

<a name="80521w14.html_para1">Arable Area Payments Scheme for cereals, linseed, proteins and set-aside (other than set-aside used for the production of non-food crops): by 31 December of the year of harvest. Payments on oilseeds are made in two instalments; an advance payment by 30 September of the year of harvest followed by a final payment within 60 days of the date of publication of the Regulation fixing the final regional reference amounts in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities (generally in February or March of the year following harvest). For set-aside land on which non-food crops are grown, the final date for payment is 31 March in the year following harvest.
<P>

<a name="80521w14.html_para2">Grain Legumes Scheme: 60 days after the date of publication of the final amount of aid, which generally takes place during December of the marketing year in question.

<P>

<a name="80521w14.html_para5">Agri-environment Schemes: no later than 4 months after the end of the period to which the payment relates. In England, the schemes covered by this provision are: Countryside Stewardship, Environmentally Sensitive Areas, Nitrate Sensitive Areas, the Organic Aid Scheme, the Habitat Scheme, the Countryside Access Scheme and the Moorland Scheme. Payment periods vary both within and between these schemes.
<P>

<a name="80521w14.html_para6">Apple and Pear Orchard Grubbing Up Grant Scheme 1998: not later than 4 months after the land has been inspected by MAFF officials to establish that grubbing up of the trees has taken place.

<a name="80521w14.html_para7">There are two schemes operated by the Ministry for which statutory payment deadlines apply but for which there is no requirement for annual claims. These are, firstly, the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, for which the first annual payment is made during the twelve months following the payment of the first instalment of grant under the Forestry Commission's Woodland Grant Scheme, and for which subsequent annual payments are made on 16 October in each year or on such other date as my right hon.

To ask the Minister without Portfolio what plans he has to exhibit United Kingdom engineering excellence in the Millennium Dome; and if he will make a statement.  [41103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The structure of the Dome is already a clear demonstration of the United Kingdom's excellence in architecture, engineering and design, and stands as an impressive new landmark on London's skyline. The exhibits in, and construction of the content of, the Dome will also provide many opportunities to demonstrate the UK's engineering excellence. In addition, a number of state-of-the art designs from the Millennium products award scheme will be featured inside the Dome.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w15.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Minister without Portfolio if the Guidance on Policy Appraisal and the Environment produced by DETR was fully applied in respect of the choice of the air-conditioning system for the Dome.  [41775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mandelson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) "Policy Appraisal and the Environment" guidance concerns appraisal of the environmental effects of policies or programmes, not projects. DETR have issued other guidance and advice on green issues that are more relevant to projects. In particular, DETR's "Green Guide for Buyers" recognises that HFCs have a high total equivalent warming impact if they are allowed to escape into the atmosphere and, as a consequence, their use is discouraged where there is a risk of high emissions. High emissions are defined in the voluntary agreement between the refrigeration industry and the Government as those in excess of 10 per cent. loss of initial charge annually from service and/or breakdown. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has set a target of 1 per cent. for the chiller units which they have procured for the Dome. Regular independent audits will be carried out to ensure that the target is met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The exhibit in the Dome currently entitled "Living Island" will explore ways in which individuals can protect and enhance their environment. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is in regular touch with DTI and DETR on science and technology and environmental matters, and is consulting and seeking advice from a number of environmental groups about the content and nature of this zone. The NMEC aims to include a range of features on the Dome site which demonstrate applications of environmental technology. The Millennium Experience will also feature a number of environmental state of the art products and services from the Millennium products award scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company's (NMEC) first concern is with the safety of people visiting and working in the Dome. The Company 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 491</I><P>
has been liaising closely with Greenwich Council and the London Fire and Civil Defence Authority (LFCDA) on fire prevention and safety issues. It has carried out detailed investigations into the potential effects of fire on the Dome's structure, with particular attention to the cladding material. The use of PTFE coated glass fibre cladding has been accepted both by Greenwich Council and by the LFCDA.
<P>

<a name="80521w15.html_para6">A number of fire prevention and detection measures will be adopted within the Millennium Dome both to minimise the risk of fire and to ensure early warning and the safety of the public in the event of a fire. Sprinkler systems and smoke extractors will be installed to minimise the impact of fire. Detailed studies have been carried out to ensure effective evacuation should this prove necessary.

 From 1 January 1999, the euro will replace the ecu as the currency of denomination of the EC budget.

<P>
<a name="80521w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The introduction of the euro in 11 European countries on 1 January 1999 will impact upon many UK businesses. We are committed to ensuring that all businesses are made aware of the need to examine their own position, and that those firms which will be affected are fully equipped to respond. This is a major task. A recent Treasury survey of over 1,300 small and medium firms revealed that only 11 per cent. knew that the euro 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 493</I><P>
will start operating in the participating Member States on 1 January next year. Only 5 per cent. had made any specific preparations for this.
<P>

<a name="80521w16.html_para1">This survey will provide a benchmark to help gauge the success of future efforts to increase business preparedness. The Euro Preparations Unit within HM Treasury will play a key role in helping to co-ordinate private and public sector activities to this end.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w16.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In his July 1997 Budget, the Chancellor announced the reduction in VAT on fuel and power for domestic users from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. This cut took effect from 1 September 1997. VAT on the costs of installing energy saving insulation materials where those costs are funded by certain grant schemes reduced from 17&#189; per cent. to 5 per cent. This will allow more pensioner and low-income households to improve the insulation of their homes and helps to reduce their fuel bills. This tax cut will take effect from 1 July. The Chancellor also announced that the Gas Levy would be cut to zero with effect from April 1998. The levy distorted the energy market and meant higher prices for consumers.
<P>

<a name="80521w16.html_para2">In his November 1997 Pre-Budget report, the Chancellor announced the introduction of a new Winter Fuel Payment giving additional help for all pensioners with their fuel bills. Last winter, every pensioner household received &#163;20, with

<P>
<a name="80521w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced a major extension of the Welfare to Work initiative in his recent Budget. We will provide additional help to young people, the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and partners of the unemployed. This commitment has been welcomed by employers, unemployed people, the voluntary sector and the wider public. The Chancellor's and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's initiative to expand the New Deal for the long-term unemployed in Northern Ireland, as part of a wider strategy for investment and enterprise, has been particularly welcomed in the Province.

<a name="80521w16.html_spnew14"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The structural changes to capital gains tax are broadly revenue neutral. They are expected to have a negligible effect in 1998-99; to cost &#163;25 million 1999-2000; and to yield &#163;25 million in 2000-01.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 It is this Government's policy to encourage individuals to save. We have given the Bank of England responsibility for setting interest rates to achieve the Government's inflation target. This, together with the Code For Fiscal Stability, will ensure economic stability and the right conditions in which individuals will be encouraged to save with confidence.

<a name="80521w17.html_para0">In addition, we have introduced plans for the Individual Savings Account specifically to develop and extend the savings habit.

 A modest cyclical fall in the saving ratio is expected over the next two years. Over the longer term, the introduction of ISAs and our policies to promote economic growth and stability will increase the incentive to save for investment.

 The regime for prudential supervision of banks is kept under constant review, both at home and internationally, in fora such as the European Union and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. When changes are needed, to reflect the nature of the markets in which banks operate, they are made. As my hon. Friend will be aware, we have announced major reforms to the structure of financial supervision in the UK. On 1 June, responsibility for the supervision of banks will transfer from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he is taking to reduce the debt burden of the poorest countries.  [41708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Debt relief was discussed at the G8 foreign and finance ministers meeting on 9 May and the G8 Summit in Birmingham last weekend. The G8 agreed to encourage all eligible countries to adopt the policy measures necessary to embark on the process of securing a sustainable exit to their debt burdens by the year 2000, and agreed that their export credit agencies would seek to ensure their export credits to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) would be used only for productive expenditure.
<P>

<a name="80521w17.html_para1">The Chancellor's latest initiative has concerned the debt burden of countries that have recently emerged from conflict. The communique issued after the Birmingham summit recognised that the present framework of the HIPC initiative was not able to provide debt relief quickly enough to post-conflict countries. These countries have large arrears to the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and require special assistance in the wake of long conflicts. The G8 urged the IMF and World Bank to look at the possibilities of helping these post-conflict countries--which include Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Rwanda--by finding mechanisms for dealing with their arrears payments to the IFIs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 Since 1 January 1997, the Treasury has received over 12,000 letters and postcards on the subject of third-world debt. To date, more than &#163;7,000 has been sent in as part of these campaigns.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the meetings of the IMF Interim Committee and World Bank/IMF Development Committee he attended in Washington in April.  [43585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 On 16 April, I attended the IMF's Interim Committee meeting. I also attended the IMF/World Bank Development Committee meeting with the Secretary of State for Development on 17 April.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para0">One of the key issues we discussed was how to strengthen the architecture of the international system in the light of the Asian crisis. In my speech to the Interim Committee, I placed particular emphasis on the importance of greater openness and transparency to long-term economic stability, and I identified six themes.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para1">First, enhancing transparency of data. I noted that we need to tighten up and enforce the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para2">Secondly, promoting openness in policy making. I welcomed the progress made in agreeing the Code of Good Practice on Fiscal Transparency and recommended that it be supplemented by a manual to provide more guidance on how to construct and present fiscal policies. I also proposed that the IMF should, in consultation with the World Bank and the BIS, prepare a code of Good Practice on Financial and Monetary policy.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para3">Thirdly, greater transparency by the IMF in providing advice on member countries. I proposed that we should do more to encourage countries to publish the outcome of their Article IV's through Press Information Notices (PINs).
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para4">Fourthly, exploring ways to improve the IMF's own accountability. I noted that it is essential for the IMF to perform its responsibilities in an open and transparent way that enhances public confidence. I proposed that we should look again at the option of establishing a new full-time evaluation unit which would report on the IMF's performance both to the Fund's shareholders and to the public.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para5">Fifthly, strengthening surveillance of national financial systems. I noted that the IMF's surveillance function should extend beyond its traditional role of looking at macro-economic policy and in particular it should look at the vulnerability of national financial systems. This will involve looking at financial sector regulation, corporate governance and legal issues. The Fund will need to cooperate closely with the World Bank, the Regional Development Banks and the Basle Committee in this area.




<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 499</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para6">Sixthly, enhancing the role of the International Financial Institutions and cooperation between them. I proposed that consideration should be given to the creation of a new joint department of the IMF and World Bank to deal with financial sector issues in all member countries. This Department would need to work closely with other international agencies and groups. Its tasks would be to help the IMF in its regular surveillance, to support the Bank in its analyses of countries' structural policies and to support both the Fund and the Bank in the advice they give to countries on financial sector restructuring.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para7">We also discussed Capital Account Liberalisation. I noted that free capital flows can bring benefits to all countries in terms of increased productivity and growth. However, capital account liberalisation needs to be backed by measures designed to put the appropriate supervisory and regulatory practices in place. It must also be properly sequenced.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para8">I noted that the IMF is the organisation best placed to oversee orderly and sustainable capital account liberalisation and that we should press ahead with the Amendment to the IMF's Articles of Agreement to give it jurisdiction over the capital account.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para9">The discussions in Washington at the Interim and Development Committees on these themes contributed to the G7 report on Strengthening the Architecture of the Global Financial System, which was published at the Birmingham Summit.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para10">Additionally, we discussed at the Interim Committee the need to take action at an international level to promote fairness and relieve poverty. I stressed that we should not allow our discussion of Asia to obscure the important work that is still needed in the poorer countries. I welcomed the Fund's recognition of the need to promote high quality growth that results in a permanent reduction in poverty, greater equality of economic opportunity, and respects the environment. In this context, I welcomed the completion of the external evaluators' review of the Fund's ESAF programme and agreed with the external evaluator's view that IMF programmes cannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the development process.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para11">There has been some significant and commendable progress with the Mauritius Mandate for the HIPC Debt Initiative which I launched a year ago. I emphasised to the international community the importance of ensuring that progress is maintained so that the Mauritius Mandate targets are met and we have met our objectives by the millennium.

In my statement in the House on 18 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 155-57, I said that I would remove from this list the name of any firm which achieved its target for resolving priority cases.

<a name="80521w18.html_para16">Information provided by firms to PIA indicates that several firms are close to achieving the targets set for them. If subsequent PIA inspections show that these initial indications are correct, then the firms' names will be removed from the list.
<P>

<a name="80521w18.html_para17">However, this does not mean that their work will be over. The regulators will continue to monitor firms, even after their targets have been met, to ensure that they follow through on offers of redress in a timely manner and establish the arrangements necessary to honour guarantees. I am asking the regulators to keep me informed.

 In 1996 the Department commissioned a programme of research which focused particularly on skill mix with an overall spend of &#163;3 million. This includes research on new roles and new responsibilities in nursing and medicine, and explores the implications of developments within the clinical team, as well as skill mix in primary care, diagnostic imaging centres and hospital teams. Many of these projects are now close to completion.

<a name="80521w19.html_para0">In addition to this research, there are plans for a major new research programme on human resources.

 The new system for allocating National Health Service research and development (R&D) funds has introduced greater accountability. R&D support funding for NHS providers is now distributed through a competitive process with bids assessed against published criteria, and successful providers obliged to account regularly to the NHS Executive for the use of these funds. The NHS Executive has in place, and will continue to develop, mechanisms for identifying and prioritising R&D activity which is best funded directly by the Executive itself. The new system will be the subject of evaluation. The Department's Director of Research and Development plans to publish an annual report on Department of Health and NHS R&D later in the year.

 The research and development (R&D) support funding allocated to primary care led providers in each National Health Service region during 1998-99 is set out in the table. This is the first year under the new R&D funding system that allocations have been made directly to primary care practices. In addition to research carried out by primary care providers, other providers within each NHS region spend some of their R&D support funding on primary care research, and the Department and NHS Executive also centrally commission primary care research projects for the benefit of the NHS as a whole. The total such R&D spending was estimated for 1996-97 at &#163;31 million. Information on the total R&D spend on primary care by NHS region is not currently available.

<a name="80521w22.html_para7">The latest figures from UCAS on applicants for autumn 1998 entry show that, as at 20 March, the numbers of mature applicants are down by 14 per cent. compared with the previous year, though this indicates a recovery from the position earlier in the cycle. This fall in part reflects trends in demographics and the numbers of potential entrants with the relevant entry qualifications. However, these figures are not a particularly good guide to final numbers for mature applicants as mature students tend typically to apply later in the applications cycle. Moreover, the UCAS figures do not cover applicants to part-time or postgraduate courses. Information on the numbers of lone parents who applied as mature students is not held centrally.

 Failure to comply with the terms set out in the jobseeker's agreement does not, in itself, result in the loss or termination of jobseeker's allowance. It may, however, give rise to a doubt as to whether the jobseeker is available for, and actively seeking, employment. If this is the case, then it is those questions that will be referred for adjudication.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Employment Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Historically, the Employment Service has not provided public toilets in its buildings largely because of the high cost of provision and maintenance which would be needed in our 1,000 plus Jobcentres. The majority of Jobcentres are in fact located in town centres where public toilet provision is available. I would also expect staff to by sympathetic to anyone with an urgent need to use a toilet, especially children, if they were made aware of the difficulty and public toilets were not to hand.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, in response to the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act, we are installing toilet facilities for disabled clients on a rolling basis, where it is feasible to do so. More generally, with the introduction of the New Deal programmes including the impending extension of the New Deal programme for Lone Parents later this year, we are reviewing our current policy on the provision of public toilets. The recommendations arising from the review should be available within the next month.</FONT></UL>

 The majority of board members of non-governmental public bodies give their time and services voluntarily, and receive no payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where members do receive remuneration, this can vary between an annual salary, an honorarium or an attendance fee (which itself can be a daily rate or a half-daily rate, or calculated on a per meeting or per case basis). Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable.

The information in the following table on the number of British citizens deported to the UK after completing a sentence for a criminal offence is therefore incomplete and relates only to those cases where we have become directly involved:

 The Argentine Government offered in 1993 to assist with demining and to meet the cost. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has asked them if, as a first step, they would be willing to help fund a British-led study to assess the feasibility and cost of demining the Falklands.

 This Department submitted its return to the UN Register covering conventional arms transfers in calendar year 1997 on the 7 May. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="80521w26.html_para4">Our return includes information on types of weapons transferred, details of procurement from national production and details of military holdings which, for the first time, include the types of weapons held in six of the seven categories of weapons included on the Register.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w26.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 This Department has approved a licence for the temporary export of aero-engine parts to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for machining and assembling into more complete units. These units will be returned to the UK for inclusion in engine kits for export to Italy. As the export of the goods concerned is controlled under Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, this licence was an exception to our interpretation of the EU arms embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This decision does not affect the Government's continued support of the EU common position on arms exports to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80521w26.html_para6">The Government believe that the Structural Funds need to be fair, affordable, durable, simpler, and more efficient. The overall budget should be well below the 0.46 per cent. of Community GNP proposed by the Commission, before and after enlargement.
<P>

<a name="80521w26.html_para7">Representations by UK Ministers and Officials have been made to the Commission, outlining our support for containing the cost of the Funds.
<P>

<a name="80521w26.html_para8">Discussions on finance are likely to take place towards the end of the year and will continue into early 1999. It is too early in the negotiations to comment on the size of the European Structural and Cohesion Funds.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what matters were covered by the public interest immunity certificates used in connection with the disqualification proceedings against Mr. Gerald James and the directors of Astra Holdings.  [41874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 No public interest immunity certificates were sought by my Department or were issued in connection with the disqualification proceedings against former directors of Astra Holding plc. Despite press reports that it was intended to use a PII to suppress the 'Moulsdale letter' in that case, the letter was in fact brought to the attention of the court by my Department.

 DTI inspectors appointed to investigate the affairs of Astra plc offered views on disqualification but not on prosecution.

<a name="80521w28.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Humble: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the outcome of the EU Industry Council held in Brussels on 7 May.  [43434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I chaired a meeting of the EU Industry Council on 7 May.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para0">The Council adopted a Regulation on new rules on aid to shipbuilding. Operating aid will be eliminated from end 2000 and remaining forms of support will be re-focused to improve the industry's competitiveness. There will be new aid for innovation and the opening up of regional aid. A strict limit will be placed on restructuring aid and strengthened monitoring provisions will be introduced. These measures will lead to an overall reduction in the level of European shipbuilding subsidies. The new aid regime is an achievement for our Presidency and meets the interests of UK shipyards.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para1">The main outstanding questions before the Council were the date when operating aid should be abolished and the restrictions that should be placed on the existing system of regional aid to reduce distortion in competition. After a long and thorough discussion, a compromise was finally agreed with the abolition of operating aid at the end of 2000 and regional aid ceilings of 22.5 per cent for "A" regions and 12.5 per cent. for "C" regions (the so called "A" regions are Europe's poorest and "C" regions are less poor). The regulation does not affect the treatment of FPSOs. There will also be Commission declarations on the following: the strict application of the regional aid rules; the aid cumulation rule; and the viability criterion for restructuring aid, and a Council statement that the agreement on regional aid is without prejudice to the Community regional state aid policy.




<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 538</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para2">The Council had an in-depth discussion on a proposed Regulation laying down detailed rules for the application of state aid rules in general. The Presidency put forward a compromise text and the debate focused on the three main issues still to be settled, namely; time limits for Commission action; Commission powers in respect of recovery of unlawful aid and a period of limitation on Commission action.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para3">Good progress was made with a clear political will in favour of a Regulation and the Presidency concluded that further work should be undertaken by officials to enable the Council to reach a political agreement.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para4">As a new initiative, I invited Industry Ministers to have dinner with representatives of industry, on the eve of the Council to discuss competitiveness. I see this as an important step in developing a real dialogue between industry and the Council of Ministers. The Council meeting held a debate on the competitiveness of European Industry, mainly focusing on the key factors at national and supra-national level influencing competitiveness of EU industry and how they can be achieved. The meeting also discussed one of the key factors, namely the availability of appropriate finance for innovative companies.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para5">I concluded that there had been agreement on the importance of competitiveness and on the key factor as identified by the dinner and confirmed by the Council's discussion, namely: encouraging competition, efficient functioning of the Internal Market, a framework for innovation, continuous development of skills and labour adaptability, efficient markets for risk capital, improved environment for business start-up and entrepreneurship. There was strong support for continuing the Council's work on competitiveness with Austria and Finland pledging to do so in their forthcoming Presidencies.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para6">The Council took note of a progress report by the Commission on the Business Environment Simplification Task Force (BEST) and a Commission communication on Fostering Entrepreneurship in Europe. The Presidency noted that there was agreement on the importance of entrepreneurship for competitiveness, growth and jobs.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para7">The Council also agreed conclusions on the competitiveness of the Construction Industry and a plan of action to increase the competitiveness of the European Textile and Clothing Industry.
<P>

<a name="80521w28.html_para8">There were Commission presentations on a proposed directive on late payment, the year 2000 computer problem, delocalisation, restructuring of the steel industry in Central and Eastern Europe, Six-monthly report on the monitoring of steel aid cases and a report on the work of the high level group dealing with the implications of industrial change.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 It is DTI policy that recruitment is carried out on the basis of fair and open competition and selection on merit, subject to the exceptions permitted by the Civil Service Commissioners. My Department has systems in place which ensure that the principles of fair and open competition are understood and followed, in 



<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1998]:</i> Where an application for an export licence is refused, applicants do not routinely inform the Department whether such decisions have resulted in the cancellation of contracts. I am not therefore in a position to make the estimate requested. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said when announcing the new export licence assessment criteria on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 26-29, we are committed to the maintenance of a strong defence industry which is a strategic part of our industrial base as well as our defence effort. Defence exports can also contribute to international stability by strengthening bilateral and collective defence relationships in accordance with the right of self-defence recognised by the UN Charter, but arms transfers must be managed responsibly, in particular so as to avoid their use for internal repression and international aggression.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w29.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Sawford: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the recently published proposals by the European Commission for reform of the European Structural and Cohesion Funds.  [43435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The draft regulations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds covering the operation of the Funds from the years 2000 to 2006 were published on 18 March as part of a wider Agenda 2000 package.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para0">It is important that the Structural and Cohesion Funds be reformed to make them more effective and to provide better value for money. The Funds' procedures are in need of substantial simplification and the prospect of enlargement of the EU to include Central and Eastern European countries makes this reform vital in any event.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para1">During the long negotiations ahead we will be striving to achieve three main aims for the UK and its regions--these are fairness, affordability and durability.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para2">Fairness means that no Member State should receive more than at present. Regions which continue to be eligible under the reformed criteria should not see an increase in per capita receipts while others face cuts. The cost of enlargement must be shared fairly between all Member States. It is not clear that the Commission's proposals achieve fairness. The UK is willing to take its fair share of cuts but could not accept an obviously unfair allocation.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para3">In order to achieve affordability and durability, the total budget for the Funds should be well below the 0.46 per cent. of GNP proposed by the Commission. It will be vitally important to reduce the cost and per capita receipts before accession in order to make enlargement of the EU affordable and therefore long lasting and durable.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para4">The Commission has proposed that the current 7 Objectives be reduced to 3 new ones. The proposed Objective 1 eligibility criterion is 75 per cent. of average EU GDP. The Government agree that a cut off is needed. There should, however, be flexibility around this level to allow for statistical margins of error. We also feel that any special cases should be translated across the EU. For example, the Scottish Highlands and Islands Objective 1 area, with a population density of about 9 people per sq km, should receive the same treatment as similar areas in northern Sweden and Finland.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para5">The special circumstances of Northern Ireland and the ongoing political developments there should be recognised. Northern Ireland should certainly receive treatment at least as good as the richer Republic of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para6">For the new Objective 2, the Commission is proposing using unemployment as the main eligibility criterion. The last-minute concession of safety net limiting the reduction of population coverage to one third is an improvement on the initial proposals. But in our view GDP would be the most equitable and transparent basis for distributing Funds between Member States and determining total eligibility in each Member State.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para7">Regional unemployment and other factors are better used to allocate money within Member States. There is a far greater range and quality of deprivation indicators for 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1998 : Column: 542</I><P>
local areas available nationally than at EU level. The length of reference period is important; measures of unemployment should take account of business cycles.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para8">Transition periods for those areas losing eligibility under the new regime should be of equal length for all Objectives--six years for Objective 2 and 5b, the same as for Objective 1.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para9">The new Objective 3 would apply only outside Objective 1 and 2 areas. It would provide a policy framework for the development of human resources across the UK. We believe that Objective 3 must support Member States' employment strategies as set out in their National Employment Action Plans.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para10">We support the objective of simplifying the Funds and making them more effective and better value for money. The Commission proposals are a good starting point. Administration must be improved, ensuring adequate appraisal monitoring and evaluation, and more subsidiarity should be introduced.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para11">The Funds make an important contribution to economic development in the UK regions. The Government are consulting widely and will be working to ensure that the detailed arrangements for the allocation of the Funds take account of the UK's regional interests, and that they are fair to the UK as a whole. It is, however, too early to estimate the impact on individual UK regions. Publication of the Regulations marks the start of a long negotiation initially under the UK Presidency and continuing possibly into 1999. The Regulations will have to be agreed in the Council of Ministers and approved by the European Parliament.

[40671]<P>
<P>
<P>

 I refer my hon. Friend to my reply of 19 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>342.</i>
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para12">The safeguards reports made by all UK nuclear operators, including Dounreay, are in accordance with the procedures set out in Commission Regulation (Euratom) No. 3227/76. Copies of the Regulations are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80521w29.html_para13">No facilities at Dounreay are currently designated for inspection by the IAEA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 On 23 April, the UKAEA held sufficient Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) of the necessary enrichment, greater than 90 per cent. to produce 7,800 targets which will then be used to produce 39 million doses of Technetium-99m for use in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. This inventory comprised 39 km of HEU in a number of different forms; only 7 km was available as stock material for immediate target manufacture. The use of Technetium-99m continues to grow, currently some 30,000 procedures per day are carried out in Western Europe using this isotope. A wide range of other radioisotopes are used in the treatment of cancer, however the UKAEA play no part in their manufacture. The Government do not have central records of the overall amounts of radioisotopes used for medical purposes.

<a name="80521w30.html_para1">From April 1999, the level of earnings at which employers' contributions become payable will be increased from the lower earnings limit (&#163;64 a week for 1998/99) to an amount equivalent to the single personal tax allowance (currently &#163;81 a week). Employers' contributions on earnings below this new threshold will be abolished, and the four different rates of contributions they currently pay for employees not contracted-out of the State earnings-related pension scheme will be replaced by a single 12.2 per cent rate. Contribution rebates for employers with contracted-out schemes will not be affected. They will continue to be entitled to contribution rebates on earnings between the lower earnings limit and the single personal tax allowance. These changes, which are revenue neutral for employers as a whole, are contained in the Social Security Bill for which we will be seeking Royal Assent today.

Also, we should ensure all decisions taken as a result of the project are right. We have, therefore, acted to

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she has appointed a new Social Fund Commissioner to succeed Mr. John Scampion when his appointment ends on 31 May.  [43578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80521w30.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that Mr. John Scampion has agreed to serve as Social Fund Commissioner for Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a further period of three years from 1 June 1998.
<P>

<a name="80521w30.html_para4">Since taking up the post of Social Fund Commissioner in June 1995, Mr. Scampion has successfully developed the Independent Review Service (IRS) into a customer focused organisation which aims to get the decision right first time. An important step for the IRS in this new approach has been the development of staff to realise their full potential, leading to the award of the Investors in People accreditation in July 1997.
<P>

<a name="80521w30.html_para5">Mr. Scampion has also agreed to take part in the general monitoring of the effectiveness of the new Budgeting Loan scheme.
<P>

<a name="80521w30.html_para6">I am confident that I can rely on Mr. Scampion to maintain and even improve upon his excellent record to date.
