<p><a name="50304w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Alan Reid: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what his Department&#039;s policy is on the use of the Gaelic language; and what plans his Department has to prepare and implement a Gaelic language scheme.  [217091]</p>




<p><a name="50304w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Action to support the Gaelic language is primarily the responsibility of the Scottish Executive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w01.html_para0">
The Department for Constitutional Affairs attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of the Gaelic language in line with the UK&#039;s obligations under the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w01.html_para1">
The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill currently before the Scottish Parliament does not extend statutory obligations on UK public bodies in Scotland in relation to the preparation or implementation of Gaelic language plans. However, UK Departments and public bodies which operate in Scotland may&#151;like comparable Scottish public bodies&#151;have a role to play in facilitating the use of the language.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w01.html_para2">
My Department has been working closely with colleagues in the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive on the role we can play, voluntarily, in securing the status of Gaelic.

<a name="50304w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Unpaid Fines</h3>


<p><a name="50304w01.html_wqn1"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many and what value of court-imposed fines have been defaulted on in <i>(a)</i> each London borough and <i>(b)</i> England in each year since 1997.  [212370]</p>




<p><a name="50304w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Information on fines imposed and collected is provided by the 42 magistrates courts committees (MCCs) with the Greater London Magistrates&#039; Courts Authority (GLMCA) responsible for courts covering the Greater London area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w01.html_para3">
Data are collected on the value of financial penalties (including fines) imposed and outstanding. It is not possible to separately identify the number and value of court-imposed fines defaulted on in any one year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w01.html_para4">
Table 1 shows the national position since 1999 when payment rate collection began. There is no comparable data for previous years. Table 2 shows performance and payment rates prior to the establishment of the GLMCA in 2001 for the 22 magistrates courts committees (MCCs) that were subsequently amalgamated into the GLMCA. Data are not available centrally at borough level.

<sup>(1)</sup> Prior to 2001 the GLMCA did not exist as a single entity. It was created from the amalgamation of 22 magistrates courts committees (MCCs) on 1 April 2001 and therefore no earlier comparable figures exist. In addition, as a result of changes to the calculation of the payment rate in 2003&#150;04, direct year-on-year comparisons arc not appropriate (see note <sup>(2)</sup> ).<br>

<sup>(3)</sup> The Payment Rate is defined as the amount paid into court as a percentage of new amounts owed. As a result of the revisions in the method of calculating the payment rate (detailed as follows), direct year-on-year comparisons cannot be made.<br>

Payment rate (September 1999 to March 2003)<br>

The calculation for the payment rate until March 2003 was:<br>

Payment rate = amount paid divided by new amount owed<br>

(New amount owed includes legally cancelled plus civil plus confiscation orders)<br>

Payment rate (April 2003 to December 2003)<br>

The calculation for the payment rate between April 2003 and December 2003 was:<br>

Payment rate = amount paid divided by new amount owed<br>

(New amount owed excludes legally cancelled plus civil plus confiscation orders)<br>

Payment rate (January 2004 onwards)<br>

The payment rate is currently calculated as follows:<br>

Payment rate = amount paid divided by new amount owed<br>

(New amount owed excludes legally cancelled plus administratively cancelled plus civil plus confiscation orders)<br>

<p><a name="50304w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Treasury&#039;s projection for the trend growth rate of the economy is built up from projections of growth for the different components that drive trend growth, one of which is the population of working age. As referred to in the 2004 pre-Budget report, the trend growth assumption is 2&#190; per cent. over the current economic cycle, with growth in the working-age population contributing around &#189; percentage point. Included in this &#189; percentage point is a contribution from net migration of slightly over &#188; percentage point. The paper &quot;Trend Growth: Recent Developments and Prospects&quot; published alongside Budget 2002 explained the Treasury&#039;s approach to assessing trend growth, and further relevant material is published in the economy chapter of each pre-Budget and Budget report.

<p><a name="50304w02.html_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The Inland Revenue&#039;s Code of Practice 26 (&quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;) sets out their approach to handling overpayments of tax credits. It describes a number of measures the Revenue has put in place to protect against hardship being caused by the recovery of an overpayment, which I can summarise as follows:




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Mar 2005 : Column 1405W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w02.html_para2">
Where possible, the Inland Revenue will collect an overpayment from a previous year from a continuing award. There are automatic limits on the amounts that will be deducted from payments and these are designed to prevent hardship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w02.html_para3">
Where a claimant&#039;s circumstances change, the Inland Revenue adjust their payments for the rest of the year with the aim of paying the right amount of tax credits for the year as a whole. The Inland Revenue may make additional tax credits payments to prevent hardship where payments are reduced following the adjustment of an award. The effect of these payments is that only part of an expected overpayment being collected is recovered by the end of the year, leaving the balance to be recovered in later years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w02.html_para4">
In exceptional cases, where claimants still feel that recovery of an overpayment is causing hardship, the Inland Revenue will consider the facts of the case and may decide not to collect all or part of the overpayment, or allow more time to pay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w02.html_para5">
Where claimants have no award for the current year, they receive a &quot;Notice to Pay&quot;. This advises them to contact the Inland Revenue if they want to arrange to pay back their overpayment in 12 monthly instalments, or to request repayment over a longer period.

<p><a name="50304w02.html_spnew9"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Self Assessment was introduced in 1996 to modernise and simplify the assessment and payment processes. The new system also produced staff savings worth over &#163;450million within the first four years. The success of the project was confirmed in an independent post-implementation review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w02.html_para7">
Since 1996 many improvements and changes have been made in the light of experience and they have also produced savings. One of the most significant has been the ability to file online (via the internet or the electronic lodgement service). More than 1.6 million online tax returns have been received in 2004&#150;05 (for tax year 2003&#150;04). These will generate targeted savings of more than &#163;14 million in 2005&#150;6, which as take up continues to rise will increase to over &#163;40 million per annum from 2011&#150;12.

 Arising out of an incident at Whiterock, Belfast, on 28 June 2003, the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland received a police file in respect of an alleged breach of a Parade Commission&#039;s Determination of 28 June 2003. Following consideration of the file the police were asked to commence proceedings against one individual for an offence contrary to section 8(7) of the Public Processions Act (Northern Ireland) 1998. This is an offence that can only be tried in the magistrates court and proceedings must be commenced within six months of the alleged offence having been committed. The administrative steps required to initiate the proceedings were a matter for the police.

The absence of formal confirmation of commencement of proceedings was noticed by the Department on 23 December 2003 and the police were asked to confirm that proceedings had in fact been commenced. The Department was assured that proceedings had been commenced. In February 2004 the Department was informed that through administrative error, proceedings had not in fact been commenced by police within the statutory time period. As more than six months had elapsed at that stage proceedings were by then statute barred and it was not possible to take any further action.

However the Government will, as the report recommends, be giving attention to the approaches set out in the report to investigate their practicality, feasibility and usefulness, and be playing a full part in the international discussions which follow.

 The Government&#039;s target of renewable energy sources contributing 10 per cent. of our electricity by 2010 is for all forms of renewables, not just wind, although it is clear that wind will make the main contribution. At this stage it is difficult to predict precise numbers. There are already just under 1,200 wind turbines currently in operation. Generating 10 per cent. of UK electricity from renewables could mean an increase of possibly another one and half times that number. There will also be a rather smaller number of offshore turbines.

 In the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s &quot;Homes for All&quot; public service plan, launched on 24 January 2005, a competition was announced that would invite organisations to bid for the right to construct one or more new developments on English Partnerships owned sites. This &quot;Design for Manufacture&quot; competition aims to demonstrate that it is possible to build a home that reaches good standards of accessible design and environmental performance for &#163;60,000.

<a name="50304w08.html_para5">
This target cost of &#163;60,000 for constructing a home relates solely to construction costs.

One of the main purposes of the competition is to encourage greater efficiency in the construction process.

In this case the appeal was submitted on 16 April 2004 and the site visit took place on 3 September 2004. There is currently a non-statutory timetable for appeal decisions to be issued within 16 weeks of the site visit. In this case a Planning Officer from the Government Office for the South West carried out the site visit on 3 September 2004, and he submitted his report on 9 November, with the decision being issued on 26 November, some 12 weeks after the site visit. While Government Offices would hope to be able to issue decisions within a shorter timescale whenever possible, this cannot always be achieved.

 The local government Public Service Agreement targets require the improved delivery and value for money of local services.

Vaccination of cattle with BCG remains a problem because it affects skin test readings. Work is in progress on a differential diagnostic test. The sequencing of the <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> genome in 2002 has led to the development of an experimental test to distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle, but more work is required to validate the test under field conditions. Defra is funding research at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, in collaboration with New Zealand workers, to experimentally vaccinate cattle with BCG and to differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals. The current project is due to end in 2005. New research proposals taking the work forward on new candidate vaccines and neonatal vaccination are currently being appraised by independent referees. Future plans to look at the performance of vaccine candidates under natural infection conditions are also being drawn up.

<p><a name="50304w09.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There is no evidence to suggest that the resumption of reactive culling would reduce the incidence of bovine TB in cattle. The ISO has continued to collect data from the reactive areas and recent analyses are consistent with results presented in late 2003, with the confidence limits providing no evidence for a beneficial effect of the reactive strategy over the time scale under study. Further detailed investigations based on the distribution of TB breakdowns in space and time are under way to investigate whether the observed increased incidence was linked to proximity to reactive culling. In addition, as further TB incidence data are obtained, the ISG will continue to analyse data from reactive areas. If the TB incidence rates in reactive 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Mar 2005 : Column 1434W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and survey areas become more similar over time, this finding would indicate that the observed increase in TB breakdowns in reactive areas, compared with survey-only areas, was associated with reactive culling.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to take action against those gangmasters who contravene provisions of the Gangmaster Licensing Act 2004.  [218459]</p>




<p><a name="50304w10.html_spnew8"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State responsibility for enforcing the criminal offences set out in the legislation. These include the offences of operating as a gangmaster without a licence, using an unlicensed gangmaster and the possession or use of false documents.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Mar 2005 : Column 1437W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w10.html_para9">
These offences will be brought into effect once gangmasters who require a licence have had the opportunity to apply for one. It will also be necessary for the Secretary of State to make regulations clarifying the checks labour users must make to establish the due diligence defence created by the Act. If the Gangmasters Licensing Authority makes early progress on specifying licence conditions and establishing the new licensing arrangements after its anticipated establishment on 1 April, it is expected that the new offences will be introduced mid 2006.
</p>


<p>

A new team of enforcement officers will be appointed by the Secretary of State to enforce the criminal offences created under the Act.

The Act gives the Gangmasters Licensing Authority responsibility for ensuring that licence holders comply with the provisions of a licence issued to them. The Authority will set out how it intends to undertake its compliance role once it is formally established.

 Price negotiations between producers and processors, or processors and supermarkets are a private commercial matter in which the Government cannot and should not get involved, provided competition rules are respected.

<p><a name="50304w11.html_spnew8"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The costs of the UK belonging to the International Organisation of Wine and Vine (OIV) have been variable and have depended on the number of proposals under consideration within the organisation, the degree of UK involvement, the resources attached to that involvement, as well as the level of annual membership fees that have been set. Where the OIV chooses to hold its meetings, for example France or Australia, will also affect the cost. In 2003&#150;04, the latest year for which figures are available, the meetings attended by the UK were in Paris alone, and the costs estimated to be about &#163;25,000. A cost benefit analysis of UK membership of OIV is not available but the UK&#039;s ability to produce, import and trade wine is not conditional on membership. Proposals emerging from OIV need to be implemented into European Community law in order to have practical effect in the UK, so our withdrawal from OIV will continue to ensure a consequence of reprioritisation of the Department&#039;s budgetary resources to focus public spending where it is most needed to meet Government objectives. The decision is we will not interfere with the UK continuing to play an active role in the development of European Community policy and legislation on wine and that the interests of the UK wine industry and consumers are fully represented at that level.

<i>[holding answer 3 March 2005]:</i> These working groups, and one on nuclear issues, were set up under the agreement between Iran and the UK, France and Germany on 15 November 2004. Their aim is to agree long-term arrangements for Iran&#039;s nuclear programme based on objective guarantees that the programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes; and they provide for co-operation in other areas. The groups meet every three or four weeks in Geneva. The group on political and security issues has discussed, for example, export controls, counter-narcotics co-operation and other subjects of mutual interest. The working group on technology and co-operation is looking at issues in a range of economic sectors. But in view of the need to build mutual confidence and trust, the two sides have agreed not to disclose details of the discussions, which are continuing.

This land includes some of the West Bank&#039;s richest agricultural land and covers part of the aquifer system which is a major source of water resources for the West Bank. The barrier also affects Palestinian access to groundwater wells in the West Bank which had previously supplied water for both drinking and agriculture. Precise figures on this are not available. The proposed route of the barrier has recently been altered by the Israeli Cabinet in response to calls from the international community and the Israeli judicial system to minimise the impact on Palestinian livelihoods. There has been no authoritative analysis yet of the impact of the changes. While some improvement is expected there will continue to be inevitable and significant disruption to the lives of Palestinians living near the route of the barrier.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what contribution his Department has made to the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and what use he expects to make of the Assessment once it is published; and if he will make a statement.  [218905]</p>




<p><a name="50304w15.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) welcomes the forthcoming publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), the first public release of which will be at the end of March. We will look for opportunities to publicise the launch of this report internally to DFID staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w15.html_para0">
The MA focuses on ecosystem services and how changes in ecosystem services affect human well-being. Building on this, the MA will identify policy, institutional, or technological changes that could not only improve the management of ecosystems, but also contribute to development and to long-term sustainability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w15.html_para1">
DFID has been involved in consultations with a number of MA working groups, providing comments and suggestions on the draft stages of the report. DFID also funded two co-ordinating lead authors through the provision of financial support to the International 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Mar 2005 : Column 1454W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Institute for Environment and Development. One of the main financial contributors to the MA process has been the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to which the UK is currently contributing &#163;103 million over four years from 2002. The UK is the fourth largest donor to the GEF.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w15.html_para2">
DFID uses the results and recommendations of reports such as the MA to inform thinking on issues of poverty-environment linkages and the continual development and improvement of tools to support work to integrate environmental considerations into development co-operation. DFID is particularly interested in the findings of the MA that seek to highlight effective policies and interventions that respond to environmental challenges while bringing financial and livelihood benefits to the poor. Examples of these options include payment for ecosystem services such as catchment management and forest certification schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w15.html_para3">
DFID will also be encouraging those agencies involved in commissioning the report, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Secretariats of the Conventions (in particular the Convention on Biodiversity and the Framework Convention on Climate Change), to use the analyses and results of this major study to inform their future policy and implementation work.

 No. Entitlement to disability living allowance is not linked to particular disabling conditions.

 It is assumed that the question refers to animals used in scientific procedures.

 Plans are underway to develop a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) in Leeds which would provide forensic examination and link in with the support and counselling offered by the STAR (Surviving Trauma After Rape) project. STAR was established in 1994 by the Police and the four health authorities in West Yorkshire to provide co-ordinated support and counselling for victims of sexual assault. In addition, I understand that the voluntary and community sector are considering developing a SARC in Halifax.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50304w23.html_para0">
We are committed to increasing the number of SARCs in England and Wales and Home Office funding from the Victims Fund is to be made available for the establishment of new SARCs in 2005&#150;06. Projects in Leeds and in Yorkshire will be invited to apply for grants along with all other areas of England and Wales. Details of the application process will be made available in March.
