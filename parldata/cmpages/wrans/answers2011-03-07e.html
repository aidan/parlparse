 As the Secretary of State for Communities set out in his written ministerial statement of 17 February 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 82WS, the Government remain committed to retaining council tax support for the most vulnerable in society and will be taking forward plans for councils to develop local rebate schemes. This reform will support the positive work incentives that will be introduced through the Government's plans on universal credit. Combined with other incentives—such as the new homes bonus and our proposals for the local retention of business rates—these changes will give councils a greater stake in the economic future of their local area.</p>

 Promoting work incentives is at the heart of the programme of welfare reform.

 Regular threat briefings take place between the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the right hon.

 The Government have made no such assessment. The Electoral Commission has the power to set and monitor performance standards for electoral services. Since 2008, the Electoral Commission has monitored the performance of electoral registration officers (EROs) in Great Britain against a set of standards, and has published annual assessments. The Commission's March 2010 Report ‘Performance Standards for Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain’ found that “just under 96% of EROs met the ‘Completeness and accuracy of electoral registration records’ standard this year compared with 85% of EROs last year”.</p>

 On average, 10,000 files are temporarily returned to Departments each year largely relating to the conduct of public business. The National Archives has provided figures for files or parts of files requisitioned by Departments during calendar years 2008, 2009 and 2010. Due to the large number of files involved, it is not possible to provide individual file names. However, a file loaned back to a Department is clearly marked as such on the National Archives document ordering system, ensuring members of the public may request to view the file should it have been requisitioned.</p>

               <b>Mr Blunt:</b>
 All approved premises in England and Wales provide staff with personal alarms which in some way link to local police stations. The most common arrangement is that, if a staff member activates their personal alarm, this alerts a call centre, which in turn contacts the approved premises by telephone to confirm whether an emergency has occurred. If there is no response, it is assumed that an emergency has occurred and police are alerted. In some cases, there are additional failsafe procedures such as passwords that have to be given before the call centre will accept that no emergency has occurred. Some approved premises instead have direct-to-police functions on personal alarms carried by staff. A minority of approved premises also have building alarm systems which operate in similar ways to the personal alarms.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service's central accounting system has a single accounting code for prisoners' earnings. It does not distinguish between: prisoners' pay; unemployment pay; foreign nationals' pay; or foreign nationals' unemployment pay. To separate each of these costs would require examining a high volume of local individual records and would thus incur disproportionate costs.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service has issued national guidance to probation trusts on health and safety matters. This includes specific guidance on the health and safety training that trusts are required to provide routinely for their staff. Probation Trusts are required to have in place arrangements to ensure that all employees (including contractors' employees and agency staff) are suitably informed and trained about the hazards and risks in their working environment.</p>

 Information is not collected centrally from probation trusts to answer this question fully. The information that is available to the National Offender Management Service does not distinguish between instances of voluntary or compulsory redundancy. However, the available information indicates that staff redundancies have occurred in 21 probation trusts since 1 April 2010.</p>

 In 2009, DEFRA funded a wide-ranging research review to identify the causes of decline in wild bird populations. This included an assessment of the impact of predation. It found evidence that predation was, at least in some areas, having an impact on ground-nesting species such as seabirds or wading birds of wetland habitats (i.e. not songbirds). Predation was also identified as a potential driver of declines for nine woodland bird species including some songbirds such as bullfinch. Many bird and other animal species are known to predate songbirds. However, despite some studies showing a link to local declines in some bird populations at some individual sites, the evidence that predation is driving national declines is mixed.

               <a name="11030740000060"> Both reports highlight one further important caveat: that there is a strong interaction with land use change—as habitats become degraded, birds are more susceptible to predation. What is clear from the research is that while predation can be important for some species in some areas, key drivers of change are habitat degradation and fragmentation, and in woodland, changes to habitat structure and so this is where our policies are focused. Improved habitat management also benefits the full range of species associated with the British countryside.</p>

               <a name="11030740000104"> However, stock sustainability is an important consideration when recommending the consumption of fish species. DEFRA has commissioned work to understand the potential for encouraging increased consumption of herring and sardines as part of their ‘Fishing for the Markets’ project—an initiative to encourage domestic consumption of sustainable, under-utilised fish species. The project began last year and research is ongoing. Initial results will be available in spring 2011.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 population, standardised to the European Standard Population. Age-standardised rates are used to allow comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of people of different ages.
<sup>(2)</sup> Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.
<sup>(3)</sup> Based on the income domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007.

 The Government have been working to build a culture of social action. As part of this, a “Giving” Green Paper was published in December 2010 containing a range of ideas to encourage the giving of time and money, and these ideas will be developed in a White Paper to be published in due course. The civil service recently committed to a new volunteering initiative that will encourage hundreds of thousands of professionals to volunteer for at least one day each year. The Government are working with external organisations to encourage this culture of giving outside the civil service and take forward the idea of a Big Society day.</p>

 The Transition Fund was open to applications on 30 November 2010 with a deadline of 21 January 2011. When setting this timetable, the Government were particularly mindful to balance the urgent need to support organisations facing financial hardship with requiring some evidence of the cuts they face. Big Fund, the delivery partner, held a consultation event on 11 November 2010 to seek views about the implementation of the Transition Fund. A wide range of organisations attended the consultation event including frontline civil society organisations, infrastructure organisations, national umbrella bodies representing civil society, representatives from the Local Government Association and central Government.</p>

 The Giving Green Paper, published in December 2010, contained a preliminary analysis of existing research. It showed that people are held back from volunteering due to a range of barriers, these include: too much bureaucracy, the lack of time or not having the right information. The Green Paper also outlined the Government's initial ideas for catalysing a culture shift towards a more giving society, including: the creation of an £80 million Volunteering Fund, which comprises a volunteering match fund and a volunteer infrastructure programme. These programmes will both provide support to organisations to take on more volunteers, and encourage individuals to take up these new opportunities.</p>

This White Paper will set out a number of policy proposals aimed at increasing all forms of giving, however we cannot anticipate details in advance of its publication.</p>

The existing—mainly technical—research suggests that biochar can deliver benefits in terms of improved soil performance, carbon capture, crop nutrients and plant disease control. However, there is currently little understanding of how this will work for smallholders in Africa.

 It is too early to say definitively what the outcome of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) surge has been but the signs are encouraging. The increase in both ISAF and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) has enabled us to continue to take the fight to the insurgency through the winter months. This has led to the momentum of the insurgency being arrested and reversed in many areas. In addition, we expect the formal process of transition to Afghan-led security to begin shortly.</p>

 International engagement is critical to the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s response to the challenges it faces in cyberspace. As part of a wider international programme which is coordinated by the Cabinet Office, the MOD is working with key allies to develop an enhanced relationship on Defence-related cyber issues. It is anticipated that this activity will result in development of new memorandum of understandings with key allies.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) manages its surplus staff by using the Redeployment Pool (RDP). This service enables those who are or who will become surplus to be given priority consideration for vacancies. Staff in the RDP usually continue to work in their last directorate or are redeployed to cover short-term tasks. The RDP is also used by staff returning from overseas postings, including civilians supporting the armed services in operational theatres. The MOD is currently subject to a freeze on external recruitment and the RDP helps us to fill vacancies from within existing staff resources.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">A close and effective link between pay and performance is an important element of the reward arrangements for the Civil Service. The payments reflect the individual’s performance during the previous year, and are therefore a direct and immediate award to those who have achieved challenging objectives. The performance element of pay is known, colloquially but misleadingly, as a bonus. In fact, the performance-related element of pay is an integral part of an individual’s pay and not an addition to it: it is funded from the core pay bill. The non-consolidated element of pay has increased over the years as consolidated pay awards have formed a lower percentage of the total pay bill. They are a cost effective way of rewarding staff because there is no assumption that the awards will be repeated the following year, so they do not add to future pay bill growth, and because they are not pensionable.</p>

Some of these payments are paid in stages, and it is now usual to pay only part of the performance award immediately with the remainder deferred for two to three years and judged against the delivery of medium to longer term objectives.</p>

 I am working closely with the appropriate ministerial colleagues across Government to ensure that robust and high quality standards are in place for all assessors and installers operating under the Green Deal. At the end of 2010, DECC and the Department for Communities and Local Government issued a Call for Evidence seeking views on how to improve the energy performance of buildings in support of the Green Deal, including qualifications arrangements for energy assessors. We have also set up advisory forums for both the assessment and installation stages of the Green Deal. Through these forums we will work with the private, public and voluntary sectors to ensure that industry is appropriately supported and prepared to train and recruit the necessary people ahead of the Green Deal launch.

ALF is administered by individual Higher Education Institutions and Further Education Colleges that make their own decisions about how best to target their allocation, taking into account their student population and their knowledge of local circumstances. In the academic year 2009-10 (the most recent year for which we have data) the ALF was used to help around 89,000 full or part-time students.</p>

               <a name="1103083000675"> The ALF budget is announced one year at a time. The allocation for 2011/12 is £40 million. The following table shows how much funding was allocated by the Department to ALF in each of the past five years. Reductions in the ALF budget should be viewed in the context of improved statutory support for students.</p>

 The University Modernisation Fund provided teaching grants in the 2010/11 academic year for an extra 10,000 student places. Under the rules of the scheme, teaching costs for subsequent years would be met from efficiencies within those institutions taking up the places, rather than from Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) grant. In addition, £20 million was invested in projects to increase the take-up and effectiveness of shared services in the sector. Although all of the additional places were taken up and projects are in place to utilise the shared services element of the fund, it is too early to make an assessment of its effectiveness.</p>

               <a name="1103083000744"> BBSRC does not have fixed allocations for neuroscience funding. Future funding of neuroscience research by BBSRC is dependent on the quality and strategic relevance of grant applications. Funding will be allocated over the next four years in relation to relevance to BBSRC's strategic priorities and BBSRC's four-year spending review settlement. A smaller part of that neuroscience research historically funded by BBSRC now falls within BBSRC's current strategic priorities. It is likely, therefore, that there will be a reduction in BBSRC funding over the next spending review period for neuroscience research that is considered to fall outside BBSRC's strategic priorities. A precise level of funding for future neuroscience funding cannot be stated since, until BBSRC has received applications and their relevance and quality has been assessed, it will be difficult to determine, but as a broad estimate, not an allocation, which is all that is possible at this stage, BBSRC believe that their total neuroscience funding might run at approximately £36 million/year.</p>

 The Access to Learning Fund (ALF) is a discretionary fund that provides additional support for higher education students facing financial hardship. The Government have provided an ALF budget of £40 million for academic year 2010/11. ALF is administered by individual higher education institutions and further education colleges, which make their own decisions about how best to target their allocation, taking into account their student population and their knowledge of local circumstances. In the academic year 2009-10 (the most recent year for which we have data) the ALF was used to help around 89,000 full or part-time students.</p>

 The Air Travel Trust Fund meets the cost of refunds and repatriation arising from the insolvency of travel companies which are covered by the Air Travel Organisers License (ATOL) scheme. The deficit of the Fund was reported as £31.8m in the Funds' annual accounts for the year ending 31 March 2010.</p>

It is expected that the Fund’s will be in surplus within 3 years of the reforms being implemented. The precise timing depends on a number of factors, including the frequency and cost of travel company insolvencies.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 4 March 2011]:</i> There is a requirement for public security announcements to be made at rail stations as part of the National Rail Security Programme. Under this programme, announcements are set at a level proportionate to the prevailing threat and vulnerability, and are kept under constant review.</p>

 The retail prices index is part of the ongoing formula for capping rail fares and is taken into account automatically in the levels of premia/subsidy through the franchise agreements with each train operator. Separately, the Government are about to engage with the industry in negotiations on the effect on subsidy/premia of the change in the cap on regulated fares from RPI+1 to RPI+3 for the three years from Jan 2012 to Jan 2014. It would prejudice these discussions to make further details public.</p>

The FCO then placed the order with the brokers and, following intense discussions, flight options were confirmed with them at 11.52 pm the same evening.

By mid-morning on 23 February, a few countries had taken the risk of flying to Tripoli without prior landing permission, seeking landing permission from the control tower instead. No sanctions had been taken against them. We therefore informed the operator and requested them to fly in on this basis. The operator agreed. However, at this point it became apparent that the charter plane had developed a technical fault, preventing it from taking off. This fault was repaired as quickly as possible and the plane departed London Gatwick on the evening of 23 February.</p>

Our records show that other governments, including those of other EU member states, have helped over 150 British nationals to leave Libya. It is likely that additional British nationals were evacuated by their employers or our international partners without formal notification to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. The information provided is Management Information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National Statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example, figures given are estimates. Actuals are not available. Estimates for 2010-11 may be revised after the end of the cold weather payment season, but will still be estimates not actuals.
2. A cold weather payment is made to an eligible customer when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0°C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. (When the temperature criterion is met, the weather station is said to trigger.)
3. Each of the weather stations is linked both to an area within Stockton North constituency and also to an area outside Stockton North constituency. Estimated numbers given are for the weather station as a whole, not for the part of Stockton North constituency linked to the weather station.
4. If there is a further trigger for any of the weather stations this winter, that will not change the estimates of the number of benefit units that received at least one cold weather payment in 2010-11.
5. Cold weather payments are made to benefit units. A benefit unit can be a single person or a couple and can include children.
6. Some benefit units received more than one payment in a year.
7. Estimated numbers have been rounded to the nearest 100.

 The most commonly used measure of pensioner poverty relates to those with incomes below 60% of contemporary median income, after housing costs. Estimates of the number of pensioners who have been lifted out of poverty are not available, as each year different households are surveyed to produce low income statistics that are published in the Households Below Average Income series. However, information is available about the net change in the number of pensioners with incomes below 60% of contemporary median income.</p>

1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.
4. Numbers of people in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
5. Disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.
6. The household level poverty threshold is defined as the 60% of median equivalised disposable household income.

Totals may not sum due to rounding. Proportions are rounded to one decimal place.  3. Housing benefit figures exclude any extended payment cases, An extended payment is a payment that may be received for a further four weeks when they start working full time, work more hours or earn more money.  4. Age groups are based on the age on the count date (second Thursday in the month). Age breakdowns are given for single recipients by single year of age. Age bands for couples are based on the age of the oldest person. Single year of age is not readily available.  5. SHBE is a monthly electronic scan of claimant level data direct from local authority computer systems. It replaces quarterly aggregate clerical returns. The data is available monthly from November 2008, and November 2010 is the most recent available.  6. Housing benefit and council tax benefit are both household benefits. Populations of households by age are not available, and therefore proportions cannot be calculated.  <i>Source:</i>  Single Housing Benefit Extract (SHBE).

Officials are considering how best to communicate with people born on or after 6 April 1954 so that they can plan for their retirement and are investigating a number of options.

 The notice period given to individuals affected by bringing forward the increase of state pension to 66 has to be balanced against the need to ensure that the state pensions system is sustainable and fair to each generation. In order to address the rapid increases in life expectancy, it will not be possible to give a notice period similar to those given for previous increases in state pension age.</p>

The police service is already well aware of the value of ANPR, but decisions on when and how to use that technology are operational decisions for individual police forces in the context of dealing with the full range of local policing issues.</p>

 All detainees have access to secondary health care services, including mental health provision. Responsibility for providing secondary health care treatment for immigration detainees rests with primary care trusts, including the hospitalisation of those with acute mental health illness. There have on occasion been unacceptable delays in such detainees being provided with a bed, and the UK Border Agency has therefore been working with the Department of Health and Ministry of Justice’s Mental Health Unit to refine processes so that primary care trusts deliver treatment promptly.</p>

 The Interception Modernisation Programme was a programme under the last Government. As made clear in the strategic defence and security review, the Government will continue to build on an existing programme of work to preserve the ability of the law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications data and to intercept communications within the appropriate legal framework. We will legislate to ensure this is compatible with the Government’s approach to civil liberties and use of communications capabilities. As set out in the Home Office’s structural reform plan, details of this legislation will be announced in Parliament in due course.</p>

 The Home Office is fully supportive of the big society vision. It is clear that communities are safer places when local people are actively involved in maintaining order and have a say in how they are policed and how other services are provided. Baroness Newlove was appointed the Government's Champion for Active, Safer Communities in October 2010 and she will be making recommendations to Government about what needs to change in order to encourage and support more people to get actively involved in keeping their communities safer.</p>

 The law is very clear that children should live with their parents wherever possible. Where a child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm, the local authority has a duty to safeguard and promote the child's welfare. Local authorities cannot remove children from their parents (without the parents' consent) without first referring the matter to a court, and they cannot place a child for adoption (without the parents' consent) without a placement order made by a court.</p>

Data on the performance of the project are not currently available. However, the project is being independently evaluated and the report is expected in the Spring.</p>

 The Department has not commissioned research to examine the effect of levels of social capital on levels of educational attainment. The Centre for Research on the Wider Benefits of Learning (a research centre previously sponsored by the Department) has however published a report on this topic in 2007, “The development and impact of Young people's social capital in secondary schools”. This reports on three types of social capital and how they impact on education and wider outcomes.</p>

 The current school food standards were put in place because there was evidence that the quality of food in schools was not good. The standards have been fully implemented only since September 2009 after a phased introduction and they are still relatively new. We want to allow a period of ‘settling in’ before reviewing them. We will do this after the School Food Trust’s study of the provision and consumption of food at lunch time in secondary schools has reported.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 24 January 2011]:</i> We have had to make some difficult choices in order to tackle the budget deficit. Our first priority has been to protect the core education programmes offered by schools and colleges. This covers the whole range of courses including A levels, vocational qualifications, foundation learning and apprenticeships that equip young people with the knowledge and skills they need to progress.</p>

Schools and colleges will have the freedom to use this additional investment in the way they see fit in order to provide the activities that contribute to improved retention, attainment and successful progression. In addition we will also be re-investing over £200 million in increasing the size of programmes for students working below level 2 to give them the opportunity to gain level 1 and 2 qualifications.</p>

                     <sup>(l)</sup> The audit fee represents the cost for the audit of the Department's Consolidated Accounts and the Summarised Accounts of the NHS carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This amount does not include fees in respect of non-audit work. In 2008-09 of the total audit fee of £565,000, £65,000 relates to work undertaken in preparation for International Financial Reporting Standard implementation in 2009-10.
It should be noted that the Department of Health audit fee is a non-cash charge and therefore notional. NAO are funded directly by Parliament. In addition the NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency, which is not included in the table, and NHS Business Services Authority had audit fees for 2009-10 and 2008-09 that were non-cash.
<sup>(2)</sup> 2008-09 was first year and only from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009.
<sup>(3)</sup> Monitor also paid for audit of consolidated accounts of £86,000, £52,000 and £53,000 in 2009-10, 2008-09 and 2007-08 respectively.
<sup>(4)</sup> The 2007-08 and 2008-09 fees combine the fees incurred by the Health Protection Agency and National Institute for Biological Standards and Control before their merger on 1 April 2009.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. The source of figures is the audited accounts for the relevant year.
 2. All bodies were audited by the National Audit Office (NAO).

 We recently announced proposals that practitioners wishing to supply unlicensed herbal medicines should be required to be registered with the Health Professions Council. This will enable us to use a derogation in European medicines legislation which permits national arrangements allowing those designated as authorised healthcare professionals to commission an unlicensed medicine on their professional responsibility to meet the special needs of their individual patient. Under these arrangements we would envisage similar criteria applying to practitioners of herbal medicine as is the case with a range of other healthcare practitioners   <br/>

1. A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes.
2. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.
3. The data are provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made.
