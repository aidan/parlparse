 At least three months prior to a deployment all service personnel are briefed by their Chain of Command on the benefits of having a will, as well as a Lasting Power of Attorney. This powerful legal document gives another person or persons the power to make decisions with regard to service person's financial affairs and/or their health and personal welfare. These can be drawn up privately, in advance of a deployment, and can be revoked at any time.</p>

               <a name="11051744000187"> While in all three services personnel sign up to a specific engagement or commission, they are permitted to resign from their service before the end of this period provided they have completed a minimum return of service. In the Naval Service the initial commitment for Royal Navy Ratings is 18 years, Royal Marine Other Ranks is four years and Royal Navy Officers is 12 years. In the Army, Other Ranks enter an engagement of 12 years and Officers are given three years service from the date of commissioning with the option to extend once they receive a positive annual report. In the RAF, Airmen sign for an engagement of nine years and RAF Officers sign a permanent commission of 18 years reckonable service or until they reach the age of 40. The commitments above are general and may differ depending upon which trade or specialty is joined.</p>

 This Government expect the adoption system to work effectively for all looked-after children who would benefit from this permanent option and all local authorities to perform at the level of the best.

I have already published revised statutory adoption guidance, written to directors of children’s services and lead members setting out my expectations and set up the Ministerial Advisory Group on Adoption to steer the overall programme. At its next meeting, the group will discuss adoption breakdown and how to help ensure that adoptive families are appropriately supported.</p>

Most of the personal data which DFID do hold relate to current and former members of staff and to recipients of pensions paid to former employees of British colonial Governments. Most personal data held by DFID for these functions are stored in the UK or in country offices by DFID itself and in accordance with the Department's organisational data protection policy. Some data relating to staff are transferred on a case by case basis according to business need to third party suppliers, some of whom may be based outside the UK (for example, to make airline reservations or arrange shipments of personal freight to country offices).</p>

This funding paid the rental subsidies for 3,436 families for two months (January and February 2011), and hospitalisation and medical cover for 1,172 families (for December 2010); none of the funding was allocated for rebuilding work.</p>

 The most recent assessment of the humanitarian situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is the report by UNRWA, ‘Socio-economic survey of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon’, published in December 2010. UNRWA has said that it needs £350 million ($568 million) for 2011 to be able to carry out its work in the region, of which approximately £42 million ($68 million) will be spent in Lebanon. An additional £11 million ($18.51 million) will be needed for the rebuilding of Nahr el Bared camp and to support families to return their homes.</p>

The Lisbon treaty transferred from the rotating presidency to the High Representative the responsibilities for chairing the Foreign Affairs Council and representing common foreign policy positions agreed unanimously by the member states. This resolution now allows that, while remaining an observer, the EU itself can represent common agreed positions of member states in the General Assembly. EU representatives—including the President of the European Council or Baroness Ashton—can now be inscribed on the list of speakers among representatives of major groups in order to make early interventions and may be invited to participate in the general debate of the General Assembly, subject to the limits set out in the resolution text. It remains the case, however, that the EU representatives can only do this if the UK and other member states authorise them to do so. Furthermore, EU representatives speak and act on behalf of the 27 member states with their authorisation, not in addition to them.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 3 May 2011]:</i> The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my right hon.

The successful tenderer, FTI, was subsequently appointed in April at a cost of £100,000 excluding VAT. I refer the hon. Member to the news story about this appointment on my Department's website:</p>

 For the period in question, the only officials in the Department eligible for base pay increases are those earning under £21,000. The Department's pay systems are performance-related and do not reward staff for seniority.</p>

               <a name="11051752000713"> The provision of pay for promotion will depend on the number of promotions which take place in the period in question, which is difficult to predict. Staff would normally receive a 10% pay uplift following promotion to the next grade. The Department usually operates promotion gateways or boards, but these are currently suspended while the Department works through the implications of its transition programme.</p>

               <a name="11051752000714"> These promotions will be strictly controlled and are likely to be few in number in the current climate. Numbers of promotions cannot be predicted in advance as they are dependent on contingent business needs. The arrangements for non-consolidated performance-related pay for non-senior civil service staff are subject to the Treasury's annual civil service pay guidance. The overall ‘pot’ of money set aside for this will not increase in 2011-12 nor in 2012-13. Non-consolidated performance-related pay for senior civil service (SCS) staff is determined within a framework set by the Cabinet Office. The overall ‘pot’ for such awards will decrease in 2011-12.</p>

At the same time, an increasing amount of NHS research funding was awarded competitively through new NIHR programmes and schemes. The NHS organisations reported on their use of these allocations in annual R and D reports, and each report included figures for research spend in a range of disease areas. These figures have been included in any estimates made by the Department of total annual research spend in these disease areas up to 2008-09.</p>

A national consultation showed overwhelming support from the public for this flexibility, with over 70% of the public who commented in favour. We are currently considering issues raised in the consultation and will discuss with the profession in the normal way any proposed changes to existing arrangements.</p>

 DECC and DWP Ministers and officials are working closely together on data matching as an important part of the policy development and planning for the Core Group of the Warm Home Discount Scheme. The scheme will involve data matching DWP pension credit data with energy suppliers' customer data to give recipients a rebate on their energy bills. This follows the successful delivery of the pilot 2010 Energy Rebate Scheme (ERS), which led to over 200,000 older poorer pensioners receiving a discount of £80 off their electricity bill.</p>

This will lead to significant technical, security, operational and policy challenges. To seek to expand the scope of data matching before evaluating this wider use of existing powers would constitute a significant delivery risk.</p>

 12 providers are running National Citizen Service (NCS) pilots in 2011. The NCS pilot programme aims to test a range of different approaches to the delivery of the core NCS programme. One of the dimensions we are seeking to test is the impact of levying a small charge on participants. Half of the 2011 pilot providers are levying a charge for participation while the other half are not. Those providers levying a charge offer a range of discounts and bursaries, and are required to ensure that financial cost is not a barrier to participation for any young person who wishes to take part. The maximum charges by NCS provider are shown in the following table.</p>

 Over 4,400 National Citizen Service pilot places in 2011 will be offered by providers levying no charge for participants. The remainder of places will be offered according to each provider's fee scale, which in all cases allow for discounts and bursaries according to participants' ability to pay. Since so many participants will not pay a fee to participate, it is not appropriate to estimate the average amount payable per participant, but the range of maximum fees levied by those pilots charging a fee is between £20 and £99. Those providers levying a charge offer a range of discounts and bursaries, and are required to ensure that financial cost is not a barrier to participation for any young person who wishes to take part.</p>

From 2012, we will be publishing data on the number of deaths in each category of custody in the annual statistics on deaths reported to coroners which will provide greater transparency about these inquests. The Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody and the Coroners’ Society of England and Wales are also working together to develop a series of recommendations to address inquest delays. We are also committed to improving the coroner system and intend to achieve this through implementation of key provisions within part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Subject to parliamentary agreement, this will include removing rigid geographical boundary restrictions so that inquests can be transferred between coroners more easily to tackle and avoid delays.</p>

This explains why the average waiting time from receipt of the appeal at the SSCS to the first hearing has increased from 16.8 weeks in May 2010 to 19.0 weeks in December 2010. The SSCS Tribunal has continued to respond strongly to the significant increase in appeals. As the volumes of receipts have increased, so has the capacity of the tribunal to deal with them. It is increasing its capacity through the recruitment of additional staff, judicial medical tribunal members as well as a range of business improvements.</p>

 Returning officers must reject a postal ballot paper if they are not satisfied that a postal voting statement is duly completed. When a statement is selected for verification the returning officer must compare the date of birth and signature on the postal voting statement with those held by the electoral registration officer. The returning officer should reject the postal vote if the records do not match. These measures are important to ensure the integrity of the election process.</p>

The statement must be returned in the period between 10 and 15 working days after the close of the poll. I understand that the Commission plans to publish both local and national statistics on the issue and return of postal ballot packs at the 5 May polls in its report on the administration of the polls, due for publication in October.</p>

 As the Attorney-General made clear during the Commons debate on this issue on 10 February, it is very difficult to make an accurate estimate of the cost to the public purse, since we cannot know the number of prisoners that may bring a claim, nor can we be certain exactly how much compensation each prisoner might be awarded.</p>
