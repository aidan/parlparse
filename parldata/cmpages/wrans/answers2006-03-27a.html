<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60327w01.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The World Bank&#039;s Africa Action Plan, which forms part of the World Bank&#039;s response to the commitments made at Gleneagles last June and was endorsed by bank governors at their annual meeting in Washington in September, proposed the establishment of a &quot;Catalytic Growth Fund&quot;. Its purpose is to help Africa make faster progress on meeting the MDGs, particularly the &quot;hardest-to-reach&quot; ones like health and access to water, and increasing the rate of economic growth. Its aim is to complement other sources of development financing, including those from the International Development Association (IDA), while, at the same time, being innovative and creative in supporting countries that have shown an ability to make good use of increased amounts of aid, as well as countries with reforming and post-conflict Governments that show a commitment to reducing poverty. Money will also be given to regional projects to deal with needs that cross borders.

We welcome the Bank&#039;s agreement that use of the Fund will be guided by the priorities of the Africa Partnership Forum and that the World Bank will ensure regular consultations with Fund donors, African Governments and regional institutions.

<a name="stpa_0">The Fund will be financed by voluntary contributions from World Bank members. The UK is the first country to pledge support, our &#163;200 million contribution was announced in October 2005. The Bank is also seeking contributions from other donors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps he is taking to increase energy efficiency within his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [60336]</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60327w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) is strongly committed to the targets set out in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. During the refurbishments of our UK offices we incorporated many energy saving mechanisms; for instance, a new building management system allow us to monitor and manage energy usage to a much greater extent than in the past. DFID has also installed energy efficient heating systems and lighting systems which are movement sensitive and take account of natural lighting levels. An environment management system has been implemented at both UK offices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">DFID is also currently installing timers to regulate energy usage and additional sub-meters to monitor our energy usage even more closely in the future. We have ensured that 100 per cent. electricity used in our main UK offices is from renewable sources and we are also currently investigating additional options such as combined heat and power plants, solar panels and a wind turbine at our East Kilbride office. The design for the refurbishment of our East Kilbride office has received an &quot;excellent&quot; and the London office a &quot;very good&quot; rating under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). We are also actively encouraging staff to use energy 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Mar 2006 : Column 624W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
efficiently, for instance by switching off equipment when not in use rather than simply leaving on &quot;stand-by&quot;. DFID is also in the process of arranging under the Carbon Trust Framework Agreement, a carbon management programme including an energy audit of both UK offices.

 This year, DFID will spend around &#163;250 million in India&#151;the Department&#039;s largest country programme in the world.

<a name="stpa_3">DFID&#039;s India programme supports the achievement of the Government of India&#039;s (GoI) 10th Plan and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) poverty reduction targets, as outlined in our India Country Assistance Plan (CAP) for 2004&#150;08 (available on DFID&#039;s website www.dfid.gov.uk).

<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">The programme is provided in close partnership with the Union Government and the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal.

economic growth. Our funds are directed at increasing access to basic education and health and to improving the lives of poor people in rural and urban areas. We also promote better management of the environment and support activities to empower the poor, especially women and those who are less able to represent themselves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">For example, in West Bengal, our Kolkata Urban Services for the Poor Programme aims to help slum dwellers directly, through funding improvements to slum infrastructure (for example; better drainage, road systems, latrines, solid waste management), and indirectly and in the longer term through supporting overall city management, building in a poverty focus to urban planning, strengthening urban management systems, and working to help municipal authorities become more accountable to citizens. A parallel programme operates in Andhra Pradesh and one is also planned for Madhya Pradesh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">In Andhra Pradesh, our Rural Livelihoods Project supports the State Government in helping poor rural households to develop new livelihood options and landless farmers to earn income from the use of common lands through better use of water in drought-prone areas. The project aims to extend the reach of these schemes to target the poorest and most excluded groups including women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">Alongside assistance to its four focus states, DFID is strengthening its National Programme to provide significant resources for central programmes in key areas, including health and education where progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to accelerate. For example, DFID is currently supporting the Government of India&#039;s Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) programme with a &#163;210 million commitment in close collaboration with other donors. This programme is aimed at ensuring that by 2010, all children in India receive eight years of basic education of acceptable quality regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location and has already resulted in a reduction in the number of out of school children from 25 million in 2003 to 13.5 million in March 2005. DFID is also financing over 20 per cent. (&#163;128 million) of the Government of India&#039;s National Polio Eradication Programme, which has succeeded in confining this disease to only a few isolated pockets in the country.

<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para9">

<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> The department is taking a number of steps to tackle the systematic tendency for promoters to be overly optimistic in estimating capital costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_27">Firstly, to ensure that optimism bias is factored into decision making the department makes explicit adjustments to promoters cost estimates within economic appraisal. The adjustments are empirically based (e.g. using data on cost overruns for transport projects in the past).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_28">Secondly, the department is taking a number of steps to try to reduce optimism bias in the future. These include:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">Issuing improved guidance on cost estimation and risk assessment (including requiring a Quantitative Risk Assessment to be undertaken for all larger major schemes).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">Involving private sector contractors earlier in scheme development to help to better estimate costs, improve scheme design and to ensure that schemes are planned in a way that uses existing capacity effectively.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">Providing greater incentives for scheme promoters to produce realistic estimates of cost. This is achieved by only committing to fund risk adjusted cost estimates excluding optimism bias and not automatically funding cost overruns.</p>

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60327w04.html_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> A range of appraisal information including assessments using the New Approach to Transport Appraisal system, is required alongside all schemes submitted to the department for funding. Traffic forecasts are used by scheme promoters as part of these appraisals. There is departmental guidance available to promoters, setting out the appropriate use of forecasting techniques, to ensure that traffic is realistically forecasted. The forecasts are checked by the promoters, such as the Highways Agency or other appropriate body, and by the department&#039;s modellers. The full appraisal is finally inspected by the department as part of the value for money assessment, to provide ministers with advice on the case for a particular scheme.

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60327w04.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> The Department, as a matter of routine, expects to assess the impacts arising from major transport schemes which it has supported, against, the forecasts originally made, in order to learn lessons for future schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w04.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_29">With regard to rail, the Department has been monitoring the usage of section one of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link against the original forecasts, as reported by the National Audit Office in their report &quot;Progress on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link&quot;, published in July 2005. Further examples of similar evaluations are the studies regarding the Jubilee Line Extension and the Manchester and Sheffield Light Rail Schemes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport which major <i>(a)</i> road, <i>(b)</i> rail and <i>(c)</i> other schemes approved since 1997 have assessed future patronage or traffic levels based on (i) a fixed trip matrix and (ii) other forecast models.  [60595]</p>




<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60327w04.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> The Department does not ordinarily compile information on the modelling technique used by external promoters in assessing future patronage; to compile a list of schemes on this basis would be prohibitively expensive. However, scheme promoters are expected to use appropriate techniques in the appraisals of a project, using the guidance published by the Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_31">Since 1997, of some sixty Highways Agency road schemes that have been approved, around 90 per cent. were appraised using a fixed trip matrix method to assess future traffic levels; a similar proportion would be expected for local authority major road schemes. The &#039;elasticity&#039; approach has been the alternative used in larger schemes. This technique models the growth in traffic induced by the completion of a transport improvement&#151;something a fixed trip matrix would not do. The Department for Transport has recently published guidance for road scheme promoters to encourage greater use of improved &#039;variable demand&#039; appraisal techniques. All rail schemes are assessed using an &#039;elasticity&#039; approach. In the largest schemes, affecting a number of modes, full multi-modal studies are conducted which would better articulate modal change as well as induced traffic.

 As indicated in the BBC Charter Review White Paper published on 14 March, responses to last year&#039;s Green Paper consultation identified a range of groups with a case for concessionary TV licences, pensioners below the age of 75; people on low incomes; partially sighted people; students; people in hostels for homeless people; members of the armed services; and catering staff in communal accommodation. However, there was no clear consensus on how such concessions should be allocated or funded and the White Paper therefore proposes no changes to the existing concessions. The draft Charter and Agreement was published along with the White Paper and as my right hon.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60327w11.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 March 2006]:</i> The Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) system was set up by the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 and encompasses (i) regulation by the Environment Agency of industrial installations subject to the requirements of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, and (ii) regulation by local authorities of some 23,000 generally smaller industrial installations in respect of their emissions to air. Local authorities are also responsible for the regulation of about 10 per cent. of the some 4,500 installations subject to IPPC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w11.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_84">These regulators recover their costs through charges made to each operator who holds a permit issued under the PPC system. The income from these charges is set out in the tables which cover the annual periods from 2000 in which year the PPC Regulations came into force. The increasing income to the Environment Agency arises because installations subject to IPPC requirements are being phased into the new system according to a timetable laid down in the PPC Regulations extending from late 2000 to early 2007. Many of those installations were already subject to integrated pollution control under the system introduced by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and which IPPC is superseding. The local authority income from charges does not vary so much from year to year because it includes income from the predecessor controls under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w11.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_85">While these charges account for a large part of the administrative costs of the PPC system, operators may also incur costs directly in preparing applications for permits and, on a recurring basis, responding to routine monitoring and other information requirements of their permits. No estimates of these on an annual basis are available.

WIP&#039;s second overarching target is to create the conditions in which the investment needed to meet our 2010, 2013 and 2020 landfill directive targets can take place. This remains a highly challenging objective but we are confident that good progress is being made toward achieving it.

 There is currently no administrative backlog of appeals at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT).

Those cases experienced a delay in initial processing (acknowledgment and issue of papers to the respondent requesting the appeal bundle) of up to 16 weeks. The administrative backlog was cleared by the end of December 2005.

As a result of work load volumes, and the clearance of backlogged cases, the AIT is currently listing entry clearance and family visit appeals at 16 weeks from receipt of the appeal bundle. This represents a departure of between eight and 12 weeks from steady-state time scales.

<sup>(22)</sup> The working age economic inactivity rate is equal to the number of people who are neither in employment nor unemployed as a percentage of the total population of working age. Working age is taken as ages 16 to 59 for females and 16 to 64 for males.<br>

Note:<br>

Estimates for parliamentary constituency areas are based on relatively small sample sizes and are therefore subject to a higher degree of sampling variability. They should therefore be treated with caution and, in particular, changes from year-to-year should not be used in isolation from the figures for a run of years.<br>
