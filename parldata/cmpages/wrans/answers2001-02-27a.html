 When my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met Secretary of State Powell in Washington on 6 February both agreed that maintaining NATO as an effective transatlantic military alliance is fundamental to European security.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made it clear in his joint statement with President Bush on 23 February that this Government are committed to a stronger Transatlantic Alliance and that NATO will remain the essential foundation of transatlantic security.

 I have seen the Israeli Ambassador several times since taking up my post. I hosted a lunch for Eitan Bentsur on 15 February.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his assessment is of the prospects for permanent peace in the middle east.  [149734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The cycle of violence is undermining the confidence of both sides in the peace process. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Designate Sharon's statement that he plans to continue with the peace process and to ease the conditions for Palestinians. However, the closures in the Occupied Territories breed resentment and fuel violence. The UK continues to urge both sides to take the steps needed to restore calm and re-engage in whole-hearted peace efforts.

<P>
35. <a name="10227w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jim Murphy: </B>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met the new Israeli Ambassador on 14 February and Prime Minister Sharon's special envoy, Eitan Bentsur, on 15 February. He also met with the Palestinian General Delegate on 15 February.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations have been made to the Syrian regime about the sheltering of Alois Brunner.  [149714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We have not made representations to the Syrian Government about Alois Brunner. There is general agreement that he is almost certainly dead. Inquiries in recent years by the French and German Governments and by journalists have failed to produce evidence of his whereabouts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We welcome the talks between Belize and Guatemala held under the auspices of the Organisation of American States (OAS). After a constructive meeting in Miami on 16 and 17 January they signed a Plan of Action to implement an Agreement on Confidence Building Measures which they had agreed in Washington on 8 November 2000.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para1">At further talks in Washington on 5-7 February they agreed a process for addressing the substantive aspects of their border dispute. They have agreed to hold a Ministerial meeting in Washington on 21-23 May.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para2">We welcome the constructive spirit in which these talks are being conducted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had a bilateral meeting with Foreign Minister Cem in the margins of the OSCE Ministerial Council in Vienna in November. They also met briefly at the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels in December, and are both attending the North Atlantic Council in Brussels today. FCO Ministers are also in regular contact with the Turkish Ambassador in London.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on his Department's role in processing export licences for sales to India; and how many such applications are currently awaiting processing by his Department.  [149718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 As an adviser to the DTI, we consider all export licence applications on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national export licensing criteria. In 2000, the FCO processed over 1,200 export licence 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 585W</I><P>
applications for India. As of 20 February, the FCO was considering 34 Standard Individual Export Licence applications for India and 23 Open Individual Export Licences which included India as a destination.

<P>
17. <a name="10227w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement about the UK's relations with Egypt.  [149719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The British Government have excellent relations with the Government of Egypt. UK/Egypt trade relations are also very strong and continue to grow; we are now the largest non-Arab investor in Egypt. I visited Egypt last month.

<a name="10227w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Ecuador</center></H4>


<P>
18. <a name="10227w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent discussions he has had regarding the political situation in Ecuador.  [149720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I spoke to the Ecuadorean Ambassador about the political situation in his country when he called on me on 1 February.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para3">The Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sir John Kerr, also held wide- ranging discussions with Ministers and senior officials when he visited Ecuador on 14-15 January.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para4">We have been following recent events closely and are pleased to note that the recent disputes between the Government and protesters over the economic reform measures have been settled.

<a name="10227w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Kashmir</center></H4>


<P>
19. <a name="10227w01.html_wqn12"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the situation in Kashmir.  [149721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We have welcomed the recent developments in Kashmir, including the announcement by the Indian Prime Minister on 22 February to extend the ceasefire by Indian security forces until the end of May. We believe this indicates a commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the Kashmir conflict. We hope that the ceasefire, and the Pakistani Government's policy of maximum restraint, will help create the conditions for a settlement to be reached. We call on both Governments to continue to build on the desire for peace in Kashmir and resume their dialogue to find a solution. We also urge the militants to respond positively and end their violence.

<a name="10227w01.html_sbhd9"><H4><center>NHS Recruitment</center></H4>


<P>
20. <a name="10227w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Hammond: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent representations his Department has received from other Governments regarding recruitment on behalf of the NHS of staff in their countries.  [149722]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The recruitment of staff for the NHS is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and his Department. However, we have received a number of representations on the international recruitment of medical staff as part of our normal bilateral dialogues with other countries.




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 586W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para5">Recruiting medical staff from around the world to help improve the NHS presents an opportunity further to encourage international co-operation and exchange. But we also need to ensure that this recruitment does not undermine local health care systems in developing countries. The 1999 NHS Guidance on International Recruitment states that NHS employers should not actively recruit from developing countries that are experiencing shortages of their own.

<P>
21. <a name="10227w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> the European Union are taking to tackle environmental pollution and nuclear contamination problems in the former Soviet central Asian republics.  [149723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are aware that water quality is one of the major environmental problems in Central Asia. The UK, in co-operation with other international donors, is encouraging improved regional water co-operation. We will also be supporting a project in the Nura-Ishim river basin in Kazakhstan to reduce industrial pollution levels.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para6">We will be supporting a &#163;600,000 project to produce a land use plan for the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan. We are also considering funding a decommissioning plan for the Aktau Nuclear Power Plant, and UK experts are transferring technical know-how to the plant.
<P>

<a name="10227w01.html_para7">The EU is supporting various projects to tackle environmental problems in Central Asia, such as water management and air pollution. It is also helping to fund the safe enclosure of the Aktau plant.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he plans to have with his European counterparts regarding the status of the EU charter of fundamental rights.  [149724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Charter was proclaimed as a political declaration at Nice in December. It was agreed that the status of the Charter would be reviewed at the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions have taken place concerning the agenda for the 2004 IGC in relation to institutional reform.  [149728]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 A Declaration in the Treaty of Nice sets out four issues to be discussed by the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. These are a more precise delimitation of competencies between the European Union and member states, the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, simplification of the Treaties, and the role of national Parliaments in European architecture.




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 587W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10227w02.html_para0">The Declaration also called for a deeper and wider debate on the future of the European Union, and mandated the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies to initiate a wide-ranging discussion with all interested parties, including representatives of national Parliaments, members of civil society and the candidate states. The Swedish Presidency will report on this process to the Gothenburg European Council in June.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the decision of Judge Guzman in Chile to bring charges against ex-President Pinochet in connection with the caravan of death.  [149727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 On 31 January Judge Guzman charged ex-President Pinochet with being the co-author of 57 deaths and 18 kidnappings perpetrated by the so-called "Caravan of Death" in Chile. We believe that those responsible for such atrocities should be brought to justice and we support the Chilean authorities in their pursuit of the due process of Chilean law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 With the full support of the international community, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNAET) is establishing institutions and preparing the ground for elections and independence later in the year.
<P>

<a name="10227w02.html_para1">We welcome recent progress made by the UNAET Prosecutor General in bringing to account those responsible for committing crimes in East Timor. We call on the UN, the East Timorese leadership and the Indonesians to build on their achievements and to maintain momentum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are pleased to see the recent political crisis resolved peacefully, in accordance with the Philippines' democratic traditions. We note President Arroyo's pledges for good governance and poverty alleviation. We welcome her resumption of peace negotiations with the rebel groups. We look forward to working closely with her Administration.

30. <a name="10227w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Syms: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions his Department has had with the United States Administration on proposed anti-missile defence systems.  [149732]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary recently held discussions in Washington with Vice- President Cheney, National Security Adviser Rice and Secretary of State Powell on a range of issues including National Missile Defence.
<P>

<a name="10227w02.html_para2">These discussions, and those my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister had last week with President Bush, clearly demonstrated the constructive approach being taken by the Bush Administration. The US Administration reaffirmed their commitment to a National Missile defence system but stressed their willingness to take their time to consult Allies, Russia and others. They confirmed that no decision had yet been made on the development or deployment of a specific system. It is therefore too early to assess any implications for the UK.

<a name="10227w02.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Burma</center></H4>


<P>
31. <a name="10227w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the emerging dialogue between the Burmese regime and opposition figures.  [149733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We cautiously welcome reports that the Burmese regime have had a series of contacts with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We hope that these will eventually be broadened to include the ethnic minorities and lead to a lasting peaceful solution to the political problems in Burma. But the UK will not soften its policy until there is real progress in Burma.

33. <a name="10227w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. John Cryer: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he has had with the US Government regarding the implementation of Plan Colombia by the Colombian Government.  [149736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We have had regular discussions with the US Government regarding the implementation of Plan Colombia. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster intends to discuss developments in Colombia with the new US Administration in March, as well as development of the separate EU package.

34. <a name="10227w02.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. David Taylor: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs when he last met the ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Congo; and what topics were discussed.  [149737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) met the Charge d'Affaires for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) when the DRC Foreign Minister visited the UK in December. The Special Representative for the Great Lakes met him on 2 February. On both occasions discussions focused on relaunching the Lusaka peace process.

<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 589W</I><P>
the arrest, detention and beating of two Christian young men for distributing the video film "Jesus" in Jacobabad.  [149739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We are aware that Khalid and Nasir Masih were arrested on 11 January for distributing videos and literature to the Christian community in Jacobabad. Our High Commission in Islamabad continues to raise our concerns over the position of religious minorities with the Pakistani authorities and maintains regular dialogue with Christian and human rights groups.

 Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a licence to export computer equipment, including 10 Fujitsu Siemens Scenic ED-1170A computers and two Fujitsu Siemens Lifebook C-6545 Notebook computers, controlled under the Dual Use Items (Export Control) Regulations 2000, to Iraq for the use by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in its humanitarian activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs at what stage it is Her Majesty's Government's policy to make representations against the use of the death penalty in cases of British nationals being tried overseas.  [151836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Our overriding objective is to avoid the execution of British nationals. We will now express our opposition to the death penalty and its use on a British national at whatever stage and level is judged appropriate from the moment when the imposition of a death sentence on a British national becomes a possibility. Our previous policy was to make these representations only when the judicial process had been exhausted.
<P>

<a name="10227w03.html_para0">We have already taken action under the new policy in the case of Krishna Maharaj. Baroness Scotland, the Minister responsible for Consular matters, has written to the Florida State Attorney setting out the UK's opposition to the death penalty and requesting that the death sentence not be pursued in his case.

 Applications for free television licences for people living in accommodation which qualifies for the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary licence scheme are made by housing managers when existing ARC licences fall due for renewal, rather than by individual residents. Information provided by the BBC, which is responsible for the administration of both concessionary schemes, indicates that since November 2000 applications have been received from about 10,500 residential and nursing homes and sheltered housing schemes. A number of these applications have still to be processed but approximately 44,500 residents have so far benefited from a free TV licence. The renewal cycle for ARC licences is spread across the year, on a monthly basis, and the BBC expects approximately 500,000 residents to qualify in total.

<a name="10227w04.html_para10">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 1,044,900; in Norwich, North the number has reduced from 2,800 to 1,700. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally and in Norwich, North from 1,600 to 1,100.

<a name="10227w04.html_para12">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 19,400 pensioners in Norwich, North will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 7,800 in Norwich, North. 2,700 pensioner families in Norwich, North are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.

These numbers include complaints about standards of service and cases in which dissatisfaction has been expressed with the outcome of benefit decisions.
<BR>
There has been a steady increase in the number of complaints throughout this period. Between April 1999 and June 2000, this can be attributed to an increase in work on hand before and after the introduction of DMA and it should be noted that the figures have steadily decreased each month since July 2000. Changes to DLA procedures led initially to a significant increase in the time taken to process each case, which created a temporary backlog of work. This was tackled as a priority and is now under control.

 I have today laid before the House a Special Grant Report which sets out the arrangements for reimbursing local authorities in England for the costs of supporting unaccompanied asylum seeking children as a result of their duties under the Children Act 1989.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 ends asylum seekers' entitlement to all social security benefits and is replaced by a system of support in kind, with small cash payments. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has on a phase basis assumed responsibility for supporting all new eligible asylum seekers and this support is provided mainly by way of vouchers. The maternity payment is provided in the same way.
<P>

<a name="10227w05.html_para9">The maternity payment vouchers have a four week expiry date because the maternity grant is provided to assist with the initial costs of provision for a new baby.

 The Head of the Strategic Policy Team took up post in April 2000. The rest of the team was then recruited, the last member joining in October 2000.
<P>

<a name="10227w05.html_para10">The team is an integral part of the Home Department, producing research and advice for Ministers. Its first major piece of work has been co-ordinating the production of "Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead", which was laid before Parliament on 26 February.
<P>

<a name="10227w05.html_para11">The team comprises eight departmental members of staff, seven of whom are full time. It employs one full time agency secretary. Where it examines issues cutting across more than one Department, it may involve staff from other Departments or from outside Government on secondment for the length of the project in question. For example, in its current work on criminal justice, it has received secondments for short periods of two officials from the Lord Chancellor's Department and one from the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="10227w05.html_para12">Special advisers contribute to the team's work as necessary in the same way as to that of other parts of the Department, and consistent with the Model Contract for Special Advisers.

<P>
<a name="10227w06.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many reported cases involving domestic violence there were in England and Wales during the last 12 months.  [151013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Domestic violence is not separately identified in recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office. However, estimates for the numbers of domestic violence offences in 1999 are available from the 2000 British Crime Survey (BCS). Figures are also available from returns submitted to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary relating to domestic violence 'incidents' notified by police forces in England and Wales (whether or not they are subsequently recorded as crimes).
<P>

<a name="10227w06.html_para0">The best estimate from the BCS is that there were 761,000 offences of domestic violence in 1999. Returns from the police indicate that there were 398,670 incidents notified to the police in 1999-2000. The BCS figure is higher than that from police 'incident' returns because not all victims will report what happened to the police. The BCS figure is an estimate only. As it is derived from a sample, it is subject to sampling error. Also, some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. A different--more confidential--approach to measuring domestic violence in the 1996 sweep of the BCS produced higher estimates than from the conventional approach, as used to derive the 761,000 incidents in 1999.
<P>

<a name="10227w06.html_para1">The BCS and police figures cover incidents against men and women. In the BCS, 74 per cent. of the offences involved women as victims (around 560,000 incidents). This information is not available from the police 'incident' returns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There have been no reports from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary on the cost- effectiveness of child abuse investigations. The police have a duty to investigate all allegations of child abuse fully and thoroughly, and in accordance with the law. It is for individual Chief Constables to decide on the most appropriate methods of investigation in each case.
<P>

<a name="10227w06.html_para2">I have been in discussion with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary about what more can be done to ensure that the procedures in place for conducting these very difficult investigations are fair and robust.
<P>

<a name="10227w06.html_para3">ACPO are currently drawing up a manual for Senior Investigating Officers working in child abuse cases, which will include a section on good practice in tracing potential witnesses and obtaining corroborative evidence. This will provide detailed operational guidance on how to conduct such investigations, while recognising that investigators must follow emerging evidence and treat each case on its merits. In parallel with this, an inter-agency working group is currently reviewing the procedures for investigating the abuse of children in care or looked

after children in the context of taking forward the Government's response to the Waterhouse Report "Lost in Care". This review will lead to the development of practical, procedural guidance to the police and social services on the handling of complex abuse investigations.
<P>

<a name="10227w06.html_para4">Both sets of best practice guidance should be completed by the end of March. Together they will provide a coherent policy framework for how to conduct child abuse investigations, building on best practice drawn from around the country and ensuring that the necessary procedures are in place to safeguard against the risk of false allegations.

 Boards of Visitors annual reports are not published documents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w07.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Following the decision by the United Kingdom to abandon its offensive chemical weapons capability in 1956 there was a requirement to dispose of the stockpile of the chemical blister agent mustard which had been built up at the time of World War II.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para0">In accordance with the practice of the day these stockpiles were burnt in either open pits or incinerators. No evaluations were made at the time of the effects on neighbouring civilian populations. However, the RAF has conducted extensive research into its historical disposal of chemical weapons.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para1">Today any historical chemical weapons which are recovered are taken to CBD Porton Down for safe disposal. Part of the disposal process of any of these weapons which contain mustard includes incineration. This is undertaken in an on-site incinerator which meets all the standards set by the Environment Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what checks are carried out on <i>(a)</i> batches of depleted uranium raw material and finished ammunition and <i>(b)</i> imported ammunition;  [150081]
<P>
<UL>(2) what checks are undertaken to ensure that depleted uranium used for ammunition manufacture is not contaminated with other radioactive materials.  [150080]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 It has long been known in the scientific community, the nuclear industry and by the Ministry of Defence that depleted uranium (DU) might contain minute traces of isotopes other than U-238, U-235 and U-234.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para2">Two types of DU based ammunition are in-service with British Forces: the UK manufactured 120mm anti-armour round and the US manufactured 20mm RN Phalanx round.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para3">My Department procures all ammunition to given specifications. It is the manufacturers' responsibility to establish the suitability of raw materials used in manufacture.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para4">Phalanx ammunition is sold to the UK via the US Department of Defence (DOD). All of DOD's DU comes from three Department of Energy (DOE) gaseous diffusion plants: Paducah, Kentucky; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Portsmouth, Ohio. All three of these plants received recycled uranium that contained trace amounts of transuranics.




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 609W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para5">RO buy their DU from Starmet Corporation who in turn buy it from DOE. They have no practical way of determining exactly where the input material came from. They believe that it was mostly from Paducah, Kentucky, but it was all produced at their plants at Concord and Barnwell in the US.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para6">Starmet have found traces of transuranic elements in their DU. However, the amounts were so small that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission simply amended Starmet's licence to accommodate the traces. Given that the amounts of contaminates are so small, and pose no additional risk to health, it is not considered worthwhile to try to remove them.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para7">On receipt by my Department, and periodically thereafter, all ammunition, including that containing DU, is subject to inspection in accordance with stringent guidelines. Where appropriate, in-service surveillance, proof and maintenance firing is undertaken to ensure that the ammunition continues to meet the required quality standards throughout its life. Before issue for use, DU ammunition is inspected, and the radiation dose rates are monitored to ensure that it meets transportation criteria. DU ammunition is also subject to regular dose rate monitoring in accordance with Departmental procedures while in storage depots.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para8">There are no specific checks undertaken which determine whether or not the DU contained in UK in-service ammunition is contaminated with other radioactive materials. However, any significant increase in the quantity of high activity radionuclides would be detected by our routine radiation monitoring.
<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para9">In view of the recent public interest in DU contamination by other radioactive materials, my Department intends to confirm the data provided by the manufacturer which was published on 7 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 519-22W. We will analyse the composition of CHARM 3 ammunition using an independent laboratory, and publish the results.

<P>
<a name="10227w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many of the personnel who have contracted malaria as a result of deployment to Sierra Leone did not receive anti-malarial treatment until they were in Sierra Leone; and if he will make a statement.  [150672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w07.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As of 21 February, there were 113 confirmed cases of malaria among Service personnel who deployed to Sierra Leone. On the basis of the investigations undertaken by my Department, of these 113 cases, there are no more than 10 personnel who did not receive their anti-malarial treatment until after arriving in Sierra Leone. In all but one case this was as a result of their deploying at very short notice. Within 24 hours of these personnel arriving in theatre, however, the French drug Savarine was procured locally and distributed. Steps were immediately taken to procure Mefloquine, the preferred anti-malarial treatment, from the UK and all personnel taking Savarine transferred to Mefloquine within four days. The other individual was temporarily absent from his unit on duty just prior to deploying and missed the issue of Mefloquine. He was issued with Mefloquine as soon as the problem came to light between two to five days after his arrival in theatre.




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 610W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10227w07.html_para10">No anti-malarial drug is 100 per cent. effective and the degree of protection can be subject to a wide range of factors; for example, the geographical location, the season, and the activities undertaken by the individuals concerned. Therefore, as well as anti-malarial drugs, other types of protection and environmental controls are used. Even with such precautions, however, malaria is not wholly preventable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 8 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 631W and his subsequent letter, (1) if he will list the serviceability targets for each year from 1995 to 2001 inclusive for <i>(a)</i> Warrior variants, <i>(b)</i> Challenger 1, <i>(c)</i> Challenger 2, <i>(d)</i> Saxon variants, <i>(e)</i> AVF 430 variants, <i>(f)</i> Sabre, <i>(g)</i> Striker, <i>(h)</i> Scimitar, <i>(i)</i> Spartan, <i>(j)</i> Sultan, <i>(k)</i> Samaritan and <i>(l)</i> Samson; and if he will make a statement;  [151037]
<P>
<UL>(2) on what date the decision was made to change the system of fully operational serviceability targets for the Army tank fleet from readiness in 24 hours to immediate availability; for what operational reasons; and if he will make a statement.  [151038]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10227w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> The decision to change the system of reporting equipment availability was taken in May last year. The change was made following the adoption of the Formation Readiness Cycle which places different units in the Army at different readiness states. Some of these states require equipment to be available immediately (ie capable of undertaking the task to which it has been allocated), while for others a much longer lead time will be acceptable.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> The Government are advised on matters of food safety by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
<P>

<a name="10227w08.html_para0">The FSA has examined the issue of the safety of beef from France. Dr Christl Donnelly of Imperial College, London has made an assessment of the risks to the consumer from BSE arising from imports of French beef. The results were published in "Nature" on 14 December 2000. The study concluded that if the United Kingdom's over-thirty-month (OTM) rule is fully enforced there is virtually no risk from BSE in French beef imported into the UK. If the OTM rule is only 75 per cent. enforced, then risks posed by British and French meat sold in the UK would be the same. The FSA estimates that OTM enforcement levels in the UK are above 75 per cent.




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2001 : Column: 612W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10227w08.html_para1">In these circumstances, the FSA concluded that a ban on the importation of beef from France would not be proportionate to the risk and could not therefore be justified.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> The Government are advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that its decision not to recommend a ban on the importation of beef from France is based on two key regulatory requirements, namely the controls on specified risk materials (SRM), and the over-thirty-month (OTM) rule, and on a scientific assessment of the risks of BSE associated with French beef.
<P>

<a name="10227w08.html_para2">European Union rules, which took effect from 1 October 2000, now require the removal of SRM from beef carcases in the country of origin, and United Kingdom legislation prohibits the import of beef containing SRM. The OTM rule prohibits the sale for human consumption of beef from animals over the age of thirty months at time of slaughter. This rule applies equally to beef from cattle that are slaughtered in the UK (with minor exceptions) and to imported beef (again with minor exceptions).

The FSA has also written to local authorities to advise them that all meat plants under local authority supervision which are likely to receive consignments of German beef should be subject to further random checks, in which any beef from Germany should be inspected.
<P>

<a name="10227w08.html_para9">The OTM rule prohibits the sale for human consumption of beef from animals over the age of thirty months at time of slaughter. This rule applies equally to home produced and imported beef, with the exception of beef from 14 specified non-EU countries with no history of BSE. In November 2000 the FSA instructed local authorities and the Meat Hygiene Service to step up their OTM rule enforcement checks in respect of imported beef. The responses from the enforcement authorities show a high level of compliance with the OTM rule.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2001]:</i> As a general rule, fresh meat imported into the United Kingdom from other European Union member states is subject only to random spot checks at places of destination. The responsibility for ensuring that only meat which complies with EU hygiene and BSE controls is exported to other member States rests with the competent authorities in each member state.

 Misoprostol is not currently licensed for the induction of labour. The Department has asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to provide clinical guidelines on the induction of labour and their report is expected this summer.
<P>

<a name="10227w09.html_para4">Our view is that until such time as the NICE guidelines are issued, use of misoprostol for the induction of labour should only be administered under properly managed clinical trials where the risks and benefits of the drug are fully explained and understood by women.
<P>

<a name="10227w09.html_para5">Since March 1998, the Medicines Control Agency has received and approved 22 notifications for clinical trials of misoprostol in the United Kingdom from consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists. These notifications have been made under the provisions of the Doctors and Dentists Exemption Scheme. Details of clinical trials, including data collated during trials, are not normally released, without the consent of the parties concerned, as there are legitimate commercial and other confidential interests which cannot be disclosed. Such interests are recognised in the current administrative Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and also in the Freedom of information legislation.

 The labelling of medicinal products for human and animal use is governed by European law, which requires all labels to show certain information including a qualitative and quantitative statement of active ingredients and a list of other key ingredients. It is not possible to introduce a requirement for labels to identify those ingredients of an animal origin without an amendment to European law.

<a name="10227w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance on the appropriate use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) has been circulated very widely: copies were sent to health authorities, National Health Service trusts, general practitioners and many other health professionals, as well as to community health councils and patients' groups. Additional resources have been made available within health authority unified allocations to support the implementation of NICE recommendations generally. Implementation of this NICE guidance on the use of ICDs will lead to an increase in the number of ICDs implanted but, as NICE acknowledge, we will need to develop the capacity to achieve this increase in implantation rates. This will be taken forward within the overall programme of work to improve and expand services for coronary heart disease (CHD) in line with the CHD National Service Framework.
<P>

<a name="10227w09.html_para6">Comprehensive data about implantation rates by region or health authority are not available. The most recent national figures relate to 1998 and show the rate then, as stated in the question, as 17 per million population.

<a name="10227w09.html_para7">Following a recommendation from the Ombudsman, the Medicines Control Agency is currently reviewing its procedures for handling requests under the Code. In addition the Agency is examining the information held by the MCA (which currently totals around 400 different types) to determine, for example, what can be routinely published or what could be pre-prepared in anticipation of requests. This work will intensify over the coming months in preparation for the implementation of the Freedom of Information legislation. These initiatives will streamline arrangements for dealing with requests for information and enable a greater number of inquiries to be answered within 20 working days.

 Nurses are well placed to identify when a child may be suffering, or be at risk of significant harm. Like any other professional, a nurse must take appropriate action in accordance with locally agreed procedures, if he or she believes that a child is at such risk. This may involve a referral to local child protection services, which may include the police who then inquire as appropriate into the circumstances of the case.

 We are committed to researching into the nature and extent of child abuse and its causes. Development of policy aimed at tackling child maltreatment is informed and influenced by published research in this complex field such as that carried out by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The revised "Working Together to Safeguard Children" (1999) guidance on child protection reflects the key messages from a programme of research studies into child protection issues commissioned by the Department of Health, "Child Protection: messages from research" (1995).

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> In order to provide cutting services to other outlets, butchers need to have their premises licensed as cutting plants under the red meat or poultry meat hygiene and inspection Regulations, which implement European Union Directives. The Regulations only exempt butchers who cut meat for sale from their own premises directly to the final consumer.
<P>

<a name="10227w11.html_para0">However, under guidance originally issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to cater for trading practices in Great Britain, exempt butchers may supply their other branches or mobile shops with up to 50 per cent. or 1 tonne (whichever is the lesser) of their production per week, provided the rest is sold from the premises where the meat is cut. In England and Wales, exempt butchers may also use shops not in their ownership as subsidiary outlets, provided they retain ownership of the meat until its sale to the final consumer, subject to the overall 50 per cent. or 1 tonne weekly limit.

 Local authorities have the same duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of unaccompanied asylum seeking children as they do for the indigenous population of children in need. All local authorities have a duty under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 to provide services for all children in need in their area, including accommodation and support. There are currently approximately 6,000 unaccompanied asylum seeking children in the United Kingdom, the majority of whom are aged 16 and 17. They are generally provided with support under Section 17 of the Children Act, with those aged under 16 being formally looked after under Section 20 of the Act.

 National Health Service sight tests are provided by community opticians at no charge to the patient. Prior to 1989 there was universal entitlement but, from 1 April 1989, eligibility was restricted to children, people on low incomes and people suffering from or predisposed to certain eye diseases. With effect from 1 April 1999 we restored eligibility to everyone aged 60 or over so that less than 50 per cent. of the population now has to pay for private sight tests. The cost of a private sight test varies between optical practices.

 We introduced a number of Best Value Indicators in 2000-01 which measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the highway maintenance function, including the condition of principal and non-principal roads, efficiency of street lighting, cost of highway maintenance, duration of temporary traffic controls caused by local authority road works on traffic sensitive roads, and time taken to respond to dangerous defects, in each highway authority.

<a name="10227w12.html_para6">Local authorities are required to publish details of their performance against these indicators in their annual Best Value Performance Plan (BVPP).

<a name="10227w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Vessels used for sea dump in the North Atlantic were subject to licence under the Dumping at Sea Act 1974. Such licences contained a provision requiring the ships, on completion of sea dump operations, to be monitored and, if necessary, cleaned by a qualified person until free from significant radioactive contamination to ensure the ships could be returned to unrestricted use with other cargoes. The statutory limits of residual non-fixed radioactive contamination and radiation levels applicable at the time remain essentially the same to date, ie non-fixed contamination limits of 4 Bq/cm <sup>2</sup>  (10- <sup>4</sup>  Ci/cm <sup>2</sup> ) for beta/gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, 0.4 Bq/cm <sup>2</sup>  (10- <sup>5</sup>  Ci/cm <sup>2</sup> ) for all other alpha emitters, and a surface radiation limit of 5 Sv/h (0.5 mrem/h).
<P>

<a name="10227w12.html_para9">Sea dump operations ceased in 1982 with the last operation of the MV Gem, which was certified free from significant radioactive contamination on 15 August 1982 by observers from the UK Atomic Energy Authority and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> On 14 February the Strategic Rail Authority announced a pause in the franchise replacement process for the East Coast main line as a result of the increased cost estimates for upgrading the line that Railtrack has now provided.
<P>

<a name="10227w13.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has asked the Chairman of the SRA, Sir Alastair Morton, to advise him urgently of the reasons for the increase in Railtrack's cost estimates and why this information has only become available at this late stage.
<P>

<a name="10227w13.html_para3">It would be inappropriate to speculate on any implications for the replacement process for the East Coast main line franchise until the SRA has discussed the cost estimates with Railtrack.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> On 24 November 1999, the Rail Regulator made an enforcement order imposing a penalty of &#163;10.8 million on Railtrack. Railtrack has sought mitigation and is to provide the Regulator with further information to enable him to make a final decision. The imposition of penalties on train operators for late performance is a matter for the Strategic Rail Authority, not the Regulator.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> No. The provision of cycle storage facilities at their 14 main railway stations is a matter for Railtrack.

<a name="10227w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> The A36/A46 route was identified as a non-core route for de-trunking in the White Paper "A New Deal for Transport", which set out the factors taken into account in defining the core trunk road network (paragraph 3.130). Following consultation with regional planning bodies on the proposed core/non-core split a further study of the role of the A36/A46 was carried out. This study concluded that the proportion of core route traffic on the route is low although it recognised that the A46/A36 met to some degree the criteria for core route status. In view of the short journey length of the majority of the traffic and in particular the need for local initiatives to manage the impact of heavy goods vehicles on the route the Secretary of State decided to confirm its status as a non-core route.
<P>

<a name="10227w13.html_para5">De-trunking is not an exercise to save money. We are committed to a fair transfer of resources to local highway authorities taking over de-trunked routes and arrangements for ensuring this have been discussed and agreed with the Local Government Association.
<P>

<a name="10227w13.html_para6">Furthermore, in the light of the major study which we commissioned to look at alternative ways of dealing with the city's transport problems following the cancellation of the A36 Salisbury Bypass in 1997, we announced in the local transport settlement last December &#163;13.7 million to be spent over the next five years on integrated transport measures from the Salisbury Package included in Wiltshire County Council's local transport plan. We also provisionally accepted the proposals for the Brunel Link and Harnham Relief Road, estimated to cost &#163;13 million, which are also part of the Package.

<P>
<a name="10227w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Given changes in the system of public expenditure control, comparison of outturn against budgetary measures over time are not meaningful. Under the current system, detailed breakdown of outturn against provision is given in July in "Public Expenditure Provisional Outturn", last published in July 2000 for financial year 1999-2000. There are equivalent tables in previous editions of the same publication for each financial year since 1994-95.

 The Government do not publish figures for allocations from the Reserve overall as it is an administrative tool in controlling overall spending, rather than a budget in its own right. Individual allocations to the Scotland Office and the Scottish Office will be apparent from Estimates laid at the time to draw down those allocations.

 Information on categories of comparable spending in UK Departments, expenditure in each category, and the Scotland comparability percentages were set out in Annexe C of the Statement of Funding Policy published in July 2000. Spending is allocated to Scotland in the form of the aggregate Departmental Expenditure Limit, which the Scottish Executive then allocates to programmes according to its own priorities.
