 All trapped badgers will be vaccinated. It is not necessary to trap and vaccinate every individual in a population or to prevent the entry of unvaccinated ones to control a disease. This is because as the proportion of immunised individuals increases, the risk to all individuals, whether vaccinated or not, decreases. The stable social structure of undisturbed badger populations, where there is little mixing of individuals between social groups, lends itself to the generation of this &#145;herd immunity&#146; through vaccination.</p>

 No recent formal representations have been received on the subject of bank lending to farmers. At the end of March 2009, net lending to agriculture, forestry and hunting in the UK stood at just below &#163;11 billion. This was more than &#163;900 million higher than at the same point in 2008 and some &#163;280 million above the level recorded at the end of 2008. There is strong evidence that the banking sector is continuing to lend to farm businesses with sound business cases but DEFRA will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

 Recycling is strongly promoted by a range of Government measures in recognition of its environmental benefits. This includes the introduction of three National Indicators within the local government performance framework to encourage local authorities to reduce waste, recycle more and send less household waste to landfill. This is in line with DEFRA's belief that local authorities are best placed to make decisions on the waste management strategy for their communities. 85 per cent. of authorities have negotiated at least one waste-related national indicator target with the Government Office in their region.</p>

The work was done as part of a higher level stewardship agreement to restore the special interest features of the SSSI&#151;namely its rare heathland habitats&#151;to favourable condition. Some tree removal is essential as part of this restoration work because many oaks became established on the heathland in the second half of the last century when the site was less actively managed. There are now over 100 trees on the northern half of the SSSI which are rapidly shading out the remaining patches of heathland vegetation. If these are all left to mature a large part of the SSSI will soon be dense woodland and the heathland will be lost.</p>

 Political impartiality is a requirement for the majority of House of Commons employees.

These entitlements are unaffected by the Department&#146;s new probationary policy, which applies only to the central Department and not its agencies. In practical terms, new employees are unlikely to be taking maternity leave during their probationary period.

 The preparation and timing of any planning application for a third runway and associated terminal facilities at Heathrow airport are a matter for the airport operator. Such a development would be likely to meet the 2008 Planning Act&#146;s threshold for a nationally significant airport infrastructure project. The planning application would therefore be subject to consideration by the new Infrastructure Planning Commission if received after March 2010 when the relevant threshold in the Planning Act is due to be commenced.</p>

 Following Second Reading of the Equality Bill, interested organisations raised concerns that, as drafted, the Bill reduced the existing protection against discrimination for pregnant women and new mothers.

on 9 June, we tabled amendments to the Bill which represent a return to the level of protection given against pregnancy and maternity discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (as amended). These amendments were briefly debated on 16 June and agreed, and now stand part of the Bill.</p>

So a woman who is breastfeeding her baby in a restaurant or on a bus cannot lawfully be asked to leave, or get off, for that reason. At present we have no plans to bring forward proposals to provide a legal right for women to breastfeed in public places.</p>

 The &#163;775 million consisted of &#163;150 million for social rented housing, through the Affordable Housing Programme; &#163;250 million for decent homes, which has been allocated to fund improvements and improve energy efficiency in council homes; &#163;175 million for major repairs to council housing stock; and &#163;100 million and &#163;80 million respectively for the regional development agencies and Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) to support key regeneration and housing infrastructure projects.</p>

The money for decent homes has been allocated directly to local authorities as part of the overall Decent Homes programme and is not reported on separately. &#163;162 million of the &#163;175 million for major repairs has been allocated to 39 local authorities.</p>

DDA requires all providers of public services to ensure that services to customers can be accessed by all, whether that is in regard to the physical office environments or by other means. The JPEG was reviewed throughout the rollout programme to ensure compliance with the Act. This was reflected both in the standards and specifications deployed in the physical refurbishment of our offices and in the design of specific components.</p>

We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally, including some offices opening to the public on Saturday. In the light of the increase in customer demand we have embarked on a programme to convert or extend our existing buildings where necessary, deploying existing components including similar seating to that already installed as part of the 2002-2006 roll out of Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>

1. Interpretation of these data need to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br>
2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (that is, excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural time lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
4. Data are unrounded.<br>
5. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) have been available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

 We do not record the number of applications for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) rejected due to fraudulent documents being used. However, we can provide reassurance that rigorous checks of all documentation are undertaken when an application to JSA is made. If there is a suspicion about the validity of the documentation produced, the case is referred to our Fraud Investigation Service. The claim will not be put into payment until the questions around the documentation are resolved.</p>

 The Department's population-level modelling calculates payback rather than internal rate of return, and there is no simple correspondence between the two measures&#151;for each individual it depends on their patterns of saving and decumulation through time.

<p><a name="stpa_482"><a name="90720w0034.htm_para6"><a name="09072110000112">It is not possible to make an assessment of whether an incident in which a UK serviceman has been killed or sustained serious injuries could have been avoided should a helicopter have been used in place of a road vehicle. We constantly monitor and respond to the capability and protection requirements of our troops, and strive to ensure that our armed forces have the protection and mobility they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as modern technology allows.</p>

 Accelerated access is a term used by MOD in the context of physical illnesses and injuries. It is separate to the specific "fast track" arrangements for orthopaedic treatment; separate provision is also made for access to in-patient care for mental health conditions.</p>

Responsibility for their individual management is shared between the single service commands, and it is not possible to separate out costs from overall unit medical budgets. Each service funds its respective DCMHs differently, with funding provision coming from a number of areas.

Typhoon requires only a one-person crew rather than a two-person crew like the Tornado F3, which is being phased out.  <br>

Additionally, as the 2004 Defence White Paper &#147;Delivering Security in a Changing World&#148; made clear, &#147;the effectiveness of modern precision weapons and sensors, which can be used in all weathers, day and night, mean that highly accurate air delivered offensive effects can be achieved with fewer fast jets than before... Similarly the air threat to deployed forces has greatly reduced and the capability of our air superiority aircraft and other air defence assets is continuing to improve. So we need fewer aircraft and fewer ground-based air defence systems to meet the threat.&#148;</p>

 There are no plans to extend eligibility to transfer from the Gurkha pension scheme (GPS) to the armed force pension scheme (AFPS) to those Gurkhas who retired before 1 July 1997. Their pension arrangements have been found to be fair and lawful in two Judicial Reviews and a High Court appeal.</p>

A further 8,800 who were discharged after 1 April 1975 would be qualified for a preserved pension under the AFPS from the age of 60.</p>

 It is envisaged that all 28 Merlin Mk3/3a helicopters will be upgraded at a cost in the region of &#163;42 million. This equates to an average of &#163;1.5 million per aircraft. These figures are lower than previously reported and stated in the written answer my predecessor, Mr. Hutton, gave on 2 March 2009, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1364W, to the hon.

 [<i> holding answer 14 July 2009]: </i>The Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency has regularly written to the Home Affairs Select Committee in order to provide all of the most robust and accurate information on the removal and deportation of foreign national prisoners, including those released from prison before March 2006. A copy of these letters are available in the Library of the House.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many staff of each organisation authorised to use the national DNA database have been <i> (a)</i> investigated, <i> (b)</i> disciplined and <i> (c)</i> dismissed for unauthorised or improper use of that database in each of the last five years; [276825]</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_113"><a name="09072117000357">(2) whether loss of data obtained from the national DNA database has been reported by any organisation which has access to <i> (a)</i> the database and <i> (b)</i> data from the database. [276826]</p>

 Direct access to information on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is restricted to a limited number of designated personnel under the control of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), either directly, or under a contract awarded to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) for operation and maintenance of the NDNAD and development of its IT systems. Throughout the lifetime of the contract, the FSS are required to demonstrate compliance with specified security requirements. Police and law enforcement personnel do not have access to the information on the NDNAD, but receive reports from the NDNAD Delivery Unit of matches between DNA taken from crime scenes and that taken from individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="90720w0044.htm_para4"><a name="09072117000359">In relation to those NPIA and FSS staff, there has been one instance of unauthorised use of the database during the last five years. This involved a contractor working for the FSS who was found to have used an administrator account on the IT system rather than his own. Following an investigation by the NPIA, no evidence of any improper access to database records was found. However, as use of the administrator account was in contravention of security procedures, the individual was removed from further work on the database. No incidents of unauthorised or improper use of match reports by police and law enforcement personnel have been reported to the NDNAD in the last five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="90720w0044.htm_para5"><a name="09072117000360">Since the NDNAD was set up in 1995, two instances of loss of data have been reported. These took place in February 2009 when the FSS faxed DNA reports intended for two police forces to incorrect fax numbers. In both instances, the faxes were either retrieved by the police or destroyed within 36 hours of the event. A thorough investigation was undertaken by the NPIA and reported to the Home Office. No evidence was found of any malicious intent by any individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="90720w0044.htm_para6"><a name="09072117000361">As a result of the investigation into this incident, an existing project to replace use of fax was accelerated. As from 17 April 2009, fax has no longer been used to transmit any DNA reports to forces. They are now sent in line with Cabinet Office guidance over a secure network either by email or as a web service on a secure network.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 July 2009]:</i> Requests for the release of data or samples relating to the DNA profiles held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) must be approved by the NDNAD Strategy Board. Requests are also considered by the NDNAD Ethics Group, which makes recommendations to the Board on whether the request should be approved. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) lays down that DNA samples and the profiles derived from them can only be used for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence, the conduct of a prosecution or, since April 2005, for the purposes of identifying a deceased person.

 It is very difficult to provide precise figures for the proportion of UK legislation that stems from the European Union and the consequent cost. All proposals for EU legislation are, however, deposited with Parliament with an assessment of any legislative changes that would be required to implement them in the UK and an explanation of the HMG policy in the area concerned, including in the case of proposals on migration and asylum, by choosing not to opt in to them where appropriate.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2009]:</i> The only major consultancy services engaged by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) have been obtained from Deloitte (who assisted in 2008 with preliminary thinking on business transformation). Deloitte has also been the FSS pension advisers for some time. FSS have used a number of specialist providers in a smaller way to support the design of the business transformation programme. The transformation team itself has also been staffed by a number of agency and interim specialists to work alongside and train in-house resources (for example Lean Sigma training). Some components of the transformation (e.g. IT enabling projects) will involve the engagement of a number of our existing external service support providers (e.g. Cap Gemini), but these companies are not involved in the provision of broader consultancy services.</p>

 On 21 May 2009 the Home Secretary announced a revised policy for former members of the Brigade of Gurkhas who had been discharged prior to 1 July 1997. Under the terms of this policy any former Gurkha with more than four years&#146; service who had been discharged from the Brigade of Gurkhas before 1 July 1997 would be eligible for settlement in the UK.</p>

We therefore cannot foresee circumstances in which ex Gurkhas in the UK do not meet the criteria but are not subject to immediate administrative removal or deportation. If this unlikely situation did arise the legal status and residency rights of the individual would be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

 Figures for all forces for front-line policing and for paperwork at a national level are given in the following tables. Figures for paperwork for individual forces should be sought from those forces, as it is not possible for the Home Office to release them without incurring disproportionate cost. The Home Office does not collect data on time spent on stop and search routinely, but we estimate that hand written completion of stop and search forms on the street takes on average three to seven minutes. The time spent on completing the form depends on the circumstances of the individual stop.</p>

 The frontline policing measure and other measures of time spent on patrol and paperwork have been discontinued as part of the Government's commitment to reduce the burden on police forces imposed by statistical and other data.

<p><a name="stpa_620"><a name="90720w0053.htm_para1"><a name="09072117003584">The decision to discontinue the measure is based on the maturing relationship which exists between the police service and the Home Office around performance management.
