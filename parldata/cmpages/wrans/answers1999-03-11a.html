<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your question about how many jobseekers, who receive Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), have been interviewed and how many, subsequently, had nil benefit awards. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Employment Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service conducts many different types of interviews with jobseekers. These start at the new claims stage and develop as unemployment lengthens. The new jobseeker's interview is important in establishing whether jobseekers meet the labour market conditions for receiving JSA. It is normally at this stage that a Jobseeker's Agreement is drawn up and jobseekers are made aware of their responsibilities in order to receive JSA. Thereafter,

Jobseekers are also asked to attend a Restart Interview at regular six monthly intervals at which they are offered further advice and information about employment and training opportunities. Beyond this interviews may take place for a variety of other reasons.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Information on the number of school leavers who entered higher education directly is not available centrally. In some cases, progression to HE will be direct from FE or tertiary college, and some students will enter after a year abroad or other sabbatical. The entry rate of young people to HE is measured by the Age Participation Index (API) which measures the chance of a young person entering full-time higher education before they are 21. In 1998-99 the API was in the range 30-32 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many special schools he estimates will close as a result of the Programme of Action for meeting special educational needs.  [74814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Programme of Action makes it clear that we see a continuing and vital role for special schools. We want to build on their strengths and ensure that they are an integral part of an inclusive local education system for children in their area, and in some cases beyond. We recognise that some local education authorities may wish to propose changes to individual schools, both special and mainstream, to reflect changes in demand for special needs provision. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has, however, informed authorities that the Programme of Action should not be interpreted as providing justification on its own for making proposals to close special schools.

<P>
<a name="90311w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Council's action is not contrary to the provisions in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The letter from the Chief Executive merely points out that it would be prudent for parent teacher associations with charitable status to check their constitutions before disseminating any information from lobby groups to ensure that their actions would not be in breach of Charity law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We have no current plans to treat pupils with special educational needs differently in performance tables. The inclusion of such pupils is supported by the Government's National Advisory Group on SEN.
<P>

<a name="90311w03.htm_para1">Many pupils with special educational needs are academically able or on a par with other pupils, and to ignore their achievements would be wrong. Schools do face particular challenges, however, in achieving results in line with national expectations for most pupils with special educational needs. The performance tables include information on the number of such pupils on roll, so that this can be taken into account in evaluating school performance.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The very early evidence from the New Deal suggests that it is having a significant impact on participants' employability. Comparing the pathfinder areas, where the New Deal commenced 



<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in January 1998, to the rest of the country, where it commenced in April 1998, the pathfinder areas showed a six percentage point higher flow of young people into jobs between January and April 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the longer term, as part of the overall evaluation of New Deal, we aim through a national survey of New Deal participants to make an assessment of employability in terms, for example, of improvements in basic skills and qualifications, increased work experience, increased levels of job search activity, increased levels of motivation and confidence about finding work and increased self-esteem. Findings from the first stage of the survey are expected to be available around September 1999; findings from the second stage around September 2000.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Turning to the number of jobs created by the New Deal, I should say that the New Deal was not planned as a job creation initiative. Its aim is to tackle long term unemployment among young people by improving their employability and helping them find jobs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, in respect of the percentage of young people without permanent employment at the end of their participation in New Deal, I should explain that the New Deal has a number of stages including Gateway, the options and a follow through period of support and guidance. Because New Deal only started nationally in April 1998 it is too early to evaluate what proportion of participants may not secure permanent employment at the end of their time on the programme. It may be helpful, however, to say that by December 1998 of the 214,300 young people who had started New Deal only 4,400 had started on the follow through period.</FONT></UL>

The reduction in 1998-99 results principally from the change, announced by the previous Government and confirmed in July 1997 in the "Excellence in schools" White Paper, from a four-year cycle of school inspections to a differentiated approach in which schools will be inspected at least every six years but more frequently where weaknesses are apparent, and from lower than expected contract prices for inspections.

A summary of recent results in Staffordshire and in primary and secondary schools in Tamworth Borough, which is not itself a local education authority, is set out in the following table. A sample of schools in each authority is inspected annually by Ofsted and reports published which include judgments about standards of attainment and the quality of education. A programme of inspections of all local education authorities is now being carried out by Ofsted, but none of the named authorities has yet been inspected. All authorities have just submitted for approval an Education Development Plan which includes a three-year programme for securing school improvement, and targets including those for pupil performance at ages 11 and 16 which will be monitored in future years.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> The education SSA for Staffordshire for 1999-2000 represents an underlying increase of &#163;18.2 million or 6 per cent., after allowing for local authority changes of function. An increase on that scale should be sufficient to meet the pressures faced by Staffordshire schools, although my right hon. Friend appreciates the concern expressed by schools in Staffordshire and elsewhere about the fairness of the current education SSA system. In announcing the conclusions of the comprehensive Spending Review for the three years up to 2001-02, Ministers made it clear that they would not seek to change the current SSA system. It will, nevertheless, be subject to review. That will be led by DETR Ministers, and it will involve local government representation, and Ministers with local government service interests.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> None in the immediate future. In announcing the conclusions of the Comprehensive Spending Review for the three years up to 2001-02, Ministers made it clear that they would not seek to change the system of calculating standard spending assessments. It will, nevertheless, be subject to review. That will be led by DETR Ministers, and it will involve local government representation, and Ministers with local government service interests.

<P>
<a name="90311w06.htm_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Serious Fraud Office deals with the most serious and complex fraud. The Comprehensive Spending Review resulted in an increase in financial resources available to the SFO over the next three years. In return, the SFO will be expected to increase its caseload and reduce average case costs and the average time it takes to investigate without sacrificing quality. Staff and other resources are sufficient to handle the current caseload.

The restructuring of CPS into 42 areas not only fulfils our promise on taking office, but is an important milestone in restructuring the criminal justice system on a more rational basis--which will facilitate closer liaison between police and the CPS as well as greater co-operation among the criminal justice agencies as a whole.

 The need for an integrated Information Technology system in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) was originally identified in an independent study carried out by Sema Group in 1994, which recommended a programme of computerisation to achieve productivity improvements. During the competition for the contract IND received confirmation of this assessment from each of the three shortlisted service providers, working on-site with full access to officials at all levels. Siemens Business Services proposed the extensive use of electronic imaging of documents. The

<P>
<a name="90311w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 A period in open conditions is regarded as essential for most life sentence prisoners before they are considered for release on life licence. This period allows for the testing of areas of concern in conditions which are closer to those in the community than are found in closed prisons. Decisions to transfer life sentence prisoners to open conditions are taken by Ministers on consideration of recommendations made by the Parole Board.
<P>

<a name="90311w08.htm_para2">The Secretary of State's directions to the Parole Board in relation to mandatory life sentence prisoners require the Board, before making a recommendation for transfer to open conditions, to balance the risks against the benefits of such a move, taking into account:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. whether the lifer has made sufficient progress towards tackling offending behaviour to minimise the risk and gravity of re-offending and whether the benefits suggest that a transfer to open conditions is worthwhile at that stage; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. whether the lifer is trustworthy enough not to abscond or to commit further offences (either inside or outside the prison).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90311w08.htm_para3">In each case the Board is also directed to consider whether:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. the extent to which the risk that the lifer will abscond or commit further offences while in an open prison is minimal;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. the lifer has shown by his performance in closed conditions that he has made positive efforts to address his attitudes and behavioural problems and the extent to which significant progress has been made in doing so; and</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90311w08.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Refugee Arrivals Project provides an advice service to asylum seekers arriving at Gatwick or Heathrow who declare their application for asylum at their port of entry. Such asylum seekers may be entitled to income support and housing benefit. Because of current difficulties experienced by single asylum seekers in obtaining suitable accommodation in the London area, the Refugee Arrivals Project has advised some to seek support in other parts of the country. At present, about 350 asylum seekers have gone to the North East Region while their asylum claim is being considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w10.htm_spnew15"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) has now provided more than a million cattle with passports since its launch on 28 September 1998. In addition BCMS has processed more than a million passports of slaughtered cattle, entered more than 600,000 live cattle movements on to the Cattle Tracing System database, and dealt with around 140,000 phone calls from farmers to its Helpline.
<P>

<a name="90311w10.htm_para0">These are impressive achievements. As a result of BCMS' work, it will be much easier to check where cattle have been during their lives. This will help to trace animals during disease outbreaks, and is an important factor in rebuilding confidence in British cattle and beef, at home and abroad.

<a name="90311w12.htm_para4">All claims to benefit must either be made in writing on a properly completed claim form relevant to the individual benefit being claimed, or in such other written manner that the Secretary of State will accept. The length and complexity, and therefore the amount of information required, varies from benefit to benefit and depends on an individual's personal circumstances. It is not possible to quantify exactly how many pieces of information must be provided.
<P>

<a name="90311w12.htm_para5">The volume of documentation is similarly dependent on the individual benefit. For those customers on Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance who are subject to the Evidence Requirement (ER) the claim form makes it clear which documents are required for a customer to satisfy that requirement. These include details of current and previous wages, any capital held, ground rent and service charges payable, details of any self-employment and any occupational pensions or other income which is received.
<P>

<a name="90311w12.htm_para6">For those customers not subject to the ER it is for the Adjudication Officer to decide the amount of documentation required in order that when deciding upon the claim they can make a sound and reasoned decision thus protecting public funds.

<a name="90311w12.htm_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people are estimated to be ineligible for benefits under the minimum income guarantee, despite having incomes that fall below its threshold, who are aged <i>(a)</i> 60 to 74, <i>(b)</i> 75 to 79 and <i>(c)</i> over 80 years (i) in total and (ii) by gender.  [75895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w12.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The information is not currently available. We have previously estimated that the total number of pensioners who will be ineligible for the Minimum Income Guarantee because their savings exceed &#163;8,000 but whose income is below the threshold is 230,000 (if income from savings is included in the assessment of total income) or 600,000 (if income from savings is not included).
<P>

<a name="90311w12.htm_para9">These estimates were based on the data used to produce the published estimates of take-up of income related benefits. These estimates are currently being revised following the discovery in December of an error, the effect of which was to understate income brought to account. The estimates will be republished in May.

<a name="90311w12.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on the general levies payable under the Pension Schemes Act 1993 by occupational and personal pension schemes.  [76730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The general levy covers the costs of bodies which exist either to safeguard the rights of, or to provide information to, pension scheme members. These bodies are the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), the Pensions Advisory Service, the 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 1999 : Column: 348</I><P>
Pensions Registry and the Pensions Ombudsman. Rates of general levy for the 1999-2000 year are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="90311w12.htm_para11">The increase in the levy rates in respect of occupational pension schemes reflects, in particular, the steady increase in the number of cases OPRA is having referred to it and the complexity of the issues it is dealing with. It is important, therefore, that the Authority and the other bodies concerned continue to have the resources necessary to ensure that scheme members' interests are properly protected. The rates in respect of personal pension schemes remain the same as last year.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> Exercise STRONG RESOLVE, which took place in March 1998 jointly in Norway and in Portugal, consisted of two halves; exercise CRISIS NORTH, in Norway, and exercise CRISIS SOUTH, in Portugal. The aim of exercise STRONG RESOLVE was to exercise NATO's ability to cope with multiple, simultaneous crises in separate geographic regions, drawing on the resources of both Major NATO Commanders, and involving the full spectrum of NATO missions, and the exercise is assessed to have succeeded in its aim. Members of the armed forces of the following nations participated in CRISIS NORTH: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. Members of the armed forces of the following nations participated in CRISIS SOUTH: Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, France, Germany,

<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w13.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The beagles at BRNC Dartmouth are funded by private subscriptions, and are not supported by public funds. The beagles are a registered encroachment, and as such the MOD can terminate the agreement at any time giving reasonable notice. The MOD is not liable for any damage or repairs and if notice was given for the beagle pack to leave BRNC Dartmouth, then any costs for a new facility outside the College would be the sole responsibility of the beagle pack.
<P>

<a name="90311w13.htm_para0">As an option within the College redevelopment plan, the present beagle kennels have been identified as a potential site for the College's new recreational facility. However, options are still being developed and no decisions have yet been taken. The approximate cost of any demolition of the kennels would be in the region of &#163;1,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into the possible genetic effects on the children of veterans who served on Christmas Island during nuclear testing periods.  [75831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w13.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department has not commissioned any research into the possible genetic effects on the children of nuclear test veterans who served on Christmas Island.
<P>

<a name="90311w13.htm_para1">As far as I am aware, there is no scientific or medical evidence to show that health or other physical problems suffered by the children or grandchildren of nuclear test veterans can be attributed to participation in the UK's nuclear test programme 40 years ago.
<P>

<a name="90311w13.htm_para2">In November 1997, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) published the results of a major epidemiological study of the children of radiation workers. The study, entitled "Cancer in the Offspring of Radiation Workers--A Record Linkage Study" discounted the hypothesis (known as the Gardner Hypothesis) that fathers' exposure to radiation before conception is a cause of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study was peer reviewed and published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>.
<P>

<a name="90311w13.htm_para3">The other major study in this area involved about 30,000 children of those Japanese nationals irradiated as a result of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan in World War II. This was published in 1990 and failed to detect any significant excess of mutations, untoward pregnancy outcomes, childhood mortality or excess cancer.
<P>

<a name="90311w13.htm_para4">A report on the US Nuclear tests published by the US Institute of Medicine in 1995 concluded that the size of the US test veteran population was not large enough to make practical a scientifically adequate and epidemiologically valid study of genetic effects in the children of test veterans. This is despite there being over 210,000 US test veterans, ten times the number in the UK.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90311w13.htm_para5">There is no prescribed list of medical conditions for which a war pension may be awarded. A war pension claimed more than seven years after discharge from service can be awarded for any condition, if, on the basis of reliable evidence, there is a reasonable doubt that disablement or death is due to service in HM forces. The Department's policy is that on current medical evidence and research a reasonable doubt has not been established that a causal link exists between multiple myeloma and participation in the UK nuclear tests programme. However, the Ministry of Defence has recently announced a further limited study into the incidence of multiple myeloma among veterans of the UKs atmospheric nuclear test programme in the 1950s.

 I have placed two tables in the Library.

These payments ensure that the rates pool, and hence the amount to be redistributed to local authorities, is not adversely reduced by decisions taken by individual local authorities to reduce non-domestic rates bills for certain businesses. The table gives figures for each authority responsible for the billing and collection of non-domestic rates.

 The effectiveness of safeguards on the disposal of mining waste is kept under review by the Health and Safety Commission in respect of stability and safety, by the Environment Agency in respect of pollution aspects, and by the monitoring of planning permissions by local authorities. The comprehensive framework of UK legislation which deals with location, stability and safety, and the pollution potential of tips and related structures, has ensured that very few problems have arisen in recent years.

 There are no plans at present to change the rules for the disposal of inert mining waste.

<P>

<P>
<a name="90311w14.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I am today announcing the names of the 25 local authorities which will be able to proceed, on a voluntary basis and subject to the approval of their tenants, with proposals to carry out 31 transfers of all or part of their housing stock to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) in 1999-2000. The programme will involve over 140,000 dwellings in large-scale voluntary transfers, generating capital receipts of over &#163;822 million. Nine of the transfers will be supported by Estates Renewal Challenge Funding.
<P>

<a name="90311w14.htm_para1">Transfers can offer significant benefits for tenants. The new landlord must plan for proper maintenance and future repairs. Increased investment means that any backlog of repairs can be carried out more quickly than if the properties had remained in local authority ownership. Rent increases are normally limited by a guarantee that rents will not rise by more than 1 per cent. above inflation for the first five years. In addition, RSLs are regulated 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 1999 : Column: 353</I><P>
by the Housing Corporation, a government body which requires RSLs to adhere to performance standards in areas such as housing management, tenant consultation, and rents.
<P>

<a name="90311w14.htm_para2">But housing transfers are voluntary and may take place only if tenants are in favour. The consent of the Secretary of State is also required before a transfer can proceed and will not be granted if it appears that a majority of tenants do not wish the transfer to proceed.
<P>

<a name="90311w14.htm_para3">The 1999-2000 programme reflects the Government's commitment to support a continuing programme of transfers as a means of generating private finance to repair and improve the condition of social housing.
<P>

<a name="90311w14.htm_para4">Both Coventry (20,349) and Tameside (16,959) are above the Department's size limit for transfers to one landlord. I am agreeing to proposals to transfer their stock to new group structure landlords involving, in each case, two asset owning RSLs.
<P>

<a name="90311w14.htm_para5">Two of the authorities on the 1999-2000 programme--Coventry City Council and Burnley Borough Council--expect to have housing debt remaining in their Housing Revenue Account (HRA) after their stock is transferred. This is because the capital receipt will not be sufficient to clear all of the debt in their HRA. Transfer will depend on the successful resolution of this issue. We plan to issue a consultation paper on how to tackle overhanging debt in the near future. Our objective is to enable as wide a range of authorities to consider transfer as possible.
<P>

<a name="90311w14.htm_para6">The authorities who have successfully gained a place on the programme, together with the intended recipient RSL are as follows:

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> The Government want a road haulage industry that is safe, competitive, efficient and sustainable. On 2 March we published <i>Sustainable Distribution: A Strategy</i>, which sets out our approach and the range of initiatives which we will be taking forward to assist the haulage industry to meet these aims. The initiatives include integration of the sustainable transport of goods with our planning and roads policies; improvements in safety and enforcement which will benefit the law-abiding majority of the industry; and the promotion of best practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the average times taken for planning applications to be processed by each planning authority in the last year for which figures are available.  [75302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w15.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1999]:</i> The information needed to determine the average time for planning applications to be processed is collected centrally only for a small number of mainly minerals and waste development applications (known as 'county matters'). These represent less than 1 per cent. of all applications and include some large, complex and contentious applications which tend to raise difficult planning issues that take some time to resolve. Information on the average time taken to determine this category of applications for the year ending September 1998 is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="90311w15.htm_para9">The speed at which decisions are made for the vast majority of applications, i.e. all except 'county matters', is measured in terms of the proportion of decisions determined within 8 weeks and 13 weeks. In the year ending September 1998, 62 per cent. of these applications in England were determined within 8 weeks and 83 per cent. within 13 weeks.
<P>

<a name="90311w15.htm_para10">The Department is currently considering whether average time taken to determine applications should be included in the suite of Best Value performance indicators on which the Department will be consulting later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has for airport studies in support of the development of the Government's airport policy.  [76589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The White Paper "A New Deal for Transport" (Cm 3950) announced the Government's intention to prepare a UK airports policy looking some 30 years ahead. The White Paper also announced a series of studies of the role of regional airports in the South West, the Midlands, and the North of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These studies are all now under way.
<P>

<a name="90311w16.htm_para0">To complement these studies, the Government have decided to set in hand a study of airport issues in the South East of England and the East of England. This study will consider future policies for these airports within the framework of the Government's sustainable development principles. It will take full account of the potential for airports in the other parts of the country to attract a greater proportion of the demand from their local area than they do at present, in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper (paragraph 3.196).
<P>

<a name="90311w16.htm_para1">The study will examine a wide range of options, and, in accordance with the new approach to appraisal set out in the White Paper, will appraise their economic, environmental and social implications. The study will consider both terminal and runway capacity. Projects for which planning applications have already been made, or are expected to be made shortly, will not be within the scope of the study. The Secretary of State must reserve his position on such cases, and cannot prejudge their outcome; the study will therefore examine a range of scenarios based on those projects either going ahead or not going ahead.
<P>

<a name="90311w16.htm_para2">In accordance with our integrated transport policy, the study will consider not only airport capacity, but also the implications of possible developments for the planning of airspace capacity and air traffic control and for surface access to the airports concerned. The study will take account of work which the Department has recently 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 1999 : Column: 361</I><P>
commissioned from OPRAF to examine the scope for improving long distance rail links to the major South East airports and the rail connections between those airports.
<P>

<a name="90311w16.htm_para3">This work will be carried out in an open way. In particular, the Government recognise the substantial economic, environmental and social implications of runway capacity issues, and their interaction with land-use planning. The Government will therefore discuss with interested parties, including the regional planning conferences and regional development agencies, the process for taking forward the study, including the criteria which should be applied in the assessment of options.

<P>
<a name="90311w16.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that today we have sent an advertisement to the Office of the Official Journal for publication in "Tenders Electronic Daily" inviting expressions of interest from companies which could provide electronic voting equipment. This would enable votes in the first Greater London Authority elections to be electronically recorded and counted.
<P>

<a name="90311w16.htm_para5">The new Authority will be modern, streamlined and efficient and we should work towards a voting system to match. This is particularly appropriate as the ballots for electing the Mayor and two types of Assembly Member require a more complex count than for most elections in this country. It is right, therefore to explore whether modern technology could improve the speed and efficiency of the process.
<P>

<a name="90311w16.htm_para6">However, our top priority is to run a successful election on 4 May 2000, so we will be looking at systems which have proved extremely reliable in national or regional elections elsewhere. We will not therefore be committed to the use of electronic voting systems unless we are confident that the equipment offered will be easy for people to use, be value for money and make a real contribution to the success of the elections.

 Section 137 is used by an increasing number of parish and town councils to provide a wide range of activities. The majority of section 137 spending by local councils is on grants to other bodies and funding for services such as youth activities, schools and playgroups. The findings of a study on local councils use of section 137 was published in November last year.

<a name="90311w16.htm_para7">Furthermore, my Department has today published a report on local authorities use of section 137.

Section 137 will be reviewed in the light of this new duty and we will take account of the findings of this report and the views of local authorities in doing so.

Costs of the delivery of education to individual students are not collected centrally. Estimates for the cost of providing higher education for non-British EU undergraduate at Scottish higher education institutions in 1996-97, based on average costs of any student, is &#163;21.9 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales (1) if he will list the statutory provisions which apply to the provision by local authorities of free school transport;  [54016]
<P>
<UL>(2) what guidance his Department gives to local authorities on what constitutes an unsafe route for the purpose of providing free school transport.  [74952]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w19.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Authorities are obliged under section 509(1) and (2) of the Education Act 1996 to make such arrangements for the provision of free transport as they consider necessary for the purpose of facilitating school attendance.
<P>

<a name="90311w19.htm_para0">Parents have a defence under section 444 of the 1996 Act for not securing the regular attendance at school of children of compulsory school age if they live more than 2 miles from the nearest school (children under 8 years of age) or 3 miles away (older pupils) and the authority has made no suitable arrangements for the provision of free school transport.




<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 1999 : Column: 370</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90311w19.htm_para1">The Courts have therefore ruled that free school transport should always be considered necessary under section 509(a) if children live more than 2 or 3 miles, as appropriate, from the nearest school. In other circumstances the need for free school transport has to be decided by local authorities in the light of local conditions and priorities.
<P>

<a name="90311w19.htm_para2">When considering whether free school transport is necessary, authorities must, among other things, have regard, by virtue of section 509(4) of the 1996 Act, to the nature of the route, or alternative routes, that a child could reasonably be expected to take. Authorities should also have regard under section 509(4) to the age of the child and any parental wish for denominational education.
<P>

<a name="90311w19.htm_para3">Whether or not a route is safe in the context of the provision of free school transport is a matter for authorities to decide. However, Welsh Office Circular 19/95, "Home To School Transport", points out that the Courts have held that a route to school is available if a child, accompanied as necessary, can walk along it with reasonable safety. A copy of the circular is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90311w19.htm_para4">Local education authorities also have a power under section 509(3) of the 1996 Act to help with school transport costs in circumstances where they do not consider the provision of free school transport under 509(1) necessary.

 Guidance issued in October 1998 set out how we expect health authorities, primary care groups and National Health Service trusts to work together and with social services, users and carers and others to develop and implement long-term service agreements.
<P>

<a name="90311w20.htm_para3">All service agreements beginning April 1999 are to be set in the context of the longer-term relationships and objectives being established through health improvement programmes. Fully fledged long-term service agreements are to be developed through a rolling programme. The new primary care groups have been asked to aim to develop at least two such agreements for the period beginning April 1999.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to introduce an independent ombudsman or other independent complaints system for complaints about <i>(a)</i> QCs, <i>(b)</i> the Bar and <i>(c)</i> solicitors; and if he will make a statement.  [75784]<P>

<P>
<a name="90311w20.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman was established by the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 because of concern that complaints about the provision of legal services should be investigated properly and thoroughly. The Ombudsman, who is statutorily independent of Government and the legal profession, has powers, inter alia, to examine allegations and make certain recommendations concerning the handling of complaints against barristers and solicitors (including QCs) by their professional bodies.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department to what extent, in considering the appointment of new QCs, the Lord Chancellor takes into account <i>(a)</i> the past record of the applicant's undertaking of pro bono work and <i>(b)</i> the willingness of the applicant, if appointed, to undertake pro bono work.  [75787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w20.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Neither the undertaking of, nor a willingness to undertake, pro bono work is one of the published criteria for appointment. Where applicants highlight the extent of the pro bono work they have undertaken, this is treated as a part of their practice which is not reflected in their fee income.

requires them to give gross fee income for the last three years. The criteria require successful applicants to have a high quality practice, and the level of fee income is an indicator of size of practice. Applicants are also asked to state if the level of their fees has been affected by the nature of their, or their firm's practice. Where applicants highlight the extent of the pro bono work they have undertaken that is treated as part of their practice which does not reflect in their fee income.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps he is taking to publicise the proposed reforms of the legal aid system in a manner accessible to potential users of the legal services, with particular reference to community legal services.  [75512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90311w20.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The proposed reforms of the legal aid system have been publicised in the White Paper "Modernising Justice", published in December 1998, in a summary version which has been widely distributed and in press releases and media briefing in connection with the Access to Justice Bill. The proposals are also available on the internet.
<P>

<a name="90311w20.htm_para4">My Department's press office has taken steps to publicise the proposals through the media in the six Community Legal Service Pioneer areas announced since December 1998 and will seek to arrange regional and national publicity when further Associate Pioneer ares are announced.
<P>

<a name="90311w20.htm_para5">In addition, informing the public at grass roots level about the Community Legal Service is one of the key tasks being considered between my Department and the Pioneer area authorities and one which will also be considered with the Associate Pioneer area authorities.
