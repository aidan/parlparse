<a name="11029w01.html_wqn0"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions which schemes will be completed within the period of the 10-Year Plan for rail; and if he will make a statement on the adequacy of funding of the programme.  [8875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government, through their 10-Year Plan, remain committed to delivering a better, safer and more reliable railway network for the 21st century, and are prepared to spend over &#163;30 billion over the next 10 years to achieve substantial improvements.
<P>

<a name="11029w01.html_para0">We look to the Strategic Rail Authority's forthcoming strategic plan to prioritise investment projects that deliver the greatest value for money for both rail users and the taxpayer. Investment is continuing on the west coast route modernisation project, Channel Tunnel Rail Link and the installation of the train protection warning system, each of which is integral to the Government's objectives for rail.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The de-trunking of the A449, previously programmed by the Highway Authority for April 2004, is on hold pending the outcome of the west midlands area multi-modal study.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) if he will publish a list of submissions by local authorities to participate in electoral pilot schemes in local elections or local by-elections in the forthcoming 12 months;  [8957]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps his Department is taking to minimise electoral fraud in the pilot schemes for new electoral arrangements; and if he will make a statement.  [8960]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Local authorities have been invited to submit details of proposed electoral pilot schemes for approval by the Secretary of State by 31 December 2001. We intend to publish a list of those applications as soon as possible after that date.
<P>

<a name="11029w01.html_para1">The invitation to local authorities indicates that the Secretary of State will approve only schemes which meet a number of criteria, one of which is that they must maintain or increase current levels of security.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what action has been taken by his Department to introduce Public Service Obligation protection for the slots used for services to and from the UK regions at Heathrow and Gatwick airports; and if he will make a statement.  [9341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The use of Public Service Obligations is governed by EC Regulation 2408&#150;92 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes. Any application for the imposition of a PSO from the relevant authorities will be carefully considered while taking the criteria set out in the regulation into account.

 The South East and East of England Study (SERAS) is examining a wide range of options at existing airports and new sites. We expect the study to be completed towards the end of this year, and to be followed by a full public consultation on the short-listed options early next year. Decisions made following the consultation will feed into an Air Transport White Paper which we aim to publish in the second half of next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions who the representative of the Scottish Executive is on the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal.  [9013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 2001]:</i> Neighbourhood renewal is a devolved matter for Scotland. The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal applies only to deprived areas in England.




<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 477W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11029w01.html_para2">The Scottish Executive will be publishing a Neighbourhood Renewal Statement for Scotland&#151;due at the end of the year&#151;which will set out a programme of action to regenerate disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="11029w01.html_para3">We shall be seeking to ensure close contact between the English and Scottish approaches to Neighbourhood Renewal.

<a name="11029w01.html_wqn8"><B> Lembit &#214;pik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what evidence his Department has received concerning the link between speed cameras on roads and improved road safety; and if he will make a statement.  [9051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The results of the first year's operation of the speed camera funding scheme provide further evidence of the link between the presence of speed cameras and improved road safety. The number of people killed or seriously injured dropped by 18 per cent. across the eight pilot areas as a whole and by 47 per cent. at the camera sites compared with the average over the previous three years. On average the number of drivers speeding at camera sites dropped from 55 per cent. to 16 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As part of its long term investment plan, NATS intends progressively to move to a two-centre strategy with modern facilities at Swanwick in Hampshire and Prestwick in Ayrshire. As part of that strategy, the existing area control centres at West Drayton and Manchester will close in the latter part of this decade. The current plan is that the majority of the task undertaken by Manchester will be moved to Prestwick, with the remainder moving to Swanwick. These plans are under detailed evaluation to find the optimum division of operational tasks between Swanwick and Prestwick.

[9662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Other than from the hon. Member on behalf of a constituent there have been no representations to the Government in the last 12 months for greater coastguard cover around south-east Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The internal structural repairs at Bexhill station have been completed. South Central are negotiating with Railtrack start dates and costs for the next phase of the refurbishment work: replacement of windows and refurbishing the waiting room. It is hoped to complete this phase in late spring 2002. South Central is also in discussion with Railtrack about improvements to the platform ramps and reglazing work at Cooden Beach, as well as the funding arrangements for the work at both stations.

<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The recent Railtrack developments will not impact on the existing or new franchise. The Strategic Rail Authority will negotiate a new franchise agreement with GoVia in line with the heads of terms that have already been signed.

<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he informed Lord Cullen of the possibility of Railtrack being placed in railway administration and being replaced by a non profit-making company prior to the publication of "The Ladbroke Grove Rail Inquiry, Part 2" report.  [9826]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how he intends to deliver the planned private investment in the railway set out in the 10-year transport plan.  [9838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government intend to propose that a private sector company limited by guarantee should succeed Railtrack. This new company would be financially sound and structured so that it would achieve at least a BBB&#151;and potentially higher investment grade credit rating. We are confident that this credit rating, combined with income from track access charges and network grants, would enable the new company to deliver the 'Railtrack elements' of private investment included within the 10-Year Plan.
<P>

<a name="11029w02.html_para0">We are confident that private sector investment will continue to be raised as planned for the completion of the channel tunnel rail link and for substantial new investment in rolling stock. We have envisaged for some time that major enhancement projects would be taken forward by standalone special purpose vehicles. The Government are continuing to develop their framework for establishing these vehicles.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what has been the total cost of the Stingray camera system for combating vehicles excise duty evasion.  [9884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The cost of 11 Stingray camera systems, the vans in which the systems are housed, plus a fault monitoring and security system was &#163;1.1 million. Use of the systems is expected to result in recovery of some &#163;9 million per annum.

<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how much land owned by English Partnerships designated for affordable housing units has been sold without a requirement for the same number of affordable housing units to be built; how much of such land has been designated for affordable low cost housing in Chorley; and how much of such land has been sold for housing in Chorley in each of the last three years.  [10095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There is no difference between the number of affordable housing units earmarked for a particular English Partnerships (EP) site and those actually built. This is because the housing provider has a contractual 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 480W</I><P>
obligation to provide the same number of affordable housing units as initially agreed between EP and the local authority.
<P>

<a name="11029w02.html_para1">No land has been designated for affordable housing in Chorley over the last three years. EP's main land ownership in Chorley is at Eaves Green. Chorley borough council considers the site unsuitable as a location for affordable housing as it is on the urban edge and remote from the town centre. EP's other land holdings in Chorley are currently "safeguarded" under the current local plan which means that development on them is precluded for the timeframe of the plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate he has made of the additional manufacturing costs for each vehicle if all new cars were to meet the four tests developed by the European Enhanced Safety of 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 482W</I><P>
Vehicles Committee; and what scientific advice he has received on the proposal for a two-stage negotiated agreement on this subject.  [9976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Previous estimates have indicated a manufacturing cost increase of between &#163;110 and &#163;330 per vehicle to meet the full EEVC tests. However, we believe that this cost would reduce appreciably as manufacturers gain experience of pedestrian design, and as improved technological solutions become available.
<P>

<a name="11029w02.html_para7">Past research has indicated that the benefits obtained from the full EEVC proposals (as proposed for the second phase of a negotiated agreement) would be in the range of an 8 per cent. reduction in pedestrian fatalities and a 21 per cent. reduction in pedestrian serious injuries. Although the first phase of the negotiated agreement would lead to appreciable casualty reductions, the second phase offers greater protection against head injuries and reduced likelihood of leg injuries, a particular aspect being reduced knee injuries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 15 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 892W, on east-west transport links, if the London to South Midlands multi-modal study is considering east-west rail links between Cambridge and Bedford, and Bedford and Milton Keynes.  [10065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The London to South Midlands multi-modal study will concentrate on three north to south transport corridors (M1/WCML, A1/MML/ECML, M11/WAnglia) but will also look at east-west movements in the study area. The east-west rail link will be considered in this context.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions in what way <i>(a)</i> new and <i>(b)</i> existing social tenants will have greater choice over their housing in the choice-based lettings pilot scheme.  [10166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w03.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The 27 local authority-led pilots were chosen to test different choice-based approaches to lettings, operating in a variety of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="11029w03.html_para1">Nearly all the schemes are designed to give greater choice to new and existing tenants by moving away from bureaucratic, points-based, allocation schemes to schemes where applicants select directly from available vacancies.
<P>

<a name="11029w03.html_para2">There is a strong emphasis on partnership working between the pilot authorities and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) operating in their area; and in some cases the intention is to bring private landlords on board as well, to offer as wide a choice as possible to new and existing tenants. Some of the pilots involve a consortium of authorities and RSLs working together. Some include links between areas of high and low demand. These schemes offer the opportunity to test the potential for promoting mobility across local authority boundaries, 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 484W</I><P>
increasing choice for tenants and new applicants, and enabling better use to be made of the national housing stock.
<P>

<a name="11029w03.html_para3">We expect all the pilot schemes to ensure that the needs of vulnerable households are considered and addressed during the development of the pilot, to ensure that they are not disadvantaged under the new scheme. This will include the provision of information and advice to help people make appropriate and informed choices&#151;as well as practical support to help them make the move.

 Information on the proportion of new homes built on previously developed land in England is available from the Department's land use change statistics. Between 1997 and 2000, 57 per cent. of new dwellings were built on previously developed land (including new dwellings provided from the conversion of existing buildings, which account for three percentage points).

<P>
<a name="11029w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's Guidance on Full Local Transport Plans, published in March 2000, advises all local highway authorities to have effective liaison arrangements with neighbouring authorities and to agree a common or complementary approach to cross-boundary issues. I am aware that there are regular consultation meetings on transport issues between the Isle of Wight council, Portsmouth city council, Southampton city council and Hampshire county council.

 We understand that the promoting authorities, Hampshire County Council and Portsmouth City Council, hope to commence construction in 2003 with completion in 2006&#150;07. The scheme is estimated to cost &#163;190 million but the precise amount will not be known until tendering process has been completed.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> There are at present no spare channels on the Parliamentary Video Network as the 24th channel, earmarked for the Scottish Parliament when a transmission becomes available, is being used for technical purposes. It may be helpful to add that the al-Jazeera channel is an Arabic-speaking channel with no English spoken and no English subtitles.

<a name="11029w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 Like Leaders of the House before me, I recognise the practical arguments for more closely aligning adjournments with school holidays. There are obvious difficulties in that half-term holidays vary accordingly to region and the Scottish school summer holidays differ markedly from those in England and Wales. However, I hope we can make progress on this issue through the Modernisation Committee.
<P>

<a name="11029w04.html_para0">I also hope that we will announce the dates of parliamentary recesses further in advance than has been usual in the past. The dates of the Christmas recess were announced during the first business statement in October. I hope to continue and extend this practice so as to allow MPs to plan their constituency work and family engagements more effectively.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Comprehensive figures for the last financial year are not yet available, so the figures given, taken from published accounts and the Departmental Annual Report, are for the 1999&#150;2000 financial year. The calculation of the figures depends on how each body presents its published financial information, and therefore the figures are not directly comparable. Where possible administration costs figures are given, but in some cases (asterisked) the published information only covers total operating expenditure. As Museums and Galleries are direct service providers, the operating expenditure covers their entire income.
<P>

<a name="11029w04.html_para1">The Football Foundation is not sponsored by DCMS, so the Department does not hold information on its expenditure. Nor does it hold the information requested on the employees of all of the organisations listed in the question.

 Al-Jazeera is a Qatar-based broadcaster licensed by the French authorities for transmission within the European Union. I understand that it is the only TV broadcaster allowed by the Taliban to operate on a permanent basis out of Afghanistan. We have urged broadcasters to be cautious in their use of material from Afghanistan and to ensure that viewers are aware of the source of material and how reliable it might be.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Member states shall ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality".
It is open to the UK Government, on the advice of the ITC, to proscribe a television broadcaster which broadcasts from another member state, where the broadcasts contain material which manifestly, seriously and gravely infringes this prohibition, on at least two occasions in a twelve month period. The ITC's monitoring of al-Jazeera has not led it to conclude that proscription would be justified. UK established broadcasters must comply with obligations to maintain due impartiality and accuracy in their reporting of news and current affairs.

<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_spnew1"><B> Peter Hain </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> The EC regulation which extends duty free access to products originating in the Least Developed Countries (the so-called "Everything but Arms" proposal) was adopted at the General Affairs Council in February 2001. The regulation came into force on 5 March 2001, and provides duty free access to EU markets for the world's 48 poorest countries for all goods except arms. Access for bananas, sugar and rice will be phased in, with full liberalisation for bananas from 2006, sugar from 1 July 2009 and rice from 1 September 2009.
<P>

<a name="11029w06.html_para0">The Government believe the regulation represents the best available deal for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and non-LDCs, given the complex balance of interests involved. The impact of the measure is difficult to assess, particularly at this early stage. Much will depend on the response of producers, both in LDC and non-LDC countries, and on wider developments in trade and agriculture policy. The Government are committed to working with multilateral and other bilateral donors to ensure that non-LDCs receive help and advice during the necessary process of adjustment. We will monitor clearly the impact of the changes, on LDC and non-LDC countries' economies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what discussions he has had with Sinn Fein on the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Bill.  [11028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 My predecessor, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), met with representatives of 10 Northern Ireland political parties (including Sinn Fein) between 20 and 23 November 2000. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the Government's proposal for a Bill to counter electoral fraud in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="11029w06.html_para7">The White Paper, "Combating Electoral Fraud in Northern Ireland" (Cm. 5080) was published in March 2001. It set out the Government's policy on electoral fraud in Northern Ireland and the legislative changes we intended to make to combat that fraud. A copy was sent to all the Northern Ireland political parties.

<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 A report, presenting the quantitative findings from a research project undertaken by Research and Evaluation Services for the Northern Ireland Office and the Electoral Office, was placed in the Library of the House on Tuesday 16 October.
<P>

<a name="11029w06.html_para8">The purpose of the research was to inform the development of electoral policy in Northern Ireland. The results of the research will contribute to a wider

discussion on the issue of electoral malpractice and provide feedback on the operation of the combined poll held on 7 June 2001.
<P>

<a name="11029w06.html_para9">The research was comprised of surveys of the general public, presiding officers and count staff. A series of in-depth interviews and focus groups with presiding officers was also carried out. The report placed in the Library of the House on 16 October presents the quantitative survey elements of the project&#151;these findings relate to people's general views and perceptions of the elections held on 7 June. The qualitative feedback from presiding officers will be included in a later report to be published as part of the Northern Ireland Office's Research and Statistical Series.

<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1) what additional resources have been allocated to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to support the consultation process they are undertaking on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland;  [7102]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many bids have been received from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for resources to support the consultation process on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland; and if these have been granted;  [7103]
<P>
(3) how his Department intends to support the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in providing financial resources for it to run a consultation process on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  [7104]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 It was initially envisaged that the task of advising on the scope for a Bill of Rights was an integral part of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's functions, and would therefore be covered by the Commission's core budget. However, we made it clear from the outset that we would be prepared to consider bids for increased funding, provided they were accompanied by a properly costed business case.
<P>

<a name="11029w06.html_para10">The Commission submitted an initial request for additional funds specifically for the consultation on the scope for a Bill of Rights in December 2000. Following discussion a revised bid was submitted in June 2001. In response to this, the Commission was granted a further &#163;357,200 to fund the consultation process to inform their draft advice to Government on the scope for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how his Department intends to respond to the consultation process on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland as it relates to proposed criminal justice and security rights.  [7105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The consultation document published by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on 4 September this year represents its draft advice to Government. The Commission expects to issue its final recommendations to the Government in early 2002, and we look forward to receiving that.
<P>

<a name="11029w06.html_para11">In the meantime, we will study carefully the contents of the draft as it currently stands.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Europol employees, whether or not foreign nationals, would be immune from prosecution for acts undertaken in the exercise of their official functions. These privileges and immunities, which are comparable with those routinely afforded to the staff of international organisations, are granted only in so far as they are necessary for the proper functioning of Europol. Europol is obliged to observe national laws and to waive immunities where possible in cases where the immunity would impede the course of justice.

All textphones at public call boxes provide access to the emergency services through the dialling of a dedicated access code. The text is then relayed on to the emergency services. BT has installed 1,950 public textphones at airports, railway stations and motorway service centres too. These offer BT's newly launched text relay services called 'TextDirect'.

 For three weeks, United States and British forces have been engaged in military action against Usama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban regime that shelters them in Afghanistan. The aims of the military action are clear: to destroy the terrorist camps; to pressure the Taliban regime to end its support for Usama bin Laden; and to create the right conditions for future operations in Afghanistan to maintain that pressure.

<P>
<a name="11029w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Strategic Defence Review and the experience and lessons from subsequent operations such as those in Kosovo have left us well placed to take on and defeat international terrorism. We have significantly improved important military capabilities including reconnaissance; intelligence; surveillance; target acquisition; precision strike; rapid deployment; and command and control. But the attacks on the United States have shown that we must build on this success and go further.
<P>

<a name="11029w09.html_para8">With operations continuing, it would be premature to draw conclusions on the implications for our future defence policy. We are, however, carrying out further work to ensure that our concepts, force structures, and capabilities are exactly those that we need in order to deal with asymmetric threats of the kind that we saw on 11 September. This work will look both at the defence of the UK and at our capability to counter and deter terrorism abroad.
<P>

<a name="11029w09.html_para9">The Ministry of Defence and the Services have well- practised systems for learning and implementing lessons from operations. These will be applied to Operation Veritas. This will ensure that our plans and policies evolve and that we are prepared for the challenges that we may face in the future.

 The total value of the signed PFI deals which are specific to the RAF or where the RAF is the major user is around &#163;850 million in net present value terms. It is not possible to make a meaningful estimate of the total through-life costs of planned PFI contracts at present. A number of projects are under consideration. They include the provision of our future air-to-air refuelling capability and the UK Military Flying Training Services, where the RAF will be a major customer. Each of these projects could involve through-life costs of &#163;10 billion or over. The RAF has also benefited from tri-Service deals such as the provision of commercial vehicles, materials handling and the Defence Fixed Telecommunications Services.

<a name="11029w11.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We have no evidence of a link between the standard of accommodation and recruiting.

<P>

<a name="11029w11.html_para3">We recognise, therefore, the importance of good quality accommodation for Service personnel and their families and we are committed to upgrading both Service Families Accommodation and Single Living Accommodation. In Great Britain the Defence Housing Executive is aiming to upgrade all of its core Service Families Accommodation to Standard 1 for condition (the highest grade) by November 2005. Furthermore, a project team was formed this year to oversee &#163;1 billion worth of investment over the next 10 years to upgrade Single Living Accommodation. This money is in addition to the &#163;1 billion that was already committed to the upgrade programme over the same period.

 Recruitment into the armed forces is open to British and Commonwealth citizens, and Republic of Ireland nationals.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence allocates defence expenditure in order to improve operational effectiveness and achieve value for money. Since 1999 the MOD has used the Index of Multiple Deprivation, along with other measures of social conditions, to inform decisions such as unit moves, site rationalisations and investment decisions on new facilities. The MOD does not, however, allocate expenditure with sole reference or respect to the Index of Multiple Deprivation or other measures of relative geographic deprivation.
<P>

<a name="11029w11.html_para15">Although the MOD does not solely allocate expenditure with respect to measures of geographic deprivation, a number of the activities we sponsor do assist areas of high deprivation. The 'Skill Force' programme, for example, is helping 47 schools in 11 areas, all of which are in areas that are among the most deprived in the UK. Skill Force is a MOD sponsored programme that uses retired military instructors to deliver a range of vocational skills training to young people.

<a name="11029w11.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We continue to work closely with the Meat and Livestock Commission to explore ways to increase the proportion of British meat we buy competitively. This has been a successful partnership and contributed to, for example, the supply of 100 per cent. British beef to our UK-based Service personnel between autumn 1998 and summer 2000. We continually monitor, with the Meat and Livestock Commission, the list of meat products required for the armed forces, and look for products which can be supplied from wholly United Kingdom sources. As a direct result of this communication and frequent meetings between the Defence Catering Group, the Meat and Livestock Commission and '3663', our food contractor, a range of British meat products have been added to a "core" list of products available to the armed forces, including British lamb shoulder and British thick rib beef. We will continue our dialogue with the Meat and Livestock Commission in order to maximise the amount of British product that can be supplied competitively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much <i>(a)</i> beef, <i>(b)</i> lamb and <i>(c)</i> pork was purchased since 1 January 2000 for consumption by the armed forces; how much of it was sourced from the United Kingdom; at what total costs; and what the per tonne cost from (i) United Kingdom and (ii) overseas sources has been.  [10791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w11.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since 1997 the task of buying food for the armed forces has been contracted to '3663' (formerly known as Booker Foodservice) and it is the Ministry of Defence's policy to require them to seek the best price in the open market; to do otherwise would contravene European law. Our contractor is specifically required to give full consideration to British products, which we look to them to buy wherever they are competitive.
<P>

<a name="11029w11.html_para16">Since January 2000, 3,983 tonnes of beef, 1,369 tonnes of lamb and 2,075 tonnes of pork have been supplied to the armed forces by '3663'. The average annual cost of beef and lamb is some &#163;6 million and &#163;2 million respectively. The average annual cost of all pig meat, including pork, is &#163;2.5 million.
<P>

<a name="11029w11.html_para17">In the case of beef, during the year 2000, 87 per cent. of all beef supplied (1,892 tonnes) was sourced from the UK. This followed the agreement we secured from the EC to release British intervention beef at competitive prices. As was announced to the House in July 2000 and again in May 2001, these stocks ran out during the summer of 2000 and market prices dictated that a mixture of British and imported beef would be required. Consequently, this year 31 per cent. of beef (571 tonnes) has been sourced from the UK.
<P>

<a name="11029w11.html_para18">In the case of pork and lamb, since January 2000, 84 per cent. of all pork supplied (1,750 tonnes and 4 per cent. of all lamb supplied (17 tonnes) was sourced from the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will instruct procurement officers responsible for the supply of meat to British service personnel stationed in the Falkland Islands to buy exclusively from the EU-approved abattoir on the islands.  [10800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w11.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has a contract for food supply with '3663' formerly trading as Booker Foodservice. The contract includes responsibility for the procurement of all commodities including meat and offal. The role of the Ministry of Defence's Defence Catering Group (DCG) is to work with the contractor to ensure that meat supplied to UK armed forces is procured from reputable sources and offers best value for money. This partnering approach extends to DCG making recommendations to '3663' regarding new sources of supply and supplementing '3663's own sourcing and quality assurance activities. The DCG is monitoring the development of the fledgling meat industry in the Falkland Islands and continues to assess the volumes of production, product availability and the quality standard of meat from the limited range of products available from the abattoir recently constructed to EU standards. It is understood that, for the foreseeable future, the output of the abattoir will be limited to lamb only. Any decision to procure meat from this particular facility to feed British service personnel in the Falkland Islands will ultimately rest with '3663' who will ensure that our stringent quality requirements are met or exceeded.

<P>
<a name="11029w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence has funded research into both the metallurgical and ballistic aspects of tungsten penetrators in tank ammunition over a period of more than 30 years. With other UK research this has produced extensive data on the performance of different tungsten materials and designs. Depleted uranium has consistently outperformed tungsten alloy equivalents as a kinetic penetrator when employed in anti-armour weapon systems; its use, therefore, offers increased operational effectiveness. In recent years, a new tungsten round has been developed for the Royal Navy's Phalanx close-in-weapons system. Anti-armour properties are not important for this weapon system; in this case, a tungsten round offers improved performance. Since 1996 all replacement ammunition for the Phalanx system has been of the tungsten variety.

 We take very seriously the need to protect UK armed forces personnel against all threats, including the potential hazards presented by chemical and biological weapons.

<a name="11029w12.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence employs depleted uranium (DU) in three principal ways. It is used in ammunition for the weapons systems for the Challenger II tank and the Royal Navy's Phalanx close in weapon system. A DU-based round was also developed for use in the Challenger 1 tank for use in the Gulf conflict. C-130J/K Hercules and Tristar aircraft and some Wessex helicopters use DU as either a counterweight or as ballast. DU is used to shield radiological sources (such as nuclear reactors) and in nuclear medicine. In addition, small amounts of DU are used for defence research purposes, and some nuclear weapons also contain uranium in this form.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para0">We aim to increase total health expenditure in the United Kingdom up to the average of the countries of the European Union, which is around 8 per cent. of gross domestic product. By the end of the present spending review period (2003&#150;04), we expect that total UK expenditure on health will have reached 7.7 per cent. of gross domestic product. This assumes private sector spending will remain at around 1 per cent. of GDP. Expenditure beyond this period will be decided in future spending reviews.

 The Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices were chosen to provide a mixture of rural, urban and inner city offices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what specific measures he has proposed to allow those living in rural constituencies without a jobcentre nearby access to personal advice from his Department.  [8273]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 From April next year, the Employment Service and the parts of the Benefits Agency that support people of working age will come together to form a new business, Jobcentre Plus. We are aiming to launch 15 of the 17 Jobcentre Plus pathfinder areas this month, comprising around 50 pathfinder offices. We anticipate that the remaining two pathfinder areas will be operating by the end of the year, once building work is completed. As the service rolls out, we will deliver an integrated service to employers and benefit claimants of working age nationally.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para1">Jobcentre Plus will offer a significantly enhanced telephone service that will improve access to the service for those who do not live near a Jobcentre Plus office. Each Jobcentre Plus pathfinder office will have a dedicated telephone contact centre open from 8.30 am to 6.00 pm. Customers will be able to make their initial claim to benefit through this service and book appointments with personal advisers. Customers will also be able to access job vacancies over the telephone through Employment Service Direct.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para2">Jobcentre Plus will also have its own internet site with information on the service and links to the Employment Service Job Bank and Worktrain sites, which offer a vast range of job and training opportunities and advice on job searching.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para3">There are several Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices in rural locations, and the managers in those places will be further developing the service they offer to meet the needs of rural communities.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para4">The development of services for people in rural communities is not confined to the Jobcentre Plus pathfinders, with both the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service already undertaking valuable outreach work. In north Yorkshire for example, the Northallerton and Richmond Jobcentres are engaged in outreach work to some of their outlying rural areas. Vacancy lists are put on display in a large number of local post offices and Jobcentre "clinics" are held in three locations&#151;Hawes, Leyburn and Catterick&#151;for half a day each week.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what representations he has received regarding his plans to remove protective screens for Benefits Agency staff; what risk assessment has been undertaken and by whom; what consultation he has had with the relevant trade unions; and what account he has taken of the views expressed.  [10802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Jobcentre Plus is a new service which brings together the Employment Service and those parts of the Benefits Agency which deal with people of working age. Jobcentre Plus will provide a far more personalised, customer friendly and work-focused service for both employers and individuals. The first 49 Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices opened on 22 October.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para5">Central to the new service is our ability to provide face-to-face advice to members of the public. That can be done only in a predominantly unscreened environment. To 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 524W</I><P>
that end we have invested considerable sums of money in building a far more friendly and safer environment than any we have had in the past. In particular we take the issue of the safety of both the public and our staff very seriously. We have therefore been involved in discussions with the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) about some of their members' concerns about the new working arrangements, both at national and local level.
<P>

<a name="11029w13.html_para6">Employment Service and Land Securities Trillium risk assessors have carried out risk assessments in each pathfinder office. Drawing on those assessments, and following consultation with local trade union health and safety representatives, we have introduced a series of extra security measures. These include: wide coverage by closed circuit television; training for staff in how to handle difficult situations; better management in each office to avoid difficult situations building up; panic alarms; and more visible and more effective security guards. Additionally, in each pathfinder area there are screened facilities to deal with individuals and parts of the business which pose a greater risk. We believe that these measures demonstrate that we are taking security even more seriously than we have done in the past.

<a name="11029w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Reed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will estimate the cost of the abolition of tuition fees in the 2002&#150;03 financial year; what plans she has to review the impact of tuition fees on entry levels into higher education from social classes D and E; and if she will make a statement.  [9078]<P>

<P>
<a name="11029w15.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The estimated cost of abolishing student contributions to tuition fees in England and Wales in the financial year 2002&#150;03 would be &#163;270 million in cash terms. This figure represents only a proportion of the full year cost. The full year cost, for academic year 2002&#150;03, would be &#163;410 million in cash terms setting aside any implications for student support. We are currently reviewing the student funding arrangements. We need to ensure that we have an appropriate balance between the contribution made by students, their families and the state to support our ambitions to widen access and participation in higher education. A range of policy options is being considered. No decisions have been taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We expect that the new education funding formula for schools will consist of an amount per pupil, with enhancements for authorities where significant deprivation adds to education costs, and a separate enhancement for areas where schools need to pay more to recruit and retain staff. The Government will consult widely on the formulae for services funded through the local government finance system, including that for education, prior to the introduction of a new system in April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w16.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Department launched the Centre for the Economics of Education (CEE) in February 2000 to undertake research into the economics of education. This centre has published several studies that have examined the economic benefits from education, including higher education. This research shows that the economic benefits from participating in higher education are substantial. The Labour Force Survey shows that graduates now earn 35 per cent. more than the average salary. This differential reflects graduates' higher productivity. Research shows that the earnings gains enjoyed by graduates have been maintained during the expansion in HE during the last 25 years. This indicates the continued strong growth in the demand for graduates.

<a name="11029w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Local authorities operate a variety of collection schemes, through civic amenity sites, bring sites and kerbside collection.
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para1">Local authorities are required to collect commercial waste if requested to do so, but may charge. They will therefore do so only where it is convenient for the business concerned. We have no specific information on the arrangements for recycling this material.
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para2">Under best value local authorities must provide information on the percentage of the population that is currently served by kerbside collection of recyclables or is within 1 km radius of a recycling centre. The latest data are at the following website: www.local-regions.dtlr.gov.uk/ bestvalue/indicators.
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para3">The latest information on kerbside schemes alone show that these are continuing to develop and now provide nearly 30 per cent. of recycled material and cover around 43 per cent. of households in England and Wales. These schemes currently produce on average 81 kg per household per annum for those households covered, however there is a wide range with some schemes achieving very low yields and a few achieving more than 200 kg. The success of schemes depend on both participation and capture rates. Rates of participation are typically in the range 30&#150;85 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para4">We have set challenging statutory performance standards for every local authority which overall triple household waste recycling and composting. As a minimum local authorities must deliver 10 per cent. recycling and/or composting of household waste by 2003&#150;04 and 18 per cent. by 2005&#150;06. It is for local authorities to decide how they should meet their performance standard.

<a name="11029w16.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> There is no EU directive on the recycling of household waste. The EU landfill directive (99/31/EC) sets challenging targets for the reduction of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill. We consulted earlier this year on a system of tradable landfill permits for waste disposal authorities. We will announce the final form of the scheme in due course and will introduce a Bill when parliamentary time permits.




<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 535W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para6">Meeting the Landfill Directive targets will require a greater percentage of household waste to be recycled, and the Government's Waste Strategy 2000 set targets to increase recycling in England and Wales. These targets are:
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11029w16.html_para10">To underpin these national targets we have set statutory recycling performance standards for each local authority in England. For example, Surrey county council currently recycles or composts approximately 15 per cent. of waste collected and must increase this to 30 per cent. for 2003&#150;04 and 36 per cent. for 2005&#150;06. We will consider future standards in the light of technological advances, with the aim of maximising the recycling and composting of waste.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason the recycling of domestic composting is not counted when assessing local authority performance against recycling targets.  [9613]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We do measure local authority recycling and composting as a percentage of the waste stream. But there are great difficulties with accurately measuring home composting and the volume of waste that local authorities would otherwise have handled.
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para11">There are none the less clear incentives for local authorities to support home composting, including savings in the costs of waste collection and transport.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w16.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on methods used for recycling industrial waste.  [9949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Of the 400 million tonnes or so of waste produced in England and Wales each year around 78 million tonnes is waste produced by industry and commerce. Nearly half of industrial and commercial waste is already recycled and recycling is highest for separately collected waste streams such as metals and scrap equipment and paper and card. The Government are keen to encourage still higher recycling rates and have set a target to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of the 1998 level by 2005.
<P>

<a name="11029w16.html_para12">The extension of producer responsibilities will contribute to the achievement of this target&#151;both through statutory schemes implementing EU legislation such as the Packaging Directive and forthcoming directives on end of life vehicles and waste electronic and electrical equipment and through voluntary schemes such as that with newspaper publishers and one currently being negotiated on junk mail. The Government also fund Envirowise to give advice to businesses on how to minimise their waste and has set up the Waste and Resources Action Programme to develop markets for recycled materials.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what contingency plans she has for <i>(a)</i> a rhizomania epidemic in sugar beet crops and <i>(b)</i> potato brown rot.  [8293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w17.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> The Department has written contingency plans against outbreaks of a number of serious plant pests and diseases, including rhizomania of sugar beet and potato brown rot.
<P>

<a name="11029w17.html_para0">Statutory measures have been taken against rhizomania since the first UK finding in 1987, to slow the spread of the disease until such time as high-yielding disease tolerant varieties became available to UK farmers. Action has been taken against a further 210 outbreaks discovered during annual official surveys, including 68 so far this year. Disease tolerant varieties are now available and we will be consulting shortly on the future of the containment policy and the UK's "protected zone" status within the EC. This status imposes precautionary measures on the movement of certain commodities from other countries where rhizomania is already widely established.
<P>

<a name="11029w17.html_para1">Our contingency plans for outbreaks of potato brown rot reflect the measures set out in EC Directive 98/57 which are aimed at eradication and containment of that disease. Over the last three years we have co-ordinated an exercise to eradicate the bacterium which causes brown rot from a number of river systems in east Anglia and one in Kent. We are currently evaluating the results of that exercise.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> All energy from waste was classified as a renewable energy source under the original Non Fossil Fuels Order. However, the EU Directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal energy market classifies only the biodegradable element of waste as a renewable source.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w17.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The Animal Movement Licensing System allows foot and mouth disease susceptible animals to move for commercial and welfare reasons. Limited movement in high risk counties in infected areas is also possible. The arrangements are intended to strike a balance between the commercial and welfare needs of farmers and their animals, and the need to contain and eradicate foot and mouth disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason further blood tests are carried out in protection zones after blood test results from the infected premises and contiguous cull farms have proved to be negative.  [6665]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Many foot and mouth disease (FMD) infected premises are confirmed on clinical grounds, by the vet on the spot in liaison with vets at DEFRA HQ. Subsequent negative results from blood tests do not necessarily mean that there was no disease on the premises. Blood tests for FMD antibodies are carried out on all farms with sheep and goats within 3 km of infected premises to check for presence of the disease. Blood sampling has to take place at least 21 days after preliminary cleansing and disinfection of the infected premises and this interval should allow time for any infected animals to produce detectable antibodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the <i>(a)</i> safety and <i>(b)</i> marketing in the UK of milk and meat from animals vaccinated against foot and mouth disease.  [5251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Veterinary Medicines Directorate has assessed the foot and mouth disease vaccines that might be used in the UK for safety in relation to the consumer. They concluded that there are no risks to human health associated with vaccination of animals intended for the production of milk or meat for human consumption. This assessment is based on the fact that these vaccines consist of purified, inactivated viruses together with a number of other ingredients which are widely used in other vaccines for animals. The Food Standards Agency has also considered this issue and is satisfied that the use of such a vaccine would not have implications for food safety.
<P>

<a name="11029w17.html_para4">There has been no official assessment on marketing in the UK of milk and meat from animals vaccinated against foot and mouth disease.

<P>
<P>

 Monitoring carried out by the Environment Agency for the Department of Health has confirmed that there is very little risk to human health following the removal of ash from the incineration of carcases.

 Work is under way within the EU to establish a framework for the assessment of the environmental impact of ionising radiation. The project is due to finish in October 2003. A recent study on behalf of the Environment Agency and English Nature "Impact Assessment of Ionising Radiation in Wildlife", published in July this year, concluded that wildlife is not significantly impacted by exposure to ionising radiation from authorised discharges. The study, however, recommended some specific areas that needed to be investigated further.
<P>

<a name="11029w18.html_para4">Proposals for liquid or aerial discharges of radioactive waste, or the disposal of solid low-level radioactive waste, are subject to authorisation by the appropriate regulator. In examining such proposals the regulators satisfy themselves, among other things, that alternatives, where they exist, are properly evaluated and that the resulting authorisation will result in a low environmental impact and that it is based on the best practicable environmental option.
<P>

<a name="11029w18.html_para5">Last year the Government published for consultation a draft "UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001&#150;02", and draft "Statutory Guidance on the Regulation of Radioactive Discharges into the Environment from Nuclear Licensed Sites". Final versions of both documents will be published shortly. The former is the Government's strategy for complying with the commitments it and other members of OSPAR entered into in 1998 for reducing radioactive discharges into the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic in the period up to 2020. The second is guidance 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 2001 : Column: 545W</I><P>
to the Environment Agency about the setting of radioactive discharge limits which will help to ensure compliance with the objectives of the strategy.
<P>

<a name="11029w18.html_para6">The Government published in September this year a consultation paper "Managing Radioactive Waste Safely". The purpose of the consultation is to set in train a process for deciding how radioactive waste can best be managed. Nuclear power generation contributes 23 per cent. of the total volume of radioactive waste. Nuclear power contributes about 26 per cent. of the UK's electricity supply and plays an important role in helping the UK to meet its climate change target. In 1998 nuclear power generation was estimated to have reduced UK carbon emissions by between 12 and 24 million tonnes. At present, high and intermediate-level waste from nuclear power generation is safely stored at nuclear licensed sites. Low-level waste is mostly disposed of at BNFL's facility at Drigg in Cumbria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11029w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK made representations to the Council of Ministers on 23 October opposing the Commission proposal to withdraw the authorisation of nicarbazin.
<P>

<a name="11029w20.html_para1">The proposal to withdraw nicarbazin was due solely to the company responsible for the product not having supplied a complete data dossier for re-evaluation by the agreed deadline.
<P>

<a name="11029w20.html_para2">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the Food Standards Agency are not aware of any evidence that nicarbazin is mutagenic. At the March 2001 Standing Committee for Animal Nutrition, the Commission agreed to postpone any decision on the future authorisation of nicarbazin and to allow the company time to submit additional information. The company commissioned the tests required to generate the missing data, and all reports are expected to be submitted by February 2002. Despite this, the Commission included nicarbazin in the proposal.
<P>

<a name="11029w20.html_para3">In view of this and potential serious bird health and welfare problems, the UK believed that the authorisation for nicarbazin should not have been withdrawn simply to meet an arbitrary Commission deadline.
<P>

<a name="11029w20.html_para4">Regarding dimetridazole, the UK did not oppose its inclusion in the proposal to withdraw authorisation.
<P>

<a name="11029w20.html_para5">The dossier submitted by the company responsible for the product was inadequate, consisting only of an index and no data. The company did not indicate a firm commitment at an early stage to submit the missing data. The Commission did not offer the company time to submit the data and unlike nicarbazin there has been evidence of safety concerns. The rapporteur for the product, France, indicated at a Standing Committee meeting that it would not support a proposal for the authorisation of DMZ to continue. Under those circumstances the UK felt it was impossible to argue for the continued authorisation of dimetridazole.
<P>

<a name="11029w20.html_para6">It should be noted that despite the UK's representations to the Council of Ministers, we failed to get the Commission to reconsider the proposal to withdraw nicarbazin, and along with dimetridazole the authorisations will be withdrawn. This will result in the products being removed from the market six months after the commission regulation is published.

<sup>(20)</sup> From 1998 all farmers managing holdings for limited companies were asked to classify themselves as salaried managers.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In 1998 fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions. It appears that this change may have led to the recording of additional labour not previously included in the census returns. The change in questions has also led to a redistribution of labour between the various categories, most notably for salaried managers. Caution is therefore advised when comparing the 1997 and 1998 results.<P>

2. Part-time is defined as 39 hours or less.<P>

3. Figures exclude school children but include trainees employed under an official youth training scheme and paid at Agricultural Wages Board rates or above.<P>

The leaflet advises that, for processed food, if the country of origin is shown on the label, it usually refers to the country where the product was processed, and not necessarily where the beef or other ingredients came from. This is one of the reasons why the FSA is pressing for improved European Union rules on country of origin labelling.

However, NHS bodies will need to apply the same criteria to purchasing treatment abroad as they do to purchasing treatment in the NHS or United Kingdom-based independent sector, including value for money.

<P>

<a name="11029w21.html_para1">The implications of health of Aventis genetically modified maize known as T25 were assessed during the passage of the marketing dossier through the European GMO regulatory regime. T25 maize was granted regulatory approval under Directive 90/220 for unrestricted cultivation throughout the European Union in 1998 through the French authorities. The dossier, including the assessment of risks to health, is on the public register held by my Department and is available for scrutiny.

<a name="11029w21.html_para2">However concerns about the safety of T25 maize for animal feed have been raised and need to be addressed. These concerns have been presented in public as part of the DEFRA public hearing into the seed listing of the variety of T25 known as ChardonLL. This hearing is currently suspended pending further information from the European Commission and the French competent authorities. However, the Government have referred all the written evidence presented to the hearing relating to the safety of T25 to the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment for advice. ACRE has sought further advice on the animal feed issues from the Advisory Committee on Animal Feed. ACRE expects to finalise its advice to Government before the end of the year.

<a name="11029w21.html_para8">A total budget of nearly &#163;3 million over three years from the Public Health Development Fund has been allocated for this initiative.

 NHS Direct received 3.5 million calls during 2000&#150;01, of which between 6 and 8 per cent. were logged as mental health-related. However, there is evidence from an independent study commissioned by the Department to suggest that a higher number of mental health calls were actually received and handled.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made towards meeting his targets of reducing waiting times to <i>(a)</i> a maximum of six months by the end of 2005 for in-patients and <i>(b)</i> a maximum of three months by 2005 for out-patients.  [10545]<P>

 In order to achieve maximum waiting times of six months for in-patients and three months for out-patients by 2005, shorter maximum waiting times are being phased. This year the national health service is working towards reducing the maximum in-patient waiting time of 18 months now to 15 months and the waiting time standard for a first out-patient appointment of over six months now to a maximum of six months by the end of March 2002. In-patient waiting times will continue to fall on a staged basis each year from 18 months through to 15, 12, nine down to six months. Waiting times for a first out-patient appointment will also fall from six months, to five, four, then eventually three months by 2005.
