<a name="30327w01.html_sbhd0"><H3 align=center>Armed Forces Compensation Scheme</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w01.html_wqn0"><B> Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what representations he has received within the last 12 months about changes to the criteria in the armed forces compensation scheme for service personnel claiming disability compensation; and if he will make a statement;  [105299]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether it is his intention to change the criteria of the armed forces compensation scheme for service personnel claiming disability compensation from the basis of reasonable doubt to the balance of probability; and if he will make a statement.  [105300]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence currently provides compensation for death and disablement caused or aggravated by service under two schemes, the War Pension Scheme (WPS) and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). Each scheme operates under separate legislation and the standard of proof applied to claims under the two schemes is different.
<P>

<a name="30327w01.html_para0">The War Pension Scheme was introduced in 1917 and its generous standard of proof reflects in particular the limits of medical understanding of the time. Claims may be made at any time after service release. Specifically, where a claim is made to a War Pension within seven years of termination of service, the onus is wholly on the Secretary of State to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the disablement was not due to service. Where a claim is made more than seven years after termination, the onus rests on the claimant to raise reasonable doubt by reliable evidence that the disablement is due to service, the claimant receiving the benefit of any reasonable doubt. The attributable benefits elements of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme introduced attributable pensions in 1973. This applies to disablements leading to medical discharge; it considers claims against the balance of probabilities standard of proof, in line with most other such schemes and the practice of civil courts. It places the onus of proof on the individual.
<P>

<a name="30327w01.html_para1">It has not been considered appropriate so far to change these arrangements but the issue has been considered within the current review of armed forces compensation arrangements. In March 2001, we published proposals for a new armed forces compensation scheme based entirely on the balance of probabilities standard of proof A number of respondents have expressed their concern that this would not be appropriate to the special status of the armed forces and the demands placed on them. This view has been particularly strongly represented by ex-service organisations. We have been in close consultation with these and other interested groups and will continue 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2003 : Column 306W</I><P>
to work with the ex-service community in finalising the details of the new scheme. We expect to make a final decision on the broad design of a new scheme shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 18 March 2003]:</i> The United Kingdom has a long-standing bilateral arrangement with the United States that enables our personnel to receive logistical services and food from US and local sources. This arrangement provides a framework of enabling contracts, some elements of which are calculated on anticipated daily consumption rates and others on term hire rates. These arrangements apply mainly to base camps and are likely to remain in place for the duration of operations in Iraq. We also contract for support services independently where this is more appropriate. In addition, a number of items of clothing and footwear have been acquired from the US at a cost of around &#163;250,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The ambit of Defence Votes does not ordinarily include funding for humanitarian aid, which is a Department for International Development responsibility. However, &#163;30 million has been made available, so far, for the conflict in Iraq, to cover the United Kingdom's legal requirements under the 1949 Geneva Convention for the Protection of Civilians in Time of War.

 Arrangements between the media and the Ministry of Defence during the conflict in Iraq are conducted in accordance with the details laid out in the Green Book&#151;"Working Arrangements with the Media in times of Emergency, Tension, Conflict or War". This covers the practical arrangements for enabling media representatives to report events both at home and abroad and includes our plans for representative numbers of correspondents to accompany British Forces in the frontline. It also outlines the policy that would facilitate or restrict the activities of journalists

 Arrangements between the media and the Ministry of Defence during the conflict in Iraq are conducted in accordance with the details laid out in the Green Book&#151;"Working Arrangements with the Media in times of Emergency, Tension, Conflict or War". The document has been made available to the media and has been placed on the MOD website at:
<P>

<a name="30327w01.html_para2">www.mod.uk/news/green book/index.htm
<P>

<a name="30327w01.html_para3">The MOD recognises that casualty information is of legitimate interest to the media and the general public. However, the Green Book explains that our casualty notification process has been developed to minimise the distress of the families concerned, and states that the names of casualties will not be released or confirmed until the next of kin have been told officially. We recognise that on occasions the media may become aware of the names of individual casualties before official announcements are made. Editors are urged not to publish such information, gained from whatever source&#151;even if it comes directly from a next of kin&#151;until it is released or confirmed by the MOD. Editors are also urged to exercise extreme discretion in approaching next of kin.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish the advice he has given to the <i>(a)</i> print and <i>(b)</i> broadcast media to permit them to have access to the conflict in Iraq whilst maintaining personal safety.  [105375]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In relation to war correspondents embedded with United Kingdom forces in the Gulf, the arrangements for the print and broadcast media are conducted in accordance with the guidance set out in the Green Book, which is entitled "Working Arrangements with the Media in times of Emergency, Tension, Conflict or War". A copy of this is available on the Ministry of Defence web-site (www.MOD.UK).
<P>

<a name="30327w01.html_para4">The Green Book sets out the arrangements for the selection of, and regulations for, accredited war correspondents. In return for protection and support, and access to other facilities, correspondents agree to undergo the necessary training and to abide by the operational security and safety measures required by the unit to which they are attached.
<P>

<a name="30327w01.html_para5">The Ministry of Defence has no responsibility for the activities of independent media personnel. The current FCO travel advice is not to travel to Iraq. This advice has been strongly emphasised to the media by the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not exclusively monitor reports from print and broadcast journalists operating in Iraq. However, we do receive a daily press cutting service highlighting stories in the printed media with a defence interest and, during the present crisis, we have appointed a watchkeeper in our Press Office to monitor the broadcast output from the main channels. The Media Monitoring Unit of the Cabinet Office also provides the Department with a daily Iraq briefing.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Weapons in service with the United Kingdom armed forces that dispense sub-munitions systems remain both effective and legal. We continue nevertheless to conduct and fund research programmes investigating the means to provide precise and discriminating methods of attacking targets, including terminal guided sub-munition technologies.
<P>

<a name="30327w02.html_para0">We have no current plans to replace the in-service CHARM 3 depleted uranium round used in the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank. Recent research on tank munitions has covered the penetration of armour process and support to commissioning new tank barrels for Challenger 2 tanks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what consultations he has had with allies on the provision of theatre missile defence capabilities for UK troops when on joint operations;  [104343]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The United Kingdom is continuing its work on the risks posed by ballistic missiles and on the technologies available to counter them. We remain in regular contact with allies about such matters and continue to co-operate with NATO in their feasibility

<P>

<a name="30327w02.html_para1">Defence against ballistic missiles has several components. Arms control, preventing supply and deterring use all have a part to play alongside defence against use. Military planning therefore includes consideration of how actively to prevent the use of ballistic missiles through threat reduction operations. Passive defensive steps are also considered, including the dispersal of forces and the provision of equipment to protect against the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.

 The Ministry of Defence has received several representations on this matter and I accordingly met with representatives from the Ulster Defence Regiment widows and widowers on 5 March 2003.

<P>

<a name="30327w02.html_para3">The removal of most of the exemptions is a counter-balance to the increased risk created by the reduction in the standstill period.

I shall continue to fund our scientific work and to press for action, with a view to securing concrete proposals from the Commission and their adoption by the Council.

<P>
<a name="30327w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 11 March 2003]:</i> The milk tokens represent some 130 million litres of milk per year, or 1 per cent. of the total production of milk in Great Britain. It is difficult to assess to what extent milk consumption might fall as a result of the proposals, as milk would still be available under the fixed value voucher system proposed by the Department of Health, albeit along with other foods.
<P>

<a name="30327w04.html_para0">The dairy industry has expressed concern that the removal of the milk token system would have an adverse effect on milk rounds, given that milk delivered under the Welfare Food Scheme represents about 5 per cent. of all doorstep deliveries. The Department of Health has conducted a major consultation exercise on its proposals, the results of which have now been published.
<P>

<a name="30327w04.html_para1">The reforms were proposed following medical advice that mothers and children required access to a broader range of foods than had been available under the scheme.

The key criteria in booking flights is value for money although there are guidelines on staff entitlement.

 Information on the occasions where my Department, agencies and non-departmental public bodies failed to pay valid invoices within 30 days or after the agreed credit period can only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However I am able to say that the percentage of bills which were paid by my Department within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice was 98 per cent. for the financial year 2001&#150;02. The average percentage of bills paid by my Department's agencies was 99 per cent. over the same period. The average percentage of bills paid by my Department's executive non- departmental public bodies was 89 per cent. over the same period.

 The UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator. The security regulator works closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the safety regulator, which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations. Security at nuclear sites is kept under regular review in the light of the prevailing threat and has been significantly enhanced since the terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001. It is not Government policy to disclose details of these measures, which could potentially be of use to terrorist under Exemption 1&#151;Defence, Security and International Relation, of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<a name="30327w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland on how many occasions since Quarter 2 of 1997 the percentage growth of GDP in Scotland has exceeded that of the UK as a whole.  [101972]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 On eight occasions since Quarter 2 of 1997 quarterly figures for GDP at constant basic prices have shown quarterly rates of growth for Scotland exceeding those for the UK as a whole.

<P>
<a name="30327w07.html_wqn2"><B> Pete Wishart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if she will estimate the impact of increasing the minimum wage <i>(a)</i> in line with average earnings, <i>(b)</i> to &#163;4.17 per hour, <i>(c)</i> to &#163;4.87 per hour, <i>(d)</i> to &#163;5.00 per hour and <i>(e)</i> to &#163;5.30 per hour, on the cost of salaries of departmental employees (i) in total and (ii) for each nation of the United Kingdom in the next financial year.  [90606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In the current financial year, the lowest salary level in my department is &#163;10,300, which equates to an hourly rate of &#163;4.71. The effect of a minimum wage of &#163;4.17 would therefore be nil.
<P>

<a name="30327w07.html_para0">If the minimum wage was raised to higher levels there would be an effect on the cost of salaries but, given the very small numbers of staff involved, this would not be significant.

 On 23 February, as part of a continuing programme of briefing backbench MPs on NI issues, the Secretary of State provided dinner at the Hilton Hotel for a party of backbench Labour MPs at a total cost of &#163;639.35.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answer of 5 March, <i>Official Report</i>, column 194W, when a decision will be made on which library facilities will benefit from the recently announced investment.  [104729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w07.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 A decision should be taken before the end of 2003 on which library projects are suitable for inclusion in the Strategic Investment Programme. The facilities that actually benefit will then depend on a number of factors including the outcome of the public private partnership procurement methodology that can take a year to 18 months to complete.




<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2003 : Column 329W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30327w07.html_para1">The Department of Culture Arts and Leisure has commissioned PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) to carry out a feasibility study to evaluate the potential for various forms of Public Private Partnership (PPP) to deliver improved value for money in library facilities when compared with more conventional procurement and to identify the forms of PPP that offer the greatest potential for improved value for money. The report is expected within a month and will help me to identify the high priority library projects that are most likely to attract private sector interest and therefore benefit from the Strategic Investment Programme. Within this programme &#163;20 million has been identified for potential library and other information resources projects.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1) whether outside funding has been used to finance the police band;  [105078]
<P>
<UL>(2) how much the police band has cost in each of the last five years; [105133]

(3) how many band members there were of the RUC/PSNI band in each of the last five years.  [105135]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w07.html_spnew10"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Despite attempts to source private sector funding and a National Lottery grant, no outside funding has ever been secured to finance the police band.
<P>

<a name="30327w07.html_para3">The established strength of the PSNI band is a complement of 40 members. The actual strength has varied slightly from time to time as members left and others joined the band. When the decision was taken to stand down the band there were 32 members.
<P>

<a name="30327w07.html_para4">Cost figures for the band for the last three years are shown in the table.

<P>
16. <a name="30327w08.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the level of business investment as a proportion of GDP since 1997 in <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> constant prices; and if he will make a statement.  [105165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w08.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In 2002, business investment stood at 12.4 per cent. of constant price GDP and 10.1 per cent. of current price GDP. Clearly the challenging global economic environment of recent years has had an adverse impact on investment in the UK as in all the other major economies. Nonetheless, even amidst the difficulties of the world economy in 2001 and 2002, business investment still stood 26 per cent. higher last year, in real terms, than it did in the year before this Government took office.

 The Government accounts for their PPP and PFI liabilities in accordance with independently established accounting standards. Our treatment of PFI is audited by the National Audit Office and other independent audit bodies. We publish a full record of future payments under PFI contracts in the Budget.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many taxpayers paid income tax at the higher rate in <i>(a)</i> 2002 and <i>(b)</i> 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [105167]<P>

<P>
19. <a name="30327w08.html_wqn4"><B> Jim Dobbin: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact of his proposed International Finance Facility on education in developing countries.  [105168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w08.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The proposed International Finance Facility would seek to double aid for the world's poorest countries from $50 billion a year today to $100 billion a year up to 2015. It is designed specifically to help provide the additional finance needed to meet the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
<P>

<a name="30327w08.html_para1">This includes the goal of achieving universal primary education for all by 2015. Best available estimates suggest that achieving this would require around $10 billion more each year to be spent on education. The IFF would seek to provide this and the further finance needed to meet all the MDGs.

<P>
20. <a name="30327w08.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what new plans he has to stimulate investment in manufacturing.  [105169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w08.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The most important contribution Government can make is to create a stable macroeconomic environment in which manufacturers can invest, grow and prosper. The Government have also introduced measures to help UK manufacturers improve their investment, productivity and competitiveness. Cuts in corporation tax and the R&D tax credit will substantially benefit manufacturers, while new venture capital funds, increased RDA budgets, strong spending on science and innovation, and our initiatives to boost skills are all stimulating investment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w08.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the Chancellor's reply to the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) earlier today on plans to discuss progress at the IMF and World bank.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w08.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government have received a number of representations from businesses in all sectors of the economy. Ministers and officials have also met with business leaders to discuss representations, and to consider the role the Government can continue to play in fostering enterprise, improving productivity, and ensuring a competitive economy.

 The Chancellor made it clear to the House on 12 February 2003 that the Treasury would be studying the Treasury Select Committee Report into the STEPS deal. The Government will be responding to the committee's report in due course.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what critieria are used to identify National Savings and Investments which are dormant savings and investment accounts; how much remains in such accounts; and how many such accounts there are.  [104982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 In common with other financial institutions, National Savings and Investments (NS&I) identifies a holding as dormant when it knows that it has lost touch with its customer&#151;e.g. mail returned as undelivered. Given current IT capability, it is not yet possible to define and precisely quantify dormant holdings because the nature of some NS&I products means there may not be any contact with the holder for many years but the holding is still live.
<P>

<a name="30327w09.html_para3">"Unclaimed monies" in the NS&I Product Accounts relate to products which have been redeemed by the Treasury, or where monthly interest or prizes are due. These monies are regarded as unclaimed when NS&I have been unable to make the payment and where the sums involved have been transferred to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt. The total at 31 March 2002 was 30.1m. But it is not possible to say how many such holdings exist.

 The information sought is not available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

<a name="30327w13.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID has been in close discussion with the Ministry of Defence over many months working to minimise the humanitarian impact of any conflict; both to limit the risks to the Iraqi population and the infrastructure on which they depend, and to ensure that UK forces meet their obligations under The Hague and Geneva conventions governing armed conflict.
<P>

<a name="30327w13.html_para7">DFID has provided funding to humanitarian agencies to enable them to pre-position stocks for the Iraqi people.

<a name="30327w13.html_spnew11"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions 661, 687 and 778, the UK Government have the power to freeze the accounts of the Government of Iraq, bodies incorporated in Iraq and residents of Iraq. UK banks hold US$648 million in frozen Iraqi assets.
<P>

<a name="30327w13.html_para11">The UK Government do not have the power to appropriate the assets in these accounts, and we are considering how best to deal with them.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the lead Department for policy relating to the control of noise pollution and nuisance and my right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what action she is taking to encourage the <i>(a)</i> Football Association, <i>(b)</i> Rugby Football Union, <i>(c)</i> Lawn Tennis Association and <i>(d)</i> England and Wales Cricket Board to (i) increase participation in their sports, (ii) increase participation in their sports by those of Asian origin and (iii) increase participation in their sports by those living in inner city areas; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="30327w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Sport's governing bodies are essential to the Government's plans to increase levels of sporting participation.
<P>

<a name="30327w16.html_para4">(i) &#163;40 million in new Lottery funding has recently been made available to national governing bodies to improve their mechanisms for delivering improvements in participation levels. In addition, the Government has taken steps to assist governing-body affiliated, and other, Community Amateur Sports Clubs in offering opportunities for people of all ages to participate in healthy recreation. DCMS worked closely with the Charity Commission on the revised guidance issued in March 2002, which will make many more local clubs are eligible for the financial benefits of charitable status;
<P>

<a name="30327w16.html_para5">(ii) The Government have worked closely with the Football Association, the Rugby Football Union, the Lawn Tennis Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board increase participation among Asian people. I fully support the efforts of these governing bodies in this area, which include FA projects in Leicester and elsewhere, the RFU's social inclusion programmes including its work at the Islamic High School for Girls in Central Manchester, the LTA's inner city tennis projects and the ECB's Racial Equality Intermediate Level Award-approved coaching projects;
<P>

<a name="30327w16.html_para6">(iii) all four of these governing bodies run sporting access schemes for children in inner urban areas, which complement Sport England's Sport Action Zones initiative in some of the most socially and economically deprived areas of the country. The Government will be investing &#163;60 million over the three years from 2003&#150;04 through the Community Clubs Investment Programme, the focus of which will be on increasing participation levels in deprived areas and among disadvantaged groups. The Government have funded additional and complementary sporting initiatives in deprived areas through the Positive Futures and Splash projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Figures on the number of public sports facilities in Harrow, London and England, which are in need of refurbishment are not available. Local authorities are the key providers of sport and recreation facilities in their areas and significant investment from the National Lottery has helped to create new state of the art community facilities. DCMS, in partnership with Sport England is developing an England-wide database

of sports facilities, which will enable more strategic Government investment in those areas and facilities that are most important.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w16.html_wqn4"><B> Sir John Stanley: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps the Government is taking to encourage states who have acceded to the Hague conventions also to become members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. [102502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w16.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 I apologise for my late reply, which is due to an administrative error. As part of its consistent support for the Hague Conference, the Government has encouraged the rapid and recent world-wide expansion of the Conference's membership; in particular, it routinely endorses applications to join from individual countries. In 2000 my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor wrote to the Ministers of Justice in South Africa, New Zealand and India to advocate membership of the conference; the first two of these countries have subsequently joined. He will continue to promote the advantages of membership on his visits to countries which have yet to join.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make it the policy of the Government to allow postal service of form N39 requiring a judgment debtor to attend an oral examination at the county court.  [104773]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w16.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 No. The order must be served on the debtor personally and the creditor must file an affidavit by the person who served the order giving details of how and when it was served. This is because non-attendance at court by the debtor may be treated as contempt of court and result in his imprisonment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w16.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 From April 2003, not for profit organisations offering legal services as part of the community legal service will be issued with a replacement contract by the Legal Services Commission (LSC). The new 'Not for Profit Contract', in common with the contract for solicitors, contains no guarantee of annual remuneration increases. However, my Department and the LSC are monitoring actively the provider base in all areas of law and will consider as

<P>

<a name="30327w16.html_para7">My right hon. and Learned Friend the Lord Chancellor and I recognise that people working in not for profit organisations are dedicated, efficient and caring individuals, providing important services to the socially excluded and disadvantaged, for rates of remuneration that will inevitably fall short of what they can earn in the private sector. However, our scope for improving the position with regard to remuneration is limited by resource constraints.

 At the start of the main move to direct payment in April 2003, there will be some 13 million benefit recipients paid by order book or giro.
<P>

<a name="30327w17.html_para0">At present 85 per cent. of our customers (including 90 per cent. of pensioners) already have access to a suitable account for direct payment and we expect the majority of our customers will choose to use that account.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w17.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Some customers who are paid direct into an account can also collect their benefit in cash at post offices through network banking arrangements at the post office. There is no data available on the number of benefit claims collected in this way. Girocheques can be cashed either over-the-counter at a post office or through a bank account. For the purposes of this answer, girocheques have been treated as an over-the-counter method of payment.

<sup>(14)</sup> The Pension Schemes Registry (PSR) is not designed or intended to provide a comprehensive or continuous statistical record of the status of schemes. The PSR registers schemes for tracing purposes and collects the levy from pension schemes, including those in the process of winding up. New scheme data is being reported to the PSR on a continuous basis. Therefore, the figures are subject to continuous revision. When a scheme has changed status, the previous status of the scheme is not recorded on the registry. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify OPRA of any status change so the data for the current year are particularly provisional. The data in the table do not include any schemes that may have changed their benefit type (money purchase, salary related or hybrid) but not their status code (open, closed, frozen, winding up, or wound up).<P>

<P>

<sup>(15)</sup> A closed scheme is a registerable scheme to which no new members may be admitted, but existing members can continue to make contributions and accrue benefits.<P>

<P>

<sup>(16)</sup> A frozen scheme is a registerable scheme under which benefits continue to be payable to existing members, and to which no new members may be admitted, no further contributions can be made by existing members, and no further benefits accrue to existing members (although benefits which have already accrued to them may be increased).<P>

<P>

<sup>(17)</sup> A winding up scheme is one which has notified OPRA that it has commenced winding up procedures.<P>

<P>

<sup>(18)</sup> A wound up scheme is one which has notified OPRA that it has completed winding up procedures.<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

The data in the table relate to private sector occupational pension schemes. In addition to data on occupational schemes, the registry also collects data on personal pension and public sector schemes. These schemes are not included in the table.<P>

<P>
<a name="30327w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The English House Condition Survey of 2001 shows that between 1996 and 2001 the number of households with at least one person over age 60 in fuel poverty, after taking all income into account, fell by over 50 per cent. The figures fell from just over two million to around 940,000.
<P>

<a name="30327w18.html_para0">This change is due to a number of measures introduced by this Government including changes in income, lower fuel prices and installation of energy efficiency measures.
<P>

<a name="30327w18.html_para1">The minimum income guarantee, introduced in April 1999, has boosted the income of the poorest pensioners and means that, from April, no single pensioner will need to live on less than &#163;102.10 a week (&#163;155.80 for couples). In 2003&#150;04, the Government will spend an extra &#163;7.5 billion a year on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes &#163;3.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners&#151;almost six times more than an earnings-link in the basic state pension since 1998 would have given them.
<P>

<a name="30327w18.html_para2">Most people aged 60 and over are entitled to a winter fuel payment of up to &#163;200. More than 11 million people aged 60 and over receive payments, totalling &#163;1.7 billion.
<P>

<a name="30327w18.html_para3">Overall, prices for all fuel and light for domestic customers fell by 13 per cent in real terms between 1997 and 2002.

 Information on the number of schoolchildren with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not collected centrally. From January 2004 the Department will be collecting data on SEN by type of need. This will include children with Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties, but will not contain a separate category for ADHD.
<P>

<a name="30327w18.html_para13">All schools and local education authorities have statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN, which includes those pupils with behavioural difficulties and ADHD. The SEN Code of Practice provides practical advice to schools and Early Years settings to help them carry out these duties. It recommends a graduated, school-based approach to meet the needs of children with SEN, and specifically offers a range of interventions for schools to use in supporting pupils who are hyperactive and lack concentration.
<P>

<a name="30327w18.html_para14">Children with ADHD normally receive help and support from within the spectrum of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) which range from primary care, including school and social services interventions, to specialist and inpatient services. Child and adolescent psychiatrists, and increasingly paediatricians, provide specialist diagnostic and treatment services for children with ADHD, supported by members of multidisciplinary teams. The joint DfES/DH good practice guidance for schools "Supporting Pupils With Medical Needs" gives advice to schools and LEAs on supporting pupils with medical needs, including those who may be prescribed medication for ADHD.

 Since I became Secretary of State on 24 October 2002, I have visited Scotland once on 14 February 2003. While I was there I conducted a range of visits including a meeting with Cathy Jamieson MSP, Minister for Education and Young People, a tour of the Student Loan Company's offices and a meeting with Colin Ward, Chief Executive of the Student Loan Company.

<P><I>27 Mar 2003 : Column 381W</I><P>
valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2001. As part of changes made to the long term funding arrangements of the scheme, the values of both the assets and liabilities were determined at that date to be &#163;142,880 million. As a result, the scheme has no deficit. A copy of the Government Actuary's report is available from the Library.

 We do not hold complete information in the form requested. However, in 1997&#150;98 the Government introduced New Deal for Schools (NDS) as a new additional programme targeted specifically at addressing the backlog of urgent repairs in school buildings that had built up after eighteen years of under-funding under the previous administration. This programme was bid based and was in addition to other capital funds made available to Portsmouth local

education authority. NDS ran through four phases from 1997- 98 to 2000- 01. Table A shows the schools in the Portsmouth area which benefited from investment through the original NDS programme. From 2001- 02 most capital funding available for building improvements in schools has been allocated to local authorities and schools by needs-related formulae. It is for local authorities and schools to decide how their capital allocations are invested and prioritised between projects, in line with their local asset management planning. Also, from 2000&#150;01 every school has received direct capital allocations to address their highest priorities. In addition, each year authorities have been able to bid for Basic Need funding for the provision of new pupil places. Table B shows all capital funding for school buildings allocated to Portsmouth LEA (including voluntary aided schools) since 1998&#150;99. Looking to the future, I announced on 26 February proposals for a new approach to capital investment in a paper, "Building schools for the future". This will be a programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that secondary education in every part of England has facilities of 21st century standard within 10 to 15 years from 2005&#150;06, subject to future public spending decisions. We will also aim to provide substantial investment in primary school buildings.

<P>

 Public dividend capital will continue to be available in the future as a source of financing for national health service trusts and NHS foundation trusts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Greg Knight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received and what research he has evaluated on the impact on human health caused by the presence of acrylamide in certain cooked foods; what action he proposes to take as a result; and if he will make a statement.  [104562]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has received several representations following reports that acrylamide had been found to occur in a wide range of home-cooked and processed foods.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para0">Research on the formation of acrylamide in certain cooked foods and its possible impact on human health is still at an early stage. Acrylamide has been shown to cause various types of cancer in laboratory animals. It is considered to have the potential to cause cancer in humans, but a link has not been proven.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para1">The FSA considers that exposure to acrylamide should be kept as low as reasonably practicable and is commissioning research and surveillance that aims to assist in minimising the amounts occurring in food. Meanwhile, FSA advice remains that, on the basis of current evidence, people should eat a balanced diet, including a variety of fruit and vegetables and that as part of a balanced diet people should moderate their consumption of fried and fatty foods.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many NHS patients are receiving anti-TNFa treatment.  [103272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We do not hold centrally information about drugs prescribed and dispensed in hospitals, which is where the anti-TNFa drugs, Etanercept (Enbrel) and Infliximab (Remicade) are prescribed.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was asked to appraise the use of anti-TNFa drugs and issued its guidance on 22 March 2002. NICE has 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2003 : Column 388W</I><P>
recommended the use of Etanercept for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Etanercept and Infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para3">We have issued directions obliging health authorities and primary care trusts to provide appropriate funding for recommended treatments. This is in line with our manifesto commitment to ensure that patients receive drugs and treatments recommended by NICE on the national health service if deemed appropriate by their clinicians.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what procedures there are to monitor whether a terminally ill patient has received an assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia from <i>(a)</i> a member of the health care team and <i>(b)</i> a family member.  [104536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Euthanasia, the intentional taking of life at the patient's request or for a merciful motive, is unlawful in the United Kingdom. Similarly, assisted suicide is unlawful under the Suicide Act 1961. The investigation of alleged criminal offences and the decision whether to prefer charges in a particular case are operational matters for the chief officer of the police force concerned.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what procedures are in place for NHS Direct staff dealing with patients' inquiries relating to assisted suicides or voluntary euthanasia.  [104537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There are no standard procedures in place for NHS Direct staff dealing with inquiries relating to assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, as they are both unlawful in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many NHS-funded training programmes provide guidance on dealing with patient requests for a medically assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia.  [104560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Euthanasia, the intentional taking of life at the patient's request or for a merciful motive, is unlawful in the United Kingdom. Similarly, assisted suicide is unlawful under the Suicide Act 1961. The Department of Health is not aware of any national health service funded training programmes to deal with such requests.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the budgeted expenditure per head of population on health was in each strategic health authority area for <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02, <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03 and <i>(c)</i> 2003&#150;04.  [103765]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Strategic health authorities were established on 1 October 2002. The Department does not make revenue allocations directly to strategic health authorities.

<a name="30327w21.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Civil Contingency Planning</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his Department's <i>(a)</i> responsibilities and <i>(b)</i> assets with regard to civil contingency planning; what funds are committed; what action he is taking within his Department to improve such planning; and what action he is taking in collaboration with other Departments.  [102622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health's responsibilities for civil contingency planning are to work with the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat, other Government Departments and the national health service to ensure there are adequate arrangements to protect the health of the population and continue to provide NHS care.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para4">The Department of Health has been working with the NHS, strengthening arrangements to ensure we are as prepared as we can be in responding to a range of possible new threats, such as the deliberate release of chemical or biological agents or incidents associated with radiological or nuclear hazards.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para5">The recent National Audit Office report, "Facing the Challenge: NHS Emergency Planning in England", made a series of recommendations for improving emergency planning arrangements which are being taken forward. The Department of Health is working with the NHS to ensure all its organisations have reviewed and enhanced their state of readiness.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para6">The Department of Health has issued specific guidance to the NHS on the public health response to the deliberate release of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incidents, mass decontamination and mass casualties. A new protective suit has been issued for use by ambulance and accident and emergency staff working on the decontamination of patients. Significant funds have been made available to pay for these suits as well as the stockpiling of drugs and vaccines which could be used in the event of an attack on the United Kingdom. Further work is being done to look at what additional resources may be needed to maintain vigilance and improve preparedness.
<P>

<a name="30327w21.html_para7">The Department of Health has made available, through the emergency planning section of its website at www.doh.gov.uk/epcu, a comprehensive package of guidance for clinicians on dealing with the consequences of deliberate release. This information is regularly updated. The website contains a link to the Public Health Laboratory Service website at www.phls.org.uk, which provides additional clinical and other information.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs), in common with all national health service organisations, are required to demonstrate their "preparedness" for major incidents. PCTs, together with partner organisations, need to be able to draw upon well-defined, effective procedures and processes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what <i>(a)</i> action the Food Standards Agency is taking and <i>(b)</i> advice the Food Standards Agency have issued to counter the threat from terrorism to food safety in the United Kingdom.  [104908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w23.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25 March 2003]:</i> The Food Standards Agency (FSA) will take the lead role in managing the consequences of any actual incident of food contamination. The FSA already undertakes such work in respect of the several hundred relatively minor accidental and adventitious environmental food contamination incidents that occur each year, ensuring that contaminated food does not reach the public. The FSA regularly exercises its response to major incidents.
<P>

<a name="30327w23.html_para0">With the agreement of other Departments, the FSA reminded the food industry in November 2002 of the importance of maintaining vigilance against potential malicious attacks on the food supply. This was a general reminder rather than a response to any new intelligence suggesting a specific threat. This advice remains current.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is on which foodstuffs of non-animal origin should be tested on <i>(a)</i> all occasions and <i>(b)</i> a 'spot-check' basis under the proposals in the EU document of 10 February (EC Draft 6090/03).  [102848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w23.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency has lead responsibility for this proposal on official feed and food controls. I am advised by the FSA that the negotiations on it are due to begin shortly. The FSA will press for provisions that ensure the frequency of testing of foods of non-animal origin is risk-based and proportionate. In effect, this would mean spot checks and random analytical testing for 'low risk' products but increased checks and analytical testing, up to a level of 100 per cent. (depending on the nature of the risk), for foods included in the list of 'high risk' products that is envisaged under the proposal. The commodities included in this list and the required level of testing will not be static over time but rather will vary depending on identification of new risks and the control of others. Currently, the European Commission publish decisions regarding those commodities from specified countries that should be subject to 100 per cent. documentary and analytical checks. This includes aflatoxins in various nuts and dried fruits from certain countries. It is understood that such products would be included in the 'high risk' list under the proposal and would require 100 per cent. testing.

<P>
<a name="30327w23.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears  </B> 
<i>[holding answers 25 March 2003]:</i> Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be scanned.
<P>

<a name="30327w23.html_para4">Where an MRI scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two months wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which will be in place for all cancers by the end of 2005.
<P>

<a name="30327w23.html_para5">To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners.

trusts leading and agreeing how targets will be met within the three year planning framework. The national health service is being asked to concentrate its planning activity against the priorities in the Priorities and Planning Framework 2003&#150;06. This has resulted in the majority of current planning requirements being replaced by a single three year local delivery plan. There will be routine monitoring of national standards to ensure they continue to be met. Inspection programmes for both health and social care are well established which generate independent performance ratings. These are aligned to the priorities and planning framework and based on the primary care trust's performance against a number of key targets and a wider set of balanced scorecard indicators.

<a name="30327w24.html_para10">In September 2001 primary care trusts' performance was assessed for the first time against a range of suitable indicators but they were not given an overall star rating.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance and technology appraisals are prepared by independent expert members of its advisory committees and guideline development groups who are drawn from the national health service, patients and carers, and the academic world. Although these committees and groups seek the views of organisations representing health care professionals, patients and carers, manufacturers and government, their advice is independent of any vested interests.
<P>

<P>
<a name="30327w25.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Since it was authorised in 1990 the safety of paroxetine (Seroxat) has been closely monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Government's independent expert advisory committee, Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM has considered the question of suicidal behaviour in association with Seroxat on a number of ccasions and carefully assessed any new data. The CSM has advised that there is insufficient evidence to confirm a causal relationship between Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicidal behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para3">The CSM has advised that it is general clinical experience that patients taking any antidepressant may develop an increase in suicidal behaviour in the first few weeks of treatment. Product information for prescribes and patients for all SSRIs has been amended to include warnings that suicidal behaviour may increase in the early stages of treatment as with any antidepressant. In September 2000, an article was published in the drug safety bulletin, Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance, which is distributed to all doctors and pharmacists.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para4">An expert working group on the safety of SSRIs has been set up by the CSM to review the current available evidence relating to the safety of SSRIs, including paroxetine, particularly in relation to suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The expert working group will report its findings to CSM in due course.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para5">Since 1997, the MCA has received a range of representations, including parliamentary questions, letters from hon. and right hon. Members, patients and health care professionals expressing concerns about the safety of paroxetine (Seroxat), none of which have been from coroners.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para6">The MCA and the CSM receive reports of suspected adverse drug reactions to medicinal products via the yellow card scheme. Since marketing authorisation was granted in 1990, the MCA and CSM have received 8,702 such reports for paroxetine (Seroxat). One of these reports has been received from a coroner. In addition the MCA has written to the coroner for Brecon to obtain further details of a recently publicised case.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what categories of <i>(a)</i> health service employees, <i>(b)</i> civil servants, <i>(c)</i> Ministers, <i>(d)</i> servicemen and women and <i>(e)</i> other public service personnel (i) have been and (ii) are intended to be vaccinated against smallpox.

<P>
<a name="30327w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The written ministerial statement of 2 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 63WS, set out our intention to vaccinate around 350 health care staff across the United Kingdom. This programme has commenced. Those vaccinated will form regional smallpox response groups around the UK. They will consist of infectious disease physicians and paediatricians, public health physicians, microbiologists/virologists, acute care and communicable disease control nurses and occupational health staff.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para7">Service personnel to be vaccinated against smallpox will include those nuclear, biological and chemical specialists and specialist medical personnel who would form the spearhead of our armed forces' defensive response, including vaccination teams, in the event of a confirmed, suspected or threatened release of smallpox. Vaccination of these service personnel has commenced. Where immunisation is not routine, it is not our practice to go into precise details of counter-biological warfare immunisation programmes for the armed forces as this information could be of use to an aggressor.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para8">Currently, there is no evidence of a specific threat of the deliberate release of smallpox as a biological agent. There is no plan to vaccinate civil servants, Ministers or other public service personnel.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para9">As set out in the "Interim Guidelines for Smallpox Response and management in the Post Eradication Era", available on the Department's website www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm, if the threat level increases, we shall step up vaccination of more emergency, laboratory and other essential personnel. This includes all those likely to be directly involved in the assessment, management and investigation of smallpox cases as well as emergency and other key essential staff, including police and fire service personnel. Officials are consulting with other Government Departments about which other key essential workers should be vaccinated at different threat levels.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the definition of usual residency for those who have been placed by one social services department in the area of another department; and what funding implications there are if the former decides <i>(a)</i> to reduce and <i>(b)</i> to remove funding.  [100539]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30327w25.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There is no definition of "ordinarily resident" in the National Assistance Act 1948 and it should be given its ordinary and natural meaning subject to any interpretation by the courts. The concept of ordinary residence involves questions of fact and degree. In determining ordinary residence, factors such as time, intention and continuity&#151;each of which may be given different weight according to the context&#151;have to be taken into account. Local Authority Circular LAC(93)7 on "Ordinary Residence" gives full details.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para11">Generally, if a council places an individual in a care home in the area of another council under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948, the first council has continuing responsibility to fund and care manage the individual's stay in residential care. This is because the individual is regarded as remaining ordinarily resident in the "placing" authority's area, by virtue of section 24(5) of the 1948 Act.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para12">Residents who are placed in care homes by councils are financially supported when their income and assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of care home fees. The amounts that supported residents should contribute to these fees are governed by the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992. Once the resident's contribution has been determined, the council should make its contribution sufficient to meet the costs of care as set out in the resident's care plan and contract between the council and care home. If the care home's fees are higher than the council would normally expect to pay, third parties such as relatives may make up the difference.
<P>

<a name="30327w25.html_para13">Whether a supported resident is placed by a council in its own area, or the area of another council, the placing council would be acting outside its statutory duties if it attempted to reduce its contribution to care costs in situations where supported residents' income and assets and assessed needs remain unchanged. When the resident's financial situation or needs change, a council may legitimately reduce or remove its funding. For example, a supported resident who acquires extra income and assets during his stay in residential care may lose entitlement to council funding. A council may reduce its funding when, following a re-assessment of needs, it agrees with a resident that some aspect of care within the care home may be reduced. In such circumstances, the resident should continue to pay their assessed contribution and the council makes up the difference with regard to the lower care home fee.
