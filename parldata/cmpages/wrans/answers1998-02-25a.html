 No central guidance exists for either furniture standards or prices and there is no specific advice on the purchase of beds.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Government are issuing today their consultation paper setting out proposals for giving people greater access to the open countryside in England and Wales. Copies have been placed in the Library of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para0">The consultation paper reflects the Government's determination to fulfil their manifesto commitment to give greater freedom for people to explore our open countryside.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para1">Our proposals have the potential to benefit the millions of people who already enjoy, or who will in future enjoy, walking in the countryside. Current arrangements for access to areas of open countryside, rather than rights of way, have not been used extensively and are not generally well understood. In many cases, people are understandably confused about the areas of land on which they are entitled to walk or the circumstances under which they may do so. We need to secure more and better quality access with greater clarity and certainty for all concerned.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para2">Our proposals are about giving greater access to open countryside, not to developed or cultivated land. Our first priority is to increase access to mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land. In total, these cover no more than 12 per cent. of the land in England and Wales. We also wish to see more access to other areas of open country such as woodland, cliffs and foreshore, and will introduce measures to encourage this if necessary.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para3">In developing our proposals, we intend to ensure that a proper balance is struck between the rights and responsibilities of those who will benefit from greater access and of others affected by it. We are determined that those who will enjoy greater access should be responsible: the countryside and people's property and livelihoods must continue to be respected and properly protected. The Government recognise the need for sensible restrictions on the freedom of access to take account of the genuine needs of owners and other users of the land. Similarly, we recognise that access to some areas or at some times needs to be limited for reasons of health or safety, nature conservation, or archaeology.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para4">We are prepared to consider all options, including voluntary arrangements, for achieving our objective of substantially greater access, and will consider carefully all responses to the consultation paper before reaching a decision on the best way forward. Assessment of the costs and benefits of different options will be a key part of our consideration. Costs to Government (central and local), to owners and occupiers, and to the relevant statutory agencies will certainly be taken into account in considering how best to proceed. We do not expect that management of greater access will have major financial implications as, in most places, no changes will need to be made to accommodate walkers. We shall be making an environmental assessment and regulatory appraisal of our proposals, as necessary.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para5">We are keen to ensure that the consultation process provides a genuine opportunity for all those interested to put forward their own ideas and views. We shall be allowing three months for consultation, ending on Friday 5 June. As well as considering written responses to the paper, we plan to hold meetings with organisations representing walkers, farmers and other owners and 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1998 : Column: 221</I><P>
occupiers, and others with an interest. We shall also be drawing on the experience and expertise of the relevant statutory agencies and local authorities in firming up our ideas, and may need to consult further on some issues before announcing our conclusions, which we hope to do later this year.

<P>
<a name="80225w01.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 26 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>15,</i> what was the make, model and cost of the new official car acquired since 1 May; and for which Minister it has been acquired.  [27702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> The car is a Jaguar 4.0i LWB, which has been provided for the use of the Deputy Prime Minister. The capital cost of the car was met by the Cabinet Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take steps to reduce the amount of fats from catering outlets entering the sewerage system.  [30468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under the Water Industry Act 1991, the water companies are responsible for management of their sewerage systems and discharges to them. It is an offence under the Act to interfere with the free flow of a sewer.
<P>

<a name="80225w01.html_para6">I understand that water companies undertake a number of initiatives to control the amount of fats entering the sewerage system. These range from educational initiatives to prevent careless disposal of fats, encouragement of installation of fat traps to prevent entry into the sewerage system and development of technology to break down fats once they have entered the system.

 The depth of contamination on the site to be occupied by the Millennium Dome varied widely. The majority of contamination was contained within the surface layer, which varied between 2 and 4 metres in depth. In isolated instances the contamination extended up to a maximum of 14 metres. The treatment applied to each part of the site depended on the type and depth of the contamination. No part of the site was treated to a depth of less than 2 metres and in places the treatment extended to 14 metres.

<a name="80225w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 A large proportion of the Millennium Dome site has been chemically contaminated to varying degrees as a result of former industrial activities, principally the generation of coal, gas and associated by-products. By-products include the manufacture of sulphuric acid and ammonium sulphate fertiliser in a dedicated chemical works as well as the production of coal tar and a range of organic chemicals such as benzene and naphtha in a separate tar works.

 There is at present no contaminated land register.

 My Department ceased to accept further applications for Derelict Land Grant (DLG) in March 1994 when the programme ended.

 The Government are committed to grant payments worth &#163;1.8 billion NPV overall. If London and Continental Railways are unable to fulfil their obligations under the CTRL Development Agreement awarded to them by the previous Government, Eurostar (UK) Limited, its assets and liabilities, would revert to the Government.

 Reasons of commercial confidentiality prevent copies of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Development Agreement with London & Continental Railways (LCR) being placed in the Library.

 No such assessment has been made. The Channel Tunnel Rail Link is primarily intended to provide for passenger services, though it would also facilitate rail freight both directly and through freeing capacity on existing lines.

 The Standing Committee has so far met seven times, the latest meeting being in November 1995. A report by the Standing Committee on the effectiveness of the Code of Practice was published in July 1993. Annual reports by the water companies on their conservation, access and recreation activities are considered by the Standing Committee, which includes representatives from the main conservation and sports bodies. There are no plans at present to change this process. The Code of Practice is currently being reviewed, with a view to producing a revised Code later this year.

This represents a challenge for both creditors and debtors. Creditors should ensure that relief mechanisms are sufficiently flexible to deal with all cases. Debtors should show a commitment to sound economic policies, with a focus on productive expenditures such as basic healthcare and primary education, and demonstrate transparent and accountable decisionmaking. Debt relief is necessary to allow such countries to continue to implement such policies, which are aimed at increasing the pro-poor economic growth that is needed for lasting poverty reduction.

 <i>[holding answer 23 February 1998]:</i> The Government are fully committed to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative that was launched by the IMF and World Bank in September 1996. In his speech to Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Mauritius last year, the Chancellor called on the international community to commit itself to dealing with the problem of unsustainable debt burdens faced by the world's poorest countries once and for all. He urged creditors and debtors to undertake concrete action in order to ensure that at least three-quarters of the twenty countries, initially identified by the World Bank and IMF as probably needing debt relief under HIPC initiative, have had decisions on the size and timing of their relief by the year 2000. The Government propose to continue their efforts to ensure that this target is met.

 Articles 29 to 42 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, will replace Title VI of the TEU by new provisions concerned with developing common action between member states in the fields of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and preventing and combating racism and xenophobia. The new provisions introduce changes, in particular as regards the scope of the common action to be developed, the legal instruments to be used and the role of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice. There are also provisions enabling member states to establish closer co-operation between themselves, and on the future role of Europol. Subject to Parliamentary approval of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, and ratification by all member states of the new Treaty, the Government will seek to participate fully in all aspects of work under the new provisions, consistently with United Kingdom national interests.
<P>

<a name="80225w05.html_para3">The Treaty of Amsterdam was published as a Command paper (Cm 3780) in October 1997.

<a name="80225w05.html_para5">Articles 29-42 will not impact directly on police operations and the judicial system in the United Kingdom. They call for closer co-operation between the competent authorities of the member states in these fields, but any further practical arrangements will only be put into place following further negotiation and agreement. For example, the provision in Article 32 for the regulation of the operation of competent authorities in the territory of another member state will require a separate, detailed discussion and agreement by the Council. Information regarding these negotiations shall of course be made available to Parliament in line with scrutiny arrangements for work undertaken in the Third Pillar.

 <i>[holding answer 23 February 1998]:</i> There is no current investigation into the conduct of the South East Regional Crime Squad (SERCS) as a whole. Individual SERCS officers may become the subject of complaint, allegation or report. In such circumstances, the Co-ordinator of SERCS would normally invite an appropriate police force within his region to conduct an investigation.

<a name="80225w06.html_para0">I have been advised that there are currently seven such inquiries being undertaken by the Metropolitan Police. These investigations are at different stages and their completion dates will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. Three of the seven were instigated by SERCS management. The inquiry which has received most publicity was set in motion after surveillance logs were found to be missing during a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. SERCS was inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary during February 1997.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what research her Department has undertaken to investigate the means whereby <i>(a)</i> workers, <i>(b)</i> consumers and <i>(c)</i> others affected by the activities of foreign investors can bring disputes to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment dispute settlement mechanism.  [30590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Investors, like others, are subject to the national laws of the countries in which they operate. Therefore, there is no need for workers, consumers or others to use the Multilateral Agreements on Investment's (MAI) dispute settlement mechanism for disputes against investors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Department has consulted British business extensively throughout the negotiations on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). The competitiveness of UK companies will not be adversely affected by the Agreement. Foreign companies, like domestic ones, will continue to be covered by UK and EU competition law. The MAI will place obligations on states, not on companies; the question of exemption for foreign companies does not arise.

 The UK's draft list of exceptions has already been placed in the Library. It includes exceptions for broadcasting, fishing, marine and air transport, and financial services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce the award of 35 licences to 27 companies for onshore oil and gas exploration covering 120 blocks. Licensees will now need to obtain any necessary consents from local planning authorities, who will take account of any environmental concerns, and to agree access terms with landowners before carrying out on-site activities under these licences.
<P>

<a name="80225w09.html_para0">The round has attracted particularly strong interest from companies targeting the UK's gas reserves, including conventional natural gas and coal-related methane resources.
<P>

<a name="80225w09.html_para1">I would like to see coal bed methane reserves--gas trapped in coal seams--exploited wherever possible, particularly in coal which is unlikely to be mined but also from potentially recoverable coal where extracting the gas beforehand can enhance mine safety. I recently consented to the UK's second coal bed methane development, at Arns Farm in Fife, and I hope to see further projects brought forward for approval in coming years.
<P>

<a name="80225w09.html_para2">I am concerned that interest by companies in coal bed methane has been hindered by the present licensing system which was designed to manage conventional oil and gas exploration. So I have asked my officials to open consultation later this year on proposals for a new form of onshore licence designed to encourage the exploitation of both conventional coal bed methane and other forms of coal-related gas.
<P>

<a name="80225w09.html_para3">There would be environmental benefits from using the considerable quantities of gas from abandoned coalworkings which escapes to atmosphere, where it is seventeen times more potent as a greenhouse gas than the exhaust from burning it would be. Although unsuitable as feed to the national gas grid, this gas can be burned locally to generate electricity or to power industrial processes and is a resource which the Government are keen to see used.
<P>

<a name="80225w09.html_para4">All exploitation of coal-related gases is carried out in consultation with the Coal Authority and the operators of active mines in the vicinity. The safety of properties on the surface is also taken fully into account.

 The Warhead Hydrodynamics Division was set up in 1955. In 1995 it was subsumed into a new Directorate and retitled the Hydrodynamics Department. Its purpose is to undertake research into high explosive detonation processes and the response of materials when subjected to explosive shocks. It produces a variety of working documents, but only one series of technical papers which is known as "Hydrodynamics Department Technical report, R Series".

 As part of the implementation of NATO's new command structure GIBMED, the NATO headquarters based in Gibraltar is due to close. Gibraltar will be located in Regional Command South. In the new structure, NATO command of Gibraltar will be the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces South Europe, based at Naples. The Commanders of Allied Naval and Air Forces South, also based at Naples, will exercise region-wide air and maritime responsibilities on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief. Regional Commanders will also be able to propose the establishment of areas of responsibility for particular Joint Sub-Regional Commanders in specific contingencies or missions. Such proposals will require the approval of all NATO nations. NATO's Joint Sub-Regional Commands, once implemented, would have no permanently established boundaries or areas of responsibility.

<a name="80225w13.html_para2">There was a 90 per cent. decrease in notifications of TB in the UK between 1948 and 1987. There was a small increase in cases after the late 1980s, but figures have

now levelled out and the latest full year provisional figure is 6,430. This success is against a worldwide resurgence in TB in recent years which is having a small but important impact on trends in the UK. Data suggest that certain parts of the community--older white people who were exposed to TB when they were younger, homeless people, HIV infected individuals and certain ethnic minority populations--are at an increased risk from TB. Many of these groups are harder to reach, and inner city areas--London, in particular--do see a disproportionate amount of TB due to a concentration of risk groups in those areas.
<P>

<a name="80225w13.html_para3">No resources have been specifically identified for TB detection and treatment. Health authorities are given general allocations for hospital and community health services to commission health care services for their resident population. All 100 health authorities in England will receive a real terms cash boost in 1998-99. The 1.9 per cent. real terms increase in general allocations is the largest for five years. It is for individual health authorities to decide the level and type of services purchased, taking account of local circumstances and national policies and priorities. TB is an important public health concern and purchasers of health care need to ensure that adequate resources are provided to meet this in their contracting for TB services. While the details of local TB policies depend on local factors, local policies must be considered within a national context (especially for Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunisation) and national policy should prevail. The importance of this has been brought to the attention of health authorities. The Department continues to purchase the BCG vaccine and make it available free to the National Health Service. The Department is also funding the Public Health Laboratory Service, with around &#163;400,000, to conduct a detailed Survey of Notifications of TB in 1998. The survey will provide important information on trends and incidence.

<a name="80225w13.html_para4">The UK has an excellent record of TB control and we are determined that this should remain the case. The BCG immunisation programme, treatment of identified cases and screening of their close contacts, screening and treatment for immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of TB and active surveillance of TB continue.

 We recognise the vital importance of tackling discrimination against mentally ill patients. The Department's impact strategy aims to increase knowledge and understanding about mental health among the general public, thereby promoting a positive image of mental health and combating stigma. We are adopting a variety of approaches to take forward the strategy including collaboration with the voluntary sector; the targeting of resources on key "at risk groups" such as young men; influencing the media; and expanding the Health Education Authority's World Mental Health Day campaign. This year, we are spending more than &#163;1.4 million nationally on public health information and mental health promotion. Mental health services have a responsibility to proceed with sensitivity and adopt an informative, open approach in handling their plans for community developments in order to convince people that they have nothing to fear.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the estimated total cost of acquiring the Holyrood site for the Scottish Parliament.  [30854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The estimated total cost of acquiring and preparing the Holyrood site is approximately &#163;4 million.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his officials first became aware of the asbestos contamination on the Holyrood site.  [30851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 Neither the Department nor the Secretary of State are aware of any asbestos contamination at the Holyrood site.
<P>

<a name="80225w14.html_para3">Contamination would arise only if the asbestos was mishandled. The Secretary of State became aware on 16 February 1998 that Scottish and Newcastle plc had undertaken to remove asbestos from their building in Holyrood before transferring the property. Officials had been informed on 16 January 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The estimated cost of clearing the Holyrood site is about &#163;500,000. This estimate has not changed since the purchase price was agreed.

<a name="80225w14.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the latest estimated total cost of establishing the Scottish Parliament, separately identifying provision for temporary accommodation for the Parliament pending completion of the Holyrood Parliament building.  [30855]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The estimated construction costs of the building at Holyrood will be around &#163;55 million, including site acquisition costs and demolition costs, but not including fees and VAT. The actual costs will depend on the final design, the level of fees negotiated and the price of construction, which will be determined by competitive tender.
<P>

<a name="80225w14.html_para4">A number of venues are being considered for the interim accommodation. Until a venue is chosen it is not possible to say what the estimated costs will be.

<a name="80225w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The UK is opposed to any definition of 'yoghurt' which might unreasonably restrict product innovation and diversity, without providing any clear benefit to our consumers. The UK believes that the definition of composite yoghurt products, containing ingredients such as fruit or nuts, is unnecessary in the draft Codex text.

<P>
<a name="80225w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department has received no formal representations from consumers, or the International Dairy Federation, concerning the draft codex text covering yoghurt. However, the Provision Trade Federation, who represent some retailers, and the Dairy Industry Federation have written to express their opposition to the draft text as it restricts the use of the term yoghurt to products which contain cultures of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii.subsp.

<a name="80225w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Officials had discussions with EU Member States, but not the USA, on the definition and labelling of yoghurt in 1996. Views vary from those who want the term yoghurt to be restricted to fermented milk products containing cultures of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii.subsp. bulgaricus</i> only, to those, such as the UK, who want a broader definition to reflect products currently sold legally in the Member State. Further discussions, both in Europe and worldwide, are scheduled for May this year.

 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> Some 80 sites were considered against selection criteria such as whether there was sufficient space. Seven sites were visited. These were in Exeter, Guildford, Huntingdon, Manchester (two sites), Sheffield and Workington.

<a name="80225w16.html_para2">Three sites were shortlisted. These sites were at Guildford (a MAFF site), Manchester (a vacant Government Office outside the MAFF Estate) and Workington (a British Steel site).

<a name="80225w16.html_para3">At the time of the decision to locate in Workington, it was clear that running costs for that site were likely to be lower than elsewhere. Subsequently, a cost benefit analysis was carried out which took account of the site specific costs, the set up costs and the running costs of each site, as estimated at that stage, over a fifteen year period. The analysis did not include the common costs of the whole Cattle Tracing System project, for instance procuring specialist equipment.

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> Information in the form precisely requested is not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, a comprehensive analysis of sickness absence in the Civil Service is produced annually by OHSA Ltd. and copies of their 1995 and 1996 reports have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80225w17.html_para0">The 1995 report indicated an average of 9.1 days sickness absence per staff year for this Department (including some smaller Agencies) but in 1996 the average was reduced to 7.8 days. Information in respect of 1997 is not yet available.
<P>

<a name="80225w17.html_para1">Responsibility for attendance matters within the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, the Central Science Laboratory Agency, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, the Meat Hygiene Service Agency and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Agency has been delegated to the Agency Chief Executives and I have asked them to reply to the hon. Member direct.

<a name="80225w18.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Southworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when he will publish his consultation paper on lifelong learning; and if he will make a statement.  [31351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I am today laying before Parliament copies of a Green Paper on lifelong learning, <i>The Learning Age</i> (Cm 3790). I am also placing in the Library copies of the Government's response to the report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education under the chairmanship of Sir. Ron Dearing and my response to the report of the Further Education Funding Council's Widening Participation Committee under the chairmanship of Helena Kennedy QC, now Baroness Kennedy, all of which are being published today.
<P>

<a name="80225w18.html_para2">Lifelong learning is at the heart of the Government's education and training policies. Higher education and further education play key roles in lifelong learning. <i>The Learning Age</i> sets out the Government's vision for a learning society in which learning is easily available, valued and enjoyed--an everyday feature of life for all people of all ages--and we have skilled and qualified workforce that will be essential in the 21st century.
<P>

<a name="80225w18.html_para3"><i>The Learning Age</i> aims to engage employers, trades unions, individual men and women and those who deliver and plan education and training to work with us to develop a "learning society". I hope our proposals and the questions we pose will stimulate a large response.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the proportion of gross domestic product spent on education in each Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country in the last financial year.  [30839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w18.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Information on the proportion of gross domestic product spent on education in each OECD country is contained in table B1.t of 'Education at a Glance OECD Indicators 1997' published in December 1997, a copy of which is held in the House of Commons Library. The latest year for which comparative information is available is 1994. Comparisons across countries are complicated by the need for consistency of definition: the OECD figures for the UK may differ from the main UK measure as published in "Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses".

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked me to reply to your question on the discretion open to local Jobcentre managers in respect of those in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance wishing to participate in local Jobclubs. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Employment Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The eligibility requirement for entry to a Jobclub is that a person must be continuously unemployed for at least 26 weeks. This means they must have been signing at an Employment Service Jobcentre claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and/or National Insurance Credits, unless they have been in receipt of Income Support or Incapacity Benefit which do not require them to be signing on (for example, if they are sick or a lone parent). However, exceptions to the six months unemployment requirement are made for people with disabilities, ex-prisoners, former members of HM forces, people with literacy or numeracy difficulties, people needing basic training in English (and Welsh/Gaelic), labour market returnees and those who have become unemployed as a result of large scale redundancies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I understand there are no plans currently to review these eligibility conditions.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what responsibilities the Careers Service has under the New Deal for 18 to 24 year olds.  [29208]<P>

<P>
<a name="80225w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> Responsibility in the delivery of the New Deal rests locally with New Deal partners. We have encouraged Careers Services to play a full role, either as individual companies or as part of consortiums, notably in the provision of careers advice during the Gateway.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what representations he has received on his proposals in the Green Paper, Excellence for all Children, Meeting Special Education Needs to end the current consent arrangements in respect of placing individual children with a statement at non-approved independent schools.

 The Employment Service and New Deal partners have made initial contact, including sending promotional material and setting meetings, with over 70,000 employers. The Large Organisations Unit has held meetings with 164 businesses. So far, some 7,000 firms have expressed interest in taking part in new deal and over 1,100 have signed Employer Agreements, with more to follow suit shortly. The disaggregation by size of employer is not yet available, but the majority of agreements are at local level, with small and medium businesses.

<a name="80225w20.html_para0">Our New Deal programmes are being delivered through local partnerships. For planning purposes, the Employment Service has provided its partners in each local unit of delivery with an indicative assumption for the numbers of young people who might join the New Deal for 18-24 year olds in 1998-99. Those planning assumptions are based on current unemployment levels. They are not forecasts of the actual numbers who will participate in the New Deal for 18-24 year olds. They do, however, enable the Employment Service and its partners in each local area to conduct better informed negotiations with organisations bidding to deliver New Deal programmes and services, and help to ensure that adequate resources are in place locally to meet potential demand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Employers may provide New Deal participants with in-house training in cases where it has been agreed with the Employment Service that the training is of a standard which meets the quality requirements of the New Deal. In these cases, the in-house training received by the New Deal participant will be mapped against NVQ frameworks for the appropriate occupational sector and, based on this, the young person would be registered for an NVQ.

 This issue has been raised by some environmental and voluntary groups. The Chief Executive of the Employment Service has approved a system whereby voluntary organisations can seek an advance payment of part of their first year's anticipated contract value. Employment Service regional contract managers received guidance about start-up funding at the beginning of the month; the guidance was designed to provide a reasonable amount of advance funding which can be expected to be repaid during the first year of operation. In so doing, we have tried to balance the risks to Employment Service with ensuring that small voluntary organisations are not prohibited from participating in New Deal.

 Her Majesty's Government seek to prevent the transfer of technology related to weapons of mass destruction in the higher education sector through the operation of the Voluntary Vetting Scheme which is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This scheme applies to post-graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from certain countries, including Iraq, and covers those scientific disciplines relevant to weapons of mass destruction technologies or the missiles to deliver them. Under the scheme, universities and higher education colleges are asked to refer potential students from specified countries who are seeking to undertake research in particular disciplines to the Government. The Government provide advice on individual applicants and the universities and colleges then make the final admission decisions. This is a voluntary arrangement and there is currently no law in place to oblige higher education institutions to contact Government over admission matters.

 <i>[holding answer 23 February 1998]:</i> On 12 February, the Government announced allocations of &#163;21.32 million under the Standards Fund to 65 LEAs to reduce infant class sizes in 1998-99. Those allocations were made on the basis of applications put forward by LEAs and according to criteria published in September last year and sent to all authorities. Further significant funding will be available in future years. Although Gloucestershire has not been allocated specific funding to reduce class sizes in 1998-99, I would urge the authority to continue to develop its plans for reducing class sizes to ensure that it attracts funding in the future. By the end of this Parliament, all infants in Gloucestershire, as in the country generally, will be in classes of 30 or fewer.

<P>
<a name="80225w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The key objective of our review of pensions is to ensure that pensioners should have an adequate income in retirement; that they should share fairly in rising national prosperity; and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable.
<P>

<a name="80225w22.html_para2">For most people, security in retirement will come from a combination of the basic State Pension and a second pension. However, for people receiving only the basic pension it is likely that they would be entitled to Income Support on top of their basic pension.

 Our aim is to provide people with the clear and concise information they need to help them make informed decisions about pensions and to raise awareness of the importance of pensions planning throughout their working lives.
<P>

<a name="80225w22.html_para3">The Department has reviewed the information and publicity material that it produces for consumers with the objective of making sure that it sets out clearly how pensions work, and what questions they should ask before deciding what is the best option for them. We will be issuing new publicity material in the Spring.

<a name="80225w22.html_para4">Developing greater financial literacy and economic awareness is crucial to give everybody, men and women, young and old, the confidence to make informed choices and take control of their financial future.

<P>
<a name="80225w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 One of the major challenges facing the Government's Pensions Review is to narrow the pensions gap between women and men to give women more security in retirement. Many pensions are simply not flexible enough to cope with women's working patterns and the fact that they are more likely to have caring responsibilities. We are therefore considering many of the obstacles that currently prevent women from developing good pension rights.
<P>

<a name="80225w22.html_para5">We are committed to introducing pension sharing for divorcing couples from April 2000, and our proposals for Stakeholder Pensions and a Citizenship Pension will be of particular benefit to women. Stakeholder Pension schemes are a central part of our plans to modernise the pensions system and the Government recognise that there is a need to develop new, value-for-money second pension schemes that do not penalise those who change jobs frequently, or who take breaks from work, particularly women.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) if she will make it her policy to reform current bankruptcy law to allow the self-employed and employees who are not members of an occupational pension scheme to receive the same exemption upon becoming insolvent as is presently enjoyed by persons who, as employees, were members of an occupational pension scheme; and if she will make a statement; [31025]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on the implications of the decision in the Landau case for the differing treatment upon insolvency of <i>(a)</i> the self-employed, <i>(b)</i> employees who are not members of an occupational pension fund and <i>(c)</i> employees with occupational pensions, in the event of their becoming insolvent.  [31026]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The issue of pensions and bankruptcy is currently being considered as part of our wide ranging Pensions Review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w22.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what proposals she has to make allowance for the consequence of divorce in pension provision.  [31064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80225w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Courts are required to take into account pensions in reaching a divorce settlement. Provision exists to allow a woman who divorces before State pension age to substitute her former husband's National Insurance contributions record for her own record for specified periods, and to receive a Basic Retirement Pension on this basis when she reaches State pension age. The earmarking provisions introduced by the Pensions Act 1995 enable courts to require a private pension scheme to make payments (once the pension is in payment) directly to a former spouse on behalf of the scheme member.
<P>

<a name="80225w22.html_para6">Our Manifesto committed us to introducing pension sharing for divorcing couples and we aim to do so from April 2000. We are working through the detailed issues and implementation arrangements with representatives of the pensions industry, family lawyers and others, and plan to publish draft legislation for consultation during this Parliamentary session. Pension sharing will allow fairer settlements on assets on divorce and is an important step towards meeting the Government's objective of closing the pensions gap between women and men in retirement.

 It is important that pensioners need to know as soon as possible how much they will receive, as well as how and when it will be paid. The simplest and most cost-effective way is to let them know that a payment will be made is through publicity. The publicity will enable them to plan with confidence and turn up their heating if there is a spell of cold weather.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DLA is a complex benefit. It is not compensation for disability. Entitlement is determined by the effect of a disability on a person's need for help with personal care and getting around and even awards made "for life" are conditional on continuing to meet the eligibility criteria for that award.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary question relating to Court action taken in Child Support Agency cases with debt.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Your question mentions "cases being dealt with by litigation teams". Since the introduction of the Agency's Debt Management System this structure has been replaced by Debt Management teams and Enforcement teams. Where a case has debt or an arrangement for paying off debt breaks down, the first stage is progressed by the Business Unit Debt Management Teams. They contact the absent parent, or the absent parent's employer where a deduction from earnings order is in place, to try to establish a voluntary arrangement with the absent parent for paying the debt or resolve difficulties an employer may be experiencing with a deduction from earnings order.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are taking a far more robust approach to non compliant absent parents. In the case of employed absent parents we are imposing a greater number of deduction from earnings orders and are doing so more quickly.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A case will only be referred on to the Enforcement Team for litigation where it has not been possible to come to a voluntary arrangement with the absent parent, or the employer refuses to implement a deduction from earnings order. In this financial year to the end of January, 2,216 new cases were sent to Enforcement 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>25 Feb 1998 : Column: 305</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>teams. The Enforcement teams apply to the Magistrates Courts in England and Wales and Sheriffs courts in Scotland for liability orders where, despite all efforts, the absent parent refuses to come to a voluntary arrangement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So far this financial year, the Agency has applied for 1,536 liability orders in England and Wales and 207 in Scotland. In the main these cases referred to self employed absent parents, but there are some employed absent parents included within the figures with a high level of protected earnings for whom a deduction from earnings order is not appropriate. The Agency has been looking at the way that we deal with self employed cases to improve the rate of compliance; difficulties with this client group are not unique to the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Once a liability order has been granted by Magistrates or Sheriffs there are a variety of methods which can be used to enforce the order. In England and Wales, the Agency decides how to apply liability. This can be by garnishee order, charging order (against capital assets), levying distress with bailiffs or registering the debt as a County Court Judgement on the register. If unsuccessful, the case can be referred back to the Magistrates Court for committal proceedings which may ultimately lead to imprisonment.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1998 : Column: 306</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In Scotland cases are referred to the Sheriff's Court to decide on liability. If the Sheriff grants a liability order, official Scottish Office solicitors decide on the action to be taken to enforce the order. This can be done by poinding (warrant of sale), arrestments of bank account, a bill of inhibition (forced sale of property or land), decrees; or, if all else fails, cases are referred to the Procurator Fiscal to decide on prosecution.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency looks to use any and all enforcement methods legally available to us, but experiences the same difficulties (as was the case under the previous court based maintenance system) other litigants experience in enforcing a civil debt. So far in 1997-98 we have been successful in registering debt by County Court Judgement in 368 cases. Where all other action has failed, the Agency has pursued cases for prosecution; between November 1997 and January 1998 a total of 6 suspended custodial sentences were imposed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout the Debt Management and Enforcement process, absent parents are given every opportunity to make a voluntary arrangement to pay off their child maintenance debt. The majority do agree to make an arrangement and only in a very small minority of cases is legal action actually taken.</FONT></UL>
