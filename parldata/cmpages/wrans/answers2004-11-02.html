This approach is supported fully by the National Level Crossing Safety Group, which includes HSE, the police, the Rail Safety and Standards Board, Network Rail, railway operators, local authorities, highway authorities and organisations representing level crossing users. Network Rail has produced a level crossing policy and strategy that sets out to reduce the risks associated with level crossings through a variety of methods including a programme of risk assessment to identify reasonably practicable risk reduction measures. Network Rail&#039;s overriding principle is to ensure that no new permanent crossings are constructed, other than in exceptional circumstances and it seeks to close existing crossings where this is feasible.

In September 2003, DfES and DfT jointly launched the Travelling to School initiative with the aim of creating conditions which will enable more children to walk, cycle or travel by public transport in safety.

 The governing body of the school that the pupil attends is responsible for ensuring the pupil receives suitable education during the fixed period exclusion. This responsibility is usually discharged by setting work for the pupil to do at home. For longer fixed period exclusions, although schools still have a responsibility to provide education, we expect them to work with the local education authority, where possible, to do this and to plan for the pupil&#039;s reintegration into school at the end of the exclusion.

The national programme for information technology is incorporating stringent security controls and safeguards that will mean patients have more control over who has access to their information than is possible with existing systems.

<a name="stpa_39">Patients will have the right to specify that detailed information recorded at the point of contact with the NHS should not be available to other NHS organisations via the summary record held on their NHS care record. They will also have the right to define some information as especially sensitive and only accessible under terms of explicit consent.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority (HA) accounts and primary care trust (PCT) summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant HAs and the commissioner costs of the PCT.<br>

2. The total NHS expenditure cannot be identified by health authority area, because the majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or PCT summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The majority of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by HAs or PCTs.<br>

3. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, based on strategic health authority (SHA) areas, have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare.<br>

<i>[holding answer 21 October 2004]:</i> Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been available to the courts since 1 April 1999.

 The information is not available in the form requested. However, of the 855 antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) notified to the Home Office as being issued between 1 June 2000 and 31 December 2002, 305 were breached, within the same period, on one or more than one occasion. As a result, 152 persons were given a custodial sentence, 93 received community sentences, and 60 received other sentences of which four received a conditional discharge. The sentence counted is the severest across all breaches.

 The Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign ran for eight consecutive weekends over the summer period. It was the first step in sending a strong signal that the irresponsible sale and consumption of alcohol will not be tolerated. The campaign provided a clear picture of where we need to focus our efforts and it made significant progress in supporting police and partners in making our streets safe. Data were captured in order to monitor the use of tactics and to establish a baseline for further work. The effectiveness of the campaign was also measured by feedback from participating areas and has been compiled in a &#039;Lessons Learned&#039; document that will be published shortly.

 As my predecessor explained in his answer of 13 January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 696W, it is not possible to provide unrecovered claims information on a debtor by debtor basis. To do so could prejudice negotiations ECGD is having or will have about recovering debt. However, I am able to supply the information you have requested on a market basis.

 EU quota restrictions under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) against WTO member countries will be removed on 1 January 2005. Given the large number of different factors involved in commercial buying decisions&#151;such as price, quality, transport costs, proximity to market and speed of reaction to fashion changes, etc.&#151;it is difficult to give an accurate forecast of the likely rise in imports. However a recent WTO study estimated that imports into the EU market will rise from 52.5 per cent. to 53.0 per cent. for textiles and from 48.5 per cent. to 51.0 per cent. for clothing. The higher increase for clothing imports reflects the fact that the clothing sector has more quota restrictions than the textiles sector.

<i>[holding answer 26 October 2004]:</i> Members of the Volunteer Reserve, Regular Reserve and Sponsored Reserve have and continue to be mobilised to support operations in Iraq. A number of trades, the majority from the Army, are required. All reservists must meet the required medical standards and be suitably trained for the role they are to perform before they are accepted into full time service. Generally a tour in theatre will last seven months (some nine months in total if pre-deployment training and post operational leave is included), although some specialist reservists may serve a shorter term. Once mobilised they remain reservists, but have the same status and are treated exactly the same way as their regular counterparts. The amount of time a reservist can be mobilised is limited by statute. Therefore, whether an individual reservist may serve another tour in Iraq (or on any other operation) will be dependent on the length of their initial deployment.

There will also be sponsorship opportunities available, and the Scottish Executive is working with Perth and Kinross Council to identify these for local companies. In the short term, the other main commercial opportunities are likely to lie with spending by attendees (4,000 or more delegates and media will use hotels, restaurants and transport) and suppliers to the main contractors. Longer term economic benefits to Perth and Kinross are expected to arise from the increased international profile of the area and of Scotland in general.

 The Representation of the People Act 1983 provides that, in addition to British citizens, qualifying Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Republic of Ireland are entitled to vote in UK parliamentary elections. The position of Commonwealth and Irish citizens in the United Kingdom reflects the traditionally close ties that exist between our countries, and other non-UK nationals are not entitled to vote in UK parliamentary elections. The franchise for referendums is determined on an individual basis and is set out explicitly in the relevant dedicated enabling legislation.

The principal reasons for these revisions relate to the scale of the project, which has meant that each stage has taken longer than normally anticipated.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what estimate he has made of the number of disposable nappies used in the Province in the last year for which figures are available; and what the resultant cost of disposal was.  [193704]</p>








<p><a name="st_250"><a name="41102w26.html_spnew4"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 There are no figures collected relating specifically to the use of disposable nappies annually in Northern Ireland. However, the Northern Ireland Household Waste Characterisation Study (2000) by NI2000 stated that disposable nappies made around 4 per cent. of the waste of the average Northern Ireland household. In 2003, a total of 901,136 tonnes of household waste was produced in Northern Ireland which, applying the 4 per cent. factor, implies a total of some 36,000 tonnes of disposable nappy waste. At 200 grammes per disposable nappy, this amounts to approximately 180 million such nappies per year.
