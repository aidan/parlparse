To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the design of her Department's logo.  [78346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The logo, and the visual identity of which it is a part, was introduced in February 1999 following the Department's name change. The identity was designed to improve the consistency and distinctiveness of DCMS communications and to achieve better value for money in design and print purchasing.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para5">The introduction of the identity resulted in year on year savings of over 25 per cent. on the procurement of the Department's printed stationery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many non-devolved posts were advertised in the press in each year from June 1999; and what percentage of them were advertised in the Scottish press.  [76850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 24 October 2002]:</i> The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has not advertised any post in the press since June 1999 which deals exclusively with departmental responsibilities which extend to Scotland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on her assessment of the impact of the Communications Bill on the independent radio industry.  [76428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Our general approach to the radio industry, and to communications markets in general, is deregulatory. Format controls and ownership restrictions will both be relaxed. However, we recognise the importance of maintaining the distinctive local basis of commercial radio. We therefore propose to retain key local ownership rules, and to give Ofcom a duty to protect and promote local content.

<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_wqn6"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> charities and <i>(b)</i> sports clubs on rate relief; and if she will make a statement.  [78410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government announced in April that community amateur sports clubs will now be eligible to apply for charitable status, under which they would receive mandatory 80 per cent. rate relief and other tax advantages. The recent Finance Act 2002 also included a package of tax reliefs available from the Inland Revenue that will benefit such clubs.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para6">In July, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met several of sport's governing bodies, as representatives of community amateur sports clubs, to discuss these measures and other issues. In September, my Department arranged a seminar which was designed to give sport's governing bodies the chance to discuss the tax and charitable status options available to amateur clubs. Since the Budget, my Department has met representatives from Sport England, the Central Council of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association on a number of occasions to discuss these issues. I will continue to work with these organisations and with governing bodies to agree the best way forward for helping these clubs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_wqn7"><B> Paul Farrelly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proposals she has for the reform of Government support for tourism; and if she will make a statement.  [79130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w01.html_spnew7"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 I announced new arrangements for support for tourism in the English regions on 13 May. Since then I have agreed with the Regional Development Agencies that they are ready to implement this, corporate planning guidance has been issued about how the RDAs should plan for the new tourism responsibilities and further planning work is in hand.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para7">I also proposed changes for the English Tourism Council and to improve the co-ordination of marketing activity for England. I have decided to achieve this by a radical reform of the existing support structures, and there are two aspects to the announcement that I make today.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para8">The first will result in a strengthening of the marketing of Britain in overseas tourism markets. This will be of direct benefit not only to England but also to Scotland and Wales. I had already asked the new Chief Executive of the British Tourism Authority, Tom Wright, to carry out a fundamental review of strategy and structure of support for British tourism overseas. The emerging conclusions point to increasing effectiveness with a structure based on dedicated new hubs for each major market and less emphasis on central services. More resource will be concentrated where it is needed most, that is in the overseas markets served by 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2002 : Column 888W</I><P>
the BTA. I will also improve the accountability arrangements for BTA in co-operation with other GB Tourism Ministers.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para9">The second aspect of my announcement concerns the need for better co-ordination of the marketing of England as a tourism destination in the GB market. We wish to combine some of the day-to-day operations of the English Tourism Council with the BTA. These two organisations have served tourism well, but combining their resources and strengths allows us to develop more quickly the marketing team for England we need. This will also enable us to put more resource into direct support for tourism and less into overheads. We will take this opportunity to develop more effective partnerships with private industry investors to support tourism. We will pursue our commitment to the sustainable development of tourism, particularly in rural areas, some of which are still in recovery following the foot-and-mouth outbreak.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para10">Accordingly, I am today asking Tom Wright to broaden the BTA reform programme and to draw up detailed plans for a further unit to lead and co-ordinate the marketing of England, promoting destinations to customers within our own country. Funding for this activity, and other activities of the relaunched national organisation in support of English tourism, will be accounted for and reported to Parliament separately from action in overseas markets on behalf of all three parts of Britain.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para11">In England, I see a major leadership role for both the private sector and the Regional Development Agencies in developing a coherent marketing agenda across the industry. The new marketing team for English tourism within the relaunched national organisation will be guided by a slimmed down English Tourist Board, drawing on support from the private sector and regional and local government. The broad remit for its work has been drawn up by a group drawn from the private and public sectors, which was fully endorsed at a meeting I chaired of a wide range of tourism bodies at the beginning of August. The team will have responsibility for working closely with RDA and other partners to make the most of the public funds available to support marketing and promotion.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para12">I have asked Alan Britten and David Quarmby, the chairs of the existing boards, to work closely together to ensure the new arrangements are implemented quickly and effectively. Staff from both organisations will be treated on an equal and fair basis, taking full account of their own skills and experience and the requirements of the new arrangements. I have asked them to make recommendations about the new name when they have made further progress on the reforms.
<P>

<a name="21031w01.html_para13">I am also announcing additional funding for tourism services in England. #10 million over three years is available, but will only be released on the effective implementation of reform, on industry rising to the challenge by coming together with matching funds, and the delivery of increased productivity we are looking for in the tourism industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence <i>(1)</i> if the anthrax innoculation programme offered to <i>(a)</i> Navy, <i>(b)</i> Army, <i>(c)</i> Air Force and <i>(d)</i> other Ministry of Defence personnel is compulsory;  [78101]
<P>
<UL><i>(2)</i> what proportion of <i>(a)</i> Navy, <i>(b)</i> Army, <i>(c)</i> Air Force and <i>(d)</i> other Ministry of Defence personnel (i) are fully vaccinated and (ii) have commenced a vaccination programme against anthrax; and if he will make a statement.  [78100]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In keeping with long-standing medical practice, immunisation against anthrax for the Armed Forces and other Ministry of Defence personnel is voluntary and on the basis of informed consent.
<P>

<a name="21031w02.html_para0">Up to and including September 2002, the period for which most recent figures are available, approximately 46 per cent. of personnel offered immunisation against anthrax had accepted. Broken down by the categories requested this equates to <i>(a)</i> Royal Navy 28 per cent. (<i>b)</i> Army 78 per cent. <i>(c)</i> Royal Air Force 46 per cent. and <i>(d)</i> other Ministry of Defence Personnel 61 per cent. Thus far, immunisation against anthrax has been targeted at a small number of personnel in the most readily deployable units. As approximate proportions of their total strengths, excluding reserves, this equates to <i>(a)</i> Royal Navy, 0.7 per cent. <i>(b)</i> Army 0.4 per cent.; <i>(c)</i> Royal Air Force, 4.5 per cent.; and <i>(d)</i> other Ministry of Defence personnel 0.2 per cent.. Information concerning individuals' current anthrax immunisation status is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21031w02.html_para1">Earlier this year we announced a decision to expand the programme so that all service personnel, including reserves, and those essential civilians who are likely to deploy on operations are routinely offered immunisation against anthrax. We plan to expand the programme gradually over the next few years, beginning with those units that are held at the highest readiness. I refer the hon. Member to the answer my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence gave on 13 June 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> <i>columns 1343&#150;44</i> to the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt).

<P>

<a name="21031w02.html_para6">Exports of arms and other goods controlled for strategic reasons are subject to export licences issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. All individual licence applications are assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Exporting Licensing Criteria. Criterion 1A of the consolidated criteria makes clear that the Government will not issue a licence if approval would be inconsistent with the UK's international obligations and its commitments to enforce UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes, as well as national embargoes observed by the UK.
<P>

<a name="21031w02.html_para7">The Government focus their efforts on assessment of potential end-use at the export licensing stage. This includes checks made by our posts overseas where necessary. Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way of preventing arms from falling into the wrong hands. In addition the Government remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring of exports in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable. Our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on allegations of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment. We take these reports into account in our assessment.
<P>

<a name="21031w02.html_para8">Officials from across Whitehall co-operate to pursue possible breaches of sanctions in the UK and abroad. Breaches involving the sale of UK arms and components sold abroad are thoroughly investigated by the relevant authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government's policy, and the policy to which the EU collectively committed itself at the European Council of Nice in December 2000, is that NATO remains the basis for the collective defence of its members.

<a name="21031w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 All the countries which are candidates for accession to the EU have made offers of contributions, with a view to their participation in EU-led operations. These countries could already offer forces to an EU-led operation, if invited to take part. When a country joins the EU, it simply removes the need for a formal invitation for that country to take part in EU-led operations.

<a name="21031w02.html_para10">Procedurally, there is also a change. The offers from member states are recorded in the Helsinki Force Catalogue; those of accession candidates in a supplement to the catalogue. This catalogue identifies the pool of capabilities, meeting commonly-agreed

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the restrictions imposed by the Spanish Government on the movements of NATO military aircraft and warships in the vicinity of Gibraltar and in transit between Spain and Gibraltar; and what steps have recently been taken by the UK Government to have these restrictions lifted.  [77379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 NATO Standardised Agreement (STANAG) 1100, sets out the procedures for visits to NATO and non-NATO ports by naval ships of NATO nations. This Agreement contains a reservation, inserted by the Spanish Government, which prevents visits by NATO ships to or from Gibraltar directly to or from Spanish ports. Any request by military aircraft from NATO (or other) nations, which has Gibraltar as a departure or arrival airfield, to overfly or land in Spain is routinely denied by Spanish authorities. We understand that NATO has no plans specifically to discuss the restrictions imposed by Spain on NATO ships and aircraft. Discussions between the British and Spanish Government in the context of the Brussels Process aim to resolve all outstanding issues between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many <i>(a)</i> nurses, <i>(b)</i> GPs, <i>(c)</i> medical consultants and <i>(d)</i> other health care professionals working for the NHS are subject to military call-up as reservists in the event of military action.  [74650]<P>

<a name="21031w03.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Although the Ministry of Defence encourages reservists to declare their reserve status to civilian employers, there is no legal requirement to do so unless specified in individual contracts of employment. Reservists are not usually required to provide details of any civilian employment to the Ministry of Defence, until such time as they are called-out. Therefore, no records are available for the number of nurses, GPs, medical consultants and other healthcare professionals that are working in the NHS who are subject to military call-out as reservists.
<P>

<a name="21031w03.html_para0">However, it is possible to provide the number of volunteer reserve nurses, GPs, consultants and other healthcare professionals in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) as at September 2002, and this is outlined in the following table:

 It is vital that service personnel deployed on military operations receive the appropriate level of medical support. The use of reservists for operations is fully in line with the tenets of the Strategic Defence Review, namely having more capable, usable, integrated and relevant reserve forces that support their regular counterparts on operations overseas. The need to call-out reservists is kept under review as part of contingency planning. If reservists are called out, we would select the most suitably qualified individuals for mobilisation by taking into account their relevant skills, fitness and training, and their professional and domestic circumstances. The Ministry of Defence would work closely with the NHS Trusts concerned to minimise disruption as far as possible.

 The EU is committed to the fullest possible involvement of the non-EU European Allies and the EU accession partners in the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). A supplement to the Helsinki Force Catalogue has been drawn up, detailing offers of contributions made by these states with a view to their participation in EU-led operations. The Nice European Council agreed at substantial set of provisions governing consultation with these countries and arrangements for their participation in EU-led operations. As a result, they now attend regular ESDP meetings at a number of levels. In the event of a crisis, this dialogue and consultation will be intensified. In particular, it was confirmed at Nice that Xupon a decision by the Council to launch an operation, the non-EU European NATO members will participate if they so wish in the event of an operation requiring recourse to

 Under the Data Protection Act 1998, personnel are able to request access to their service medical records by making a subject access request. For access to primary health care records, the request should be made to the appropriate Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force Service Records Office. For access to secondary health care records, the request may be sent to either the appropriate service records office, the hospital they were treated at, or to the Ministry of Defence Central Health Records Library.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2002]:</i> In the light of support for change expressed in response to public consultation and to a series of focus groups across the Armed Forces, consideration is being given to introducing pension benefits for unmarried partners as part of our review of the Armed Forces pension scheme. The Ministry of Defence will be seeking to finalise approvals on the new scheme around the turn of the year. Those who decide to remain in the current pension scheme would not benefit from any change. Under a similar review of current compensation arrangements, consideration is being given to extending benefits for attributable deaths to unmarried partners as part of a new scheme.

 Guidance on all aspects of development in the green belt, including new educational facilities, is set out in planning policy guidance note (PPG) 2, green belts. Designated metropolitan open land has the same status as green belt, and the planning policies set out in PPG2 will also apply to such land. New educational facilities in the green belt will be subject to the same controls as other development in the green belt and proposals will need to demonstrate that very special circumstances exist, which

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21031w05.html_para0">The Government do take the issue of fireworks seriously. On 14 October 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 890W, my hon. Friend the Minister for Consumer Affairs announced a package of measures which the Government are introducing to address the problems that fireworks can pose to humans, to the environment and to wildlife.
<P>

<a name="21031w05.html_para1">In terms of air pollution, a burning firework may produce particulate matter, organic compounds (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans), and a variety of metal fumes and aerosols, depending on its contents. The effects of bonfire night celebrations can certainly be detected in local air quality, but is very dependent on local atmospheric conditions at the time, and the most significant source of emissions is likely to be bonfires rather than fireworks.
<P>

<a name="21031w05.html_para2">In relation to wildlife, there is little research evidence on the immediate effects of bonfire night on wildlife. Fires and loud noises can have a disturbing effect on animals of any kind, but bonfire night celebrations are short-lived and relatively localised in nature.

 In my Parliamentary Statement of 18 July on sustainable communities I announced the Government's intentions for tackling the housing shortage in London and the South East. The Statement explained that the Government expects the housing numbers already agreed in regional planning guidance for the South East to be delivered, working within the presumption of making better use of land by improving design, increasing densities and using brownfield sites to the full. In the Statement, I announced I would intervene in planning applications for housing that involve a density of less than 30 dwellings per hectare net. 1 am publishing today the Town and Country Planning (Residential Density) (London and South East England) Direction 2002 which gives effect to this announcement. From 2 December local planning authorities in London and the South East will have to consult me before giving planning permission for low density housing developments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) (as amended) grants a general planning permission for licensed telecommunications code system operators to install specified telecommunications apparatus without the need to apply for planning permission to the local authority, subject to certain conditions and limitations.
<P>

<a name="21031w05.html_para9">The installation of an antenna on a building, where the antenna does not exceed the height of the building by 4 metres or more, would normally be regarded as permitted development and would not therefore require an application for planning permission or statutory public consultation.
<P>

<a name="21031w05.html_para10">All mobile phone antennas are registered with the radiocommunications agency. Information on the location and ownership of the antennas is available on the Agency's Site Finder database at www.sitefinder.radio.gov.uk The site is updated every three months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Mobile phone mast development close to residential properties, schools and hospitals is subject to the normal telecommunications planning arrangements in place throughout England, set out in Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO). Following publication of the Stewart report on mobile phones and health in May 2000, these arrangements were significantly strengthened and include improved requirements for consulting local people about mast proposals. The changes to the GPDO were underpinned by revised guidance, set out in planning policy guidance note 8, telecommunications, published in August 2001.
<P>

<a name="21031w05.html_para11">The Stewart report did not recommend that the erection of mobile phone masts should be restricted in such areas and we have no plans to introduce specific restrictions.

under each of the three main procedures: written representations, hearings and inquiries.

Copies are to be placed in the House Libraries. The changes implement the conclusions of a consultation exercise announced in August 2000.
<P>

<a name="21031w06.html_para1">The new arrangements, due to come into operation on 23 December 2002, implement the Government's commitment to improve the Planning Inspectorate's service to its customers, and to increase the efficiency of the enforcement appeals process by reducing both the cost and time taken. In introducing these changes, the Government recognise that it is vital to maintain a system which ensures that there is fair and open decision-making and that all parties have the opportunity to put their case, resulting in decisions that are legally sound and of the highest possible quality.
<P>

<a name="21031w06.html_para2">We have already set tough targets for the Planning Inspectorate to turn round enforcement appeals more quickly, and they have made a good deal of progress in improving their own performance. However, improving service to the benefit of all concerned is not just the responsibility of the Planning Inspectorate. All parties to the enforcement appeal process have a responsibility to meet the deadlines set and to co- operate with the inspectorate in agreeing dates offered for hearings and inquiries. The new procedures will put in place a regime of discipline for all parties involved in the process by setting clear timetables and deadlines for the various stages. In future, representations sent after due dates will normally be disregarded. We intend to monitor the impact of the changes, and will review their effectiveness to help us decide whether any further action is needed.

<P>
<a name="21031w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Government recently consulted on a code of practice and new statutory guidance which will ensure that all local authority service contracting takes proper account of the need for a high quality workforce in order to deliver high quality services. The consultation period ended on 6 September; we are currently considering the responses, with the aim of publishing the code and guidance shortly.

into the sale of dwellings by Westminster Council will be distributed; how much other local authorities will be charged to cover the costs; and if he will make a statement.  [76860]

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The auditor's investigation leading to his decision in 1996 that six individuals had caused a loss, through wilful misconduct, of some 31million to Westminster City Council, and to issue surcharge certificates against those individuals, cost approximately 3 million. Those costs were met by Westminster City Council.
<P>

<a name="21031w06.html_para5">The auditor's costs in the subsequent litigation (during which the Divisional Court set aside the auditor's surcharge in respect of four of the six individuals) leading to the decision of the House of Lords in December 2001, to uphold the surcharge against Dame Shirley Porter and David Weeks, were met by the Audit Commission. The total of the auditor's litigation costs to this point was around 4.5million. Westminster City Council is currently taking legal action to recover the amount of the surcharge and costs. The final costs of the investigation and litigation will not be known until the outcome of those proceedings.

 The Challenge Fund (which is not part of the Starter Home Initiative) has been set up within the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme in 2003&#150;04 to provide 4,000 homes for rent and low cost home ownership in south-east England. Bids for the Challenge Fund were invited from registered social landlords by 18 October. Dependent upon the bids received, a proportion of the homes will be for key public sector workers. We hope to announce the outcome of the bidding process in November.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The QCA reports to the Department each year on the incidence of malpractice and maladministration in national tests. Both the Department and QCA take all complaints about malpractice very seriously. QCA works closely with LEAs to investigate and monitor reported incidents. Even anonymous complaints are recorded and monitored. QCA works very closely with LEA inspectors who conduct thorough checks throughout the test process. Investigations of malpractice can involve a review of scripts from a school, interviews with teachers, talking to children and drawing on advice from experts in the field depending upon the nature of the allegations.
<P>

<a name="21031w07.html_para0">In 2002, 479 cases of alleged malpractice or maladministration across the three key stages were reported, leading to the annulment of the results of seven schools. Of these seven schools, four had the results in one subject annulled, two the results in two subjects and one the results in all three subjects.

<a name="21031w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department's remit to the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority includes the maintenance of a robust, reliable and credible examination and assessment system. As part of its role in overseeing the administration of statutory assessments, it is for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to approach the Department with proposals for minimising the incidence of malpractice and maladministration in the national tests.
<P>

 A new unit, led by Baroness Ashton, accountable for delivery to the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions, will administer a budget of #1.5 billion a year by 2005&#150;06. This represents a doubling of child care spending in real terms .

<a name="21031w08.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 14&#150;15 October. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Development also attended.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para1">The Council considered three proposals on food safety, covering the monitoring and control of zoonoses and genetically modified food and feed. Some clarification of positions emerged but it was not possible to reach agreement on this occasion. Further work will be undertaken by officials before Ministers reconsider these dossiers.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para2">The Council assessed the agricultural priorities flowing from the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and agreed conclusions accordingly.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para3">The Council continued its consideration of the mid-term review of the CAP with a discussion concentrating on the proposals concerning rural development, farm audits and three commodity sectors: nuts, rice and milk. My hon. Friend was supported by a number of other Member States in stressing the importance of a shift from production-linked support under the CAP to rural development programmes and he recalled the importance of a fair distribution of funds between Member States. On the commodity proposals, he opposed the introduction of new market measures for 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2002 : Column 916W</I><P>
nuts and supported the Commission's proposals on rice which would complement improved access to the EU market for third countries. On milk, he reiterated UK support for action that would eventually enable milk quotas to be phased out, and indicated that we would be prepared to consider favourably the possible acceleration of certain measures agreed in the Agenda 2000 package.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para4">Ministers also discussed the agricultural aspects of the WTO round negotiations. My hon Friend strongly supported Commissioner Fischler in emphasising the importance of CAP reform in general and decoupling in particular if the EU is to participate constructively in the round.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para5">Under other business, the Commission dealt with enquiries about olive oil promotion, aid to Greek cotton producers and negotiations with third countries over grain imports.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para6">On fisheries, the Council held a further debate on the Commission's proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, this time covering access to waters and resources, enforcement, and the Commission's proposals for Regional Advisory Councils: the presidency noted the various views expressed and reiterated that its aim is to conclude this dossier at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para7">The Council also debated the Commission's proposal for a cod and hake recovery plan based on limitations on days at sea, which was originally submitted to the Council in December 2001. There was a divergence of view on the desirability of a plan, with one significant group of member states, including the UK, supportive of the need to act, and another group markedly less so. For the UK, my hon. Friend recognised the seriousness of the state of the stocks and emphasised that all possible approaches, including days at sea, warranted consideration. He stressed also that it would be important, when determining what measures to adopt, to recognise the varying structures and circumstances of national fleets.
<P>

<a name="21031w08.html_para8">Commissioner Fischler gave a first presentation to the Council on his proposed action plan for Mediterranean fisheries. The Council will discuss this substantively at a later date.

 Defra has commissioned an extensive research project with Warwick University to study the transmission of bovine TB in restocked herds. The first part of this project investigates the incidence of bovine TB in herds in the badger culling trial areas which have been restocked since the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak, compared with herds in the same areas which were unaffected by FMD. The second part of the project is a case control study of restocked herds in all parts of Great Britain which become infected with bovine TB within two years of restocking.

In addition, the Community Development Foundation has been contracted to develop a network of rural community development workers, including the posts funded through the Agency, to build capacity among the network, to spread good practice and to promote training. Total spend in the year to date is #385,691. There was no expenditure in 2000/01 and 2001/02.

 The Government take very seriously the possibility of the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans as a result of the use of antibiotics in animals. They are satisfied that the four remaining antibiotic growth promoters are not related to any therapeutic antibiotics currently used in human or veterinary medicine but will keep the issue under review. Government policy will continue to be informed by the advice of their specialist committees.
<P>

<a name="21031w09.html_para5">There is currently a proposal before the European Commission for a regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition. The proposal aims to rationalise existing measures and introduce new controls. One of the effects will be to withdraw the use of antibiotic growth promoters by 31 December 2005. The intended withdrawal is based on a precautionary approach taking into account the impact that antimicrobial-resistant microbes can have on human health. This time scale includes a phasing out period, allowing time for the development of new husbandry methods and for industry to develop alternative products.

 In March 2001 during the foot and mouth outbreak, the proposal to ban swill feeding was the subject of a full public consultation and Regulatory Impact Assessment. We received over 350 responses to the consultation letter. Subsequently, Minister's have received 51 letters and 33 questions from MPs with regards to the ban on swill feeding. On 20 November 2001 I met with representatives of the Associated Swill Users.
<P>

<a name="21031w10.html_para6">Before the ban on swill-feeding, only a small proportion of catering waste from restaurants and other catering establishments was fed to pigs as swill. The vast majority was already disposed of to landfill or incineration. As the additional waste was going to landfill under the same conditions as before, no specific assessment was made as to the environmental and animal health impacts from the use of landfill to dispose of material that would otherwise have been fed to pigs.

Our objective has been, as described in the written answer by my noble Friend Baroness Symons of 5 December 2001 (<i>Official Report</i>, column WA 140), to continue with the policy of the SBAs remaining outside the EU, except where necessary to ensure that Cypriots who live and work in the SBAs do not benefit less from Cyprus's membership of the European Union than their compatriots in the Republic of Cyprus.

 I am pleased that talks are continuing between the two sides in Cyprus to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement. Our aim, and that of our EU partners and the US, is that such a settlement should be reached as soon as possible, so that a reunited island can be invited, at the Copenhagen European Council, to accede to the EU. I fully support the UN in its efforts to bridge the gaps between the two sides and urge the two leaders to do all they can to narrow their differences on the core issues.

 On 23 October 2002 my right hon.

 The Government believe that the key to improving public perception of crime and criminal justice is to continue to deliver reductions in crime and improvements in the way the criminal justice system operates.
<P>

<a name="21031w17.html_para0">The recently published White Paper, Justice for All, set out what needs to be done to modernise and improve the Criminal Justice System (CJS). The Home Office has been set targets for reducing crime and the fear of crime, improving the delivery of justice and increasing confidence in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="21031w17.html_para1">The Government are committed to improving the prevention and detection of crime, convicting the guilty and rehabilitating offenders so they do not offend again. 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2002 : Column 946W</I><P>
Reform will also ensure that justice is seen to serve and protect the interests of the community, and especially victims of crime.
<P>

<a name="21031w17.html_para2">The presentation of statistical information about crime has been made clearer and more comprehensive by combining publication of recorded crime statistics and information from the British Crime Survey. An objective in all our communication activity is to work with our partners to close the gap between the public perception that crime is rising against the reality of long term falls in crime. The media make an important contribution to public perceptions of crime, and efforts are being made to encourage responsible reporting of crime. We are also exploring alternative ways to provide accurate information about crime to the public.
<P>

<a name="21031w17.html_para3">The Government have made a commitment to increase the number of crimes that result in the perpetrator being brought to justice, an initiative called 'Narrowing the Justice Gap'. A co-ordinated strategy based on: tackling weaknesses in the criminal justice process; targeting types of offender, particularly persistent offenders; and targeting specific types of offence, aims to bring 1.2 million offences to justice by 2005&#150;06. Narrowing the justice gap not only reduces crime but also demonstrates that the criminal justice system is effective and responsive to the needs and concerns of victims and witnesses. The perception that criminals are Xgetting away with it" is hugely damaging to confidence levels. The Government have made improvement in this area their key aim for the CJS.
<P>

<a name="21031w17.html_para4">We also have a responsibility to promote confidence in the CJS and we are actively working on a programme of work in this area. This will be based on ensuring that the public are aware of the impact of reform and improvements in the delivery of justice.

 There have been regular discussions with the Governments of Uganda and Rwanda at both ministerial and official levels since the first UN panel report on exploitation of resources in the DRC was published. We have urged both Governments to work openly and constructively with the panel team and take seriously any allegations of exploitation. The final UN panel report was issued on 18 October. The Government of Uganda have already established a judicial enquiry into the allegations in a previous report, and this report is due on 15 November. The Government of Rwanda have rejected this report, as they did earlier ones, on the grounds that it is politically motivated and lacking in corroborative evidence. While we share many of the Government of Rwanda's criticisms of the report, we will continue to encourage the Government of Rwanda to take action to address the panel's accusations in an open manner. We believe the most important focus for future work is achieve peace and work to help the DRC and other Great Lakes countries put trade and the exploitation of mineral resources on to a well-regulated, transparent basis.

<a name="21031w17.html_para8">There have been some positive developments in the on-going peace process. The Regional Summit held in Dar-es-Salaam on 7 October welcomed the recent signing of a cease-fire agreement with the Transitional Government of Burundi by two of the remaining rebel forces not party to the Arusha Peace Accord, CNDD-FDD (Jean-Bosco) and PALIPEHUTU-FNL (Mugabarabona). The summit agreed an extension of 30 days to allow for the negotiation of similar cease-fire agreements with the two largest remaining rebel groups CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) and PALIPEHUTU-FNL (Rwasa).

 We have not undertaken an independent assessment of the humanitarian impact of the conflict in Cote d'lvoire. However we are monitoring the situation closely and are in regular contact with UN agencies in the field. The UN held an Emergency Regional Contingency Planning meeting in Accra from 17&#150;18 October to discuss the situation. We are awaiting their assessment of likely humanitarian needs.
<P>

<a name="21031w17.html_para10">We are working closely with the international community to bring about a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict. We consider that the best hope for peace lies in an African led solution and we are supporting the efforts of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) to mediate in the conflict. An ECOWAS mediation team has succeeded at establishing contact with the rebels and gaining commitment from both parties to a ceasefire and the start of negotiations. It is also proposed that an ECOWAS monitoring force be established to replace the French troops currently providing a buffer force between the two sides. The plans for this force are still under discussion. The UK has provided a military adviser to assist ECOWAS in their efforts.

Planned Government of Ghana interventions include slum upgrading and partnership programmes with non-government organisations that seek to safeguard children. The Government are also supporting civil society initiatives that protect children in Ghana and West Africa through the Civil Society Challenge Fund and Partnership Programme Agreements with Action Aid and Save the Children.

 President Museveni and President Kagame recommitted themselves and their Governments to the Understanding they signed last November in London on not interfering in each others' political and security affairs.

 The UK role in supporting the peace process is led jointly by the FCO and DFID. The UK Special Representative for Sudan, Alan Goulty, leads the UK observer delegation at the peace talks. He is supported by a joint FCO-DFID Sudan Unit. He and his team co-ordinate with the mediators and other observers at Machakos so that we can complement each other's efforts to deliver the best results. We carry out intensive consultations with the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in Khartoum and elsewhere. We ensure that UK policy and the peace process are fully understood by other interested Governments and co-ordinate with international partners, including the EU; our collective approach to implementing an eventual peace agreement.

 My Department has closely monitored developments regarding the investigation by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) into allegations of sexual exploitation of refugee women and girls by humanitarian aid workers and peacekeepers in refugee camps in West Africa. While the OIOS report found no involvement by UNHCR staff in acts of sexual

<P><I>31 Oct 2002 : Column 952W</I><P>
exploitation, from a total of 43 cases of possible sexual exploitation investigated by the OIOS team 10 cases were substantiated by evidence. This finding confirms that the issue of sexual exploitation is a significant one and that it is not just confined to West Africa&#151;but wherever refugees find themselves in similarly desperate and vulnerable circumstances.
<P>

<a name="21031w18.html_para4">The report crucially identifies several factors which contribute to sexual exploitation in refugee communities including aspects of refugee camp life, camp structure, camp security, food and services distribution, employment opportunities, profiles of camp workers, and the quality and quantities of food and other relief items distributed.
<P>

<a name="21031w18.html_para5">UNHCR has, in partnership with other concerned UN agencies, instituted a number of remedial measures and preventative actions to enhance the prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence. Specifically, in West Africa these include: increasing the accountability of humanitarian workers through the design of country-specific standards, applicable to all UN agencies and international and local NGOs; raising awareness of rights and entitlements in refugee communities through education and advocacy campaigns; increases in-field presence and improved training in sexual training and gender-based issues for UNHCR staff; improved reporting and monitoring procedures to speed up the identification of victims; building on existing programmes to better facilitate equal access and control of material resources as well as strengthening support to victims and groups at risk.
<P>

<a name="21031w18.html_para6">There exist additional measures which extend to the rest of Africa which, in turn, complement UNHCR's efforts on a global front, specifically the UNHCR Code of Conduct which aims to guide the behaviour and attitude of all UNHCR international and local staff in terms of the standards of conduct that are expected to be adhered to in the UN Charter and the Staff Regulation and Rules.

 The Government has set in place a number of measures designed to tackle the gender pay gap. We are leading by example, through our commitment to equal pay reviews in the Civil Service'; we are making it easier for women to get equal pay through changes in the Employment Act 2002; we are making it easier for employers to pay fairly through the work of the Fair Play Champions and the Castle Awards, and we are tackling the wider causes of the pay gap by helping mothers stay attached to the labour market, investing more resources than any other Government in childcare, improving the skill levels of those already in the labour market and helping employers make the most of their female workforce.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w20.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 At 31 March 2001, as set out in Public Bodies 2001, 34 per cent of appointments were held by women, this is 2 per cent. up since 1997.
<P>

<a name="21031w20.html_para0">We are determined to deliver on our aim that women should hold 45&#150;50 per cent. of public appointments made by the majority of Government departments by the end of 2005 and to address any constraints on diversity and equal representation.
<P>

<a name="21031w20.html_para1">Throughout 2002, we have led a national outreach campaign on women and public appointments, we have reached over 2000 women across the country and the vast majority have said they are now more likely to apply for public appointments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act received Royal Assent in February this year. It enables political parties, if they wish, to use positive measures to reduce inequality in the numbers of men and women elected.
<P>

<a name="21031w20.html_para2">We are also reforming government to make it a more attractive option to women, through improving the hours and working environments at all levels of government. However, it is for political parties themselves to decide arrangements for selecting parliamentary candidates. The Government has provided the framework and I am encouraged by the level of cross party support we received for the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act. It has galvanised debates within all parties and I very much hope that as a result we shall see more women being selected to stand.

 From next April, working women will benefit from the enhanced maternity pay and leave; and mothers, as well as fathers with children under the age of 6, or disabled children under 18, will have the right to apply for flexible working arrangements. Their employers will have a statutory duty to consider their requests seriously. The Government's Work-Life Balance Campaign also encourages all employers to follow best practice and offer flexible working arrangements to the benefit of all working women.
<P>

<a name="21031w20.html_para3">By 2003&#150;4, annual investment in the Government's National Childcare Strategy will have increased to over #200 million, a three-fold increase on the #66 million in 2000&#150;1, to benefit 1.6 million children in England.
<P>

<a name="21031w20.html_para4">Two new tax credits will be introduced next April, the Child Tax Credit, income related and paid directly to the main carer in the family; and the Working Tax Credit paid to low income working people with or without children. These will replace the existing tax credits, and simplify the system to ensure that people get financial support when they most need it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w20.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 As the Human Organs Inquiry observed, it was never anticipated that the records of post mortems would come under such scrutiny so many years after being written. They are not generally computerised and some of them have been lost over time. The inquiry report drew attention to the inadequacy of record-keeping systems, including difficulties in identifying and tracking organs once they were removed. An inquiry into the loss of these particular records is not considered necessary, and my Department has established a steering group to see that improvements in record keeping will be identified and implemented. The method of record keeping previously used within the Royal does not allow for information on the numbers of organs disposed of in clear-outs at the hospitals organ and tissue store to be collated.

The post office card account has no overdraft facilities and is limited to direct payment of benefits, pensions and tax credits by Government agencies only but this limited functionality will attract some individuals because of its simplicity. A second card will also be available for use by a nominee for those customers unable themselves to collect their money at the post office.

 Since January 2000, we have put in place a number of measures to reduce the burden of regulations on small businesses, including:
<P>

<a name="21031w21.html_para15">employers with four or fewer employees, exempted from requirement to provide access to stakeholder pensions and deduct pension contributions; increased the statutory audit threshold for companies from #350,000 to #1 million. This will relieve up to 150,000 small firms from the burden of a statutory audit, saving them up to #180 million a year; exempted small shops from the new EU unit pricing requirements; exempted employers with 20 or fewer employees from trade union recognition procedures in the Employment Relations Act. The Small Business Service has also: secured a 12-week period between regulations being agreed and implemented, allowing SMEs time to adapt to new regulations; secured the right to be consulted on all new regulations, so impact on SMEs is not disproportionate. Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) have to be

produced for regulations setting out costs and benefits;produced clear guidance on a number of complex regulations; published the Regulatory Reform Action Plan&#151;setting out over 250 proposals for better regulation and reform; regularly brought together groups of SMEs to express their views to officials, e.g. for Patrick Carter's review of payroll administration; set up an independent office to represent the views of small firms to the European institutions.
<P>

<a name="21031w21.html_para16">The Business Link Website is now attracting 80,000 users per month&#151;businesses can register to receive alerts about regulations automatically.Further to these measures: around 900,000 SMEs benefit from measures announced in Budget 2002, including 485,000 businesses whose corporation tax bill is cut or abolished, and 700,000 are benefiting from flat rate VAT scheme; regulatory challenge function within the DTI strengthened. A new team created to consider how we challenge existing and future legislation and to ensure all policy makers fully consider alternatives to regulation at the outset of the policy-making process. The UK is not over-regulated compared to other countries: A survey jointly published by Anderson and GrowthPlus benchmarks the business environment in nine EU countries, plus the USA. In this report the UK comes out in first place, for providing the most entrepreneur-friendly environment scoring consistently high in all measured categories.

<a name="21031w21.html_para17">The Economist Intelligence Unit (E.I.U.) studied the business environment, including regulation, in 60 countries. Results published in the Economist in August 2001, showed the Netherlands, the USA and Britain in the top three places. Recent OECD report into UK regulation concluded the environment is particularly supportive of market openness and competition. The report noted British entrepreneurs face better business and regulatory conditions than in most other OECD economies, it also highlighted support that SBS gives to SMEs and its role in fostering an enterprise culture in the UK.

 I share my hon. Friend's desire to see a very substantial increase in renewable energy generation to help us mitigate the impacts of climate change and to create a more diversified energy market. The aim when setting any target must be to ensure that it is realistic and achievable. Our current target for renewables is that, by 2010, 10 per cent. of electricity sales within Great Britain should come from sources eligible for the recently introduced Renewables Obligation. This will represent a substantial but attainable expansion over the course of the decade.

 The programme to restructure the urban post office network has only just started and is being taken forward in consultation with individual sub-postmasters, the community, Members of Parliament, other local stakeholders and Postwatch in accordance with the Code of Practice. There is no pre-determined closure list. Under the Code, Post Office Ltd. is required to consult Postwatch and other interested parties on its specific proposals for changes.
<P>

<a name="21031w23.html_para7">The objective of the urban network restructuring programme is to ensure that ad hoc closures which would leave gaps in the network are prevented. It is envisaged that the restructured urban network will provide modernised and improved facilities which meet customers' needs and expectations and are in the right location for the local community.

<P>
<a name="21031w23.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government have been and continue to be supportive of the aerospace industry in the UK. Since 1987 we have committed nearly #1 billion in launch investment for major new large aircraft and engine projects and provided some #20 million per year for civil aerospace research and demonstration. As large investors in R&D, aerospace companies will also benefit from the tax credit scheme for larger firms announced in the last Budget.
<P>

<a name="21031w23.html_para8">We are conscious of the strong competition faced by the industry, however, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 16 May this year the establishment of the Aerospace Innovation and Growth Team, led by Sir Richard Evans. This will enable the key stakeholders to work together to produce a shared vision and strategy for the future success of the industry. Sir Richard and his team are currently about half way through their work and a great deal of effort, from industry, Government and other organisations, is being put into the process. I expect the IGT to report by next spring, with recommendations and an agreed action plan to take the industry forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on United Kingdom policy in respect of the court case brought by the Irish Republic at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague on the non-disclosure of documents relating to the operation of the Sellafield MOX plant. [77238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government of Ireland requested from the United Kingdom Government full versions of two reports about the economic justification of the Sellafield MOX plant prepared by the independent consultants PA Consulting and AD Little. Both reports contain items of commercially confidential information and these were redacted from the versions published by Ministers in 1999 and 2001 as part of the public consultation process. The Government is entitled to protect that information from public disclosure on the grounds that its release would cause unreasonable damage to BNFL's commercial operations and the prospects for its MOX business in particular. Accordingly, the Government has declined Ireland's request.
<P>

<a name="21031w24.html_para0">In accordance with Article 32(1) of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (the 'OSPAR Convention') Ireland requested that an Arbitral Tribunal be established, claiming that the United Kingdom Government was in breach of its obligations under that Convention by declining to provide Ireland with the information requested. Following the appointment of arbitrators and the constitution of the Tribunal, both sides submitted written pleadings prior to an oral hearing held at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague between 21&#150;25 October 2002. The Tribunal will deliver its Award in due course. The written submissions and the transcripts of the oral hearing can be found on the PCA website at <i>www.pca-cpa.org.</i>

<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's nuclear site licences are granted in respect of sites rather then individual facilities. Under conditions attached to such site licences, HSE requires that for every operation on site that may affect safety, the licensee shall prepare a safety case to demonstrate that any proposed activity will be safe.
<P>

<a name="21031w24.html_para1">Sellafield currently does not have a safety case for a production facility to re-dissolve unirradiated MoX fuel. However, BNFL is considering various options for reusing the fissile material, including fuel dissolution and fuel pellet crushing into a powder; re-dissolution may involve modifications to existing plant. I understand that in due course BNFL will be submitting proposals to HSE, including any necessary safety case, to gain permission for the proposed activity.

<P>

<a name="21031w24.html_para2">The question of how to manage the whole of the UK's civil nuclear liabilities more effectively&#151;which includes decommissioning at Sellafield&#151;is the subject of the Government's recent White Paper XManaging the Nuclear Legacy&#151;A Strategy For Action". The White Paper proposes fundamental changes to current management arrangements including the establishment of a new strategic body, the Liabilities Management Authority (LMA). The LMA's task will be to ensure that the nuclear legacy is cleaned up safely, securely, cost effectively, and in ways which protect the environment for current and future generations. The Government intends to ensure that the work of the LMA is carried out in a transparent manner.

 The criteria for patenting in this field are laid down in EU Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions.

 The G7 countries have agreed to work together on the issues surrounding the patentability of biotechnological inventions. UK guidelines summarising the Patent Office's current practice based on the existing law and legal precedents from the UKcourts and the European Patent Office (EPO) will be provided to the G7 as a basis for further discussion. Staff in the UK Patent Office have also established and maintained regular contacts with their opposite numbers in the EPO to exchange information about practice in this field. Similar contacts exist with the Swedish, Austrian, Japanese, Chinese and Australian Patent Offices. The Patent Office takes due account of decisions which emerge from the EPO in making its own decisions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what guidelines she has issued on the benchmarks used for assessing the patentability of biotechnology inventions; and what implications these guidelines have for future patenting of DNA sequences identified by data-mining techniques.  [77874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w24.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Patent Office published the examination guidelines used by patent examiners for assessing the patentability of biotechnological inventions in October.

They are available from the Patent Office website at http://www.patent.gov.uk
<P>

<a name="21031w24.html_para3">Inventions arising from data-mining have to satisfy the usual patentability requirements, including inventive steps. The guidelines state that the 'use of mining to identify a polynucleotide or a polypeptide homologous to a polynucleotide or polypeptide, having a known function or activity, will not normally involve and inventive step'.

<P>

<a name="21031w25.html_para0">One strand of the strategy is to identify the need for direct support measures and this has been taken forward through the #4.4 million Scottish programme of projects under the UK Broadband Fund. There are measures to stimulate awareness and demand for broadband via a broadband information website and a network of local demonstration centres for SMEs. On the supply side, there are technology trials in rural areas, such as Powerline Carrier and Wireless pilots, which aim to determine the potential of these technologies for delivering broadband in rural communities.
<P>

<a name="21031w25.html_para1">In addition, the DTI is establishing a network of broadband experts to be located in each of the English regions and the devolved Administrations, to spread best practice in the promotion and take-up of broadband technology.

<a name="21031w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Cable networks currently pass approximately 50 per cent. of UK households. Decisions on whether to extend coverage further are a commercial matter for the cable company concerned, as network expansion is no longer dictated by the build milestones in a cable operator's Telecommunications Act licence. Cable franchises, when originally granted, contained a balance of exclusivity and build milestones. Since 1998, the exclusivity of the franchises has been progressively removed to enable greater competition in the provision of communications services. This process was completed on 1 January 2001. In recognition of this, cable operators' licences are no longer subject to build milestones.

<a name="21031w25.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 My Department is in regular contact with Ofgem to discuss energy security issues. The Joint Energy Security of Supply working group (JESS), chaired jointly by DTI and Ofgem, is the main forum for jointly monitoring security of supply issues over a medium-term timescale of up to seven years. The first JESS report, containing security indicators, was issued in June 2002 and a copy was placed in the House of Commons Library. Long-term energy security to 2020 and beyond is a key subject for the forthcoming Energy White Paper, due to be published in the new year. Ofgem are involved in the inter-departmental steering group, which is developing the White Paper.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the likely effects of the EU Copyright Directive in terms of <i>(a)</i> the ownership of intellectual property and <i>(b)</i> access to information.  [76957]<P>

<a name="21031w25.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The EU Copyright Directive does not require us to make any changes that will affect the ownership of intellectual property. Moreover, copyright does not protect information as such. Where information is contained in a copyright protected work, then implementation of the Directive in the UK will not make any change of substance to the copyright owner's existing right to control if and how that work is made available to the public by any means.

 The Foresight Vehicle LINK programme is still open. Foresight Vehicle has just published a technology road map identifying critical technology and research themes and this, taken together with the recommendations of the Automotive Innovation andGrowth Team, will be used as the basis for future calls for proposals. Sponsor departments will be meeting in the next few weeks to discuss the timing of the next call. It is too early for a full formal evaluation of the research to date, but on completion, individual projects are assessed against their objectives by the Programme Management Panel. In addition, themed dissemination events are held regularly and papers have been presented at international conferences. Details of the research portfolio and progress are also made available on the Foresight Vehicle website www.foresightvehicle.org.uk

<a name="21031w27.html_para2">All relevant export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for internal repression or external aggression. The outbreak of the intifada, continued Israeli incursions in the Occupied Territories and the Israeli breach of its assurance that UK originated equipment would not be used in the Occupied Territories have all been factored in to the Government's current export licensing policy. The UK arms trade with Israel is tiny.

In the domestic sector, the new Energy Efficiency Commitment places new obligations on gas and electricity suppliers to make energy efficiency improvements; there are also new requirements on local authorities to make proposals to achieve energy efficiency gains; and the #600 million home energy efficiency scheme provides grants for home insulation and heating improvements to improve energy savings. On transport, there is the EU-level agreements with the car manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency in new cars, backed by changes in UK vehicle taxation through company car tax and vehicle excise duty, together with the infrastructure investment in the 10-year plan to tackle congestion and pollution.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the effect of the planting of foliage on the central reservations of UK motorways on reducing headlight glare from other carriageways.  [78353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21031w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Planting and maintenance of foliage in the central reserve creates safety risks to road workers, and can cause congestion for travellers, without offering any additional safety benefits. On this basis, planting foliage in the central reservations of motorways is not favoured except where the central reservation is very wide. Headlight glare is very rarely a factor in motorway accidents.

 The Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) scheme was launched in 1999 with a budget of #105 million over three years. In December 2001 the Strategic Rail Authority re-launched RPP with a budget of #400 million until 2010&#150;11.
<P>

<a name="21031w28.html_para6">It is not possible to give a precise figure for the amount spent exclusively in rural areas, as many of the schemes for which funding has been awarded by the SRA are of benefit to rural and non-rural areas. In the financial year 2000&#150;01, some #271,000 was awarded for schemes containing a rural element. In 2001&#150;02 the figure was just under #1.1 million.

Instead, when reporting their entire pensions review provisions firms will include their guarantee liabilities. In respect of <i>(b)</i> (iii), a firm must give an undertaking to the FSA that its reserving basis for the guarantee is adequate, does not compromise its solvency position and will conform with the requirements of its prudential regulator. The Government Actuary issued guidance to appointed actuaries on the reserving implications of guaranteeing pension benefits linked to individual salaries. This guidance is incorporated within Volume Three of the IPRU (INS) rulebook under the heading DAA9.
