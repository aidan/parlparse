<i> [holding answer 29 October 2008]:</i> Flystrike is not a notifiable disease and as such farmers are not obliged to report cases to Animal Health. The number of submissions to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) are very small and therefore any conclusions drawn from these figures would be unreliable as they are not reflective of the incidence of flystrike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="81030w0002.htm_para2"><a name="08103048000510">Flystrike occurs annually in most UK sheep flocks, the incidence being highest in warm and humid areas of South West England. It is estimated that about 12,000 sheep die each year in the UK as a result of flystrike (NADIS report, 2005). Flystrike is a major welfare concern and an important cause of ill thrift in affected animals. Furthermore, the disease results in economically significant fleece and hide damage.</p>

Wall (2007) following a study in South West England during 2002-03 indicated that flystrike was associated with higher mean temperatures among other variables. The article concluded that an increase average ambient temperature was likely to increase the incidence of flystrike.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 October 2008]:</i> DEFRA worked in partnership with the industry to create a strategy for voluntary vaccination, and ensured the availability of vaccine. DEFRA has always encouraged vaccination as the only effective way for individuals to protect the welfare of their animals and their own livelihood. Ministers and the chief veterinary officer have emphasised the importance of vaccinating against bluetongue in the media and in meetings with the industry. DEFRA also supported the industry-led Joint Action Against Bluetongue (JAB) communications campaign which promoted the benefits of vaccinating against bluetongue (under the &#147;Don&#146;t hesitate, vaccinate&#148; banner), and highlighted the risks of not doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="81030w0002.htm_para4"><a name="08103048000516">DEFRA backed up these messages through a communications campaign which ran throughout the summer, using the farming press and local channels such as roadshows and Animal Health communications to stress the importance of vaccination.</p>

 The Environment Agency does not maintain a register of known residential moorings or information about other boats other than house boats used for residential purposes. As residential use is a matter for the local planning authority, the agency advises these authorities if it detects a potential change of land use from leisure to residential purposes.</p>

 Commitments to new projects under Axis 1, 3 and the Leader Axis of the Rural Development Programme for England only commenced in January 2008 following EU approval of the new programme. Since 1 October 2006, payments have also been made by regional development agencies to projects that were the legacy of the previous England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), funding for which came from the new RDPE budget. That programme closed for new applications in June 2006.</p>

 The Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) consultation document considered a study by Element Energy on the growth potential for microgeneration and so included some analysis on the potential of solar PV and small wind technologies in the non-domestic setting up to 50 kWe. In addition, we commissioned a further study, prior to the RES consultation, on the potential of solar PV and wind technologies beyond this up to 1 MW. However, this work was not completed at the time the RES consultation was launched. We therefore said that we planned to publish this study to scope the potential for retrofitting larger on-site renewable electricity generation in the existing built environment during the consultation period, which we did.

 Ensuring access for a mix of generating technologies is essential in delivering energy security and tackling climate change. As the amount of variable renewable generation on the network increases, we will need to see timely investment in new responsive back-up capacity in order to ensure reliable electricity supplies.</p>

Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part. 3. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. 4. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF. 5. The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients. 6. The Quality Management Analysis System captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. 7. Figures presented here are just the number of patients on the disease register for dementia.  <i> Source:</i> The data supplied in Table 1 is published on the website of the Information Centre for health and social care.

 1. More accurate validation in 2006 has resulted in 232 headcount duplicate records being identified and removed from the non-medical census<br>
 2. Data Quality<br>
 Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

A direct comparison between the 2005-06 and 2008-09 levels of main police grant would be misleading because the creation and discontinuation of a number of specific grants in this period have impacted on the level of main police grant, but not on the overall level of funding provided to the police. Nevertheless, since 2005-06 total Government grants to Lancashire police authority has increased from &#163;210,385,869 to &#163;243,114,829, an increase of &#163;32,728,960.</p>

 New homes built in the Thames Gateway must meet the same standards as in the rest of the UK. The long-term goal is to reduce UK carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050. The intention is for all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016, to be achieved through a progressive tightening of the energy efficiency standards in building regulations&#151;with a 25 per cent. improvement on current standards in 2010 and a 44 per cent. in 2013&#151;up to the zero carbon standard in 2016. Our planning policies on climate change enable councils to drive things further and faster than the national timetable through their planning strategies, where local circumstances warrant and allow this. In addition, homes built with funding from English Partnerships, Housing Corporation or the two Thames Gateway Development Corporations are required to be built to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 3. We also announced in the November 2007 Thames Gateway Delivery Plan that we envisage the Thames Gateway as an eco-region. Work continues to develop the eco-region concept and next steps will be announced in a prospectus, to be published later this year.</p>

 The town and country planning system is designed to regulate the development and use of land in the public interest. It is concerned only with whether a proposed use of a site is acceptable in land-use planning terms. The system works on the principle that if permission is granted to one applicant it should be available to anyone else wishing to develop the site in the same way. This means that land with the benefit of planning permission could be sold, whether the land owner is based in the UK or abroad.</p>

But many other people too have a huge interest in the success of our universities and colleges. That is why the next stage in the debate is for a group of people whose cultural activities, businesses, public services depend on the success of our universities to articulate their perspective on what a world class higher education sector would look like in 10 to 15 years' time to support their needs. They will also provide challenges and responses to the recommendations that the original contributors put forward. In addition, the National Student Forum will provide the student angle.</p>

 We have not made any specific assessment. There is a wide variety of postgraduate courses, and the decision to undertake postgraduate studies is influenced by a range of factors, and not just debt.</p>

Borrowers repay at a rate of 9 per cent. of their income over a threshold of &#163;15,000 a year. Repayment is progressive and therefore rises as income does.

 Any assault incident may be referred to the police for investigation and consideration as to whether any criminal charges are appropriate.

There is no separate offence under prison discipline rules of attempted murder.

 The review of the Dedicated Schools Grant is wide-ranging and includes specifically looking at the funding for sparsity and for early years. The aim of the review is to develop a funding formula which distributes resources in line with relative need, recognising the different costs of educating particular groups of pupils and providing education in different areas. Our aim is to support schools and LAs in raising the educational achievement of all pupils and narrow achievement gaps, particularly those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_560"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para4"><a name="08103118000331">If the information requested could be produced, it would come from the Achievement and Attainment Tables data. That data is essentially hierarchical&#151;each pupil can sit many exams, each school has many pupils and each local authority has many schools. To deal with that, DCSF manage the data as a series of pre-specified, separate and distinct data files: exam, pupil, school, local authority and national.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_561"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para5"><a name="08103118000332">That allows the Department to quickly and easily answer questions and produce analyses at a range of different levels and on a range of different measures and indicators. However, those measures and indicators must be pre-specified and the data files are produced under contract for, and delivered to, the Department. A lot of work is put into ensuring the fullest range of relevant measures and indicators are pre-specified and available and updated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_562"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para6"><a name="08103118000333">However, it becomes more difficult and expensive to produce analyses where a measure or indicator has not been pre-specified. Essentially, that requires going much further back into the data file production process&#151;agreeing classifications, developing and agreeing production rules and processes, aggregating data (for e.g. from examination level to pupil level), matching data across levels (for e.g. to identify whether a, pupil is in a comprehensive school), extensive quality assurance to check the results and then actual production of the tables and analysis required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_563"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para7"><a name="08103118000334">The key point is that, at school and pupil level (for the range of yearn requested), there are not pre-specified variables relating to Modern Foreign Languages&#151;which would be required to answer these two questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_564"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para8"><a name="08103118000335">The initial estimate of &#163;4,000 was based on the assumption that DCSF would need to ask contractors to create additional variables, aggregations and matches across levels&#151;with associated development and quality assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_565"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para9"><a name="08103118000336">In some cases, we have the option of carrying out the work ourselves, without involving our contractor in going back to a very early stage in the production process. We have reconsidered on that basis and estimate that would cost &#163;2,200. An explanation of this cost is given as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para10"><a name="08103118000337">The main tasks are as outlined earlier&#151;developing and agreeing classifications, production rules and processes, aggregating data across levels, matching data across levels, quality assurance and final production. This is a complex data production and manipulation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para11"><a name="08103118000338">As PQ 224479 asked for 11 years worth of information, at approximately half a day&#146;s work per year, plus a day extra for checking, this would result in a cost of around &#163;1,300. (circa 45 hours).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para12"><a name="08103118000339">PQ 224500 does not require an aggregation up to school level so producing the information is slightly simpler but the process would still require implementing the production rules, creating a suitable variable, aggregating up to pupil level and matching to the pupil lie. Again, substantial quality assurance checks would be needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="81030w0029.htm_para13"><a name="08103118000340">This process would need to be repeated for each year and would take longer than the disproportionate threshold of at least three and a half days of HEO-equivalent grade&#146;s work and at least another day for a different HEO (or higher) to verify it. This amounts to &#163;900. (circa 32 hours).</p>

 The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not collect this information.

Primary school policies should have clear parameters on what children will be taught in the transition year before moving to secondary school; secondary school policies must set out how the relevant National Curriculum Science topics will be taught and how sex and relationship education will be provided as part of personal, social and health education.

1. UCAS tariff score was used to assess candidates from 2002/03 onwards.<br>
2. UCAS introduced the tariff score to take account of curriculum 2000. It was designed to make different qualifications comparable. It is based on a number of qualifications including A/AS levels. Grade A at A-level scores 120 points; grade B scores 100 points; grade C scores 80 points; grade D scores 60 points and grade E scores 40 points. Tariff scores cover those entrants for whom data are collected. Tariff score data are not collected for some qualifications, including Access courses, OND/ONC, HND/HNC, GCE, A/SCE, Higher, GNVQ/GSVQ, NVQ/SVQ level 3.<br>

This will fund up to 3,500 public play areas and 30 staffed adventure playgrounds nationally. 30 pathfinder authorities will receive on average &#163;2.1 million of capital and &#163;500,000 of revenue each; and every other authority will receive on average &#163;1 million capital and a small revenue grant.</p>

 The review of the dedicated schools grant is wide-ranging and includes specifically looking at the funding for sparsity, deprivation and special educational needs. The aim of the review is to develop a funding formula which distributes resources in line with relative need, recognising the different costs of educating particular groups of pupils and providing education in different areas. Our aim is to support schools and LAs in raising the educational achievement of all pupils and narrow achievement gaps, particularly those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds. It will therefore take into account the contribution of small rural primary schools, alongside other schools, in achieving those aims.</p>

 Responses to the Staying Safe consultation, which closed on 31 October 2007, included concerns about safety on bus journeys to and from school. In the Staying Safe Action Plan (February 2008), the Government committed to launching new guidance and training on tackling bullying which takes place outside of schools. Following a competitive tendering process, we have appointed the charity 4Children to develop guidance and training tools and materials on tackling bullying outside of schools. These will be published early in 2009. The guidance and materials will specifically include advice to help practitioners tackle bullying during journeys to and from school and on public transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="81030w0031.htm_para5"><a name="08103118000576">Ofsted&#146;s Tellus 3 survey, published in October 2008, includes for the first time a question on the frequency of bullying both inside and outside school, including journeys to and from school. Although the survey does not include a measure specifically relating to buses, it does include a question on how safe children feel on public transport and journeys to and from school. Responses to these questions provide a valuable source of information on the scale of bullying outside school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_576"><a name="81030w0031.htm_para6"><a name="08103118000577">My Department promotes local good practice to monitor and tackle bullying, such as having school prefects act as bullying monitors on school buses. It also encourages local initiatives to tackle bad behaviour on buses, such as the Purbeck Bus Forum which operates in the hon. Member&#146;s constituency. To improve monitoring at a local level, my Department is also proposing to introduce a statutory requirement for all schools to record, although not report, incidents of verbal or physical abuse which are linked to bullying. We intend to consult key stakeholders on this over the coming months and will legislate at the earliest possible opportunity in 2009. We will continue also to recommend that schools supply this recorded data to their local authority, so that trends across the authority can be identified and area-wide initiatives evaluated.</p>

This is consistent with the Government&#146;s principles of public service inspections and Ofsted&#146;s statutory functions, both of which require inspection to be proportionate to risk. Subject to the passage of legislation, the new school inspection arrangements will be introduced in autumn 2009.</p>

 The Government consider that schools are more likely to achieve high standards when they take responsibility for their own future. Control of land and buildings, together with the other freedoms that self-governance brings, is part of this. The land is held in trust for the school by the governing body or the trust. There are protections relating to the disposal of any publicly provided land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_577"><a name="81030w0031.htm_para7"><a name="08103118000582">The majority of academies occupy their land and buildings through a lease from the local authority (LA). There are in some cases arrangements where academies are built on land owned by a third party (other than the LA) but the land and buildings are leased to the academy trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_578"><a name="81030w0031.htm_para8"><a name="08103118000583">Those academies that were built early in the programme were typically given the freehold of their land by the LA as part of the overall package of transfer of responsibility and control.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) expect the countries to which we provide direct support to have plans in place to remove tuition fees. To be successful, and to protect standards, the removal of fees needs to be part of a comprehensive, long-term plan for universal primary enrolment. Support from DFID, in the form of long-term predictable funding, is helping governments, achieve this aim but other donors also need to provide long-term flexible funding to ensure the removal of primary tuition fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="81030w0033.htm_para11"><a name="08103118000908">Many of the countries that DFID prioritises for support have already removed tuition fees or are working towards their removal. The high cost of education is the biggest deterrent to poor families educating their children, particularly for girls. In addition to tuition fees, other direct costs include uniforms and textbooks, teachers&#146; and Parent Teacher Association fees, transportation as well as &#145;hidden&#146; costs such as lost household and/or paid labour. Such costs have a significant impact on whether and which children are educated.</p>

 Civil Society Organisations have regularly raised this issue and I agree it is important that wage ceilings do not restrict the ability of governments to hire teachers. The Department for International Development welcomes the recent changes agreed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to significantly reduce the use of wage ceilings. If any ceilings are agreed with the government as part of an IMF programme, they will need explicit justification and the need for them will be subject to regular reassessment. The IMF&#146;s new approach makes clear that ceilings should allow for full spending of higher aid flows and take measures to safeguard priority sectors, such as education.</p>
