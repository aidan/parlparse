 The UK climate impacts programme is conducting ongoing work to provide scenarios to show how our climate might change and co-ordinating research on dealing with our future climate. This includes work on climate change impacts on the agriculture sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Research suggests that climate change impacts do not appear to threaten the viability of the agriculture industry as a whole in the UK due to the adaptability of UK systems., However, individual agricultural businesses and land managers will need to be alive to the need to adapt.

<a name="60502w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The UK national adaptation policy framework is currently being developed. It will help to provide a more strategic approach to adaptation, identifying key risks and opportunities common across a number of policy areas and to coordinate approaches where possible.

<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="60502w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of air quality in the London borough of Bexley.  [65681]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives. The Mayor has responsibility for ensuring the local air quality management regime is undertaken appropriately by London boroughs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Following the first round of reviews and assessments, the London borough of Bexley declared an air quality management area in respect of Particulate (PM10), in the Manor road area, in August 2001. In fulfilment of its obligations under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Act, Bexley carried out a further assessment of existing, and likely future, air quality within the AQMA in the borough, and submitted a report to my Department in May 2003 and the Mayor of London in March 2003. The report concluded that the air quality management area as declared was still justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The council consulted my Department on its draft plan in July 2003, and the Mayor of London in June 2003. The Greater London Authority has asked Bexley to provide an update on its action plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The last round of reviews and assessments started in 2003 and London boroughs had to submit their updating and screening assessments (USA) by December 2003. They were expected to submit either a detailed assessment, where further investigation was required, or a progress report by December 2004. The London borough of Bexley submitted its USA to my Department in September 2004, and the Mayor of London in October 2004. The conclusion was that further investigation (detailed assessment) was needed at Manor road in respect of the likely exceedences of nitrogen dioxide and PM10 objectives. The Department is still awaiting a report on its detailed assessment of air quality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The next round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities are asked to submit a new updating and screening assessment by the end of April 2006, which will be considered by my officials. My Department will be assessing the London borough of Bexley&#039;s report as part of this exercise.

 The Department is currently undertaking an assessment of the humaneness, efficacy and non-target risks of a body snare specifically designed to restrain badgers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The trials are initially being undertaken in captivity&#151;pen trials&#151;under Home Office licence with continuous observation by researchers. This ensures that if any animal is injured during capture immediate assessment and, if necessary, intervention can occur. In the absence of such signs the animals are restrained for a maximum of eight hours. At the end of the restraint period the badgers are examined for injuries by a veterinary surgeon. They are then held for a further four days and re-examined by a veterinary surgeon for signs of any sub-dermal damage&#151;necrosis&#151;before release back to the wild. The available evidence is reviewed after each trial to determine whether further studies should proceed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The aim is to release all animals back to the wild unharmed within a maximum period of 10 days following initial capture. Advice from veterinary surgeons and badger experts is that removing the badger from its home territory for this length of time should not affect the social structure of the family group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">If the humaneness of the body snare is found to be acceptable in these pen trials, then field trials will be conducted to confirm its humaneness and to assess effectiveness, utility and non-target risks. It is anticipated that body snares will be inspected approximately every four hours during such trials.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 An independent review of veterinary capacity and preparedness was carried out prior to the implementation of pre-movement testing in England. The review surveyed local veterinary inspectors&#039; (LVI) in high incidence areas in England. The review found that most LVIs had a good general awareness of the new requirements and felt they would be able to respond to and meet the expected demand for testing. The full report can be found on the DEFRA website at: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/premovement/report.pdf

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the forecast annual cost is arising from the decision by her Department to pay for one pre-movement bovine tuberculosis test.  [66626]</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Based on 2005 monthly cattle movement data and assuming cattle are tested in groups of 20, the maximum cost to Government of paying for all pre-movement testing to the end of June is estimated at &#163;714,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">However, as Government support is limited to one test per herd owner, and as the figure does not take account of herd owners who use their routine herd test, the actual costs to Government will be lower. These transitional support arrangements end on 30 June 2006.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Each month Defra publishes provisional cumulative data on the total number of TB cases identified at slaughterhouses and reported to the State Veterinary Service (SVS), along with the number of slaughterhouse cases that have been confirmed by visible lesion or laboratory culture. The data form part of Defra&#039;s regular TB statistics report, which is available on the Defra website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/latest.htm.

<a name="60502w01.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">All slaughterhouse cases notified by the Meat Hygiene Service are subject to traceback investigations by the SVS, and have samples taken that are fast-tracked to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for histology and culture. Where Mycobacterium bovis infection is confirmed, the molecular typing data derived from those tests are used by the SVS to identify the origin of the infection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">A summary of the culture results from individual slaughterhouse cases identified in 2005 will be included in the Chief Veterinary Officer&#039;s annual report, which will be published later this year.

 The principal means of control to protect the water environment are the Environment Agency&#039;s powers and duties under the Water Resources Act 1991, the Environment Act 1995 and the Groundwater Regulations 1998. The Environment Agency&#039;s booklet Assessing the Groundwater Pollution Potential of Cemetery Development&quot; gives advice to operators on assessing the risk to groundwater from existing and planned cemeteries.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60502w07.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In April 2005, DFID funded the NGO Forest Trends, in co-operation with the World Agroforestry Centre (formerly ICRAF), to produce a report: &#039;Navigating the Border: An Analysis of the China-Myanmar Timber Trade&#039;. In addition, Her Majesty&#039;s Government officials were consulted on the October 2005 Global Witness Report: A Choice for China: Ending the destruction of Burma&#039;s frontier forests&quot;. We believe that the analysis of the trade and its impact contained in these reports is broadly accurate. They report that:
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_76">China imported 1.3 million m <sup>3</sup>  of timber from Burma in 2003, almost 60 per cent. of total world imports of Burmese timber. In financial terms this equates to illegal timber exports worth $250 million to $300 million annually across the border from northern Burma to China&#039;s Yunnan province. Global Witness estimate that two-thirds of Burma&#039;s total revenue from timber exports came from illegal trade, mostly with China, and that more than 100 Chinese timber companies and 20,000 Chinese loggers are involved in the trade inside Burma.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_77">In Burma, logging is having an adverse effect on both the local population and the environment. Deforestation has caused localised flooding, drought and resulting crop failure, the disappearance of wild animals and birdlife associated with the forests. Local people in Burma derive little direct financial benefit from the logging industry and are frequently worse off as a result of the presence of Chinese logging companies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_78">In China, the increased concentration of logging firms and workers along the Yunnan-Burma border has meant that the timber buyers on China&#039;s eastern seaboard largely bypass inland Yunnan and procure materials directly on the border. The recent wave of migration to the Yunnan-Burma border has, in some areas, led to a visible increase in gambling, drugs and commercial sex work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_79">In March 2006, in response to these reports, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry took the unusual step of admitting that some of its companies and individual citizens are involved in illegal logging in Burma, and said the Government were paying high attention&quot; to the problem and requests the Chinese companies and individuals to abide by local laws and regulations.&quot;

 The UK recognises the severity of the current humanitarian situation in Somalia and the risks of further deterioration. The most pessimistic predictions, however, including famine, are only likely if the 2006 long rains fail. Fortunately these have now started and are continuing well. So far we see malnutrition and mortality rates that are high but not yet catastrophic, and some of the predicted drought enforced migrations that had been envisaged have not taken place. This is likely to be, at least in part, due to the efforts of the relief agencies.

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is making good progress in improving public awareness and public confidence in its work. A communication strategy has been developed to improve public awareness of the CPS&#039;s role in prosecuting crime. The strategy includes proactively engaging with the media; working with other criminal justice system agencies on communication initiatives; improving stakeholder engagement; and promoting the CPS&#039;s vision of becoming a world-class prosecution authority. Greater awareness is important in raising public confidence in the CPS. The latest British Crime Survey report on policing and confidence, published on 30 March 2006, suggests that public satisfaction with the CPS&#039;s work has increased.

Of those 1,551 personnel, 208 were assessed as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. A further 696 personnel were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder, which will include some who have post traumatic symptoms not amounting to full PTSD but with some symptoms of post traumatic stress. Other personnel were diagnosed with a range of other mental health conditions, including mood and neurotic disorders, and psychoactive substance misuse.

<a name="stpa_107">Figures on the total number of personnel treated following service in Iraq for physical injuries sustained in theatre are not collated centrally. Nor is it possible, for example, to break down the medical evacuation figure given in my previous answer of 2 February 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 704&#150;05W, because the database which records the data does not contain information on treatment received after evacuation. Complete information on medical treatment could only be compiled from personal medical records which are held by individual unit commands. These can only be viewed for non-clinical reasons with the express consent of the individual concerned, to protect patient confidentiality. I cannot therefore give a figure for the total number of personnel treated following service in Iraq for physical injuries sustained in theatre.

A medium-sized company is defined for the purposes of special accounting provisions of the Companies Act 1985 as a company that satisfies at least two of three requirements: turnover of not more than &#163;22.8 million, balance sheet total of not more than &#163;11.4 million, and number of employees totalling not more than 250. Such companies can take advantage of certain accounting and reporting exemptions in the accounts and reports they prepare for members and file with the Registrar of Companies. However, public (including public listed) companies are excluded from these special provisions, and, so, cannot qualify to file as medium-sized. Since no public companies can file medium-sized accounts with the Registrar, it is not possible to estimate the proportion of medium-sized companies that are public companies.

<i>[holding answer 27 April 2006]:</i> The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the decommissioning and clean up of the UK&#039;s civil nuclear legacy on 1 April 2005. The cost of the decommissioning and clean up of the NDA&#039;s sites is calculated by means of Life Cycle Baselines&#151;which are long-term plans providing a detailed assessment of the scope, methodology, and time scale of proposed site activities, including the cost of its commercial operations. Based on the 2005&#150;06 Life Cycle Baselines the NDA has estimated the undiscounted cost of delivering its mission at &#163;62.7 billion at current prices. This is the figure given in its strategy. But the NDA has also identified a potential further &#163;7.5 billion of costs that will need to be included in future Life Cycle Baselines. Information on Life Cycle Baselines and the long-term funding of the NDA&#039;s mission is available on its website www.nda.gov.uk

The NDA is considering the scope for extending the life of Wylfa beyond 2010&#151;which is the planned closure date given in its approved strategy. The NDA has advised me that in light of factors such as the age of the plant, related safety concerns, and the closure of associated fuel processing facilities at Sellafield such an extension is highly unlikely.

 We continue to have serious concerns about the situation of religious minorities in Iran. The Iranian constitution recognises the Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian communities, but not others such as the Baha&#039;is. We receive many reports of discrimination against those wishing to practise these faiths. The position of people who have converted from Islam appears to be especially difficult. We have made clear to the Iranian authorities that we believe that persecution of individuals on the grounds of their religious beliefs is unacceptable. We expect Iran to uphold freedom of religion and belief in accordance with its international obligations under Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights.

 Respect for democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law are principles which form the foundation for UK and EU co-operation with Moldova. They are also principles to which Moldova is committed through its participation in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and other international organisations. Moldova has made some progress towards becoming a functioning democracy, with active opposition parties represented in Parliament. However, the OSCE&#039;s Office for Democracy and Institution for Human Rights identified a number of shortcomings in the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections, including obstruction of the opposition&#039;s campaign. Recent reports have also raised concerns about interference by the Moldovan authorities in the work of opposition political parties. Through the EU troika, we have raised our concerns about these issues, most recently with the Moldovan Foreign Minister at the EU-Moldova Co-operation Council on 6 April. We will continue to monitor Moldova&#039;s progress towards meeting its democratic commitments, including through the European Neighbourhood Policy, which offers Moldova the opportunity to achieve its ambition of closer relations with the EU, subject to progress on internal reform.

<p><a name="st_222"><a name="60502w26.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 At major airports, Border Control has staff deployed to meet all services requiring immigration control. At smaller airports, resources are deployed on an intelligence led risk basis to deal with passengers who require leave to enter. The IAN Act 2006 provides additional powers to deal more effectively with people posing a threat to border security, including the capture of data on passengers and fingerprinting of those detained. The Border Management Programme ensures that the three border agencies (HMRC, UKIS and the Police) work more closely together to maximise border security while minimising the impact on legitimate traffic. MATRA groups (Multi Agency Threat and Risk Assessment Group) at airports bring together border agencies, operators and carriers to identify and assess risks to general security and put in place action plans in order to counter any potential threats. e-Borders is a multi agency programme to harness passenger information and use new technology to provide more effective border controls. Project Semaphore, as part of the e-Borders programme, is further strengthening the border through the use of an advance passenger information processing system and the adoption of a proactive intelligence led approach.

<p><a name="st_321"><a name="60502w35.html_spnew4"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The global nature of the causes and effects of climate change means that international action is crucial. The measures in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#039;s speech to the UN ambassadors highlight how co-ordinated international action can bring significant emissions reductions. These proposals aim to drive forward effective multilateral action. In particular, the Multilateral Development Banks&#039; Energy Investment Framework, and an extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Clean Development Mechanism will have significant impacts in reducing global emissions, encouraging the development of a deeper and more liquid global carbon market. However, details of these proposals have not yet been finalised with international partners and institutions, so an assessment of their impact would be premature. Action is also needed to tackle greenhouse gas emissions from consumers, and the 1 Watt initiative which the Chancellor proposed has significant potential to reduce global emissions and should be accelerated.

For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Brazil and the UK have already announced that they will make contributions to the IFFIm, and on 25 April, South Africa announced that they would also contribute to the IFFIm.

 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed at the United Nations Millennium summit in September 2000. The goals range from halving global income poverty and protecting the environment, to human development objectives like improving health and sanitation, achieving universal primary education and tackling discrimination against women. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been placed at the centre of Britain&#039;s international development effort. DFID&#039;s key aims and objectives, as set out in its public service agreement, are the attainment of the MDGs by 2015.

<a name="stpa_320">The MDGs and global poverty were at the heart of the UK presidencies of the EU and the G7/8 in 2005. The international community committed to raise an additional $50 billion of aid by 2010, to cancel 100 per cent. of the multilateral debts of the world&#039;s poorest countries, and to launch the international finance facility for immunisation. G8 leaders also agreed to achieve universal access to AIDS treatment for all those who need it by 2010, and work on advance market commitments for vaccines against malaria, HIV/AIDS and other priority diseases.

Government have established the new industry framework within which both Network Rail and the Association of Train Operators now have active and successful programmes for recruitment, training and professional development of chartered and graduate engineers and engineering technicians.

As stated in the decision letter, the Secretary of State accepted the planning Inspector&#039;s recommendation for the limit on the basis of a precautionary approach, and in view of the Inspector&#039;s concerns about noise, particularly the weighting of the number of aircraft movements relative to the Leq noise index. The limit applies from the date that the core terminal building opens for public use, but BAA have stated their intention to manage traffic levels in the intervening period.

<p><a name="st_388"><a name="60502w43.html_spnew3"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The Department of Education actively promotes and funds anti-bullying initiatives through its anti-bullying programme. The current programme comprises funding for a dedicated bullying advice helpline, operated by ChildLine; a further study into the extent and nature of bullying in schools in Northern Ireland as a follow up to the research published in 2002; and a survey of pastoral care in schools to ensure compliance with the requirements to have measures in place to tackle bullying.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w43.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_346">The Department is a member of the local Anti-bullying Forum. The Forum, which draws its members from the statutory and voluntary sectors, was launched in November 2005, with the aim of sharing models of best practice, disseminating information, developing and co-coordinating joint initiatives. This will ensure that schools and organisations working with children and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 May 2006 : Column 1470W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
young people are able to have appropriate strategies to prevent and deal with bullying behaviours. The Forum has developed a three-year anti-bullying strategy with the Department of Education funding its administrative structure. The main elements of the Forum&#039;s strategic plan includes developing, implementing and promoting of models of good practice, developing parental partnerships, website development and organising annual bullying week.

<p>
<a name="60502w43.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_347">In 2005&#150;06 the Department of Education has contributed approximately &#163;55,000 to the development of anti-bullying initiatives. In 2006&#150;07 the Department has agreed to fund &#163;66,000 to the local Forum to implement its anti-bullying strategy and providing the terms and conditions of grant are met, the Department has agreed in principle to fund in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09. Across the education and library boards at least &#163;200,000 per annum is allocated to specific anti-bullying activity. The Department does not have information about the resources that schools devote to anti-bullying initiatives from their own budgets.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the effects of the funding awarded to each of the 13 organisations in February 2005 to tackle racism. [65329]</p>








<p><a name="st_389"><a name="60502w43.html_spnew4"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 In February 2005 &#163;100,000 was made available specifically to assist local communities build positive relationships with minority ethnic people, thereby helping to tackle hate crime in a number of geographical areas. 33 organisations applied and 13 received funding. These projects were subject to continual monitoring to ensure that they fulfilled the aims and objectives set out in the original applications.

<p>
<a name="60502w43.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_348">This investment, in the Government&#039;s view, represents good value for money. It has enabled those organisations to undertake a range of activities and develop programmes to help minority ethnic and migrant groups integrate into society. The programmes also addressed the problem of racism. For example, over 100 people attended workshops across Northern Ireland to share experiences and develop action plans to tackle racism; a CD ROM is being produced to promote the integration of minority ethnic people into the local communities; over 75 people, in the Greater Belfast area, representing five community groups, received anti-racism and diversity training; over 200 young people from local schools in the mid-Ulster area attended a Chinese cultural awareness and martial arts event; 90 people from North and East Belfast attended cultural celebration events; and 75 children from the mid-Down area attended a six week summer camp designed to tackle issues such as conflict resolution.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for what reasons the Newborn Screening programme does not include screening for Biotinidase deficiency.  [66616]</p>








<p><a name="st_390"><a name="60502w44.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 The National Screening Committee (NSC) has recommended that Biotinidase Deficiency should not be included as part of Newborn Screening. This advice was based on two Health Technology Assessment reports which reviewed the current research evidence. The NSC has also assessed Biotinidase Deficiency against its assessment criteria for new screening programmes.

<p><a name="st_392"><a name="60502w44.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Biotinidase deficiency is a rare condition. With approximately 12 cases per year across the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland&#039;s proportional share, based on number of births, would be one case every three years. Given the small numbers affected, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety does not record the specific costs of treating a child with this condition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w44.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_349">Specific medical conditions such as biotinidase deficiency are not recorded by education and library boards (ELBs) as part of the school census process. Only one of the ELBs is aware of children in their area with biotinidase deficiency. Regardless of specific medical conditions and their severity, special educational needs provision is matched to the individual needs of pupils. As this provision may be made in a special school, a special unit of a mainstream class, the associated cost cannot be provided for individual pupils.

Under the contract, each GMS practice receives payment and can generate income through a number of streams, some of which are core and some in which participation is a matter of choice for the practice concerned. It is a matter for each GMS contractor to determine how its practice is organised and how much of the funding it receives goes directly to each GP in the practice by way of salary/profit sharing. Since, as independent contractors, GPs are not required to declare information about their salaries, it is not possible to provide accurate average salary figures for the profession. However, officials estimate that in Northern Ireland, on average, the gross annual income per GP, after practice expenses, is currently in the region of &#163;85,000 to &#163;95,000.

The Chief Constable made a clear statement to the Policing Board on 1 March 2006 that the Security Service did not withhold intelligence that was relevant or would have progressed the Omagh enquiry. It remains the policy of successive governments to neither confirm nor deny matters relating to intelligence information. The Treasury Solicitor&#039;s Department has explained in correspondence with lawyers acting on behalf of the families of Omagh bomb victims why the Security Service is unable to provide them with any information. We do not believe therefore in the case for a public inquiry; nor is there a case to review the decision to transfer the lead role for national security intelligence work in Northern Ireland from the police to the Security Service.

 I believe it is important that we continually review and develop how we manage offenders in the community.

<a name="stpa_377">The recent consultation on the sentencing framework in Northern Ireland included a wide range of possible sentencing disposals which would provide for: increased public protection through tougher sentences and post-release supervision; a reduction in crime; and improved rehabilitation of offenders in Northern Ireland. Central to that process was consideration of the issue of protection of the public from dangerous violent and sexual offenders through extended sentences underpinned by robust risk assessment and management.

 There is no statutory definition of a key worker. For the purposes of the Key Worker Living (KWL) programme, a key worker is someone employed by the public sector in health, education or community safety delivering an essential public service in a frontline role where there are serious recruitment and retention problems. Within this broad definition sponsor Government Departments and Police and Fire Authorities specify the groups at which help should be targeted based on recruitment and retention issues in critical frontline services.

Notes:<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>





A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier called the hospital episode statistics identifier (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data is incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

PCT and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality<br>

PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practice (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data that is the data is ungrossed.<br>

 All clinical trials that are conducted in England and Wales are regulated by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 which implemented the Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) into United Kingdom law. This directive came into force in the UK on 1 May 2004. At the time the legislation came into force, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued comprehensive guidance and advice on the new regulatory framework to all stakeholders including those involved in the conduct of clinical trials. The Department also issued specific guidance about sponsorship responsibilities in publicly funded trials under the new regulatory framework. The Department&#039;s research governance framework for health and social care which is the core standard for health care draws attention to the law regulating clinical trials and to the principles of good clinical practice. In addition, the European Commission has issued detailed guidance on the requirements under the directive.

 An independent review of the health informatics market concluded that Dr. Foster was the most suitable private sector partner to work with the NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre. A formal due diligence exercise confirmed that although Dr. Foster was relatively new to the market place, it had a robust position. Opinion canvassed among a number of stakeholders confirmed Dr. Foster&#039;s strong brand and market position.
