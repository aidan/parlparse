<a name="10201w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Department's claim handling agents, IRISC, have registered a total of 6,802 claims by former miners who have died and where the date of death is after the date of claim. Of these 656 were Scottish claimants. In all these cases the claims will be continued by the claimant's widow or dependants. In addition, where the claimant's death certificate shows that one of the respiratory diseases for which British Coal were found liable either caused or materially contributed to the death, the Department will also make bereavement or loss of society awards. The Department has made 4,650 bereavement or loss of society awards, totalling &#163;38.7 million. Of these 258, totalling &#163;2 million, were Scottish claimants.
<P>

<a name="10201w01.html_para2">The Department has settled some 7,080 claims in full, with payments totalling &#163;25 million. Of these some 585 settlements, totalling &#163;1.6 million, were to Scottish claimants. In addition the Department has made some 25,000 interim settlements, totalling &#163;83.5 million, with some 2,000 payments, totalling &#163;5.5 million, made to Scottish claimants.

<P>
<a name="10201w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Temple-Morris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on how many occasions municipal solid waste incinerators have been found to be operating in breach of conditions on their operation imposed by <i>(a)</i> planning consents and <i>(b)</i> pollution control consents in each of the last five years; and what assessment was made of the potential damage to the health of local residents in each case.  [147506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Planning Consents: The Department does not keep a central record of breaches of planning consent conditions. It is the responsibility of the local planning authority that imposed the planning conditions to assess the effect of any that are breached and to take any necessary action.
<P>

<a name="10201w01.html_para5">Pollution Control Consents: Within the UK, municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) are regulated under part 1 of the Environment Protection Act 1990 by the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland and local authorities. In England and Wales, the Environment Agency is responsible for regulating MSWIs with a capacity of one tonne per hour or more under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime.
<P>

<a name="10201w01.html_para6">The table summarises the numbers of breaches of emission limits to air from MSWIs currently operating in England and Wales under the IPC regime. The table does not include breaches of limits in the period 1 January to 1 December 1996 for MSWIs that closed following the implementation of the Council Directive on the reduction of air pollution from existing municipal waste incineration plants.
<P>

<a name="10201w01.html_para7">All operators of MSWIs are required by their authorisations to inform the Agency of any breaches of emission limit values or failures of equipment that could result in a breach. On receipt of these notifications the Agency assesses the cause and the potential effect on the environment and health. Where enforcement action is necessary the Agency follows its Enforcement and Prosecution Policy. I understand that to date there have been no breaches of limits that have warranted a detailed study of the impact on health, as the Agency has determined that the potential impact would be negligible. However, should an emission limit be exceeded in the future to the extent that the impact is not likely to be negligible, the Agency has assured me that it would take appropriate enforcement action and study the potential effects.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what length of time he will allow for the completion of the mapping exercises required by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  [147702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department has a Public Service Agreement target to open up public access to mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land by the end of 2005. The Countryside Agency has a duty under the Act to prepare and consult on statutory maps of open country and registered common land in England. This is a major task. The Agency plans to map region by region and aims to complete the mapping process by September 2004.
<P>

<a name="10201w01.html_para8">We are considering with the Agency the possibility of early commencement of the right, either on a region-by-region basis, or for mountains over 600 m and registered common land.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the European Parliament's decision to allow the European Commission to start issuing new licences for GM products to go on to the market in Europe from February.  [147579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The European Parliament has taken no such decision. The placing on the market of products consisting of or containing GMOs within the European Community is governed by Directive 90/220/EEC. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are currently considering a revision to this Directive under Community co-decision procedures. In accordance with these procedures, the Parliament and the Council are required to take a decision by 14 February 2001 on whether to adopt the text of a revised Directive approved jointly by a Conciliation Committee of the two institutions on 20 December 2000. On the assumption the revised Directive is adopted as currently drafted, member states and the Commission will continue to have joint responsibility, as they have under the existing directive, for taking decisions on the authorisation of the placing on the market of products controlled by the Directive. Such decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis, including detailed assessment of the measures necessary to avoid any adverse effects on human health and the environment that might arise from the authorisation of a particular product.

<a name="10201w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Greenway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what the annual cost is of giving mandatory rate relief at 50 per cent. to voluntary sports clubs in England;  [147887]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many voluntary sports clubs in England during 1998-99 received discretionary rate relief; and at what level;  [147888]

(3) how many voluntary sports clubs in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Scotland, <i>(c)</i> Wales and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland are listed with the relevant agency responsible for the collection of rateable values;  [147890]
<P>
(4) how many sports clubs in England will benefit from the mandatory rate relief and discretionary relief proposals published in the Green Paper on the Local Government Finance Bill;  [147894]
<P>
(5) how many voluntary clubs in England have a rateable value of under <i>(a)</i> &#163;3,000 and <i>(b)</i> &#163;8,000.  [147895]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2001]:</i> The rating lists do not record the use of property as a voluntary sports club as distinct from other sports clubs, so the information is not available in the form requested. The rating lists for England include around 16,000 sports properties, including those used by voluntary clubs as well as professional and commercial sports bodies. The equivalent information requested regarding Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland relates to a devolved matter and as such is for the relevant devolved administration to provide.
<P>

<a name="10201w02.html_para8">Of the 16,000 sports properties in England, around 7,500 have rateable values of under &#163;3,000 and a further 4,000 have rateable values above &#163;3,000 and below &#163;8,000.
<P>

<a name="10201w02.html_para9">Under the proposals in our Green Paper "Modernising Local Government Finance", mandatory rate relief would be available to all small businesses and non-profit making bodies in England. All 11,500 sports properties with rateable values below &#163;8,000 would be eligible for the relief, the amount depending on their size. 7,500 sports properties with rateable values below &#163;3,000 would be eligible for 50 per cent. mandatory relief. 3,000 properties with rateable values between &#163;3,000 and &#163;6,000 would be eligible for mandatory relief between 50 per cent. and 20 per cent. 1,000 properties with rateable values between &#163;6,000 and &#163;8,000 would be eligible for mandatory relief of less than 20 per cent., tapering to no mandatory relief above &#163;8,000. Mandatory relief would be available to all non-profit making sports clubs, as well as commercial or professional clubs that met other tests of being a small business, as proposed in the Green Paper. We are currently considering responses to the Green Paper and will announce the final details of the proposed scheme in a White Paper later this year.
<P>

<a name="10201w02.html_para10">All non-profit making sports clubs are currently eligible for 100 per cent. discretionary relief and would continue to be so under the Green Paper proposals, both to top up any mandatory relief and for those clubs over the size threshold for mandatory relief. Information on the number of voluntary sports clubs eligible for discretionary relief is not held centrally.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2001 : Column: 257W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10201w02.html_para11">To give 50 per cent. mandatory relief to all 16,000 sports properties in England would cost around &#163;35 million in 2000-01. This includes commercial and professional bodies as well as voluntary clubs, as information on voluntary clubs is not available separately. This figure does not take account of any discretionary relief which is already given to non-profit making sports clubs, nor of any transitional or other reliefs which may apply to any of these properties.
<P>

<a name="10201w02.html_para12">English local authorities estimate the total cost of discretionary rate relief to all non-profit making bodies at &#163;24.5 million in 2000-01. This includes relief for non-profit making sports clubs as well as other philanthropic, educational, social, scientific, literary or fine arts bodies, excluding those which are charities. Information on how much of this was for voluntary sports clubs and the level of relief given to each club is not recorded centrally. Information is not readily available for 1998-99.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2001]:</i> We will publish the Regulatory Impact Assessment of the proposals for rate relief for small businesses and other non-profit making bodies including sports clubs in due course. If the relief were to apply to all non-profit making bodies within certain rateable value thresholds, as we currently propose, we would expect the additional burden on clubs in making an application to be minimal, and no more than is currently involved in apply for discretionary rate relief.

 We are today letting a contract to a consortium led by the University of Brighton to establish the facts about participation.

<a name="10201w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The necessary Regulations (Statutory Instrument SI 2000 No. 3224--The Road Vehicles (Authorised Weight) (Amendment) Regulations 2000)--will come into force on 1 February. The regulations will allow certain types of lorry to operate at up to 44-tonnes maximum weight in Great Britain. The lorries in question must have six axles, a maximum axle weight of 10.5 tonnes and Euro 2 low emission engines. These vehicles will result in a considerable saving in lorry miles where heavy goods are being carried and will be no bigger, and cause less road wear, than existing 40-tonne, 5 axle lorries.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2001]:</i> Our latest best estimates for the amounts spent on individual training by the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army and RAF in the last 12 months are respectively: &#163;233 million, &#163;39 million, &#163;422 million and &#163;446 million. These figures

<P><I>1 Feb 2001 : Column: 262W</I><P>
are approximate and exclude the costs of front-line collective training which are difficult to separate from normal day-to-day operations.
<P>

<a name="10201w03.html_para2">Of the figures above, &#163;869 million was spent by the Services' Training Agencies. It is estimated that just over 1 per cent. of this sum was spent in Scotland. The balance of &#163;291 million, which represents the cost of training conducted outside the Services' Training Agencies, is not broken down on a regional basis, and figures could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 United Kingdom armed forces have used depleted uranium (DU) rounds in conflict only during Operation Granby in the Gulf in 1991. The Ministry of Defence's assessment is that UK tanks used fewer than one hundred 120 mm rounds against Iraq's military forces during hostilities (this equates to less than one metric tonne of DU).

 It would be inappropriate to disclose information about my Department's estimated financial liability while claims for compensation remain to be settled. I am withholding the information requested under exemption 4 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. However, I can say that 15 claims for compensation have been received from members of HM forces who contracted malaria as a result of deployment to Sierra Leone. In only one of these cases does my Department accept that the claim is valid.

<a name="10201w05.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary gave approval for the rank of chief superintendent to be reintroduced at the earliest legislative opportunity following consultation with police service interests and on the recommendation of the Police Advisory Board (PAB). The PAB view was that the abolition of the rank from 1 April 1995 had led to operational and management difficulties.

(3) if he will ensure that the guidelines attached to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 stipulate that the Secretary of State will not license procedures likely to cause severe pain or distress that cannot be alleviated; and if he will make a statement.  [148107]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The reply I gave the hon. Member on 8 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 253W, fully explained the criteria for placing scientific procedures on animals in the category of "substantial severity". That reply also made it clear that, for each licence application, the likely severity of the effects of a proposed procedure on the animals concerned are weighed against the benefits likely to accrue in medical research or other developments.
<P>

<a name="10201w05.html_para2">This is an area of research where, rightly, enormous care is taken in granting licences. This means that licences can allow protected animals to suffer substantially severe effects only in the relatively few cases where it appears justified by the significant medical, pharmaceutical and other research gains to be made (66 of the 3,481 project licences in force at the end of 1999 had substantial severity conditions). Even then, as I made clear in the earlier reply, licence holders are required to minimise pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, and to approach the prescribed severity limit only when absolutely necessary.
<P>

<a name="10201w05.html_para3">The species of animals to be used may be a factor in determining severity limits, given the criteria for defining the categories and the known varying degrees of sentience between species. However, the judgment on severity limits is exercised with respect to the suffering to be encountered by a protected animal, rather than the species by itself.
<P>

<a name="10201w05.html_para4">The Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, presented to Parliament in March 2000, states that the Secretary of State will not license any procedure likely to cause severe pain or distress which cannot be alleviated. This accords with section 10(2A) of the Act, which in turn refers to Council Directive No. 86/609/EEC, regarding use of anaesthesia and analgesics. As a further safeguard, all project licences contain a standard condition (number 6) requiring that only the minimum justifiable animal suffering is caused and personal licences all bear a standard condition (number 14) requiring the prompt and humane destruction of an animal that is in severe pain or distress that cannot be alleviated. In addition, Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectors have the power to require the prompt and humane killing of any protected animal they consider to be suffering excessively or unnecessarily.
<P>

<a name="10201w05.html_para5">There are no current plans to exclude major surgery and xenotransplantation from the substantial severity category. Each application for a licence to undertake such procedures will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis.

 There has been no deduction made from the budget of Northumberland county council: its Education SSA will rise by &#163;4.75 million to &#163;139.66 million, an increase of some 3.75 per cent. for 2001-02. From 2000-01 to 2001-02 total funding for education in Northumberland increased by 5.69 per cent. We estimate that Northumberland's share of direct grant in 2001-02 will be &#163;5.09 million. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 29 January that he would be making available an extra &#163;52 million in grant to authorities with lower than average increases in their Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) in 2001-02, and who face pressures from the change of responsibility for adult education to the Learning and Skills Council from April. Northumberland local education authority's share of the additional grant will be &#163;1.35 million.
<P>

<a name="10201w06.html_para0">The &#163;142 million being allocated via the Learning and Skills Council means that all authorities have an increase of some 6 per cent. on what they are spending on Adult and Community Learning in 2000-01. For Northumberland, with current spend of &#163;92,000, the provisional Learning and Skills Council allocation for 2001-02 is &#163;98,000.

<a name="10201w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2001]:</i> Undergraduates taking their first degree course are expected to make a contribution towards their higher education only if they can afford to do so. From 2001-02, we expect around 50 per cent. of students to make no contribution to tuition fees, as a result of the rise in the income threshold. Over 85 per cent. of mature students do not pay fees. No student pays the full amount of tuition as the maximum fee set amounts to 28 per cent. of the average cost of an undergraduate course.

<a name="10201w06.html_para2">In 1998-99, the latest year for which data are available, there were 241,000 English and Welsh higher education students liable for fees under the Education (Student Support) Regulations. Of these, 45 per cent. were exempt from making a contribution towards fees, 20 per cent. of students made a partial contribution, and only 35 per cent. were expected to make a full contribution towards fees. Of the 20 per cent. of students making a partial contribution, it is estimated some 58 per cent. paid &#163;500 or less and 42 per cent. paid more than &#163;500.

<a name="10201w08.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2001]:</i> Guidance on when an employer should stop paying tax credit payments is included in the booklet "WFTC/EG--An employer's guide to tax credits" which is routinely issued by the Inland Revenue to employers. Employers are normally required to pay tax credits until the date the Inland Revenue has told them to stop, unless the employee leaves the employment before that date. This applies provided the employer's payroll arrangements remain in the UK. The employer can stop paying tax credits to an employee as soon as there is a pay period in which no other payroll payments are due to that employee. The Inland Revenue then pays the employee direct for the rest of the award period.

<P>
<a name="10201w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Rebated gas oil, also known as red diesel, is liable for duty at the rate of 3.13 pence per litre and is used in excepted vehicles and as a heating and industrial fuel. Assuming the current level of use, raising the rate of duty on gas oil to that applying to <i>(a)</i> standard diesel and <i>(b)</i> ultra low sulphur diesel would raise additional revenues of &#163;3.5 billion and &#163;3.3 billion respectively. In practice, the additional revenue would be significantly less than this because a fifteenfold increase in the duty rate would reduce the demand for rebated gas oil.

 To ask the Solicitor-General what assessment he has made of the effect of changes in funding recently announced for the CPS on the morale of the service.  [146811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w09.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 As some Members of this House will know, the CPS has secured additional funding for next year of &#163;30.4 million from the new criminal justice reserve. This is in addition to the extra resources allocated to the CPS from the 2000 spending review announced last July. As a result, the CPS's budget next year will be 23 per cent. higher in real terms than now.
<P>

<a name="10201w09.html_para0">Through the CPS's consultation machinery and my own frequent visits to the areas, I know that news of the additional funds has been welcomed by staff. This is hardly surprising. A staff survey, published last May, showed that securing adequate funding and improving resource allocation were among the key development priorities staff identified to improve morale within the service. When the next survey is undertaken I have no doubt that it will show a significant improvement in morale.
<P>

<a name="10201w09.html_para1">With the new funding secured, the CPS has launched a national recruitment campaign for lawyers and intends to follow this with a similar campaign for caseworkers shortly.

 The relationship between the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions is one of superintendence and it is in the context of those arrangements that the accountability of the Crown Prosecution Service for individual case decisions is secured.
<P>

<a name="10201w09.html_para2">If the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant that there will not be a prosecution, the Code for Crown Prosecutors provides that that is normally the 



end of the matter. There are special reasons why a case might be re-started by the CPS, especially if it is serious: for example, where initially there was insufficient evidence to proceed but further significant evidence comes to light; or in rare cases where a decision not to prosecute was clearly wrong and ought not to stand. The CPS does not keep central records of re-instituted cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w09.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Public confidence in the criminal justice system is vital if the system is to operate effectively. The 2000 British Crime Survey sought to measure the existing level of public confidence so as to provide a base line against which to set targets for improvement. The survey produced disappointing results: although the majority of people are confident that the criminal justice system respects the rights of defendants, only a quarter are confident the system meets the needs of victims of crime.
<P>

<a name="10201w09.html_para3">The Government are committed to improving the level of service provided to victims and are confident that new legislation and new initiatives will do much to increase levels of victim satisfaction. These measures include provisions in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 to assist vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, the introduction of the Witness Service at all criminal courts, the introduction of victim personal statements and the CPS initiative to inform victims of decisions relating to their case.

 In March 1999, we commissioned independent researchers to monitor the effects of the Council Tax Benefit restrictions introduced in April 1998. The report has now been finalised. However, the data obtained for this project proved to be of variable quality and therefore the findings are not generally reliable. Copies of the report will be placed in the Library in February and will be available on request.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w10.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Child Support Agency may close a child support case when asked to do so by the person who originally made the application, provided that the parent with care is not in receipt of Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.
<P>

<a name="10201w10.html_para2">The new child support scheme will start first for new cases from April 2002. Existing cases will be transferred at a later date once we are sure that the new scheme is working well and changes in the levels of assessment will be phased in.
<P>

<a name="10201w10.html_para3">If an existing case is closed before conversion to the new scheme, any fresh application made within 13 weeks will lead to an old scheme maintenance assessment, followed by conversion to the new scheme on the same date as other existing assessments. It would not be right for existing clients to be able to manipulate the rules for their own advantage by going off the books for short periods.

<a name="10201w10.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Commission's proposal would progressively reduce duties on imports of sugar from the least developed countries and the principle of access for LDC's is one which the Government support (which, depending on the volume of imports the LDCs were able to supply, could require the EU to respond by taking action to reduce existing cane or beet supplies.) However, the proposal also contains a safeguard clause to guard against any large-scale disruptive increase in imports. We are pressing for the implications of the LDC proposal to be fully examined in the context of current discussions on the future shape of the EU sugar regime.

<P>
<a name="10201w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Government and industry are working in a number of ways to promote improved levels of co-operation and working together in the food chain. For instance, some &#163;5 million of grant aid has been allocated to projects under the Agriculture Development Scheme and many of these are being taken forward by supply chain partnerships.

<a name="10201w11.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has asked the Director General of Fair Trading to seek the agreement of the major supermarkets to a binding Code of Practice that addresses the specific concerns identified by the Competition Commission in its recent report on the supply of groceries from multiple stores. Officials have been kept informed of progress on the drafting of the Code by the Office of Fair Trading and have maintained contact with the DTI. We have received a number of representations about the proposed Code from individual supermarket companies and representatives of suppliers.

 The England Rural Development Programme supports farm diversification through the &#163;152 million Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), Processing and Marketing Grants, the Vocational Training Scheme and tree-planting schemes. MAFF is producing a free guide on farm diversification and aims to make available free planning advice to RES applicants for farm diversification. The Rural White Paper contains a number of extra initiatives on planning to help diversification and we have consulted on providing time-limited rate relief for farmers wishing to diversify into non-farming activities.

 As part of the Red Tape reviews initiated in September 1999, we have examined those areas of concern identified by the industry and secured changes in EU provisions and also simplified our own procedures. On the former, we have successfully argued in Brussels that non-grower members should be able to become full members of Producer Organisation (PO) Boards; and for a fixed level of aid to be paid under the EU scheme, as requested by the UK industry. On the latter, improvements have been made to the forms and explanatory material, issued by this Department, for producer organisations.

 Local authorities' tenanted farms are important in providing a first rung on the farming ladder. Day-to-day management of these estates is the responsibility of individual smallholdings authorities.

<a name="10201w11.html_wqn12"><B> Paddy Ashdown: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what his estimate is of the total financial support for <i>(a)</i> United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> English agriculture (i) directly and (ii) indirectly in each year since 1990-91; and if he will make a statement.  [145954]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10201w11.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2001]:</i> Agricultural producers receive financial support in two ways: from consumers, as a result of the maintenance of market prices for some commodities at levels above those obtaining on world markets; and from taxpayers, in the form of direct receipts from the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="10201w11.html_para6">The value of producer support receipts from consumers can only be estimated and is dependent upon several assumptions, including the level of world prices which would have obtained in the absence of the CAP. An estimate by research analysis of the value of market support received by producers and direct producer receipts from the Exchequer for the year 1997-98 has been published in a Ministry report "Reducing Farm Subsidies; Economic Adjustment in Rural Areas", which can be found on the Ministry website.
<P>

<a name="10201w11.html_para7">Total support received by UK producers from both of these sources was estimated to be a little under &#163;6 billion in that year. A copy of the relevant table is to be found at Table 2. Some information concerning support receipts by English producers is also given.
<P>

<a name="10201w11.html_para8">Exchequer expenditure on UK agriculture for the years 1990-91 to 1999-2000 is also given. Expenditure peaked in 1996-97 as a result of the MacSharry reforms of the CAP--which shifted the burden of support from consumers to taxpayers--and the measures put in place in respect of BSE. Not all of these expenditures will have benefited farmers directly: for example, some expenditures relating to the cost of storing surplus produce are not a direct receipt by producers. Corresponding figures are not available in England.
