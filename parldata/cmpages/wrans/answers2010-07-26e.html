<i> [holding answer 21 July 2010]:</i> In 2004, the Big Lottery Fund gave an undertaking to direct between 60-70% of funding to the voluntary and community sector (VCS). This undertaking has since been increased to 80% of grants. This commitment reflects the view that the VCS is frequently best placed to make funding work for those communities and people most in need.</p>

Roll-out of broadband is first and foremost a matter for private sector investors. However, as stated in the Coalition's joint programme for Government, we will seek to introduce superfast broadband in remote areas at the same time as in more populated areas, and pilots will be held in three areas to test the roll-out of superfast broadband in rural areas.

As a result of the action we are taking, basic rate taxpayers will gain from the £1,000 rise in the personal allowance for income tax, and families will gain from increases of £150 and £60 above indexation per year to the child element of the child tax credit in the next two years respectively.

 We are conducting a counter-insurgency operation in Afghanistan, a key part of which is for troops to interact with the local population, some of which can only be carried out by patrolling on foot or in vehicles.

This will be a phased, gradual process and will be subject to careful assessment by commanders on the ground. It is only through close engagement and partnering with the Afghan authorities that we will be able to transfer responsibility for security to the Afghans to deliver a stable country in the long-term.</p>

There are six measures because there is no single best way of describing deprivation across large areas, such as local authority districts. This is due to the difficulties associated with describing or comparing places with different population sizes and patterns of deprivation. The six summary measures cover various different aspects of multiple deprivation so when considered together give a good overall impression of deprivation in the district. The six summary measures are; Average Score, Average Rank, Extent, Local Concentration, Income Scale, and Employment Scale. A description of what these indicators represent can be found in the Indices of Deprivation 2007 Report available from the Department website at:</p>

 Attrition is not a term which is formally defined in criminal justice statistics although in the past there has been one in common usage which relates to the ratio of convictions to offences recorded. In terms of police recorded crime, to achieve such an 'attrition' measure would require using two data sources which are not directly comparable.

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2010]:</i> An entry clearance manager will normally only be asked to review a decision to refuse a visit visa application following representations from hon. Members if there are exceptional or compelling compassionate circumstances involved, or if the decision is clearly flawed. Applicants who intended to visit family in the UK can achieve a review of the decision by exercising their right of appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="100726w0002.htm_para28"><a name="10072635000109">Their grounds of appeal, and any additional supporting documentation submitted, will be taken fully into account. The way forward for other visit visa applicants would be to re-apply, ensuring that they address the concerns about their previous application when doing so.</p>

 Decisions about who is a victim of trafficking are made by trained specialists in designated 'Competent Authorities'. A Competent Authority will take into account multiple factors when considering whether an individual meets the definition of trafficking given in the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. There is no prescribed list of factors that must be present before trafficking can be recognised, but the detailed training and guidance used by Competent Authorities and frontline staff includes a range of indicators drawn from international best practice. These indicators include being deceived about the nature of the job, location or employer, violence or threats of violence against victim, confiscation of a passport, debt bondage, isolation, confinement or surveillance, forced tasks and excessive working hours.</p>

 Where an individual has been granted indefinite leave to remain as the spouse of a British citizen, and is subsequently alleged to have been violent towards his or her spouse, this is not in itself grounds for revoking that indefinite leave. However, if deception was used in obtaining indefinite leave to remain as the spouse of a British citizen, section 10(1)(b) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which provides for the removal from UK of a person using deception, is relevant. This allows for leave to be revoked and removal pursued. If the person has been criminally convicted of violence, he or she may have their leave revoked and be subject to deportation.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 June 2010]:</i> The £545 million set out in the 2009 Policing White Paper included £100 million intended for delivery in 2010-11. Savings were to be achieved through national frameworks for procurement, converging IT, reductions in overtime and streamlining support services. I have reduced this year's core Government funding to the police by a total of £125 million. It is for chief constables to use their expertise and decide what makes most sense for their force, including taking account of the £100 million opportunities, but I am quite clear that the £125 million saving can be achieved by driving out wasteful spending on support functions, reducing bureaucracy and increasing efficiency in key functions, leaving the frontline of policing strong and secure. I expect forces to be held to this by both police authorities and Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary.</p>

 Where a person has limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as a spouse or partner, and the marriage or relationship breaks down, there is discretionary provision in paragraph 323 of the Immigration Rules to curtail that person's leave.

If a non-British citizen is convicted of a criminal offence carrying a custodial sentence of 12 months or more, he is liable to deportation from the UK.

 The House of Commons and House of Lords jointly have conducted public sector procurement exercises for Select Committee and Private Bill Committee transcription services periodically in the last decade. (Public Bill Committees have always been transcribed directly by the <i> Official Report</i> (<i> Hansard</i>).) Competitions for contracts beginning in 2002 and 2007 were won by W B Gurney's, a private firm which has carried out this work for a very long period. A review of the requirement for future transcription services was carried out in 2007, taking into account the increasing need for value for money, developments in technology, and the need to maximise the utilisation of the House's existing transcription expertise following reorganisation of the House administration. Those consulted by the review team included a range of other users of transcription services. The review recommended that future contracts should be managed by the <i> Official Reports</i> in the two Houses, so as to make better use of the Houses' existing professional expertise, and should build in greater business resilience by including the possibility of awarding work to more than one company. The present contract, subject to the possibility of renewal for up to two years, expires on 31 July 2010 and the competition for the new contract was launched on 23 September 2009. The tenders and award under the competition have followed the process set down by the Public Contracts Regulations 2006, SI 2006 No.5, which, as a Contracting Authority (as defined in the Regulations) both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are bound to follow. The competition has been conducted by a panel comprising senior officials of the Committee Offices and the Editors of the <i> Official Reports</i> of both Houses, advised and supported by the House's Commercial Services Directorate, acting on behalf of the Corporate Officers of both Houses. It is the Corporate Officers who have the legal capacity to enter into contracts of this nature on behalf of the House each serves. The House of Commons Commission itself has no direct involvement in procurement exercises of this nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="100726w0003.htm_para1"><a name="10072637000017">Following the competition, contracts for externally transcribed Committee sessions are being awarded to three companies: Ubiqus, Merrill Legal and Marten Walsh Cherer. The criteria governing the competition were set out in the procurement documentation, and included quality of work, reliability and value for money. The contract assessment process has paid full attention to the requirement for quality, with tenderers required to demonstrate their capacity to deliver the services required, including through sample transcripts of other work undertaken, a real-time practical exercise, and evidence of other work carried out by the companies.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 July 2010">

<notus-date day="26" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>26 July 2010 : Column 662W</b><br>
Separate contractual requirements are not specified for each element of the process, since the objective is to govern the quality of the end product, not the means by which it is achieved. There was thus no requirement for example to consider the specific language skills of the individual staff of potential providers, though the capacity of a tendering company to submit transcripts to a required standard of English was assessed by the process indicated above. Equally, tenderers were not required to commit to specific methods of transcription; there was thus no requirement for the process to assess the quality and accuracy of transcription services using specific methods carried out for other specific users, such as court services (although the Departments of the <i> Official Report</i> in both Houses, under the direction of their Editors, keep abreast of professional developments in their field). In practice, as at present, while there will always be a transcriber present in the committee room, some of the transcription work will be via verbatim note-takers, with the remainder via loggers using recordings, though the balance between different methods may differ from the present arrangements. The <i> Official Report</i> will continue to provide transcription services for up to 20% of select committee meetings using sub-editors to log meetings, as it has been doing satisfactorily for the past two years. As part of their normal contracted duties, Westminster Sound Systems will ensure that back-up recordings are made of every meeting; in addition, all note-takers and loggers will be required to make their own back-up recordings using mobile digital recording technology. As a further assurance measure all transcripts will be quality checked by the <i> Official Report</i>, with no extra delay in the turnaround time, before they are passed to committees. The <i> Official Report</i> will be managing the contracts with outside providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="100726w0003.htm_para2"><a name="10072637000018">The new arrangements will create very substantial direct savings for both Houses, as well as making more efficient use of existing <i> Hansard</i> resources. Obtaining best value for money in the use of public resources has been an important part of the process. The House of Commons 2010-11 Corporate Business Plan identified 'increased and demonstrable value for money' in services as a strategic objective for the House service. The Commission has agreed a commitment to reduce the Commons Administration budget by 9% over the period 2010-11 to 2012-13.</p>

 It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Members of the diplomatic service pay UK tax wherever they work and are entitled to have their children educated at public expense. Most parents prefer to take their children with them on posting, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK where staff choose this, or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>

The Bill would amend Schedule 2 of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 and provide that a Boundary Commission may take into account, if and to such extent as they think fit, special geographical considerations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency.

This will take some extra time, although precisely how much is difficult to predict as it would depend on how many candidates won outright on the first round, and how many further rounds of counting were necessary to determine the winner. As now, voter turnout, the total number of votes cast and any re-counting of votes will also impact upon the length and cost of the count. We have not yet made a detailed estimate of the cost that would result from different combinations of turnout, voting patterns and rounds of counting.</p>

 Based on the information set out in the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers' Charges) Order 2010, the estimated cost of the conduct of the UK parliamentary election in Great Britain which was held under the first past the post system on 6 May is £82.1 million. This figure takes into account the reduced costs of holding the UK parliamentary election on the same day as local government elections. The estimated cost of the 2010 UK parliamentary election in Northern Ireland was £2.5 million. The overall figures will be finalised once all claims from acting returning officers in Great Britain and the chief electoral officer for Northern Ireland (who are statutorily responsible for running the poll) have been received and finalised.

 The Government have no plans to restrict the franchise for referendums in general so that only British citizens are eligible to vote. Although the legal requirements for referendums are set out in the Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000, the question of who is entitled to vote in any particular referendum will be considered and determined in the light of the subject matter of that referendum. The franchise for the referendum on the Alternative Vote system is set out in the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, which the Government published on Thursday 22 July. Anyone who is entitled to vote in Westminster parliamentary elections will be entitled to vote in the referendum-this means that British, Republic of Ireland and qualifying Commonwealth citizens who are aged over 18 and who are registered to vote in parliamentary elections can vote in the referendum. In addition, those members of the House of Lords who are eligible to vote in local or European parliamentary elections will be eligible to vote in this referendum.</p>

 Unless domestic practices are stimulating international trade, the convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) does not restrict such activities. Nevertheless, whereas CITES does not prohibit the domestic "farming" of captive-bred specimens of appendix I species-such as Asiatic black bears-it does regard them as being included in appendix II of the convention and thus requiring appropriate certification if the animals, or products from them, are to be subject to international trade.

 British Waterways is not able to refund license or mooring fees.

 The following amounts were spent on electricity, heating (gas, oil and Whitehall district heating system) since 2002-03 and on water since 2004-05. Information is not held prior to those dates. In addition, availability of historic telephone services expenditure varies from body to body according to their archiving strategy. Those data are therefore incomplete. These data cover the core Department, its executive agencies, and its two largest NDPBs, the Environment Agency and Natural England; information for all NDPBs could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Officials from the Marine Management Organisation are working very hard to secure additional North sea sole quota for the under 10 metre fleet. I have also asked representatives from across industry to consider possible options for immediate-term relief. If these prove successful, I hope that a limited reopening of the fishery may be possible in the near future. At this stage, I foresee little prospect of being able to reopen the skate fishery, where uptake has been consistent with previous years, and closure of the fishery occurred later than in 2009. I am committed to delivering the long-term reform of the inshore fleet that is clearly necessary to prevent a recurrence of the difficulties that it currently faces and to ensure its future sustainability. It is my intention that a public consultation on proposals for such reform will be launched in the latter part of this year.</p>

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br>

<sup>(3)</sup> Confidence intervals (CIs) are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.<br>

For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to 5:<br>
'0' means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments;<br>
'1' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards;<br>

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Five year averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and experimental ward population estimates based on the 2001 Census. The ward names and boundaries used are 2001 Census Standard Table wards.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Confidence intervals (CIs) are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> The presence of medical and care communal establishments, such as nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to 5:<br>
'0' means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments;<br>
'1' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards;<br>
'5' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the highest fifth of all wards.<br>

In the 2008 pre-Budget report, Ofgem were asked to produce a quarterly update on the link between wholesale and retail energy prices precisely in order to increase levels of pricing transparency. The latest report showed the major suppliers have cut their prices in response to falling wholesale prices and that margins were lower than in the previous quarter. Ofgem has said that if suppliers stopped competing on price or domestic prices did not respond to a sustained fall in wholesale prices, it would look closely at the market.</p>

 The overall remuneration for civil servants working within the Department is published as an annex in the Resource Accounts.

 In 1998 the Department entered into a 20 year PFI contract for the provision of fully serviced accommodation for which the Department pays an all inclusive unitary charge. Security is one of the services provided but the cost of it cannot be disaggregated from the unitary charge.</p>

 No single source of information provides a count of the total number of people that have died each year from an occupational illness. For some causes of death, occupational cases are clinically indistinguishable from those due to other factors. For these causes numbers have to be estimated rather than counted, and year-on-year figures are not available.</p>

This estimate includes deaths from the asbestos related cancer mesothelioma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_670"><a name="100726w0007.htm_para50"><a name="10072718001507">Using other international research, it is also estimated that there are currently approximately 4,000 deaths in Great Britain each year from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to past occupational exposures to dusts, gases, vapours and fumes. Again, it is likely that a similar number would have occurred in each of the other years from 1997.</p>

An analysis of these accounts suggests that the difference in levels of expenditure year on year was caused by this accumulation. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency estimates the current spend on the initial stationery definition at between £275,000 and £325,000. To extract this data in the required format would involve interrogating numerous line items within these accounts and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 None. There are no plans to make the wearing of helmets compulsory for quad bikes but we continue to keep the position under review.

The main change in funding that an academy would see is a grant to cover the cost of local authority central services that the academy will now be responsible for funding itself. These amounts are based on data from statutory financial statements, published by every local authority, which are thoroughly checked by the Department for inconsistencies and anomalies. Local authorities are given the opportunity to review and confirm the accuracy of the figures they provide.</p>

 The Department in 2006 commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake an independent evaluation of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. This runs for a total of six years to support the longitudinal evaluation of the impact of investment in school buildings on educational achievement.

This echoes the finding of the National Audit Office in its 2009 report "The Building Schools for the Future Programme" which highlighted how the programme had initially over-optimistic expectations on delivery; how estimates of the overall cost of the programme have increased substantially; and how the cost of setting up local education partnerships has been too high for the first authorities.</p>

 The Department does not allocate money to schools specifically for cricket. Cricket taught as part of the national curriculum will be funded through schools' core funding. Over the last five years, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has allocated £1.5 million to the ECB to develop and improve links between schools and local cricket clubs as part of the school-club links programme.

 The incubation period for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is unknown and may vary due to factors such as route of transmission and genotype of patient. For the majority of cases where consumption of meat or meat products is presumed to be the route of infection the minimum incubation period is likely to be five years, with a mean period of around 10-12 years and the maximum, as in other human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, may extend over decades. Of the three clinical cases of vCJD presumed to be associated with blood transfusion the incubation periods are estimated to be between six and nine years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_778"><a name="100726w0009.htm_para20"><a name="10072719000895">Under the proposed model not all GPs have to be actively involved in every aspect of commissioning. Their predominant focus will continue to be on providing high-quality primary care to their patients. It is likely to be a smaller group of primary care practitioners who will lead the consortium and play an active role in the clinical design of local services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_779"><a name="100726w0009.htm_para21"><a name="10072719000896">GP consortia will have the freedom to decide what commissioning activities they undertake for themselves and for what activities (such as demographic analysis, contract negotiation, performance monitoring and aspects of financial management) they may choose to buy in support from external organisations, including local authorities, private and voluntary sector bodies.</p>

A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<sup>(<i> 2</i>)</sup><i>  Cause code</i><br>
A supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in HES. Codes in italics are those used to define assault.<br>
<i> Knife wound:</i><br>
W26 Contact with knife, sword or dagger<br>
X78 Intentional self-harm by sharp object<br>
X99 Assault by sharp object<br>
Y28 Contact with sharp object, undetermined intent<br>
The above four codes identifies 'any' sharp object, and therefore includes (but is not limited to) knife.<br>
<i> Gunshot wounds:</i><br>
W32 Handgun discharge<br>
W33 Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
W34 Discharge from other and unspecified firearms<br>

<sup>(<i> 3</i>)</sup><i>  SHA/PCT of residence</i><br>
The strategic health authority (SHA) or primary care trust (PCT) containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br>
<sup>(<i> 4</i>)</sup><i>  Provisional data</i><br>
The data is provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than those generated for the same period in the final dataset. It is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been investigated and corrected.<br>
<sup>(<i> 5</i>)</sup><i>  NHS Re-organisation</i><br>
In July 2006, the NHS reorganised strategic health authorities (SHA) and primary care trusts (PCT) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result, data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. We mapped the current London SHA to the following SHAs prior to 2006-07: North Central London, North East London, North West London, South East London and South West London. Lambeth PCT remained the same during the PCT changes.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Small numbers</i><br>
To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been replaced with "*" (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total, an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced.<br>
<i> Activity included</i><br>
Activity in English NHS hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector<br>

 It is for local commissioners, currently primary care trusts, to determine how best to meet the health needs of their local population. In respect of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other fertility treatments and services, there are no plans to move away from local determination in the future.</p>

The NICE fertility guidelines recommend that women aged between 23 and 39, if they fulfil the criteria, should be offered three cycles of IVF treatment funded by the NHS. NICE has just commenced a review of these guidelines and it is intended that the review will be completed in October 2012.</p>

 We believe there is a need for both patients and clinicians to be able to access patient records in an electronic form. This is part of our thinking about making information transparent and available, while involving patients in decisions about their health care. The experience in Scotland, which has had an electronic summary similar to the summary care record (SCR) operating for a number of years, shows the continuing benefits it provides to patients receiving emergency and out-of-hours care.</p>

 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has recently completed a review of high cost credit products, including pawnbroking, payday loans and home collected credit. As part of this review, the OFT considered the possible introduction of price controls for high-cost credit. The review concluded that price controls would not be a suitable solution to the concerns that the OFT identified in the sector.</p>

 As part of the Government's drive to enhance the UK's representation and voice in the EU institutions, work is underway to develop a more strategic approach to the use of secondments of UK civil servants to posts in the EU institutions, where UK experience and insight can add real value. We aim to ensure that these secondments are joined up across Government and appropriately targeted so that our good people are sent to strategically important positions. Short-term secondees from Government to the EU are an important source of immediate advice, and of long-term EU expertise back in Whitehall. Departments will look to help staff prepare for secondments, keep in touch while they are away and fully use their skills and experience when they get back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_855"><a name="100726w0010.htm_para8"><a name="10072719001369">Supporting secondments is a valuable investment that can pay dividends, so it is important to ensure that UK secondees are placed in positions that matter in terms of UK priorities. Where opportunities become available in UK priority areas, then consideration will be given to providing a UK secondee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_856"><a name="100726w0010.htm_para9"><a name="10072719001370">BIS usually has between six and 10 secondees in the institutions at any one time. Our centrally managed EU secondment programme focuses on BIS priority areas and sending the best candidates as opposed to the total number of secondees. Another consideration is that EU secondments vary in cost according the grade of the secondee, length of secondment and whether the institutions provide living allowances.</p>

 It is assumed that the 'administrators' report' refers to the statutory disqualification return filed under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 by the administrators.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State on the conduct of the directors. This is a statutory obligation in every company and the fact that an insolvency practitioner submits a report on a company's director(s) does not necessarily mean that misconduct is alleged. However if misconduct is alleged, the Insolvency Service, on behalf of my right hon.

 The Department has several bilateral education programmes with countries such as China and India and a multilateral programme involving a variety of countries.

The programmes are funded until March 2011. Decisions on future funding will be taken in the spending review.

Against the backdrop of this demographic change, the Government want to help and encourage people to work for longer in all sectors and to remove any unnecessary barriers to them doing so. It is the Government's view that older workers bring with them a wealth of talent and experience as employees and entrepreneurs.
