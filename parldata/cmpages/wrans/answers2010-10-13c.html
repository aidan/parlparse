 The Ministry of Justice has not undertaken any specific research, or evaluated any specific treatment of people who are on the autistic spectrum in the criminal justice system. However, offenders are known to have a higher level of needs across a wide range of conditions than the general population, and recently, the department has undertaken a survey of offenders in custody, and started a survey of offenders in the community, each including a range of emotional and other wellbeing questions. A report on the survey of offenders in custody will be published as part of a Reoffending Statistics Compendium on 4 November 2010. We are committed to working closely with our partners in the Department of Health and other departments to make sure offenders have access to appropriate treatment.</p>

The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains. The ODA is unable to release the value of individual contracts at this time as this is commercially sensitive information. These figures represent the committed spend to date, rather than the end contract value, as in many cases this will not yet be known.</p>

 Rules governing the importation of products of animal origin (POAO), including food products, are laid down in EU legislation. Imported food products must come from an approved establishment in an approved third country and be accompanied by appropriate animal and public health certification, which includes a guarantee that the products come from healthy animals. All consignments are checked on entry to ensure that they meet EU import conditions. These checks may include analysis for microbiological contaminants.</p>

All operational frontline UKBA staff are employed as multifunctional anti-smuggling staff with a responsibility to tackle a range of risks at the border, including illegal imports of POAO. Enforcement staff are deployed on a mobile and flexible basis and, at major ports and airports, are supported by the use of detector dogs specifically trained to detect POAO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="101013w0001.htm_para14"><a name="10101332000261">Surveillance for TB in pigs is based on routine post mortem meat inspection in abattoirs. In addition, TB in non-bovine species is a notifiable disease under the Tuberculosis (England) Order 2007. Under the order, carcases of pigs (and any other farmed animal or pet) with, or suspected of being affected with tuberculosis, are notifiable to Animal Health. When TB is suspected, Animal Health can impose movement restrictions on herds to reduce the risk of spread of infection out of the herd. We work with the herd owner to agree appropriate surveillance regimes for their particular enterprise aimed at lifting the restrictions at the earliest opportunity and in the most cost effective manner. Occasionally this can involve a test and slaughter (of TB test positive animals) approach, while at other times Animal Health vets rely on routine meat inspection information.</p>

 The Government's proposals treat people registered to vote in more than one constituency in the same way as existing legislation. It has been a longstanding feature of the electoral register that some people are legitimately registered in two places. Although in some circumstances a person may legitimately appear on two or more electoral registers, it is an offence, subject to a fine of up to Â£5,000, to vote more than once at an election for the same body. Therefore a person cannot vote twice in a UK General election or European Parliamentary election, but can do so in different local elections where they are validly registered.</p>

This offers applicants both choice and certainty on the specific date and time of their interview and is particularly useful for those who may need to travel some distance and who want to plan their journey. In those cases, where possible, applicants will be offered appointment slots to fit with their travel plans.

3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single-year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
2. Benefits are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the uppermost benefit which they receive. Thus a person who is a lone parent and receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified as 'Incapacity benefits', whereas someone receiving both Bereavement Benefit and Disability Living Allowance would be classified as 'Disabled'. For this reason the group 'Lone Parent', for example, will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the 'Employment and Support Allowance and incapacity benefits' group instead:<br>
Job Seeker-Claimant of Job Seekers Allowance<br>
Incapacity Benefits-Claimant of either Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance<br>
Lone Parent-Claimant of Income Support with a child under 16 and no partner<br>
Carer-Claimant of Carer's Allowance<br>
Others on Income related benefit-Other Income Support claimants (including IS disability premiums) or Pension Credit claimant<br>
Disabled-Claimant of either Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance or Industrial Injuries Benefits<br>
Bereaved-Claimant of either Widow's Benefit, Bereavement Benefit or Industrial Death Benefit<br>
3. Lone Parent Obligations were introduced from 24 November 2008 affecting the age of the youngest child. Further details are provided here:<br>

 The Government have looked into policy on the British Indian Ocean Territory and have decided to defend the claims for resettlement and compensation which the Chagos Islanders have brought to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. This is because we believe the arguments against allowing resettlement on the grounds of feasibility and defence security are clear and compelling. Nor do we see the case for compensation as this has already been paid in full and final settlement of all claims. Both of these issues have already been decided by the UK courts.</p>

 The UK regularly raises human rights matters of concern with the Egyptian Government. Mr Arsal is one of over 10,000 prisoners in Egypt who is reported to be detained without a final sentence. In our view it is fairer and ultimately more effective, to address the common human rights concerns behind each of these cases, rather than to raise each case individually. For example, the UK supports the EU's â¬10 million project on the 'Support and Modernisation of Administration of Justice and Enhancement of Security' which is expected to reduce the backlog of cases in Egyptian courts. Given our overall approach, the Government currently have no plans to raise Mr Arsal's case with the Egyptian Government.</p>
