 On 21 May 2004, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued guidance to police officers and Crown prosecutors under section 37A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The guidance sets out the cases that must be referred to prosecutors for charging decisions and the circumstances in which a release on bail before charge may be appropriate in accordance with the amendments to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_0">In April 2005, further guidance was issued to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the police on the subject of granting pre-charge bail to obtain a charging decision from a Crown prosecutor. The guidance was formulated as a result of issues raised during the implementation of the statutory charging arrangements, and establishes a standardised approach to the operation of pre-charge bail.

 I have had several discussions on both these issues with Commissioner Mandelson since he took up office.

 The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)&#039;s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) produces two sets of reports that warn of imminent food crises in Africa. The Foodcrops and Shortages Report&quot; from February 2005 stated that the harvest in Niger was normal against the five year average, and did not require exceptional and/or emergency assistance. The Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects&quot; Report in April 2005 similarly omitted Niger from its list of countries facing food emergencies. Only in its June 2005 edition did the Foodcrops and Shortages Report&quot; recommend emergency assistance for Niger, and only in September 2005 did Niger feature on FAO/GIEWS&#039; list of countries facing food crises.

<a name="stpa_3">DFID attended the presentation of the World Food Programme (WFP)/FAO&#039;s initial Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) findings from the Sahel region in December 2004, where cereal production for the entire region was reported as average, in spite of drought and locusts, but where pockets of need were identified within all the Sahel countries. Based on the evidence, DFID judged that large scale food aid would not be required at that time.

<a name="stpa_4">DFID does not have any officials based in Niger. The London based humanitarian unit responsible for monitoring emerging crises in Africa had been monitoring the situation in the Sahel since the locust invasions of August 2004. In April 2005, the first incontrovertible evidence of a deteriorating situation was provided by Medecins Sans Frontieres. A full account of DFID&#039;s subsequent response is set out in my parliamentary written statement on the Niger food crisis made on 11 October 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 26&#150;27WS.

Following depopulation, the premises must be cleansed and disinfected to standards set by a DEFRA veterinarian and this may take several weeks for it to be completed. The premises must then remain empty of poultry for at least 21 days. We would then allow the premises to re-stock if there were no more outbreaks of the disease in the locality. Once restocked the poultry would be kept under close surveillance for a period of 21 days and subjected to clinical inspections during that period.

 On the 21 October the European Commission considered the encroaching avian influenza threat and, as a result, introduced a decision to ban bird markets, fairs and other gatherings of birds until the 31 January 2006, when the decision will be reviewed. This decision was implemented in England by the Avian Influenza (Preventive Measures) Regulations 2005 (2005 No. 2989). The ban will remain in place until the European law requiring it is lifted. We have worked with representatives of groups holding such events and assessed the risks. As a result, some gatherings may continue under licence and subject to biosecurity controls. We will consider any applications for a licence sympathetically and any which can be permitted to go ahead following a veterinary risk assessment will be licensed.

 In comparison to domestic chickens, feral pigeons are generally unsusceptible to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Experimental studies show that while pigeons can be infected with HPAI they do not appear to excrete the virus. This suggests that pigeons are unlikely to form a reservoir of infection of virus. However, the risk cannot be completely discounted and the public is encouraged to report any unusual die-off in pigeons or any other wild birds to the DEFRA helpline (08459 33 55 77) when further advice will be provided.

 Defra has issued no specific guidance to waste collection authorities about the charging of charity shops for the collection by waste collection authorities of unusable items donated by members of the public since the publication of the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992. Guidance to waste collection authorities in Schedule 2 to these regulations covers the types of household waste for which a charge for collection may be made. Where waste collection authorities do decide to charge they must only recover their costs of collection and these costs must be set at a level so that the authorities do not make a profit.

<p><a name="qn_52"><a name="51107w04.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list recipients of payment under common agricultural policy agri-environment and rural development schemes for the last two years including <i>(a)</i> size of payment, <i>(b)</i> date of payment, <i>(c)</i> name of scheme under which payment was made, <i>(d)</i> name of recipient, <i>(e)</i> postal address of recipient and <i>(f)</i> location of enterprise in respect of which the payment was made.

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51107w04.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) disclosed common agricultural policy (CAP) payment information on 22 March 2005, listing the names of CAP subsidy recipients and the amount paid to them in the last two years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_53">The information represented an annual aggregate figure for payments to each recipient under all of the schemes paid by RPA, including agri-environment and rural development schemes. The full list of schemes covered by the disclosure is set out in Annex A.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_54">RPA investigated the practicalities of providing further breakdown by scheme, including scheme type, date of payment and name of scheme under which payment was made. It was concluded that it was unreasonable to produce this data because it is held in detailed scheme records and to reconcile the scheme statistics against the monies paid at the aggregate customer level would be extremely resource intensive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_55">RPA published on its website in July 2005 a supplement to the CAP payments information giving details of payments by geographic location for the EAGGF (European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund) year 2003&#150;04. The regional analysis has been produced using the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) and NUTS levels one and two were used to provide this analysis. It was decided that a more detailed regional breakdown and the release of full postal addresses would not be appropriate. The general privacy arguments were examined in detail and it was concluded that the risks around privacy intrusion outweighed the limited additional public value of the additional postal address data.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_56">Further, the diversion of more resources from other priority work, in particular considering RPA&#039;s imperative to commencing Single Payment Scheme payments to farmers by February 2006, to produce additional geographical or scheme breakdown would be manifestly unreasonable. However RPA continues to examine detailed requests on a case by case basis.

<p><a name="qn_63"><a name="51107w05.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the possible existence in wild plants of the fireblight disease.  [23806]</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51107w05.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Fireblight, a bacterial plant disease, is well established throughout much of Europe and has been known to exist in the UK since the 1950s. It is a serious disease of apples, pears and related trees and shrubs in the family <i>Rosaceae</i>, sub family <i>Pomoideae</i>. The list of susceptible material includes several plants which commonly grow wild in England and Wales, including <i>Chaenomeles</i> (Flowering Quince), <i>Cotoneaster</i>, <i>Crataegus</i> (Hawthorn) and <i>Sorbus</i> (Mountain Ash).




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Nov 2005 : Column 24W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para1">
The first UK finding of fireblight was in Kent in 1957. It is now widespread in Wales, England and also parts of Scotland but absent from Northern Ireland. The disease can be spread by wind, rain, birds and pollinating insects, as well as on contaminated pruning tools and by the planting of infected plants which may or may not show symptoms. It is known to have spread in England along hawthorn hedges planted alongside railways, motorways and main roads. There are no pesticides currently available to treat the disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_58">Nurseries intending to move fireblight-host material have to be registered with DEFRA and must have at least two inspections per year in order to retain their ability to trade susceptible plants within the EU.


</p>







<p><a name="qn_64"><a name="51107w05.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place to ensure that exporters of fireblight-susceptible species of trees and shrubs do not use other species&#039; names on the necessary paperwork; and what assessment she has made of whether those who inspect the paperwork are capable of <i>(a)</i> differentiating and <i>(b)</i> identifying the species.  [23807]</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51107w05.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Exporters of plants and plant products to non EC countries must satisfy the plant health requirements of the importing country. In many cases importing countries require consignments to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the official services in the country of origin as evidence that those requirements have been met. In the case of fireblight-susceptible host plants, where requested by an exporter and if required by the importing country, DEFRA&#039;s Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) will undertake inspection of the material and, if it is found to comply with the conditions of import, will issue the necessary phytosanitary certificate. This would include details of the plant genera and species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_59">In relation to movements within the EU, growers of fireblight host material are required to register with DEFRA as producers of plant material requiring a plant passport and they also have to apply to DEFRA for authorisation to issue plant passports. An element of the authorisation process is to designate a technically experienced person who is responsible for passporting and associated plant health matters on the premises. In order to retain their authorisation producers must be inspected at least twice a year by the PHSI. One of these inspections will take place during the period of growth of the plants and the other at the time of despatch of material, including a check of records and documentation. If at any time a registered plant passporter is shown to be deliberately falsifying information or contravening the passporting regulations, his authorisation to issue plant passports may be withdrawn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_60">PHSI are normally graduates and invariably have a background or qualification in horticulture or agriculture. On appointment they receive a period of intensive training, which will include plant, pest and disease identification, familiarisation with the legislation under which they will operate, plant passporting and export certification arrangements etc. On completion of this formal training they shadow experienced Inspectors for a further period of field-based training, including 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Nov 2005 : Column 25W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
visits to plant passporting and/or exporting nurseries. Identification of fireblight hosts is included as part of this general training.

 The National Equine Database is being established jointly between Defra and the horse industry as it will help to meet Government objectives over passports and disease surveillance and the industry&#039;s own objectives to improve its prospects by enhancing breeding. Information about pedigree and performance can be commercially valuable and, although Defra will meet its share of future running costs, the industry will need to cover its costs. Our initial research did show that some basic information is available free from other sources, as it will be from NED. A recent study commissioned jointly with the industry indicated that the combination of the quality and accessibility of the information on the database will enable its costs to be recovered from fees.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51107w11.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael </b> 
<i>[holding answer 25 October 2005]:</i> Some of England&#039;s regional development agencies (RDAs) have commissioned sculptures and statues in their regions over the last five years as part of their wider efforts to regenerate deprived or run down areas, consistent with RDAs&#039; statutory purposes set out in the RDAs Act 1998. Making the places where people live and work more attractive, can stimulate increased business investment, and community cohesion. Works of art also play a part in making business paths more attractive and assisting with inward investment and in promoting tourism and interpretation of historic areas and landscapes. RDAs play an important role in such developments, often working in partnership with business, local government and other public and voluntary organisations in order to promote the region and its economy.

Several indirect measures of state support for CHP were introduced in 2001&#150;02. Of those that can be enumerated, climate change levy exemption on fuel inputs to good quality CHP and good quality CHP electricity outputs were valued at up to &#163;80 million per annum, while eligibility for enhanced capital allowances is worth in the region of 10m per annum to the industry. Capital grants for community energy programme schemes were introduced in 2002&#150;03 and the spend on schemes including CHP was: &#163;427,000 in 2002&#150;03, &#163;4,315,000 in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;4,896,000 in 2004&#150;05.<br>

 Variability, or volatility, is a normal part of the working of a well-functioning commodity market. Current UK wholesale spot gas prices are determined by the price of oil and the day-to-day balance between demand and supply in the UK gas market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w14.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_138">When the market is tight small changes in demand and supply will have a bigger impact on price volatility than if the market were over-supplied. The balance of demand and supply, and thus the volatility of prices, will depend on many external factors, including the weather and the availability of storage facilities or import infrastructure on a day-to-day basis. In view of the unpredictability of many of these factors it is not possible to make accurate estimates of future price volatility.

 The Government are firmly committed to tackling illegal migrant working. We have taken steps to strengthen the relevant legislation by reforming section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and by supporting my friend&#039;s initiative on gangmaster licensing. We are introducing new measures for a civil penalty regime and a tougher criminal offence for employers in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, currently before the House. Our strategy also involves increasing enforcement, encouraging compliance by business, and developing joint working between agencies responsible for enforcing workplace regulations. We have also increased removals of those in breach of immigration laws.

<sup>(24)</sup> Though the holding prisons were, at the end of the month in which the prisoners died, operating over their respective CNAs, this does not necessarily mean that the prisoners who died were accommodated in &#039;crowded&#039; conditions&#151;for example, one of two prisoners accommodated in a cell certified for one.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> One death in 2001 and one death in 2003 occurred in the custody of the Prison Escort and Custody Services. <br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent assessment he has made of the extent of drugs being <i>(a)</i> taken into prisons by (i) prisoners, (ii) visitors, (iii) governors, (iv) officers and (v) other staff and <i>(b)</i> thrown over prison walls; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="51107w20.html_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 There has been no such assessment. However, a recent internal review was carried out which looked at methods of entry of illegal drugs into prisons with a view to sharing good practice. Recommendations included giving greater priority to the use of intelligence, targeting the use of mobile phones by prisoners, increased intelligence-led searching, and a managed approach to disrupt the activities of prisoners engaged in drug trafficking.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) keeps under review the demand on prison places and the capacity of prisons to accommodate those prisoners sent to them by the courts. It is ensuring maximum use of all spare capacity within the prison estate, increasing useable operational capacity in prisons by building additional places as part of an ongoing funded building programme, and returning to use accommodation at existing prisons.

The Government have introduced credible, intensive community sentences, which courts can tailor to individual offenders who might have otherwise received ineffective short prison sentences. We have also alerted courts to the availability of electronic monitoring to support a curfew imposed as a condition of bail.

As reported in the HM Treasury Departmental Report 2005, the UK is making progress in boosting its productivity performance: between 1997 and 2001Q3, the UK trend rate of actual productivity growth on an output per worker basis (figures not adjusted for employment growth) is estimated to have grown by 2.5 per cent. a year compared with a growth rate of 2 per cent. a year in the previous economic cycle (1986Q2&#151;1997H1). Adjusting for the effect of employment growth, it is estimated that the underlying trend rate of productivity growth was 2.7 per cent. between 1997H1&#151;2001Q3 compared to 2.2 per cent. over the previous economic cycle (1986Q2&#151;1997H1).

<i>[holding answer 3 November 2005]:</i> Building Schools for the Future is our long-term strategic programme to transform facilities for secondary pupils over 15 years, subject to future public spending decisions. We have grouped investment in annual waves. Wave 1 projects were announced in 2003 and aim to sign contracts in the financial year 2005&#150;06. Wave 2 and 3 projects were announced in 2004 and aim to sign contracts in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 respectively. As the projects are large and involve many schools, building work can take several years after contract signature.

<a name="stpa_218">We plan to announce the next waves of investment after the coming comprehensive spending review, probably late in 2007. In the meantime, we have told each local authority when their schools may begin in the 15-year programme. On current plans, the Stroud and Cotswold area of Gloucestershire is not due to begin in the programme until waves 13 to 15, i.e. 2017 at the earliest.

<a name="stpa_219">This indicative planning information allows local authorities to look ahead strategically, discuss options with schools and communities and agree long-term education visions for schools and their buildings. By doing this, local areas will be well placed to make good use of other investment, as it becomes available, and to use the local flexibilities of the Single Capital Pot and prudential system. In this way, authorities should find that they will be able to achieve much on their critical paths to starting Building Schools for the Future.

Notes:<br>

1. Capital allocations to local authorities may differ, in a particular year, from local authority expenditure. This is due to timing differences and to decisions made locally. Figures for 2005&#150;06 are provisional.<br>

2. Revenue allocation figures, from 2003&#150;04, include the pensions transfer to Education Formula Spending and the Learning and Skills Council; the figures prior to 2003&#150;04 have not been adjusted. Total funding includes all revenue grants in the DfES budget relevant to pupils ages three to 19, and excludes Education Maintenance Allowances and grants not allocated at local authority level. Figures for the years 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

<i>[holding answer 3 November 2005]:</i> When a school is judged, by Ofsted, to be failing the local authority is under a duty to prepare, within 10 working days, an action plan to improve the school. There are then termly visits from Ofsted to monitor the implementation of the action plan and the school&#039;s progress. Since 1998 the number of failing schools has more than halved and the average time to turn round such a school has reduced from 24 to 21 months. The Schools White Paper published last month includes proposals to ensure that school failure is remedied even more quickly. In particular, we propose to extend the range of intervention powers available to authorities and to require them to consider the full range of their powers immediately on receipt of an adverse Ofsted inspection report on a school.

 In March 2005 the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced a &#163;115 million Boost for Modern Foreign Languages&quot;, providing support for language teaching and learning for this and the next two years.

<p>
<a name="51107w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">Part of that funding will support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11 to 18-year-olds, including alternative qualifications to traditional GCSEs and vocational options at key stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies and meet the needs of a wider range of pupils. We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications. We are also funding a range of projects and materials to promote languages and to develop innovative curricular models which will be show-cased to provide schools with delivery ideas and support. For example, we funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to produce &#039;Languages Work&#039;, a suite of materials designed to promote the value of language learning, support take up of languages beyond key stage 3, and how language skills can enhance future employability.

<p>
<a name="51107w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">Last September the new languages recognition scheme, the languages ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is available in eight languages. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. The scheme can provide motivation and recognition of achievement at key stage 3, thus encouraging take up at key stage 4. Finally, the scheme can support language learning at key stage 4 within a wide range of learning pathways, including vocational and work-related contexts.

<p><a name="st_298"><a name="51107w31.html_spnew4"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The LSC&#039;s core administration costs have fallen steadily from 4.6 per cent. of total funding in 2001&#150;02, to 2.5 per cent. of its planned total budget in 2005&#150;06. The LSC&#039;s administration budget for the next two years was set out in the Secretary of State&#039;s Grant Letter issued on 31 October 2005. This Grant Letter provides the LSC with just over &#163;252 million (2.4 per cent. of planned total budget) for 2006&#150;07 and just under &#163;240 million (2.2 per cent. of planned total budget) for 2007&#150;08 to cover its administration costs including the cost of capital and depreciation. This reflects efficiency savings already agreed. The overall administration budget will be reassessed when the results of the consultation on the LSC&#039;s Agenda for Change&quot;, particularly its restructuring, are finalised. At this stage further savings could be released to the sector.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether the Skills for Life courses at Entry Level 1 cover elements of the Skills for Life course at Entry Level 2.  [24979]</p>








<p><a name="st_319"><a name="51107w33.html_spnew6"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 All Skills for Life courses funded by the Learning and Skills Council for England are referenced to the National Standards for Literacy and Numeracy, which cover Entry Levels 1, 2 and 3 and Levels 1 and 2. This ensures that there is consistency in a learner&#039;s studies across the country, whatever their environment or situation. The standards are constructed to facilitate progression from one level to the next in order to promote high quality learning which naturally leads the learner through the levels and where each level sets the context for higher level work in the next. Entry Level 2 Skills for Life courses build on the work done at Entry Level 1 but broaden and raise the expected levels of achievement. For instance, in literacy the contexts are extended from forms, lists, messages, notes and records&quot; at Entry Level 1 to also include e-mails and simple narratives&quot; at Entry Level 2.

[24980]</p>








<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51107w33.html_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 From April 2001 to July 2005, a confirmed 1,130,000 adults have achieved a qualification in literacy, language or numeracy and have counted towards the Skills for Life Public Service Agreement (PSA) target. However, the Department currently only has detailed and complete information on Skills for Life achievements from April 2001 until July 2004. During that period approximately 865,000 learners achieved at least one Skills for Life qualification in literacy, language or numeracy and therefore counted once towards the Skills for Life PSA target. The total number 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Nov 2005 : Column 131W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of Skills for Life achievements of these learners was approximately 1,280,000 achievements, which is an average of 1.48 per learner. Therefore, a significant number of learners will have gained two or more achievements. The specific information requested is not readily available and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_458">The DCS has been developing and testing different disability living allowance (DLA) claim forms since September 2003, in order to address concerns from disabled people and their representative organisations about the difficulties they were experiencing in claiming disability benefits. This has culminated in a claim form for DLA adult working age customers, currently being tested in the areas serviced by the Disability Benefits Centres at Manchester and Bootle. The effectiveness of the claim for both customers and DCS will be evaluated fully before any decisions are made about the way forward.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_459">The establishment of the DCS as an Agency on 1st November 2004 marked an increased focus on understanding the needs of its customers through early proactive and open consultation with customer representative organisations. Consequently, the claim form currently being tested was subject to considerable consultation and input from a wide range of customer groups through the DCS Advisory Forum (formerly the Modern Service Working Group). The Forum provides the DCS&#039; main consultation mechanism through its membership of 14 national Voluntary and Community Sector officers, who represent customers with a wide range of disabilities. Some of the Forum members also sought input from additional organisations, whom they considered could offer valuable input.</p>

It is too early to judge the effect. However, this policy has been introduced to rationalise a contract portfolio of some several thousand contracts. It should provide better value for money in contract management terms, as well as offering contracts of a size that are a more commercially viable proposition for providers. It aims also to alleviate the burden for smaller providers by offering them the scope to work with other local partners rather than having to bid for separate small contracts.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the implementation of the Ley Reguladora de Actividades Urbanisticas (LRAU) with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, in October 2004. Our Ambassador in Madrid and our Consul in Alicante, have continued to lobby the Central and Regional Governments. They have also made representations both bilaterally and in conjunction with other countries. The Valencia Autonomous Community&#039;s (VAC) own Ombudsman has criticised law 6/94. In response to lobbying, the Valencia regional government drew up a new law to replace the LRAU, the Ley Urbanistica Valenciana (LUV). While the proposed new law addresses some of the concerns expressed by interested parties, it does not give the sort of tenure guarantees and property rights that are enjoyed in other parts of Spain and other European countries: nor does it fully address many of the Ombudsman&#039;s criticisms.

 The competition for the Firelink system for the Fire and Rescue Service has followed EU procurement rules. The specification for the wide area radio communications system was output based to ensure that current functions required by the Fire and Rescue Service could be met, in addition to ensuring a high level of resilience and interoperability both within the Fire and Rescue Service and with the other emergency services. The evaluation of final bids from suppliers has been based on four key areas: technical issues, project management, procurement and whole life costs. The outcome of the competition will be based on the balance of these factors. all of which will enable the Firelink system to be migrated into the regional control rooms.

A plan has been put in place, approved by residents, and a resident led company, Hartlepool Revival, has been set up to put the plan into action.

 Part L of the Building Regulations sets levels for energy performance in ways that offer designers the flexibility to choose solutions that best meet their needs, are cost-effective and practical, and enable innovation. Without prescribing solutions this enables builders to take up the benefits of renewable and other low and zero carbon&quot; technologies. In September the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced further improvements to these energy efficiency requirements that will come into effect next April and will encourage greater take-up of renewable systems.

 Alzheimer&#039;s is one of a number of physical and mental conditions that impact seriously upon the lives of older people and their families. In Northern Ireland, resources are allocated by programme of care for different classes of patients andcclients rather than by specific conditions. Information on resources for Alzheimer&#039;s disease is not therefore available separately. Decisions relating to the treatment and support of clients and their carers are made by health and social services boards in light of local priorities and available resources.

Information is available on the number of cardiomyopathy sufferers admitted as in-patients to hospitals in Northern Ireland. The number of admissions to hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of cardiomyopathy is detailed in the following table for each of the last five years available. It should be noted that any individual could have been admitted to hospital more than once over the course of a year or over a number of years and would therefore be counted more than once in the table.

 The following tables relate to the years 2000&#150;03 and detail the number of persons prosecuted and convicted at court. The tables are based on the police district command unit in which the offender&#039;s address falls. Where numbers are small conviction rates for each DCU are not calculated but the number of prosecutions and convictions are presented, along with the overall conviction rates for each year. Due to changes in the way data is collected figures for 1999 are not directly comparable but table four shows Northern Ireland level prosecutions and convictions for that year, for the three offence categories in question. It should be noted that many offences of common assault, breach of peace and drunkenness may be brought to justice via a police caution rather than via a court prosecution.

<sup>(62)</sup> Common assault offences include: common assault, common assault on adult, and common assault on a child/ young person.<br>

<sup>(63)</sup> Data are based on the police district command unit in which an offender&#039;s address falls. Police district command units became operational in April 2001. However, for the purposes of comparability, calendar year 2000 data are also disaggregated by DCU, rather than police division.

<sup>(64)</sup> The conviction rate is based on the number of persons found guilty out of those brought to court for the offence. Caution is recommended when interpreting rates, due to small numbers in some categories.<br>

 Accounting and accountability issues are a central item for discussion at the regular accountability reviews held between the Department and each Board. Board members have expressed concern regarding complexities in operating resource accounting, although all public bodies have for some years, been required to account for the public expenditure allocated to them in line with government accounting procedures and the principles and practice of resource accounting.

<a name="stpa_365">The report from the Statutory Inquiry into Financial Management and Control in the Belfast and South Eastern Education and Library Boards pointed to the importance of Board members understanding the financial context in which the Boards operate and probing and challenging officers on issues relating to finance and accountability. As part of the process of enabling Board members to fulfil this role, my Department is providing additional training and support to all Board members to complement existing internal induction arrangements and ensure that all Board members understand standards of public accounting and accountability.

As a result of the increase in capital funding for major works in recent years around 700 temporary classrooms will be removed from 80 schools as these schemes come to fruition over the next few years. The programme of capital investment is planned to continue over the coming years and it is expected that this will remove further temporary classrooms from the estate. There is no timetable for the removal of all temporary accommodation as temporary classrooms can provide an appropriate solution to meet immediate accommodation needs.

 The Department operates a competency based recruitment process, which requires candidates to demonstrate that they have the skills and competencies required for the advertised role. Applicants are generally assessed initially on the strength of their written application. Short listed candidates are expected to provide additional evidence at the interview stage. Where high levels of literacy or numeracy are required for a particular role a specific literacy or numeracy test may be carried out.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment she has made of whether the consultation process undertaken by the Food Standards Agency on proposed changes in the regulation of tryptophan in food supplements was consistent <i>(a)</i> with the principles set out in Cabinet Office code of practice on consultation and <i>(b)</i> with the code of good practice in consultations and policy appraisal; and if she will make a statement;  [22237]

<p><a name="qnpa_35">(2) what assessment she has made of the merits of <i>(a)</i> warning statements and <i>(b)</i> statutory limits as a means of regulating the use of tryptophan in food supplements;  [22238]

<p><a name="st_633"><a name="51107w66.html_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27 October 2005]:</i> The consultation process carried out by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) included preparing a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) to determine the impact on industry and consumers, which was followed by a 12-week consultation period with stakeholders on the proposed regulations and the draft RIA. The impact on industry, on allowing the re-introduction of L-tryptophan into supplements, was considered and on balance was considered to be positive given that supplements containing tryptophan have been prohibited for sale since 1990. Consumer choice will also be increased without presenting an appreciable risk to health. This approach is consistent with the Cabinet Office code of practice on consultation and the code of good practice in consultations and policy appraisal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w66.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_427">The use of advisory statements was not considered appropriate due to the severity of the symptoms of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in people taking dietary supplements containing tryptophan pre-1990, and the uncertainty relating to gaps in the scientific evidence. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Nov 2005 : Column 256W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
The United Kingdom Government&#039;s committee on toxicity (COT) decided to recommend a daily dose level of 220 milligrammes (mg) on a precautionary basis that would not present an appreciable risk to health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w66.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_428">Following the closure of the formal consultation exercise on the regulations for the use of tryptophan in foods, the COT secretariat has reviewed the data submitted by respondents. They found that there was no new evidence to that already reviewed by COT in 2004, when it reached its conclusions on the safety of tryptophan that would support a higher level of tryptophan being used in food supplements. The FSA therefore adopted the level and purity criteria recommended by COT, and this has therefore been adopted into UK legislation to reintroduce the sale of tryptophan supplements in the UK, in the interests of consumer choice and safety. We have asked COT to review its recommendation and any new information on tryptophan since June 2004, and this will be considered at the COT meeting in December. Depending on COTs advice the legislation may be amended. A summary of consultation responses and full RIA will be sent to all respondents, and made available on the FSA website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w66.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_429">Tryptophan was not considered by the expert group on vitamins and minerals (EVM) as it is not a vitamin or mineral. The EVM proposed safe upper levels (SULs) for vitamins and minerals using the well-established paradigm for setting acceptable and tolerable intake levels for chemicals in food. Where the data were not adequate to set a SUL, the EVM gave guidance on levels that would not be expected to result in adverse effects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w66.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_430">The COT uses the same paradigm in its consideration of the safety of tryptophan as a supplement. In its evaluation the COT noted significant uncertainties and decided that an uncertainty factor of 10 should be applied to derive a dose that would not be expected to be a risk to health in the general population. The limit proposed by the COT was 220 mg of tryptophan per day.

Individual budgets would also give the individual choice over how they receive their allocation; it does not have to be a cash allocation.

<i>[holding answer 25 October 2005]:</i> After a period of sustained investment to ensure a rapid growth in the national health service workforce, the national health service is now moving to more of a steady state where there is a closer match between supply and demand. NHS expenditure is continuing to grow but getting the right staffing complement is an issue that needs to be addressed locally. Workforce planners within strategic health authorities are working closely with local NHS employers to make sure that staff and students understand the range of opportunities that are available.

The number of places available in new structures will continue to be decided by service and educational need. The launch of the foundation programme as the first phase of MMC in August this year saw some SHO posts converted to SHO equivalent foundation year two posts but this conversion did not affect the overall number of posts available for doctors working at the SHO level.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps she is taking to act on the recommendation in the Audit Commission&#039;s report on supporting people, that her Department, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, providers and administering authorities should jointly consider practical problems and opportunities.

<p><a name="st_694"><a name="51107w72.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The Government will be considering the findings of the Audit Commission report in the context of the ongoing work to develop a supporting people strategy. I understand that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will issue a consultation paper on this shortly. Departmental officials have been closely involved in the development of that consultation paper, and the consultation will provide an opportunity for joint consideration of a way forward which also includes providers and administering authorities.

 A copy of the submissions received by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in response to its recent consultation on the use of tryptophan in food will be placed in the Library. The FSA will make all the documents available in its library and publish these on its website, including the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) and a copy of the regulations. The intention was to publish all the documents when the statutory instruments were laid before the House, but a further delay has occurred due to a typographical error in the RIA, which now requires re-signing before publication.
