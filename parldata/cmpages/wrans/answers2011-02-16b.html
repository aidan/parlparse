 On 15 November the Secretary of State for Justice announced the publication of a consultation on a package of proposals for the reform of legal aid. The consultation proposes that legal aid ceases to be available for clinical negligence matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="110216w0001.htm_para31"><a name="11021659000264">Most personal injury cases were removed from the scope of the civil legal aid scheme by the Access to Justice Act 1999. Legal aid funding is still available for claims, including personal injury claims, against public authorities alleging serious wrong-doing, abuse of position of power or significant breach of human rights. We have proposed replacing the existing "serious wrong-doing" ground for funding, and replacing it with "negligent acts or omissions falling very far below the required standard of care" as a ground for funding these claims.</p>

The current consultation proposes to abolish the rule which brings back into the scope of civil legal aid any case which has a significant wider public interest. While the Government recognises that public interest is an important factor, which should continue to be reflected in the Funding Code merits criteria for granting civil legal aid, we do not consider that it should be either a solely determinative factor in deciding whether legal aid should be granted, or a basis for bringing back into scope otherwise excluded cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="110216w0001.htm_para33"><a name="11021659000266">Funding is available for claims, including personal injury claims, arising from allegations of abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, or sexual assault.</p>

1. Estimates are derived from the Family Resources Survey and are based on a three year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain income bands and statistical variation across the years.<br>
2. All amounts are in 2008-09 prices. Information covers Great Britain only.<br>
3. Shares of benefit expenditure by income band according to the Family Resources Survey have been applied to administrative data to derive a split by income band. Administrative data totals are available to the nearest million pounds, while information based on survey data is presented rounded to the nearest £50 million.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series. Note, however, that unlike most incomes used in the 'Households Below Average Income' publication, incomes here are gross and unequivalised.<br>
5. The Family Resources Survey is known to undercount receipt of certain benefits. This methodology assumes that this undercount is spread proportionally across income bands. For example, if 30% of expenditure is in a certain income band, this assumes 30% of any undercount is also in that income band. This assumption may not be justified here given the relationship between overall income and reporting of benefit income.<br>
6. Unequivalised gross incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling in order to assign all incomes to bands.<br>

These included refusal of access for international monitors, lack of access in many instances for independent national monitors and candidate representatives to key parts of the voting and counting process and reports of attempts to limit media comment on the elections. In a number of cases, reported voting irregularities and the harassment and arrest of opposition candidates and their supporters amounted to serious interference in the electoral process. This called into question the credibility of some of the results. The majority of the opposition parties and candidates refused to participate in the second round of elections, citing these issues. We strongly encouraged the Egyptian authorities to address those concerns. After the elections the UK and EU highlighted in public and in private irregularities in the electoral process including the absence of independent monitors and limits to press freedom.</p>

The advice against all but essential travel to Tunisia was removed on 4 February 2011, in line with an improving security situation on the ground. In response to the unrest in Egypt, the FCO advises against all but essential travel to Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Luxor. In addition, the FCO organised two government-funded charter flights for British nationals wanting to leave Cairo, on 3 and 5 February 2011. The FCO sent additional staff to both Tunisia and Egypt to reinforce our embassies on the ground. We continue to monitor the situation in Jordan and Yemen.

This estimate is not based on specific size of plant. The renewables obligation (RO) is currently the Government's main mechanism for incentivising large scale renewable deployment. The cost of renewables obligation support for this level of biomass generation is estimated to be in the region of £0.5 to £1 billion in 2020 (2010-11 prices).</p>

 We announced in "Investing Skills for Sustainable Growth" in November 2010 that a minimum contract level (MCL) was being introduced for the 2011/12 academic year as part of our commitment to create a streamlined and more efficient FE system. In an environment of declining budgets, it has become increasingly difficult for small providers to operate without realising the efficiencies of shared services or economies of scale through collaboration or subcontracting. The Skills Funding Agency also needs to become more efficient and streamlined.</p>

Second, exiting existing contractual arrangements relating to the provision of financial services through the post office network.
