To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) of 24 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>283</i>, what factors underlie her assessment that the impact of the euro on north-south relationships in the island of Ireland in the short term is likely to be limited.  [80176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90416w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Over the past two decades, North-South trade has been subject to exchange rate risk and business is therefore used to dealing with this. Many retail businesses in border areas currently transact using both currencies. Also the volume of North-South trade is unlikely to change significantly in the short term, due to the continuing importance of the Great Britain market to Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will make a statement on the impact in Northern Ireland of the proposals in the Government's consultation paper, New and Renewable Energy-Prospects for the 21st Century.  [80240]<P>

<P>
<a name="90416w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Government intend working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10% of UK electricity supplies, cost effectively, as soon as possible; they hope to achieve this by 2010. So the proposals in the consultation paper will stimulate further interest in the potential of renewable technologies in Northern Ireland and complement the current range of initiatives such as the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation Orders (NI-NFFOs 1 and 2), the EU supported Energy Demonstration Scheme, the INTERREG programme and Northern Ireland Electricity's Eco Energy (Green Tariff) scheme. Following appraisal of the regional responses to the consultation paper, consideration will be given to the implications for sustained promotion of renewable technologies in Northern Ireland.

<a name="90416w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have been considering the report into the brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. The Report focuses on the Metropolitan Police but it raises many issues for policing and, indeed, society generally. Many of the Lawrence Report's recommendations are pertinent in Northern Ireland, not only in terms of how racial differences are addressed, but also in terms of divisions along religious and other lines.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para0">The Government attach great importance to issues of racial equality in Northern Ireland and, in the context of policing, I welcome the first meeting of the Consultative Committee on Policing for Ethnic Minorities hosted recently by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and the RUC. This Committee will do much to ensure the views of ethnic minority groups are fully understood and their policing needs met. It will develop a greater understanding in the police service of the problems faced by ethnic minorities and provide a means by which these communities can work with the police to provide a better service and have their problems addressed.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para1">The Criminal Justice and Policing section of the Good Friday Agreement recognises that we have a unique opportunity to bring about a society,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which will recognise the full and equal legitimacy and worth of identifies, senses of allegiance and ethos of all sections of the community in Norther Ireland".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para2">This is why the Government established the independent Commission on Policing and the Review of Criminal Justice which will report later this year. The terms of reference of these two bodies cover many areas highlighted by the report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para3">None the less, there are a number of areas where I will want to see comparable changes to those set out in my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's action plan for addressing the recommendations of the Lawrence Report. On the application of not only race relations legislation, but all Northern Ireland's stringent equality legislation to the police, I want to see as full a coverage as possible. Northern Ireland is already a leader in providing statutory guarantees of equality of treatment and I want to build on this.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para4">Improving community confidence in policing generally is an essential priority. The Police Authority has set an objective in the recently published Policing Plan requiring the Chief Constable to raise public confidence in the RUC in the year 1999-2000. However, in view of the recommendations contained in the Lawrence Report, I will examine with the Authority and the Chief Constable what more might be needed to promote racial, religious, sex and disability equality and what meaningful measures can be adopted to ensure this happens. There should be no doubt of the Government's commitment to tackling all forms of discrimination.




<P>
<P><I>16 Apr 1999 : Column: 362</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para5">Turning to the recommendations which affect police complaints and discipline procedure, we are making important changes. On independent investigations we are pressing ahead with the establishment of a Police Ombudsman. This will provide for completely independent investigation of complaints against the police and will provide a model for other systems. We want this system to be as transparent as possible. We will also be introducing important reforms of the police conduct and performance procedures and will consider the further changes recommended by the Lawrence Report in this area.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para6">Whilst first-aid training in the RUC generally meets the standards recommended by the report, we are in touch with the RUC to ensure that any steps necessary to reduce intervals between refresher training are advanced as a matter of urgency. In other aspects of training, the police will build upon the initiatives taken as part of the Community Awareness Programme which already uses outside trainers from a wide variety of organisations. On inspection, similar changes to the role of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will be made in Northern Ireland in line with those being made by the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para7">The Report raises issues about communication between the prosecuting authorities and victims. In Northern Ireland victims or their families are informed about the progress of their case by the RUC at key stages during the process, and by staff of the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland if any decisions are taken once the case has actually come to court. The experience of those victims and witnesses who are made to feel particularly vulnerable because of the nature of the offence they are giving evidence about has been considered by a working group since last May. The group will be making recommendations to me in the Summer as to how the criminal justice system might better assist such witnesses.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para8">The Stephen Lawrence Report highlights the need for co-ordinated action across the public sector if reforms are to be truly effective. For this reason the Government will be seeking to work closely with the new Assembly in Northern Ireland on those recommendations dealing with education and equality law. Consultation with bodies outside central Government will also be required. I have already initiated this action.
<P>

<a name="90416w01.htm_para9">The Government consider the protection of human rights, equality of treatment and respect for difference cultures as fundamental aspects of the ethos of the police service in Northern Ireland. A service where, as the Chief Constable has indicated, there is no room for prejudice of any kind and cultural diversity is celebrated. The recommendations of the Report on Stephen Lawrence will help us in pursuing this aim.

 My Department does not maintain records of the numbers of Service personnel deemed to be on sick leave at any one time and could only provide that information at disproportionate cost. However, under the Statutory Sick Pay Act 1994, payment of Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) became the responsibility of employers and the ability for them to reclaim up to 80 per cent. of costs from the Department of Social Security ceased. Employers were compensated for the extra SSP costs by a reduction in employers' National Insurance Contributions.

 There have been no incidents requiring nuclear accident response over the last five years and therefore no costs have been incurred. However, defence nuclear accident response capabilities are maintained in appropriate divisions within the Department and are regularly exercised. Costs associated are borne by those divisions and no central record is maintained. Such a record could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

 I refer my hon.

A copy of the paper was sent to my hon. Friend on the date of its publication and copies were also placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90416w04.htm_para5">In addition, the Ministry of Defence is funding a major epidemiological study, led by Professor Nicola Cherry at Manchester University, which aims to determine whether Gulf veterans are experiencing greater ill-health than service personnel who did not take part in the conflict and to identify possible exposures and predisposing factors associated with any distinctive pattern of symptoms which may be found. This study will also investigate whether there is an increased incidence of cancer or mortality amongst Gulf veterans. Initial results are expected to be submitted for publication at around the middle of this year.

 Within the reforms of the Territorial Army, the operational requirement for the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) is to produce trained individual reservists to provide crewmen for Challenger 2 tanks and medium reconnaissance vehicles, and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) specialists. Against this background, there is no longer an operational requirement for an RAC pool of ex-regular officers since there will be sufficient expertise available within the new unit structure, and the Regular Army Retired Officers (RARO) will provide a continued source of specialist armoured skills and experience.

In the event of any future investigation into this case my Department would co-operate fully as we did with the earlier investigations including, where appropriate, over information held by third parties. In doing so the Ministry of Defence would continue to take into account our continuing duty to safeguard national security and the safety of individuals.

In every year bar one under the previous Government, prescription charges were increased in real terms--the annual average increase being 12.3 per cent. in real terms.

In order to facilitate the work of the European Scrutiny Committee and to keep it informed of the progress of negotiations, the Department regularly submits Explanatory Memoranda to the Committee. Ninety-two such memoranda have been submitted since 1 May 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90416w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 Further to the reply of my hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) on 24 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>288,</i> I have received papers over the period 6 April to 13 April from solicitors acting on behalf of Mrs. Cathy Woodhead. They relate wholly to the progress of the Woodheads' divorce in 1976 and 1977 and date from September 1976. They contain a number of exchanges between Mrs. Woodhead and her solicitor, plus a signed statement from Chris Woodhead admitting to adultery in November and December 1976, some months after he and Amanda Johnston left Gordano school. I have considered that material. No evidence has been presented to me that proves that Mr. Woodhead had a sexual relationship with Ms Johnston while she was his pupil. Both Mr. Woodhead and Ms Johnston have signed documents to the effect that there was no relationship until the late autumn of 1976.
<P>

<a name="90416w07.htm_para4">It is not for me as Secretary of State to intervene in the rights and wrongs of a divorce which took place 23 years age; nor to side with either Mr. or Mrs. Woodhead in a dispute about the facts surrounding that divorce. My responsibility is in relation to the role of the Chief Inspector as a Crown employee and to apply good management practice fairly and impartially. There is nothing in the papers I have seen which substantiates the allegations made against Chris Woodhead or calls into question his suitability to continue as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools. I do not, therefore, intend to carry out any further investigations of this matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90416w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Foreign Office Ministers and officials discuss frequently the abolition of the death penalty with their US counterparts. Baroness Symons most recently raised HMG's opposition to the use of the death penalty in the United States with Harold Koh, Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, US State Department, during her visit to Washington in late March.
<P>

<a name="90416w07.htm_para5">Her Majesty's Government are opposed to the use of the death penalty in the United States and will continue to use their very close relationship with the US Government to take up death penalty cases whenever appropriate. As EU Presidency in 1998, the UK was instrumental in establishing a set of EU guidelines on death penalty cases, which now form the basis of all EU demarches to the US authorities. To date, the UK has been involved in eight EU demarches. The Foreign Secretary's Death Penalty Panel has also targeted the United States for action, and we are constantly reviewing the best way to tackle the US authorities over the death penalty.

In developing the NDDP we have been consulting closely with disabled people and the organisations that represent them. Consultation has taken place at key stages throughout the development of the programme and will continue in the future. As part of the NDDP we are piloting a Personal Adviser service for disabled people in 12 areas covering over 250,000 people receiving an Incapacity Benefit. The service is providing personal support to disabled people who wish to move into, or remain in work. We are also funding 24 Innovative Schemes to test the best ways of helping disabled people into work, of which four specifically cater for people with learning difficulties.
<P>

<a name="90416w08.htm_para3">We have arranged for independent evaluation of the initiatives under the NDDP that will include the views of the disabled people who have used them.
<P>

<a name="90416w08.htm_para4">In addition to the NDDP, we will be piloting the Single Work Focused Gateway in 12 areas, starting from June 1999. All claimants in the Gateway pilot areas will be allocated their own personal adviser who will help provide appropriate guidance and support for those who want to consider employment, training and rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="90416w08.htm_para5">Through the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill we plan to modernise disability benefits so that they will provide more help for disabled people in greatest need. Certain young disabled people will be entitled to Incapacity Benefit without having to meet the usual contribution conditions; they will gain by up to &#163;26.40 a week. And the higher rate of mobility component of Disability Living Allowance worth &#163;37 a week will be available to severely disabled children aged three and four.

<a name="90416w08.htm_para6">Analysis of the 1996 General Household Survey (GHS) and Summer 1998 Labour Force Survey (LFS) suggests that there are around 10.75 million people earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;20,000. Of these, half are members of an occupational pension scheme, and 2.5 million contribute to a personal pension. Of these 2.5 million, 1 million make no additional contributions above the contracted-out rebate. As the GHS and LFS do not track individuals over a number of years, it is not possible to use these surveys to reliably forecast changes in earnings from year to year.
<P>

<a name="90416w08.htm_para7">Estimates made by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) <sup>1</sup>  using data from the British Household Panel Survey suggest that of those employees earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 at least once between 1992 and 1995, 38 per cent. had earnings within this range in all 4 years, and 26 per cent. earned above &#163;18,500 at least once during this period.

Estimating the impact of indirect taxes is imprecise as spending patterns vary widely between households with the same composition and income. The level of council tax payments will also vary depending on where families live.
<P>

<a name="90416w09.htm_para2">Changes announced in this and the last Budget will offer significant help to families. From October 1999 the WFTC will mean that no family with children will pay net income tax until their earnings exceed &#163;235 per week or more than &#163;12,000 per year. On average families with children will be &#163;740 per year better off.

1. Income tax payments are calculated on the basis that the households receive no tax reliefs other than the standard allowances and only have income from employment. All earners, including wives, are assumed to pay Class 1 national insurance contributions at the contracted-in rate.<P>

2. Earnings are taken to be the median gross weekly earnings of all full-time employees on adult rates with pay unaffected by absence. (Median earnings are more representative of the population as a whole than mean male full-time earnings.)<P>

3. A family with 2 children is assumed to have both children aged under 11.<P>

4. In line with the convention in the Tax Benefit Reference Manual, child benefit is treated as negative income tax.<P>

5. Family Credit, although not part of the tax system, has been treated in the same way as WFTC so as to provide comparability with the tax system following the introduction of WFTC.<P>

6. The calculations assume earnings growth for 1998-99 onwards of an illustrative 4 per cent. <P>

 Under the programme carried out by the Department between 1994-1998, IACS map checks were undertaken in respect of 2,174,843 field areas and numbers to establish the accuracy of the details included in Area Aid Applications and entered on the IACS database. The number of officials involved in the programme and the total value of reductions to claims were not recorded centrally and the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, the object of the programme was to protect Community expenditure on the schemes governed by IACS not only for the period up to 1998 but also, by verifying the information recorded on the IACS database, which is used to validate claims in subsequent years.

 The Government are fully committed to increasing biodiversity.

Following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, we have announced that we aim to expand the area protected and enhanced under the major agri-environment schemes. During the next three years an additional &#163;40 million will be available in England for additional agreements under these schemes.

 Representations have been made by the pig industry and the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) to allow porcine MBM to be fed to poultry on the condition that processing takes place in rendering plants dedicated to pig waste. The existing ban was put in place on the recommendation of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, and the Government continue to base their handling of BSE on the advice of that Committee.
<P>

<a name="90416w10.htm_para2">Before we would be prepared to ask SEAC to look at the use of porcine MBM for export or poultry feed purposes the industry itself will need to address the key issues of how monitoring at all stages of production and distribution would be carried out to avoid the possibility of cross-contamination.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90416w10.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Mammalian meat and bonemeal (MBM) is considered to have been the main source of infection in the BSE epidemic. Controls on the use of mammalian MBM have been progressively tightened in the light of experience and the latest available advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), the Government's independent advisor on BSE issues. The controls in place are: a prohibition on all mammalian protein, including MBM, in ruminant feed; and a prohibition on the feeding of mammalian MBM to all farmed livestock to prevent cross-contamination of ruminant rations. This ban was not introduced to protect the health of pigs and poultry. The existing bans on the use of mammalian MBM in feed for farmed animals do not extend to MBM derived from poultry.
<P>

<a name="90416w10.htm_para4">SEAC provided advice to the Government on the practice of intraspecies recycling of waste in the pig and poultry industries in December 1997. They considered that there may be a very small risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) arising spontaneously within a species and recommended that a strategy be developed to remove the small potential risk of TSE transmission from the recycling of pig and poultry waste as feed for the same species. The Government have accepted this advice.

 The Treaty of Amsterdam will have minimal impact on the responsibilities of the Department and its staffing. As far as EU bodies are concerned, there will be an increased role for the European Parliament, following the amendment to Article 129 of the Treaty to extend the co-decision procedure to cover measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which have as their direct objective the protection of public health.

 Late last year the USA Government introduced a variety of aid measures for small pig farmers. Although the USA is the EU's main competitor in world pigmeat markets, the impact of these aid measures on UK producers is likely to be indirect and relatively small.

 I have received occasional representations from beekeepers seeking advice on the implications of bees foraging GM crops. The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes hosted a workshop in 1991 to consider the safety of pollen from GM plants in honey. The workshop's conclusion was that the consumption of gene products from pollen in honey was likely to be negligible. The results from three research projects commissioned by MAFF to investigate this further subsequently confirmed this conclusion.
