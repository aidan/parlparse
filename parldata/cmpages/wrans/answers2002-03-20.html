To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made with the memorial to service personnel killed since the second world war; and if he will make a statement.  [44480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A project team was appointed early last year to look at potential sites for the memorial and to consider the qualifying criteria for those to be commemorated. Extensive research was carried out on suitable sites both in and outside London. There has been wide consultation with the services and ex-service organisations on both the siting and eligibility criteria. There is general support for the proposals.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para0">I am delighted to be able to confirm that the Armed Forces Memorial will be sited at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The names of those commemorated will either be engraved on the memorial or in Rolls of Honour that will be kept close by in the Millennium Chapel at the Arboretum. The design of the memorial will be decided following an architectural competition that will be held later this year.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para1">The qualifying criteria for inclusion on the memorial are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"All those Service personnel who were killed on duty whilst performing functions attributable to the special circumstances and requirements of the Armed Forces, or as a result of terrorist attack, and all those who died whilst deployed on designated operations."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20320w01.html_para2">An additional part of the project will be to erect a memorial plaque in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey to those members of the armed forces killed in conflict since the end of the second world war. Finally, there will be Rolls of Honour recording the names of all members of the Royal Navy and the Army who have died in service during this period. These will be kept in suitable churches in London and will be similar to those for the Royal Air Force that are kept in the Church of St. Clement Danes.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para3">Trustees of the Armed Forces Memorial trust will now be appointed to take this project forward. They will take on the ownership of the memorial and will be responsible for its funding and construction. Funds will be raised by public subscription.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para4">This is a very important national project that will also provide a platform to help educate our younger generations about the value of our armed forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_wqn2"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the monitoring systems he has put in place to check the levels of depleted uranium entering the ground water and food chain from the use of munitions containing depleted uranium at Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright training areas.  [43415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Comprehensive environmental monitoring programmes have been in place at both Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright ever since the beginning of the DU munitions trials announced in the House in 1979. These programmes have focused on the collection and analysis of samples of soil, vegetation, freshwater, seawater, seaweed, molluscs and seabed and shoreline sediments. Faecal samples from domestic and wild animals have also been collected on an opportunity basis. This monitoring continues to show that DU does not pose a significant risk to members of the public or site personnel.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para6">Other Government Departments with statutory health and safety and environmental protection responsibilities were consulted while these programmes were being established, and their successors, principally the Environment Agency and Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, continue to be advised of the nature and results of the monitoring activities. The local councils also 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 313W</I><P>
receive copies of the annual environmental monitoring reports for both sites. The Ministry of Defence also made a commitment on 13 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 128&#150;29W, to continue these monitoring activities for as long as the regulatory authorities consider necessary.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_wqn3"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what clean up operations he has put in place on the Crown Estate relating to the use of munitions containing depleted uranium.  [43422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As Eskmeals, depleted uranium (DU) rounds have been fired against hard targets and the resulting DU fragments and contaminated debris have been collected after each firing. The material has then been sent for disposal at the low-level radioactive waste repository at Drigg. Air filters from the target area have also been disposed of via this route. Some higher activity material, such as DU plate, which is not suitable for disposal at Drigg, remains in storage pending a national decision on future radioactive waste disposal strategies. Some steel targets contaminated with very low levels of DU are still stored at the site and options for the disposal of this material are currently being discussed with the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para7">At Kirkudbright, the trials require the DU rounds to be fired through very soft targets (such as hessian sheets) and to travel out to sea. In this case, remediation is required only if an experimental round malfunctions and contaminates the range area. When such impact points have been located, samples of soil and vegetation have been collected to assess the degree of contamination: clean-up is then carried out if pre-set action levels have been exceeded. Specially marked drums have been kept at each firing point for storing contaminated material and the Radiation Protection Adviser has provided disposal advice on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para8">At West Freugh, a small number of DU projectiles, weighing less than 25kg in total, were fired into the sea 2km below the low-water mark. There are no records of any DU projectiles accidentally striking the land in the region. The small number of DU rounds in the sea were not considered to pose a hazard which would warrant a clean-up operation.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para9">Foulness had an indoor facility, in which small experimental DU projectiles were fired between 1982 and 1983. The building was designed to prevent any escape of particulate DU into the atmosphere. It is no longer in use and was decontaminated in 1997.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the conclusions of the Royal Society report on the health effects of depleted uranium munitions; and if he will make a statement.  [44038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We welcome the publication of part II of the Royal Society report which is a valuable addition to the scientific knowledge on the risks from depleted uranium (DU) munitions.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para10">Overall, the report's conclusions are very much in line with the Ministry of Defence's assessment that the risks DU poses to the health of UK Gulf veterans, peacekeepers in the Balkans and UK forces/civilians in current and future conflicts, are very low, in all but extreme cases. This is what we have always believed, and bears out the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 314W</I><P>
findings of research carried out by organisations such as the United Nations and World Health Organisation as well as ourselves.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para11">The extreme circumstances mentioned in the report could affect individuals such as the crew of a vehicle that had been hit by a DU round or personnel who had worked for long periods, unprotected, in a vehicle which had been hit. I am pleased to say that no UK service personnel have been exposed in this way.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para12">Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where we believe that further research is desirable to enhance the database on which to make judgments weighing the potential loss of life arising from not using DU munitions in battle against any potential longer term impact on human health and the environment resulting from its use.
<P>

<a name="20320w01.html_para13">On 14 March 2002, I released details of the MOD research programme which contains elements that address this subject. The full details of our proposals have been placed in the Library of the House. They have also been published on the MOD website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his policy is regarding the selection of films held in the archive of the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down to be transferred to the Imperial War Museum for permanent preservation; and what plans he has to change this policy.  [43454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 9 May 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 196W. Films held in the archive at Dstl Porton Down are gradually being transferred to the Imperial War Museum in accordance with Ministry of Defence policy. The final decision on which films should be preserved for permanent preservation rests with the Imperial War Museum. There are currently no plans to change this procedure.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w02.html_wqn1"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what dates since 1 January 1999 the Independent Ethics Committee overseeing human experiments at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down has discussed the long-term effects of nerve gas on humans during its meetings.  [43453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Independent Ethics Committee overseeing the conduct of the Service Volunteer Programme at Dstl Porton Down has not discussed the possible long term effects of exposure to nerve agents during its meetings since 1 January 1999.

<P>
<a name="20320w02.html_wqn2"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will place in the Library a copy of the report produced by the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down in 1973 entitled "The effects of a chemical agent on the eyes of aircrew".  [43444]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many films are held by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down, of its biological warfare trial known as Operation Ozone which was conducted in 1954 off the Bahamas; and if he will place a list of the titles and dates of these films in the Library.

<a name="20320w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Dstl Porton Down holds two canisters of 16 mm film entitled Operation Ozone 'Master' and Operation Ozone 'View' together with a videotape, entitled "Operation Ozone&#151;1954", which contains footage extracted from the 16 mm 'Master' shot during the trial.
<P>

<a name="20320w02.html_para0">However, the titles of the 1,200 films in the archive at Dstl Porton Down have not been catalogued and in many cases are not very informative. It would involve disproportionate cost to collate a compete list of films. It is not, therefore, possible to say if the two canisters of film and the videotape detailed above represents the sum total of Dstl Porton Down's film holdings in relation to Operation Ozone.

 The Ministry of Defence is pursuing initiatives to reduce the numbers who are temporarily unfit for operational purposes because of injury. These initiatives include measures aimed at prevention of injury, 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 316W</I><P>
for example, improvements to the physical fitness training programmes for new entrants. The measures also include swifter assessment and better treatment of those who are injured, especially through the creation of additional rehabilitation facilities. These steps are expected to lead to a reduction in the numbers of personnel who are medically downgraded, including a reduction in the numbers who are invalided as a consequence of injury.
<P>

<a name="20320w02.html_para2">Any personnel developing a permanent condition which degrades their functional capacity may require to be permanently downgraded or invalided as appropriate. The recommendation will be made in accordance with the service's medical boarding procedures. A Medical Board may recommend that an individual's medical condition is compatible with continued service in a permanently reduced medical category but the final decision will be made by the employing authority, taking into account the ability for the service to continue to employ an individual with the relevant restriction. If, despite efforts to the contrary, this turns out not to be practicable, the individual will be invalided.
<P>

<a name="20320w02.html_para3">In the case of officers invalided from the service, subject to meeting the health requirements laid down, eligible individuals may apply for employment under the MOD Retired Officer scheme. Alternatively, there are no restrictions on disabled people being employed in civilian jobs in the MOD. The Department complies fully with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and was one of the first Departments to achieve the Employment Service two-tick "Positive about disabled people" symbol in May 1995. The MOD also has its own Disability Fund to pay for specialist equipment and training to help disabled employees develop their full potential at work. The Department is a member of the Employers' Forum on Disability and currently funds three disability bursaries through the Cabinet Office scheme. Around 5 per cent. of the civilian workforce of the MOD has a declared disability. This percentage is broadly in line with the estimated numbers of economically active disabled people in the working population as a whole.

<P>
<a name="20320w03.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Her Majesty the Queen requested that additional expenditure on her Golden Jubilee be kept to a minimum. The armed forces are organising a royal visit which will take place in Portsmouth in late June and the Ministry of Defence will fund the cost of providing a Golden Jubilee medal to eligible service personnel. Wherever possible any expenditure on these two projects will be from its existing financial allocation. There was no identifiable expenditure on the Golden Jubilee in financial year (FY) 1999&#150;2000. In FY 2000&#150;01 there was an estimated &#163;31,500 associated with planning for the Golden Jubilee and thus far in FY 2001&#150;02 a further &#163;1,155,000 has been spent, including the costs of supplying and issuing about 40,500 Golden Jubilee medals. Additional expenditure is anticipated in the coming FY.

<P>
<a name="20320w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> The Armed Forces Discipline Act 2000 amended the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (the Service discipline Acts), primarily to provide for the judicial supervision of pre-trial custody and to introduce a right of appeal against findings and sentences imposed summarily.
<P>

<a name="20320w03.html_para1">All discipline procedures are kept under review. We shall be considering whether any changes will be required to the aspects dealt with in the 2000 Act when the Service discipline Acts are replaced by a single piece of discipline legislation covering all the Services. We are also assessing whether any modifications may be necessary as a result of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Morris <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom, although that judgment was directly concerned with court martial procedures rather than the areas covered by the 2000 Act.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) It sets out a new framework with criteria that will help consistent judgments to be made on when loans are more appropriate to use than alternatives such as grants;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) Most existing Government loans, and similar types of support, score well under these criteria;</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20320w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 This Government are committed to abolishing child poverty within a generation and halving it by 2010. As part of this commitment, we recently published a strategy document entitled 'Tackling child poverty: giving every child the best possible start in life' which will inform the Budget and Spending Review 2002. As a result of tax and benefit changes announced in the last Parliament, there are now 1.2 million fewer children in poverty than there would otherwise have been.
<P>

<a name="20320w06.html_para1">During this Parliament, the Government will continue to make progress towards its goals with the introduction of two new tax credits&#151;the child tax credit and the working tax credit. The Government are also making substantial new investments in services for children. Over the four years to 2004, average real-terms annual growth in spending on education and training in England will be over 5&#189; per cent. In addition, extra funds have been made available for SureStart, Neighbourhood Renewal and the Children's Fund.

 These attacks are completely the opposite of what the Belfast Agreement was about. Those who sanction them and carry them out are the enemies of a transition to a peaceful society in Northern Ireland. Police investigate all such attacks but their investigations into these offences are often hampered, as the victims generally decline to make a formal complaint. Regrettably therefore prosecutions are therefore extremely rare.

 [holding answer 11 March and 14 March 2002]:
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para3"><i>Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC)</i>
All information in PLASC about individual pupils, including their ethnicity, is collected from schools under Regulations laid under section 537A of the Education Act 1996, as amended by section 140(1), paragraph 153 of Schedule 30 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para4">PLASC information will be used by the Department solely for statistical purposes. It remains of statistical value after pupils have left school&#151;for example to monitor patterns of progression from school into further education and training, higher education and the labour market, and how these patterns vary between different groups of pupils, including different ethnic groups. In order to be able to derive such statistics PLASC information will be retained indefinitely on an individual pupil basis, as allowed by section 33 of the Data Protection Act 1998.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 340W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para5">With respect to pupils' ethnicity, the ethnic groups used for PLASC in January 2002 were based on those from the 1991 national population Census, and from January 2003 will be based on those from the 2001 Census. In neither case is Jewish identified as a separate ethnic group, nor is there any other information in PLASC that identifies pupils as Jewish.
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para6">Relatively little of the information in PLASC is provided by pupils or parents&#151;much of it will be known by the school from its own interactions with pupils, or will be received from other sources. The main items that are provided by pupils or parents (in addition to name, date of birth and home postcode) are ethnic group and first language. Schools should seek this information, but pupils or parents have the right to withhold it. Most schools already obtain this information routinely.
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para7">The White Paper "Excellence in Schools", published in July 1997, highlighted the need for much better pupil level information to be available throughout the schools sector in order to support the drive to raise standards, and also for a national system of "unique pupil numbers" (UPNs) to enable this information to be collated accurately on a pupil by pupil basis. A consultation document was issued in December 1997 with detailed proposals (including PLASC, UPNs and a central pupil database) addressing the issues raised by the White Paper. This document was sent to LEAs, teacher associations, church and religious organisations, governors' and parents' organisations, the Data Protection Registrar (as she was then), leading civil liberties organisations (Liberty and Charter 88), and a range of other interested organisations (including the Commission for Racial Equality). A summary of the document was also sent to all schools.
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para8">Before and after this consultation exercise the Department had meetings with the Data Protection Registrar and her officials, and a series of measures were agreed in respect of the issuing of UPNs, and their use in the collection and collation of pupil level data. These measures aimed to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act, and minimise any possible threat to the privacy of pupils. The Department continues to discuss the use of UPNs and pupil level information with the Information Commissioner's Office as and when issues arise, and is also planning to discuss with her Office security arrangements for the forthcoming central pupil database.
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para9">The Department has no interest in the identity of individual pupils as such. Pupil names and UPNs are collected to enable PLASC information to be linked, pupil by pupil, with Key Stage and examination results which are collected separately, and from one year to the next. Technical staff engaged in this data linking will, for that purpose, need to have access to pupil names and UPNs. The linked data (without pupil names and UPNs) will then be used to carry out statistical analyses of attainment levels, and how these vary according to the various pupil attributes identified in PLASC.
<P>

<a name="20320w08.html_para10">Pupils, or in certain circumstances their parents or guardians, will be able to see the information held about them in the central database, and to ask for correction of any inaccurate data.

The DTI has recently announced a new &#163;1 million programme, called "LPG Boost", to further enhance the uptake of LPG, including grants to help additional conversion specialists undertake the technical training and meet the competencies for becoming Powershift approved converters, and so increase the network of approved converters.

Motorists are converting to LPG at an increasing rate, with the number expected to increase by about 35,000 for 2002 and 50,000 in 2003, prompted by the Government grants available, and the fact that low-cost LPG fuel is now available in all areas of the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 A short-term loan facility for National Air Traffic Services has now been agreed. It is for a maximum of &#163;60 million over the period to 30 September 2002, &#163;30 million of which is to be provided by the Government and the other &#163;30 million by a group of four lending banks. Each party will lend on the same commercial terms. Its purpose is to relieve NATS' cash-flow position until arrangements are put in place to secure the long-term financial stability of the company following the unprecedented events of 11 September 2001.

imposed in each of the preceding four years for each civil airport in the United Kingdom operated by (i) BAA and (ii) each of the other airport operators.  [43861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Those airports subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority notify CAA of the different airport charges levied at their airport. Landing charges are one of these. However, they vary for different categories of aircraft (eg by aircraft noise); by aircraft weight categories and sometimes by time of day. They may also include airport navigation charges. The resources required to process and collate the information on landing charges data for all airport operators, and in a form which would allow useful comparisons between airports, would be disproportionate and not show the level of the total airport charge.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para0">The revenue from airport charges is published for about 30 airports by the Centre for the study of Regulated Industries (CRI) in their statistical series "Airport Statistics". This publication also includes passenger number so it would be possible to derive the annual revenue from airport charges per passenger for these airports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what factors the Civil Aviation Authority is required to take account of when considering applications from airport operators for increases in landing charges.  [43864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are three categories of airport in respect of airport charges.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para1">Airports with more than one million passengers each year are subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and require their permission to levy charges. Below this threshold, airports are able to levy airport charges without permission. For the 'designated' airports of BAA's London airports and for Manchester airport, this permission is also subject to conditions regarding the maximum amounts that may be levied.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para2">For the non-designated economically regulated airports with permission to levy charges, CAA are notified of the airport charges to be levied by the airport operator but they do not play a part in determining these.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 353W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para3">For the designated airports of BAA's London airports and of Manchester airport, the conditions imposed by CAA are the result of an extensive process every five years to set the maximum annual airport charge for the following five years. In doing this, CAA take account of their statutory objectives listed in Section 39 of the 1986 Airports Act. This price cap has been expressed in terms of the average revenue from airport charges per passenger (revenue yield). Provided the annual airport charges set each year by the airport operator would not be expected to result in the price cap being exceeded, CAA are not involved in their determination.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he proposes to announce the outcome of stage one of the review of English Partnerships; and if he will make a statement.  [45052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w12.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Today we are announcing the outcome of the first stage of the current review of English Partnerships (EP), together with appointment of the new chair of the organisation.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para4">The new chair of English Partnerships is to be Margaret Ford. She has extensive experience in economic development and of working with Government organisations within the UK and internationally. She has particular experience of leading organisations though periods of considerable change. We are confident that Margaret Ford is the right person to lead EP into its new role.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para5">EP will become the Secretary of State's expert adviser on brownfield regeneration, managing a national portfolio of strategic sites, and managing demonstration projects. EP will work with national, regional and local partners, especially the RDAs, and the private sector, to identify strategic brownfield land, prioritise and facilitate its development. There is a continuing remit for EP as a national public sector body and as a vital component of the Government's programme for achieving an Urban Renaissance.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para6">To sharpen the organisation's focus on brownfield regeneration, we intend EP progressively to transfer their non-strategic Commission for the New Towns (CNT) landholdings to other appropriate bodies, for example the local authority.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para7">In the spirit of the two Green Papers we published last year setting out fundamental changes to local government and the planning system, EP will relinquish the use of their planning powers in the former new town areas, bringing control over the development of these areas under the democratic control of their local councils. This will be a staged process.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para8">As part of stage two of review, we want to resolve the problems that have arisen in the past from the dual statutory function of the former Urban Regeneration Agency and the Commission for the New Towns. This will give EP a common purpose and help them in taking forward their changed agenda.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proposals he has to promote the development of brownfield sites.  [40355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The development of brownfield sites is a key priority for my Department. It underpins our policy for the revival of our towns and cities and for achieving more sustainable patterns of development.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para10">We are radically overhauling the planning system so it helps promote economic prosperity by delivering land for development in the right place at the right time. Our planning policy guidance for housing (PPG3) sets out an "urban brownfields first policy" as we want to conserve greenfield land.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para11">Planning Policy is directing private sector development towards brownfield land, and measures are in place within the development control and local plan system to ensure this. For instance, local authorities must reassess greenfield sites that have been previously identified in their local plans for development, and they must thoroughly re-appraise applications for the renewal of planning permission on such sites. Regional and local planning strategies are expected to focus new housing development where brownfield sites are available. The Department is also promoting a greater use of Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) to assemble brownfield sites that are in multiple ownership.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para12">The public sector also has a direct role to play, and in this respect the Department has a Public Service Agreement target under which it aims to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". . Ensure that brownfield land will be reclaimed at a rate of over 1,100 hectares per annum by 2004 (reclaiming 5 per cent. of current brownfield land by 2004 and 17 per cent. by 2010)"
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20320w12.html_para13">The reclamation of over 1,100 hectares is specifically for the Regional Development Agencies and English Partnerships to achieve. With a forecast output of 1,200 ha for this year, they are on course to exceed it.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para14">Within the Corporate Planning process, an annual target for brownfield land reclamation is being agreed with each RDA. DTLR officials will be monitoring and encouraging progress.
<P>

<a name="20320w12.html_para15">There are many examples of RDA involvement in the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites. For instance, the South East RDA is continuing the earlier work of English Partnerships in redeveloping the former Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham Maritime in Kent, with a sustainable mixed development at this 140 ha site. The North West Development Agency is to develop a high quality business park in North Manchester, thereby bringing 25 ha of brownfield land back into use. Dursley and Gloucester Docks are sustainable mixed-use developments being undertaken by the South West of England RDA.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what recent assessment he has made of the threat to buildings and subterranean structures in London posed by sinking ground levels.  [43811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The intensity of subsidence reported in the press is very minor and is unlikely to cause damage. It is several orders of magnitude less than that experienced in the coalfields and damage is much more likely to occur from shrinking and swelling of clay subsoils in London than from subsidence at the level reported.
<P>

<a name="20320w13.html_para0">Subsidence from tunnelling operations is well known and it is taken into account in the design of tunnelling operations. Where necessary, such operations include mitigation measures to reduce the effects of subsidence to below the level likely to cause damage. The levels

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the Local Authorities (Capital Finance) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (S.I.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The incentive is voluntary, and involves agreement being reached between landlords and owners/ leaseholders. We are monitoring the use made by local authorities of the incentive offered by these regulations.

 The Department does not collect this information on its regular statistical returns.

 The Secretary of State will shortly issue guidance to bus operators and other interested parties on reducing crime against passengers and crew, on buses and at stops and interchanges. This will update existing guidance on protecting bus crews and guidelines to operators on personal security on public transport. The new guidance will include advice on the installation, maintenance and repair of on-board equipment, which could help prevent crime. Professional counselling of employees is a matter for the operating companies.

<P>
<a name="20320w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department is satisfied that there is clear evidence of an increased risk of an accident when using any type of mobile phone while driving. International research has established that the increased risk of an accident arises from the distracting effects of holding a telephone conversation rather than from just driving with one hand on the wheel. Further research, commissioned within the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme towards the end of last year, is under way to measure the distraction from hands-free phones in comparison to other common driver distractions such as talking with passengers or tuning the radio.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are no plans to make a change in the foreseeable future. The limit will stay at 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The Government consulted on this in 1998 and waited upon proposals from Europe before considering the matter further. No firm legislation was forthcoming from the European Union although the European Commission produced a Recommendation which, among other measures, recommended community wide harmonisation of the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit for motorists at 50mg. We have now considered whether it would be desirable to make such a change and concluded that we should maintain emphasis on enforcement and publicity. In reaching this decision the Government were mindful of the fact that our penalties are among the toughest in Europe. But we remain committed to combating drink-driving and support more research and collaboration at a European level.

This funding is reviewed, together with the other components of the science budget, at each Government Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="20320w15.html_para1">My officials also meet the Executive Secretaries and other members of staff of each body approximately quarterly to review progress in respect of grant in aid funded programmes, and to discuss other matters of common interest.

 Belize was considered for CDI under the three basic CDI criteria&#151;commitment to pro-poor policies, promotion of responsive and accountable government; and application of macro-economic policies to encourage sustainable development. Although some progress had been made in implementing commitments in relation to the first two criteria, on the third criterion my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development shared the concerns set out in the IMF Article IV report from April 2001, particularly in terms of significant increases in external commercial debt levels and the widening public sector deficit. Against this background she concluded that Belize had not fulfilled the CDI criteria. There is provision for a further review later this year.

 Making an effective contribution to the Millennium Development Goal of reducing maternal mortality by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 is a key objective in my Department's Public Service Agreement.
<P>

<a name="20320w16.html_para1">WHO are the lead international agency and we are supporting their work to determine the most successful and cost-effective safe motherhood packages. DFID is funding research designed to identify the most effective interventions to help reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in the developing world, including trials of vitamin A supplementation and magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia. We are also looking to draw lessons from the large safer motherhood programmes we support in Nepal, Malawi, Kenya, Pakistan and Bolivia.
<P>

<a name="20320w16.html_para2">Evidence to date indicates that increasing and sustaining the quality of midwifery and obstetric services is very likely to result in reduced maternal mortality. Evidence also shows that strengthening health systems is also a key prerequisite for improving safe motherhood. DFID has committed over &#163;1 billion to this work since 1997.

[43999]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w16.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID attaches great importance to learning and sharing lessons form successful strategies in developing countries to improve health, particularly of the poor. DFID's ability to feed country experience into international policy making, using our network of in-country health experts, is widely recognised as one of its institutional strengths. We are further contributing to the international effort by:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20320w16.html_para3">Lessons learned as a result of these efforts are used to help developing countries develop and refine their own multi-sectoral national programmes and plans for better health and poverty reduction.

 Under the Animal Health Act 1981 and the Rabies (Importation of Dogs, Cats and Other Mammals) Order 1974 (as amended) animal quarantine kennels are regulated with regard to disease security and isolation. There are standard requirements for the design, construction, operation and management of authorised quarantine premises, and it is the responsibility of the Veterinary Superintendent of the premises to ensure that these standards are met, and also to ensure the safe custody and strict isolation of each animal throughout its period of quarantine.
<P>

<a name="20320w17.html_para7">Currently, all approved quarantine premises have undertaken to abide by a Voluntary Code of Practice on the Welfare of Dogs and Cats in Quarantine Premises. But we are determined to improve the welfare standards of animals in quarantine. The Animal Health (Amendment) Act 1998 gives us the power to set statutory welfare standards in quarantine premises. In 2000 we consulted on a draft order which contained, among other things, such statutory welfare standards.
<P>

<a name="20320w17.html_para8">Work on the draft order was suspended during 2001 due to foot and mouth disease. We hope to introduce the legislation later this year.

 I saw the report of the Rural Task Force which was chaired by my right hon. Friend, the Minister of State for Rural Affairs on 15 October immediately after the report had been completed. My noble Friend, the Lord Haskins, sent me a near-final draft of his report on 2 October, but he made some subsequent amendments; the report as printed was also completed on 15 October. The earliest mutually acceptable date for publication was 18 October.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> Since April last year initiatives on illegal imports have been co-ordinated by officials in DEFRA, working closely with other Departments such as HM Customs and Excise and Food Standards Agency, as well as the local authorities and port health authorities who are responsible for controls at ports and airports.

 Draft maps of open country and registered common land for land in the south-east and lower-north west mapping regions were issued by the Countryside Agency in November 2001, with a deadline for comments of 11 February 2002. The Agency will consider the representations which it has received about the draft maps before publishing provisional maps later this year. When the provisional maps are published, anyone with an interest in land may appeal to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State against its inclusion on a provisional map. When any appeals have been dealt with the Countryside Agency will issue a conclusive map. I have indicated that we will consider the case for bringing the right of access into force on a regional basis in the light of progress in the first two regions. I shall make an announcement soon.

 Rather than a Government advertising campaign, the "Your Countryside, You're Welcome" campaign was owned by some 50 organisations who worked as partners with DEFRA, DCMS, the Countryside Agency and the English Tourism Council. Over 100 other organisations were supportive or involved in a variety of ways. No costs can be ascribed to their time and effort, nor to the high level of activity at local and regional level around the country which has helped to re-engage urban and rural interest in a positive way.
<P>

<a name="20320w18.html_para3">The total cost for the PR activity to support the "Your Countryside, You're Welcome" campaign was &#163;209,000 plus VAT.
<P>

<a name="20320w18.html_para4">This covered all fees and expenses incurred on the campaign including the launch event on 28 January, the public event in Leicester Square on 10 March, and the <i>Daily Mirror</i> promotion in the week commencing 11 March.

 The legal base of proposal 569 was article 308 of the EU treaty. The proposal was adopted as a regulation (2580&#150;2001) on 27 December 2001. The legal basis of the regulation was articles 60, 301 and 308 of the EU treaty.

<a name="20320w19.html_para5">The Government welcome this regulation as an integral part of the EU's measures to implement UNSCR 1373(2001). The UK strongly supported the timely adoption of UNSCR 1373 (2001) as a vital measure in the global campaign against terrorism. The regulation will assist in ensuring full compliance within the EU with the provisions of UNSCR 1373(2001). The Government consider the immediate freezing of assets to prevent their dissipation an essential tool in the fight against terrorism. The regulation does not limit the UK's ability to take autonomous measures against other individuals that we deem to be linked to terrorism.

 Through our bilateral aid programme, the European Union and UNWRA we support the short term needs of the Palestinian Authority.

We aim to provide a broad range of technical assistance designed to promote peace, stability and economic and social development. UK bilateral assistance is planned at &#163;14 million this year. In 2001 the UK contributed &#163;25 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency to support vulnerable Palestinian refugee communities. The Government have no specific plans to give aid to rebuild Palestinian towns in the West Bank.

<P>

<a name="20320w21.html_para1">Information the length of temporary export bars and the issue of export licences is set out in the fourth, fifth and sixth columns of the table. Temporary export bars usually take the form of a split period; the first to allow expressions of interest in purchasing the item to be made, and the second to allow the funds to be raised and the invoice paid. If there is no expression of interest by the end of the first period a licence is usually granted. If there is an expression of interest, then the deferral usually continues into the second period.
<P>

<a name="20320w21.html_para2">Items which have been under temporary export bar are usually purchased by UK institutions or private individuals, not by Government Departments. Decisions to purchase are usually made by the trustees of these institutions and they are often assisted by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund and the Resource/Victoria and Albert Museum Purchase Grant Fund. Purchase information is shown in the final column of the table, and details of contributions made each year by grant-giving bodies can be found in Appendix G of the Reviewing Committee's annual reports.

 The Government's policy on the BBC and OFCOM is set out in the White Paper "A New Future for Communications". Our aim, within the proposed three tiers of regulation, is to create a more level playing field for the BBC and the commercial public service broadcasters, while recognising the distinctive role of the BBC. At tier one (covering for example standards and subtitling but with impartiality requirements excepted) and tier two (measurable quotas, news in peak time) the BBC will be regulated by OFCOM alongside other public service broadcasters. At tier three, the Governors will continue to regulate the delivery of the BBC's remit, while the commercial public service broadcasters will be given greater freedom in the delivery of their remits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w21.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The DCMS is a mainly policy Department and has few activities capable of being outsourced. Some support services functions are able to be outsourced and during the last five years the provision of facilities management services have been contracted out after competitive tendering. The facilities services budget in total amounts to 0.15 per cent. of the total departmental budget and 5 per cent. of the administration budget. The saving of &#163;60,000 annually represents a 4 per cent. saving of the facilities services budget but has also brought unquantifiable quality savings and industrial know-how. No market testing has taken place.

 Between 1997 and September 2001 four British films, "The Full Monty", "Notting Hill", "Chicken Run" and "Bridget Jones's Diary", together grossed around &#163;700 million at the worldwide box office. Recent major budget productions attracted to these shores such as "Tomb Raider", "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "Chocolat", "Killing me Softly" and "The Mummy Returns" have contributed to the overall inward investment figure of approximately &#163;539 million in 2000. The Film Council's Premiere Fund has a budget of &#163;30 million of Lottery money over three years for the production of theatrical feature films that have the potential to attract significant audiences at home and abroad. The Film Council's most recent release, Gosford Park, has already won a Golden Globe and has been nominated for seven "Oscars". The UK was one of the earliest signatories of the European Co-Production Convention and has seven bilateral co-production agreements with other countries. The UK also has a massive talent base, providing a major contribution to the world's feature film industry.

 The Department does not hold information on which members of staff are members of the Territorial Forces. We encourage staff to become members of the Territorial Forces by allowing up to eight days paid special leave per year for training plus an additional five for special courses or exercises. We also look favourably upon requests for unpaid special leave in connection with these activities.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> This issue was thoroughly reviewed between 1997 and 1999. Following our review, the White Paper "Time for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of Our Licensing Laws (Cm 4696)", published on 10 April 2000, set out our plans for reforming the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws, including the hours during which alcohol may be sold or supplied to the public. To counter and minimise public disorder resulting from fixed closing times, we intend to introduce flexible opening hours as a condition of the licences of each venue, with the potential for some to operate up to 24 hour opening on each day of the week, subject to consideration of the impact on local residents. We intend to introduce primary legislation to implement these proposals as soon as parliamentary time permits.

 The Government have not ruled out a Royal Commission but strongly believe that resources can best be used to make immediate improvements to the operation of the 1986 Act and to promote the fullest application of the three Rs&#151;replacing the use of animals with alternative methods; reducing the number of animals needed for a particular purpose and refining the procedures to minimise suffering.

<a name="20320w23.html_para11">Nonetheless, every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee (APC) a budget for research aimed at developing or promoting the use of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used, or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering (the three Rs).

However, this is not the only money spent by the Government on seeking to develop alternatives, as other Departments also fund such work. It is estimated that the total spent on this by the United Kingdom Government is in the region of &#163;2 million each year. Industry also spends many millions of pounds each year on the search for and development of alternatives. To take this further on an international level, the United Kingdom Government will continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) through contributions to the European Union.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are in place to regulate the breeding of animals specifically for experiments; and if he will introduce further legislation on this issue.  [43996]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w23.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Breeding and supply of animals for use in experimental or other scientific procedures are regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Such animals, as described in Schedule 2 of the Act (which lists the commonly used species), may generally only be obtained from designated breeding and supplying establishments.
<P>

<a name="20320w23.html_para13">These establishments are only designated if, on the advice of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, or my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Mr. Blunkett) is satisfied that they meet minimum animal welfare standards. The standards are set out in the Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals in Designated Breeding and Supplying Establishments, presented to Parliament in 1995 under section 21 of the Act (HC 125, available&#151;along with a recently published supplement&#151;in the Library).
<P>

<a name="20320w23.html_para14">There are no plans to introduce further legislation. The Code of Practice will, however, continue to be supplemented and updated as required, to take account of any additions to Schedule 2 of the Act and of any new developments in the field of animal care.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will establish a mandatory control database to stop unnecessary experiments involving animals.  [43994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w23.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 To meet the requirements of section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, any application to use protected animals in research must be the subject of a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work. All procedures are strictly regulated and all applications for licenses to use animals are assessed to ensure that the work is necessary.
<P>

<a name="20320w23.html_para15">For that purpose the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, who offer professional advice and recommendations on licence applications made under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, use a range of resources to keep abreast of developments and results in 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 398W</I><P>
animal research, and the scientific community have established and maintained their own databases to the same end.
<P>

<a name="20320w23.html_para16">A mandatory central database would be problematic for a number of reasons. There would, in particular, be significant difficulties in ensuring the completeness and quality of the data and in ensuring that intellectual or commercial confidentiality were not compromised. We do, however, believe that there is scope for further reducing the risk of duplication of animal testing by encouraging companies to engage in data sharing. To this end, in August 2000, we announced an inter-Departmental concordat on data sharing to enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals. The concordat commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests. Progress in implementing the concordat will be reviewed in the next few months.
<P>

<a name="20320w23.html_para17">In addition, there are a number of international and national initiatives to encourage data sharing. International assessment programmes have well-established and effective methods for data sharing, ensuring mutual acceptance of data and dissemination of information on chemicals. This also extends to dissemination of data to developing countries.

<P>
<a name="20320w24.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We need to ensure that we can perform the basic duty to protect the public by punishing people for the crimes they have committed while ensuring we engage in rehabilitation to reduce re-offending and prevent crime. To this end we are committed to a radical re-think of the sentencing framework so as to give clarity and direction to the courts and avoid the damaging effects of prison overcrowding. Prison must be used as effectively as possible and targeted where it is most necessary. It should be used for incapacitating dangerous, 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 400W</I><P>
violent and other serious offenders but prison sentences should be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection, and no longer.
<P>

<a name="20320w24.html_para5">The reform of the probation service, with its central focus on reducing re-offending means that rigorously enforced community sentences are a real and tough alternative to imprisonment. We want to build on this work to provide sentencers with more than two stark options, imprisonment or a community sentence. We are looking at intermediate disposals such as intermittent custody and a strengthened suspended sentence. On community sentences the courts need to be able to mix and match with a generic sentence so that we can get it right for the individual. As part of the work taking forward the recommendations of the Halliday report on the sentencing framework we are looking at new forms of community penalties that allow the sentencer this flexibility. We aim to encourage greater use of community penalties for some non-violent offenders such as those convicted of theft and handling or fraud.
<P>

<a name="20320w24.html_para6">Home Detention Curfew and a rigorous assessment process plays an important role by enabling some prisoners to be released from prison, while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to secure employment as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="20320w24.html_para7">We are addressing the recent increase in female prison population by taking forward the Government's strategy for female prisoners. A cross-Government women's offenders reduction plan is currently being developed by a multi-agency team drawn from across the criminal justice system, which is based in the Home Office. The aim of the programme is to strengthen policy, programme, research and spending partnerships across government to reduce women's offending. This includes linking criminal justice work with broader Government efforts to tackle social exclusion, particularly as it affects women at risk of offending.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the average time taken between arrest and sentencing of <i>(a)</i> young offenders and <i>(b)</i> adult offenders was in the last 12 months; and if he will make a statement.  [42505]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply. Information is not available in the exact form requested. Figures are available on the average time between arrest and sentence for 'persistent' young offenders in England and Wales, as used to monitor the Youth Justice Pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence. The latest data available shows that for those sentenced in magistrates courts and the Crown court in the 12 months ending 30 November 2001, the latest month available, the average arrest to sentence time was 77 days. For those 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 403W</I><P>
sentenced in November 2001 the average arrest to sentence time was 67 days compared with the target of 71 days.
<P>

<a name="20320w25.html_para0">From another source of information the time between arrest and sentence can be estimated for all young offenders sentenced in magistrates courts in England and Wales. For the 12 months ending September 2001, this estimate was 60 days. Similarly for adult offenders the time between charge (the closest available date to arrest) and sentence in magistrates courts was 58 days.

 Regular statistics on the number of young offenders who break their bail conditions are not available centrally, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, Home Office research published in 1998 showed that juveniles breached their bail conditions in 30 per cent. of cases.

 The National Probation Directorate will conduct a post-contract review of the National Probation Service information systems strategy (NPSISS) contract which will include consideration of benefits delivery to the Service.
<P>

<a name="20320w25.html_para2">I can say in advance of this review that the qualitative benefits to the National Probation Service (NPS) resulting from NPSISS include; the introduction of a network infrastructure which covers 38 of the 42 probation areas; the ability for electronic communication between these areas, the Directorate, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation and the Research and Statistics Unit; and the deployment of Lotus Notes across the Service. In addition this technology has given probation staff the opportunity to develop information technology skills providing the NPS with a computer literate workforce.

<a name="20320w26.html_para5">The temporary use of spaces in a number of local prisons ended in mid-January 2002, as did the use of the accommodation at Her Majesty's Prison Rochester. In addition, the dedicated detention facilities at Her Majesty's Prison Haslar and Her Majesty's Prison Lindholme were redesignated formally as immigration removal centres on 8 February 2002, thus requiring them to operate under detention centre rules rather than prison rules. These changes will not be reflected fully in the statistics until the information on Immigration Act detainees as at 30 March

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2002]:</i> Our policy on the detention of asylum seekers in prison remains as set out in our White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven&#151;Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain". We made it clear that, although the routine use of prison accommodation for immigration detainees had ended, there would remain a need to hold small numbers of individuals, including asylum seekers, in prison for reasons of security. This would, for example, include individuals transferred to prison accommodation following the incident at Yarl's Wood removal centre on 14&#150;15 February 2002. Such individuals would be identified on the basis of the security risk they are assessed to pose rather than on the progress of any asylum or other claim they may have made. As such, individuals who are assessed to pose a security risk and who have yet to receive a decision on their asylum application may be held in prison accommodation.

<a name="20320w26.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven&#151;Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain" (Chapter 4 Paragraph 53) makes it clear that for the future, the case for abolishing the subsistence only option will be looked at and a power to allow this will be taken in forthcoming legislation. As yet we have not set any timetable for ending the subsistence only support option.
<P>

<a name="20320w26.html_para7">Paragraph 4.33 of the White Paper makes it clear that asylum seekers who refuse the offer of a place in one of the accommodation centres being trialled will not be offered any alternative forms of support. There is no reason why these proposals should lead to greater destitution among asylum seekers. We will be offering both accommodation and subsistence support to those who need it.

 The decision whether to grant bail or not is a judicial decision taken within the statutory framework provided by the Bail Act 1976. The court may refuse to grant bail where it finds there are substantial grounds to believe that one or more of the statutory exceptions in the Act apply. Where the court finds such grounds and refuses bail, it must then decide where the youth shall be remanded. The courts' powers and the restrictions on those powers are set out in section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969

<a name="20320w27.html_para5">The courts' powers to order custody in respect of persistent offenders under 16 who are convicted of non-violent offences are set out in the Powers of Criminal Courts Acts (Sentencing) Act 2000. Section 100 sets out the courts' powers to impose a detention and training order of up to two years. Section 91 sets out the Crown Court's powers to order a youth to be detained for certain serious offences for a period not exceeding the maximum term of imprisonment with which the offence is punishable in the case of an adult aged 21 or over. These powers are subject to the general restrictions in section 79 of the 2000 Act on imposing discretionary custodial sentences.

 At their conference on 7 March the Royal National Institute for the Blind, in their employment strategy document Work Matters, raised the issue of disability leave to allow people losing their sight to get time off work for intensive rehabilitation, mobility training and the opportunity to learn new skills.
<P>

<a name="20320w28.html_para0">The Disability Rights Task Force considered this and concluded that the reasonable adjustment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act provide adequate arrangements for employees affected.

 The Regulation Scrutiny Group is made up of officials from the Department and representatives appointed by the local authority associations.

<P>

<a name="20320w28.html_para1">We have already made a commitment to the local authority associations that changes to regulations will only be introduced in April and October of each year apart from in very exceptional circumstances.

<P>
<a name="20320w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 People who have been receiving incapacity benefit for more than 28 weeks normally undergo a personal capability assessment (PCA). The purpose of the PCA is to determine that a person meets the threshold of incapacity to continue receiving benefit. In addition, in selected pilot areas, examining doctors are able to produce a capability report for the person's personal adviser. The capability report helps those who wish to return to work by shifting the emphasis from disability to ability.
<P>

<a name="20320w28.html_para2">As part of the PCA process, a person may be called, where appropriate, to attend a medical examination. The importance of keeping an appointment along with the potential consequences of not attending are clearly highlighted in the supporting documentation sent to the person.
<P>

<a name="20320w28.html_para3">When a person fails to attend an appointment he or she is asked to provide written details of their reasons for non-attendance. The reasons, along with any other relevant information, are presented to a decision maker for consideration of whether there was good cause for not attending the appointment. The good cause provision acts as a safeguard for vulnerable people and those with genuine difficulties.
<P>

<a name="20320w28.html_para4">A decision maker decides good cause by considering all the evidence and applying the law to the facts of the claim. Each case is considered on merit and all relevant circumstances, including the person's state of health, are taken into account. If it is decided to withdraw entitlement, then the person can ask for the decision to be reconsidered or referred to an independent appeal tribunal.

<i>Notes for all tables:</i>
<BR>
1. It is assumed that a pensioner with HB and/or CTB entitlement was entitled to these benefits before the introduction of pension credit.
<BR>
2. Although single pensioners with income under &#163;77 and pensioner couples with income under &#163;123 face 100 per cent. marginal deduction rates their final income will be raised to the amount of the guarantee credit as a result of the introduction of pension credit.
<BR>
3. Tables 3 and 4 show gains due only to the savings credit and the extension of the applicable amounts in housing and council tax benefits by the maximum savings credit. Some pensioners will gain more because of the changes to the treatment of capital and the more generous income assessment.

<P><I>20 Mar 2002 : Column 423W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20320w30.html_para0">The hospital downrating rules prevent double provision from public funds as the publicly funded NHS maintains people while they stay in hospital as well as providing free treatment. Social security maintenance benefits are also paid from state funds. They are therefore not paid in full indefinitely where a person is in a NHS hospital and having their day to day living expenses met through the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20320w30.html_para1">The double provision principle is a key cornerstone of the system of national insurance introduced over 50 years ago.
<P>

<a name="20320w30.html_para2">However, we also recognise that people have on-going financial commitments while in hospital, and although we consider the six week rule strikes a fair balance between what the state should provide financially and the provision individuals should make for themselves, we have none the less decided to extend the period before benefits are downrated by a further seven weeks to the 13 week stage. This will mean that people previously affected by the six week rule will be able to keep their benefits untouched if their period of stay in hospital is under 13 weeks. Benefit is generally then not downrated again until after 52 weeks.
<P>

<a name="20320w30.html_para3">Benefit is adjusted in this way because, generally speaking, the national health service will have assumed the responsibility of providing for patients who have spent more than 52 weeks in hospital. The personal requirements allowance is regarded as a reasonable amount to cover small personal items not already provided by the hospital.

<a name="20320w30.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will issue advice to decision-makers for <i>(a)</i> attendance allowance and <i>(b)</i> disability living allowance to give full weight to the definition of virtually unable to walk as given in Cassinelli <i>v.</i> Secretary of State for Social Services, Times Law report 6.12.91, following the Chairman's ruling on 11 February at the reconstituted tribunal set up by the Sutton Benefits Agency office concerning Mr. Tom Mann.  [39412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20320w30.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The 1991 judgment of the Court of Appeal in Cassinelli <i>v.</i> Secretary of State for Social Services was concerned only with the meaning of the test of "severe discomfort" in relation to whether the manner in which a person could make progress on foot out of doors was so limited that he could be taken to be virtually unable to walk for the purpose of entitlement to mobility allowance. The court held that the test is one of severe discomfort rather than of severe pain or distress. This is not relevant to <i>(a)</i> attendance allowance, for which entitlement depends upon a severely disabled person's need for personal attention, supervision or watching over from another person; but <i>(b)</i> it continues to be relevant to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance, which replaced mobility allowance in 1992, and the guidance to decision makers about that component in the Decision Makers Guide cites the meaning of "severe discomfort" given in the Cassinelli judgment as the one to be followed when considering whether a person is virtually unable to walk.

 Long-term unemployed people who need help with basic skills or the English language are identified by personal advisers during the Gateway period of the New Deal. Those with a need can then be referred to help within the Gateway, including short basic skills courses. People who need more intensive, longer- term assistance are offered help through the Education and Training New Deal option which can provide courses lasting up to 26 weeks.
<P>

<a name="20320w30.html_para9">Basic skills or English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) training is provided in response to an individual's needs.

 We have no plans to increase the state pension age to 67.

<a name="20320w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Department of Work and Pensions collects information on the value of occupational pensions available in payment to current pensioners and in connection with the overall income of retired people via the Family Resources Survey. The Family Resources Survey (FRS) is a continuous survey, interviewing approximately 25,000 private households in Great Britain each year. The FRS asks a wide range of questions about people's incomes and other living circumstances, including sources of pension income.

 All our forms are constantly reviewed and regularly researched. We frequently adopt suggestions made by members of the public as well as organisations such as the Social Security Advisory Committee.
<P>

<a name="20320w31.html_para7">A radically changed minimum income guarantee (MIG) form was introduced last October after consultation with pensioners and their organisations. The new form cut the number of pages pensioners had to complete from 40 to 10 and removed questions irrelevant to the vast majority of pensioners. The Department also established a MIG helpline to enable pensioners to claim over the telephone.
<P>

<a name="20320w31.html_para8">Improvements have been made to our standard size claim forms, particularly those relating to disability benefits.

 The report "Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 2000" prepared for my Department by Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS) shows that by applying the same methodology as in previous years the average level of sickness absence was 9.9 days per staff year. This represents a small decrease over the equivalent figure of 10.1 days set out in the report for 1999. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2000 figures.
<P>

<a name="20320w32.html_para6">Calculated on the basis of absence per person, the figure for the civil service was 8.5 days. According to the CBI survey for 2000, this compares favourably with a figure of 10.2 days for the public sector as a whole and is only slightly more than the average rate of 7.8 days for all sectors.

<a name="20320w32.html_para7">Departments have published Service Delivery Agreements which contain their individual targets for reducing sickness absence. Overall the civil service has been targeted to reduce sickness absence by 30 per cent. (to 7.2 days per staff year) by 2003 against the 1998 baseline. My Department is continuing to work with other Departments and agencies as they take forward their plans to reduce sickness absence.

The officials who attend meetings may also vary depending on their availability and the topics under discussion. For these reasons we do not consider it would be appropriate to list individual names. We are currently consulting on proposals to extend the membership of the group and we will consider, in the light of replies to consultation, whether there would be a case in future for listing the names of individual members.

 Yes. Our programme for modernising the national health service (NHS) as set out in the NHS plan will rely on the provision of efficient and effective information systems to enable the benefits for patients and the public to be achieved. A common e-mail system is one component of this; by opting for a common system across the NHS the maximum benefits of value for money will be obtained. To this end, the NHS information authority is currently conducting a formal open procurement exercise for e-mail and directory services for the NHS. It is expected that subject to successful completion of negotiations a preferred bidder will be announced shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2002]:</i> I understand that while mesotherapy has a number of applications, it is of most relevance to the NHS as a method of pain relief. Mesotherapy is a treatment where local anaesthetic is injected in small amounts to an area of pain. Chronic pain relief is provided throughout the NHS in different forms, and includes the use of local anaesthetic. However, pain relief is a short-term measure and it is important that the underlying cause of the pain is identified and treated.

 The additional funds provide the opportunity for the Medical Research Council (MRC) to accelerate research on autism, building on existing strengths and addressing gaps which were identified in the report of their review of the epidemiology and causes of autism. It will complement and add to the MRC's current support for research in this field. It is likely that the range of research supported will be broader than that of the MRC review and may include research to develop and evaluate interventions.
<P>

<a name="20320w34.html_para1">The MRC will shortly be setting up a steering group which will offer detailed advice on implementation.

 Following publication of national service frameworks (NSF) for mental health and for older people, the Department has established a number of multi-agency care group workforce teams, including one focused on older people and one on mental health, to support national workforce development.
<P>

<a name="20320w34.html_para6">Standard 7 of the Older People's NSF concerns the promotion of good mental health in older people and the provision of treatment and support for older people with dementia and depression. Work undertaken to implement the framework standards, and within the care group workforce teams, will help to strengthen training and education for existing staff and support recruitment, consistent with the proposals in the NHS plan for new staff to support people of all ages with mental health problems.

However the figure given for 1999&#150;2000 is not comparable to previous years or future years, 1999&#150;2000 represents the first year that primary care group expenditure was included in the calculation and the formula used to apportion the expenditure was based on estimated data. In future years the data for primary care groups will be more detailed and the resultant figure for percentage spend will be more accurate.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> The Department has not collected any data which would enable an assessment to be made of the cost of office moves resulting from NHS reorganisation. For example, mergers of NHS trusts may involve the need to consolidate at one of those merged, or new offices entirely. The cost of this is not readily identifiable from trust accounts.
