 There are a large number of factors that affect the career progression of women, and how much they earn. These include differences in men and women&#146;s labour market experience (for example as a result of women taking time out to look after children), skills and education, occupational segregation, lack of quality part-time work (especially for women returning from maternity leave), historical culture, gender stereotyping, and pay discrimination.</p>

Research published in the British Social Attitudes survey, published on 23 January 2008, suggests that only one in six men now believe that a woman&#146;s place is in the home, compared with one in three in 1989. However the same survey found that 77 per cent. of people with partners say that the woman usually or always does the laundry, a similar proportion to that found in 1994  (81 per cent.). The British Social Attitudes Survey also found that the most liberal division of labour between women and men is found among couples where the woman works full-time, earns more than her partner, or has a partner who does not work.</p>

 To ask the Minister for Women and Equality what recent steps the Government has taken to reduce the gender pay gap in the public sector. [185375]</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 February 2008]:</i> The gender pay gap for full-time public sector workers (based on the median) was 10.2 per cent. in 2007 compared to 20.0 per cent. in the private sector. In 1997 the figures were 13.5 per cent. and 23.8 per cent. respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="80227w0001.htm_para2"><a name="08022769000055">Closing the pay gap between men and women in both the public and private sectors is a high priority for us, as Harriet Harman made clear in my statement to Parliament on women&#146;s priorities last July. We see it as an essential part of enabling families to have real choices about how they live their lives, because the pay gap plays such a large part in the unequal division of labour in the home, preventing fathers from playing a more active role in their children&#146;s early years and preventing women from fulfilling their opportunities to work. To galvanise this, closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new Equalities Public Service Agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as: giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working, and providing more access to child care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="80227w0001.htm_para3"><a name="08022769000056">In the field of local government, we have issued  &#163;500 million of capitalisation directions to 46 local authorities in the current financial year (which enables those authorities to treat equal pay costs as capital expenditure, which they can then borrow against) to enable them to make equal pay back-payments. The Minister for Local Government confirmed on 5 February that the Government will continue to support councils through a further equal pay capitalisation round in 2008-09. Capitalisation can only be used by local authorities to meet equal pay back-payments, and not for any other costs.</p>

Many difficulties can emerge following divorce or parental separation and children can be affected in a variety of ways. The Government believe that, where possible, parents should work together to agree contact and residence arrangements themselves and in the best interests of their children. The Children's Plan contains a commitment to improve support during and after family breakdown, including helping children to maintain contact with both parents. Where contact cases come to court, the child's welfare must be the court's paramount consideration. The Children and Adoption Act 2006 has extended the maximum duration of Family Assistance Orders from six to 12 months; This will expand the potential support that CAFCAS8 can provide in assisting families to respect agreements over contact The other provisions in the 2006 Act, when implemented, will give the courts more flexible powers in contact cases, including introducing contact activities, monitoring court-ordered contact, and new enforcement powers.</p>

 The target for the number of new homes to be built in local authority areas is stated in the relevant regional spatial strategy. For the Leicester city council area, this is the regional spatial strategy for the East Midlands (RSS8) adopted in March 2005. However, that document only covers the period to 2021, and only specifies a figure for the former structure plan area of Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland. That figure is 3,150 homes a year over the period 2001-2021.</p>

That review is intended to cover the period 2001-26 and to apportion housing targets down to the local authority level. The Secretary of State is currently considering the recommendations of the panel report into the examination in public of the East Midlands Regional Assembly's draft, with a view to adopting the strategy with any amendments towards the end of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="80227w0007.htm_para10"><a name="08022781000248">Neither the adopted 2005 regional spatial strategy nor the emerging review includes targets for the size of housing to be delivered. This is because it is not Government policy for the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to determine the size of housing that should be built in local authority areas. Instead, Government policy on planning for housing which is set out in Planning Policy Statement 3 requires local planning authorities to state the proportions of market housing demand likely to arise from multi-person households including families with children, and to specify the size and type of affordable housing required in particular areas, through their local development frameworks.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 February 2008]:</i> The Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), in its role as a World and EU Community Reference Laboratory for avian influenza, collaborates at an international level with many leading institutes so that information and expert advice can be shared. In particular, the VLA chairs and leads a working group, which conducts detailed scientific analysis of wild bird surveillance (AIWBS) data on avian influenza from all EU member states; this helps to continually advise and develop the European AIWBS strategy. In addition, the VLA provides direct advice, through its expert consultants, to DEFRA, EU member states, and the European Commission.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 February 2008]:</i> Scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in 2004, and subsequent advice to DEFRA from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, suggests that the bass stock is fished sustainably. With a view to providing additional protection for stocks of bass, I announced last year a review of bass nursery areas and inshore netting restrictions, for the benefit of both inshore recreational and commercial bass fishing. I am also currently consulting on a draft recreational sea angling strategy which considers a package of measures for the development of recreational sea fishing. The consultation closes on 31 March.</p>

Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) in 2006 and 2008. These confirm the earlier assessment and indicate that levels of bass landings by the commercial fishing industry (including the inshore sector) reflect the increase in stock abundance since the mid 1990s.</p>

Although stock assessments by CEFAS indicate that adult bass are more abundant than historically, large adult bass tend to be less available inshore, where smaller younger bass are more prevalent.</p>

 Departmental policy on fishing vessel decommissioning in the years 2006 to 2008 has been that general decommissioning schemes are not the most effective, nor the fairest way of reducing fleet capacity. Specifically, they do not encourage fishermen to make long-term business decisions, or provide value for money.</p>

 Where there is refuse or fly-tipping on public land, then the relevant local authority has a duty to clear it and bear the cost of removal.

However, to place a duty on the authorities and the Environment Agency to remove waste from private land would create a fly-tippers' charter. This would encourage illegal dumping rather than tackle the problem. Moreover, such a duty would place significant additional burdens on local authorities and the Environment Agency.</p>

 The only source of farm household income data measures income before tax is deducted. The official DWP low income threshold is based on income after tax. One would expect the number below 60 per cent. of the median to be lower after tax as the tax system is designed to reduce some of the inequalities in income. Household income data for rural households are not available so the answer to part <i> (b)</i> is based on working age adults living in low income households. Therefore, the answers given in part <i> (a)</i> and part <i> (b)</i> are not directly comparable. In addition it should be noted that the data used to answer part <i> (a)</i> are based on the English population while those in part <i> (b)</i> are based on incomes in the United Kingdom.</p>

It may be presented either before housing costs or after housing costs. The Farm Business Survey is not able to provide figures for household income net of tax, so farm household incomes cannot be compared directly with the low income threshold. Instead they are compared with a modified low income threshold defined as 60 per cent. of the England median, equivalised income before tax (and before housing costs). This has been calculated from 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data. Table 1 shows that:</p>

 The Student Loans Company (SLC) is responsible for producing the student loans application forms and guidance. In previous years, the application form has proactively sought the student's consent to share financial information with their HE institution. The SLC share this information with HE Institutions registered with the Higher Education Bursary Scholarship System, so that entitlement to a bursary can be assessed. The Office for Fair Access monitoring shows 12,000 students on full state support have declined to give consent so failing to collect their bursaries, DIUS ministers and officials have therefore worked closely with the SLC to improve the bursary consent arrangements on the 2008-09 student finance application form The introduction of an 'opt. out' clause, giving both the student and their sponsor an opportunity to opt out of consenting for their personal information to be shared with universities for bursary purposes, should increase the numbers of students assessed for and receiving bursaries. Clear guidance states that a decision to opt out of sharing data with universities does not affect entitlement to other forms of student support.</p>

 The Government recognises the benefits that have been demonstrated by the 101 single-non emergency number service in the initial live areas, but it is vital that we target our resources to those areas which will have the greatest impact and which will contribute most to the protection of the public and security of the country. It is on this basis and in the context of significant pressures on resources and competing policing and security priorities, that it was decided not to continue to fund centrally the ongoing operation and roll out of the 101 service.</p>

I welcome the work currently being taken forward to this effect by the Greater London Assembly together with London Councils, individual boroughs and the Metropolitan police in their plans to pilot the 101 service locally.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 February 2008]:</i> Setting a target relating to the seizure of Class A drugs would risk creating perverse incentives by encouraging the pursuit of seizures at the expense of a focus on the criminal networks and markets doing the most harm. We believe that the performance of SOCA is better measured on the basis of the quality of understanding of serious organised crime; the amounts of criminal assets recovered; evidence that criminals are finding the UK a less attractive market; and the quality of SOCA's relationships with others. SOCA reports against these measures in its annual reports.</p>

1. Figures for 2007 are not yet available for London boroughs.<br>
2. Classifying bankrupts into geographic areas is done using the postcode that the bankrupt individual provides. The use of this in assigning an individual to a borough is thus as reliable as the postcode information provided, which is subject to an element of missing or unusable data.

Therefore, when a children&#146;s homes report is requested, a copy of a redacted report&#151;which excludes the address of the home is made available. The Chief Inspector will shortly be launching a consultation to take account of the views of children, service providers and local authorities as to whether children&#146;s homes reports should be published on the Ofsted website. We will consider what steps to take, if any, when the findings of that consultation become available.</p>

 Jessica Randall died tragically, just 54 days old, on 21 November 2005 at the hands of her father who was subsequently jailed for life in March 2007. On 13 February 2008 Northamptonshire Local Safeguarding Children Board published the Executive Summary of a Serious Case Review (SGR) into Jessica Randall&#146;s death. It found that those procedures which were designed to protect Jessica were never activated, and that the outcome for her might have been different had the various indicators and signs noticed by agencies been acted upon. Every child death is a tragedy and Jessica&#146;s particularly so. I do not see, however, any reason at this time for an independent inquiry. The perpetrator of Jessica's murder has been jailed for life and local services have accepted unreservedly the serious case review's conclusions and are committed to implementing the changes necessary to better protect children in the future. That is the best way forward to ensure the lessons of Jessica&#146;s short life are fully learnt.</p>

However, as part of the Children's Plan we have given a commitment to review best practice in effective sex and relationship education (SRE) and how it is delivered in schools. We have listened to young people and recognise that many feel that they do not currently have the knowledge they need to make sale and responsible choices about relationships and sexual health. We will involve young people fully in the review to make sure that future SRE better meets their needs.</p>

 The Department does not collect information on the average length of the school lunch break. Schools are required by law to hold two sessions per day during a school term, with a break in between. But it is for schools to decide how long that break should be. We are aware that some schools have reduced the length of the lunch break for a variety of reasons. But we are also aware that having insufficient time to eat lunch can put pupils off taking a school lunch. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families wrote to schools last year asking them to consider their lunchtime arrangements as a means of improving school lunch take-up. As part of its Million Meals campaign to improve school lunch take-up, the School Food Trust is also working closely with schools to improve lunchtime arrangements, including ensuring that pupils have sufficient time to eat their meal.</p>

 A forced marriage is a marriage conducted without the full consent of both parties and where duress is a factor. It is a human rights abuse and is not sanctioned by any culture or religion. In an arranged marriage both parties consent of their own free will, and so arranged marriages are legal. We have encouraged schools through guidance to make available information about helplines and access to support for students who might be the subject of forced marriage. Following recent concerns that information was not being provided to students, my Department is looking into this issue, jointly with the Forced Marriage Unit. We will report back to the House in March.</p>

 It is not necessary to change the law so that unborn children may be treated as separate victims. Under section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 it is an offence to act to procure a miscarriage (subject to the Abortion Act 1967). And under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, it is an offence for any person intentionally to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive. Injury to a foetus, if proved, is likely to be treated in law as an injury to the mother and prosecutable under the Offences Against the Person Act 186 l. The loss of an unborn child may also be taken into account as an aggravating factor in sentencing any person convicted of killing or harming the mother.</p>

 The information requested as set out in the table is subject to important qualifications. The Prison Service Incident Reporting System processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute. Assault data is complex and may include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact incidents and allegations. Information on assault incidents may involve more than one assaulter or more than one victim. In a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>

 The prison capacity programme has &#163;2.2 billion allocated to deliver around 11,700 places. Further to this, up to &#163;120 million has been provisionally allocated for the land purchase including three Titans in the post&#151;2011 SR period and this will be subject to the usual SR process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_623"><a name="80227w0035.htm_para0"><a name="08022816002572">This programme will provide around 2,300 places in three new prisons and a further 7,500 places to be provided in three Titan prisons. The remaining places in the programme are provided in expansions to existing prison sites and conversions of some surplus MOD and NHS sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="80227w0035.htm_para1"><a name="08022816002573">Although land is still to be purchased for the Titans, no additional expenditure on land purchase has been required for the other three prisons as the land is already in NOMS ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="80227w0035.htm_para2"><a name="08022816002574">It is estimated that the proportion of costs across the whole capacity programme will be 3 per cent. for architectural or design fees, 90 per cent. for construction fees and less than 1 per cent. for legal fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="80227w0035.htm_para3"><a name="08022816002575">Where new prisons are to be procured through the Design, Construct Manage Finance (DCMF) process, the bids are evaluated on the cost per prisoner place over the lifetime of the proposed contract. A breakdown of the regime elements at the new prisons such as health care, exercise, education and detoxification facilities cannot be provided at this stage of the current ongoing DCMF competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_628"><a name="80227w0035.htm_para5"><a name="08022816002580">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, county courts jurisdictions are not coterminous with London borough boundaries, and therefore any single court&#146;s repossession actions are likely to relate to homes in a number of different boroughs.</p>

 A simplified system of banded national health service dental charges was introduced in 2006-07, alongside new commissioning and remuneration arrangements for NHS primary dental care services. Services were also evolving ahead of the changeover as increasing numbers of dental practices converted from the former general dental services (GDS) contract to personal dental service (PDS) pilots where remuneration was based on levels of care rather than item of service fees. However, levels of charge income reduced in PDS pilots because of the need to retain the old charge structure which was not calibrated to take account of the new ways of working stimulated by the new terms of service. This effect was particularly noticeable in 2005-06 when the number of PDS pilots reached their peak. The following table shows charge income for the four-year span 2003-04 to 2006-07 to give a perspective on these trends ahead of the adoption of the new charge structure in April 2006.</p>

 Dentists wishing to operate as independent contractors and planning to establish a new dental practice or surgery would generally fund the facilities themselves and secure an appropriate return on their investment from their annual service contract with their primary care trust (PCT) to provide an agreed level of national health service dental services. However, PCTs may offer dentists assistance with the start up costs of establishing new dental practices at their discretion, if they consider this appropriate and necessary.

 The information requested is shown in the following tables. Fluoridation of water offers the best prospect of reducing inequalities in oral health, but comparisons between expenditure levels in different areas are affected by a number of factors. There is no simple and direct relationship between expenditure levels and relative oral health needs. The legacy of the previous general dental service contract is that the pattern of services largely reflects where dentists previously chose to set up in practice, and how much national health service dental work they chose to undertake. In addition, levels of patient demand for dental care may not necessarily reflect levels of oral health need. The Department has no data on the levels of private dental care provided in different areas. Expenditure per head is calculated from resident population figures, but patients may attend dental surgeries outside their areas of residence.</p>

 The new general medical services contract introduced a number of steps to incentivise and improve access to general practice. New allocation and funding mechanisms such as the global sum, Quality and Outcomes Framework and enhanced services reward the work associated with each additional patient under new practice-based contracts. Therefore, every new additional patient registration attracts additional funding for each practice. In addition, substantial investment in primary care has enabled new and extended premises for general practices to increase their capacity and accept a greater number of patients to their lists.</p>

 The current system of patient registration is relatively straightforward. However, the Department acknowledges that the current rules on eligibility to register for free primary medical services for foreign nationals are unclear and much is left to the discretion of individual general practitioners (GPs) and practices. The Department is undertaking a joint review of Access to the NHS by foreign nationals with the Home Office. The review is due to be completed shortly and any new proposals will then go out to public consultation.</p>

 There is no requirement for any general practitioner (GP) practice to extend their opening hours. Under proposals put to the BMA&#146;s General Practitioners Committee, the average GP practice which provides three hours extended opening per week could expect to receive around &#163;19,000 per year, where they choose to provide such services to their patients. This would be funded by making more effective use of existing resources within the current GP contract arrangement. In addition, we have offered to invest an additional 1.5 per cent. increase through the GP contract, worth just over &#163;100 million. This would be a further boost in investment, provide  greater improvements for patients and is a good deal for GPs.</p>

 1. The figures show the median waiting times for patients still waiting for admission at the end of the period stated. Inpatient waiting times are measured from decision to admit by the consultant to admission to hospital.<br>
 2. Median waiting times are calculated from aggregate data, rather than patient level data, and therefore are only estimates of the position on average waits. In particular, specialties with low numbers waiting are prone to fluctuations in the median. This should be taken into account when interpreting the data.<br>
 3. Medians are not provided for inpatients not seen with total of less than 50 because this population is too small for a statistically meaningful median to be calculated so a n/a shown in that case.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_668"><a name="80227w0043.htm_para6"><a name="08022816004356">Implementation of the Department's research strategy &#147;Best Research for Best Health&#148; is resulting in an expansion of our research programmes and in significant new funding opportunities for health research. The National Institute for Health Research, set up as part of that implementation process, has awarded a &#163;2 million programme grant to support research on improving physical health and reducing substance use, particularly cannabis use, in severe mental illness. Research on cannabis use and psychosis will also form part of the work programme of the Institute's South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and Institute of Psychiatry Biomedical Research Centre which the Department began funding in April 2007.</p>

Following the settlement of the comprehensive spending review last October, total expenditure on the NHS will rise to &#163;110 billion by 2010-11. We have made very substantial resources available to the NHS from which to provide treatments and services for the population. However, the responsibility for the provision of all NHS services now rests with primary care trusts (PCTs) and NHS funds are not ringfenced for particular treatments. Ultimately, PCTs in conjunction with their relevant strategic health authority should plan, develop, commission or provide heath services, and decide what proportion of their budgets they spend on particular health services, including mental health services, according to the needs of their local communities.</p>

The information available under RIDDOR 95 includes three categories of severity of injury to workers: fatal injuries, defined major injuries and other injuries leading to more than three days absence (over-3-day).<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Identified by Standard Industrial Classification 1992 (SIC92) code 85.111, which covers activities of hospitals with or without NHS trust status. Such activities are:<br>
medical and surgical technical care activities such as diagnosis, treatment;<br>
operations, analyses, emergency activities, etc;<br>
accommodation activities such as boarding, meals, etc; and<br>
This includes short or long term hospital activities of general and specialised hospitals, sanatoria, preventoria, asylums, mental hospital institutions, rehabilitation centres, leprosaria and other health institutions which have accommodation facilities, including military and prison hospitals.<br>
The activities are chiefly directed to in-patients and carried out under the direct supervision of medical doctors. This classification excludes:<br>
health activities for military personnel in the field (code 75.22);<br>
private consultants&#146; services to in-patients (code 85.12);<br>
dental activities without accommodation (code 85.13); and<br>

The next stage review is producing reports on eight key areas of care, including end of life care. Publication of the End of Life Care Strategy has been delayed until summer 2008, to allow the findings of the next stage review to inform and strengthen the national strategy.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list his Department's <i> (a)</i> current and <i> (b)</i> planned private finance initiative and public private partnership contracts by (i) total end of life debt owed by the state by final year of payment and (ii) annual state payment by year; and what the total comparative value is of the assets provided. [170540]</p>

<p><a name="st_498"><a name="08022816005076"><a name="80227w0046.htm_spnew0"><a name="08022816005506"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 There are many hundreds of contracts negotiated annually between national health service bodies and private sector suppliers for a full range of services and equipment that involve elements of public private partnerships. These range from service contracts with private hospitals and social care placements to leases of equipment and private finance initiative contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_682"><a name="80227w0046.htm_para0"><a name="08022816005077">Of the three major areas of public private partnership contracts for which information is collected centrally&#151;private finance initiative (PFI) schemes, NHS local improvement finance trusts (NHS LIFT) and independent treatment centres (ISTCs)&#151;lists have been placed in the Library. For PFI and NHS LIFT the lists show only those schemes which have reached financial close as it is not possible to predict final capital values and annual payments on schemes which are still in the planning or procurement stages. The lists show the estimated capital value of each scheme (an approximation to asset value), where appropriate, as well as the annual unitary payment made by each NHS body to their private sector partner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_683"><a name="80227w0046.htm_para1"><a name="08022816005078">For ISTCs, the table shows the total contract value for Wave 1 schemes. The total contract value represents the estimated nominal value at the time of signing, calculated in accordance with an estimate of the inflation index as specified in each contract. Procurement of Phase 2 of the ISTC programme is ongoing and all contractual values remain commercial in confidence at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_684"><a name="80227w0046.htm_para2"><a name="08022816005079">In the case of the PFI schemes, under current accounting standards the facilities do not appear on the balance sheet of the NHS body during the life of the contract; and by the end of the contract all the debt raised by the private sector has been paid back. So</p>

<p><a name="stpa_685"><a name="80227w0046.htm_para3"><a name="08022816005080">although the facility will have a residual value when it reverts to the ownership of the NHS trust or primary care trust at the end of the contract, it will go on their balance sheets as an asset without an off-setting liability or &#145;debt&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_686"><a name="80227w0046.htm_para4"><a name="08022816005081">In the case of NHS LIFT schemes the facilities also do not appear on the balance sheet of the NHS body during the life of the contract. However, the shorter contract lengths (typically 25 years compared with 30 or more in a PFI scheme) means there is a small outstanding debt owed by the NHS LIFT project company at the end of the contract (i.e. their outstanding borrowings). In NHS LIFT this is a project company &#145;risk&#146; in terms of recouping enough from the future use or disposal of the asset to meet this debt (known as &#145;residual value risk&#146;). The NHS body has an option to buy the facility or walk away from the contract, in which case the project company must look to sell the facility on the open market or lease it out again. So again, there is no &#145;debt&#146; owed by the NHS body at the end of the contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_687"><a name="80227w0046.htm_para5"><a name="08022816005082">In the case of the ISTCs, where the contract lengths are much shorter, many of the contracts involve a residual value payment to the contractor at the end of the term. This means that in this case the &#145;residual value&#146; risk lies with the NHS (i.e. the risk here is that the theoretical residual value will exceed the actual market value that can be achieved). So there is a &#145;debt&#146;  <br>
