 DFID tracks expenditure on programmes which include governance amongst the objectives. This is a broad category covering different aspects of state building and the building blocks for democracy.

DFID&#039;s bilateral expenditure on programmes which include governance amongst the objectives is &#163;224 million to date (15 February 2005) in 2005&#150;06 or 12.5 per cent. of total spending of &#163;1.8 billion.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps are being taken by his Department to assist victims of violence and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with particular reference to victims of sexual violence.  [52203]</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60322w02.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The continuing high levels of sexual violence and human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reflect the prevailing culture of impunity in the DRC. The UK is working with the international community to deal with the causes and symptoms of this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">We are supporting humanitarian agencies to provide medical assistance to victims of sexual violence, particularly in the Eastern DRC. We have recently started to fund the Norwegian non-governmental organisation (NGO) Christian Relief Network to set up and run a wing in Panzi hospital, South Kivu, treating women suffering from fistula&#151;which is one of the most serious and devastating consequences of sexual violence. Their programme includes psychological support for patients as well as medical treatment. We are also supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross, who have recently launched a gender based violence pilot programme in the East. The UK will be spending approximately &#163;27 million this financial year 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2006 : Column 371W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
on humanitarian and health service delivery projects in the DRC through the UN and NGOs. Many of these provide assistance to victims of sexual violence and we remain ready to support other appropriate and effective interventions in this area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_8">It is also vital to tackle the underlying causes of sexual violence and other abuses of human rights. One of the ways to end the cycle of human rights violations in the DRC is to end the conflict in the country and the whole Great Lakes region. Conflict reduction is the major focus of the UK&#039;s engagement in the DRC. We have consistently pushed the Congolese transitional government for faster progress in a number of areas that are critical for making the democratic process a success and avoiding a return to conflict, notably preparations for elections, security sector reform, disarming militias and ending corruption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_9">The UK has also been working with the DRC authorities and non-governmental organisations to try and start reforming the Congolese justice sector and restoring the rule of law, to reduce the culture of impunity that allows sexual violence to happen and

<a name="stpa_10">Ill-disciplined and underpaid members of the Congolese armed forces (FARDC-Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo) also create insecurity for local communities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of levels of corruption in Nigeria; and what steps are being taken by his Department to promote and support good governance there.  [52202]</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60322w02.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 As for other countries, DFID&#039;s assessment of corruption and governance in Nigeria draws on a range of analysis, including that by the World Bank and by national and international non-governmental organisations. DFID&#039;s own Drivers of Change analysis, undertaken in 2004, highlighted Nigeria&#039;s history of systematic mismanagement of oil revenues as one of the main constraints to poverty reduction in Nigeria. In 2005, DFID and other development partners supported a national benchmarking of State governments, which measured a range of governance indicators, including what each State has done to address corruption. DFID is currently working with the World Bank to undertake a review of public financial management at Federal and State level, using the internationally agreed Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) benchmarks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_11">Improved governance is one of the three pillars of Nigeria&#039;s poverty reduction strategy, the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). As part of its support to NEEDS, DFID is providing technical support for reforms in public financial management and service delivery systems at both Federal and State level. At the Federal level, DFID supports reforms which are being implemented by a team of Ministers put in place by President Obasanjo following the 2003 elections. Discernible progress has been made on economic reform and on fighting corruption. At State level, DFID is focusing its support on a group of states that have shown, particularly through the benchmarking exercise noted earlier, that they are committed to better governance and transparency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_12">DFID is also supporting reforms in the police and justice sector, along with support for measures to improve the electoral process in 2003 and 2007. DFID will shortly launch a new programme of assistance to enhance the capacity of the National Assembly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_13">Nigeria is leading the world in taking forward the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to promote transparency in the use of oil revenue. Complementing the support which DFID has provided for the EITI globally, DFID in Nigeria has provided specific technical and financial support to a unit in the Finance Ministry responsible for coordinating audits of oil and gas revenue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w02.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_14">DFID and the FCO are jointly providing technical support to the work of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of a number of high profile corruption cases in recent months. EFCC investigations have led to the early retirement and subsequent imprisonment of the Inspector General of Police, the removal of the Education Minister and the resignation of the Senate President. Most recently, EFCC provided evidence that led to the impeachment of the former Governor of Bayelsa State, after he jumped bail on money laundering charges in the UK. The former Governor is now being prosecuted in Nigeria.

 In harbour authority areas, it is for the harbour authority to decide whether ship-to-ship transfers may take place&#151;provided that the harbour authority has an oil spill contingency plan, approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which covers such activities. Elsewhere in UK territorial waters, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency has non-statutory arrangements and procedures under which ship owners and operators are expected to notify the Maritime and Coastguard Agency of the intention to carry out a ship-to-ship transfer, and to carry out such transfers according to best practice.

<a name="stpa_26">New rolling stock has to comply after a transitional period of two years. The design of new UK freight rolling stock is such that it is already likely to be compliant. The UK has negotiated permanent specific cases for locomotives and diesel multiple units to allow for the constraints that the limited UK loading gauge presents to fitting onboard noise shields, but there may be a small increase for cab soundproofing in the cost of new locomotives. For refurbished rolling stock it is only necessary to demonstrate that noise has not been increased. There is no impact on track.

A Local Authority Circular 1/95 Guidance on Decriminalised Parking Enforcement Outside London&quot; has been issued to guide them in these duties. Records are not kept centrally of the number of unlawful PCNs issued but it is likely that an appeal against such a PCN would be allowed by the parking adjudicators and local authorities pay close attention to the results of appeals. It is also likely that the local government ombudsman would accept an invitation to investigate a local authority that persistently issued PCNs that were not in accordance with the national and local regulatory framework.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60322w08.html_spnew7"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The Department works mainly through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to deliver business education provision via higher education institutions in England. The following are just some examples of the steps my Department is taking to support business education in universities in the North East.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_51"><i>Preparing students for business through business education.</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">Professional and other business services1 was identified as a priority at level 4 in the North East skills action plan, so HEFCE were keen to ensure this subject area received additional student numbers (ASNs) from the managed growth allocation last year. They were identified as one of HEFCE&#039;s priorities in the selection process, and in the end they allocated 388 full-time equivalents (25 percent.of the total North East allocation) to business related subjects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_53">Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the North East are committed to business and management, not least because leadership has been identified as a key contributor to the economic future of the region. For example, the University of Northumbria is in the midst of expanding its business school in the centre of Newcastle. The school (together with law and design) will be moved into new high profile, high spec premises as part of a strategy to ensure these three key schools gain synergies from closer working through co-location. There are other campus developments across the region that may not directly improve the infrastructure of business studies, but will improve the facilities for business to interact with the university.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_54">More generally, HEFCE have encouraged institutions to think about getting students ready for business through their HEROBC and HEIF funding. Over the years these funding streams have provided placements, developed employability skills, encouraged graduate entrepreneurship, facilitated spin offs, established incubator space and created real links between business and students. Between August 2006 and July 2008, over &#163;9.4 million will go into the North East in HEIF III funding through the core institutional allocations.

<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_56">This is slightly different, as business is the end user. HEFCE have targeted investment in this area through HEROBC and HEIF. The HE business and community interaction survey (http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2005/05&#095;46/) provides a good breakdown of where the funding has been used in the past, for example to increase the amount of continuing professional development (CPD) and short courses run businesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_57">The North East Higher Skills Network (NEHSN)&#151;the region-wide Lifelong Learning Network&#151; will also impact on this in the future as it will aim to increase the skills levels of those at work in the North East in three key employment sectors (manufacturing, health and business). The region successfully bid for &#163;5.5 million last year to establish the NEHSN, and we hope to see activity take over the next year. The network will encourage progression for employees from vocational backgrounds and provide information, advice and guidance on how their careers could be enhanced through further study. It will also create links with employers and Sectors Skills Councils (SSCs) to ensure qualifications are fit for purpose and meet the needs of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2006 : Column 395W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
business. We expect the network to look at ways of accrediting work based learning and also interact with Train to Gain, Business Links and other regional business service providers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w08.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_58">Through previous HEIF rounds, a number of specific employer related initiatives have been established. There is a region wide New Technology Institute that is now funded by the RDA, but which came from a HEFCE funded imitative from 2001. Knowledge House has received several years of funding through HEIF competitions and is a gateway for business as well as research consultancy. More recently two Centres for Knowledge Exchange in the region have been funded.

<a name="stpa_59">Sunderland (Global Automotive Technology Exchange &#151;GATE) was established to identify emerging technologies in the automotive sector and develop exploitation routes for the benefit of UK manufacturing industry, involves transferring existing technology from the UK HEI partners to industry, developing technology with industrial partners and promoting these via the GATE partnership. GATE has been successful in supporting joint R and D projects and encouraging academics to become more proactive in seeking out and servicing the requirements in industry (significant rise in the numbers of academics and students engaging in technology transfer). Teesside&#151;Digital Knowledge Exchange (DKE) has helped to develop advanced services in digital media. It has helped Teesside to create a core team of experienced developers, researchers and business people able to respond rapidly to the needs of digital sector. The team also acts as a focus for further activity drawing on additional help from external research teams, academics, graduates, students and partner bodies.

 Rather than offset, the concentration of effort has been on more efficient energy use. Some good progress has been made.

The Carbon Trust has been working in partnership with the Parliamentary Estates Directorate (PED) to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, help reduce energy consumption and develop a corporate strategy for the management of carbon dioxide. The PED will shortly be discussing a new partnership with the Carbon Trust to start in April 2006.

 The latest estimate of the average cost of a false alarm attended by the fire and rescue service is &#163;1,970. The cost of false fire alarms is estimated by calculating the proportion of fire service call-outs that are not related to an incident, and assuming that the proportion of total expenditure by the fire and rescue service on call-outs is attributable to false alarms. This is likely to be an overestimate, as less time and resource is generally used during false alarms than in tackling genuine incidents. Calculations produce a national average figure, but the methodology does not allow us to produce estimates for individual FRS areas.

<a name="stpa_77">In 2005&#150;06 the Government more than doubled its contribution to the cost of local authorities&#039; civil protection activities in England and Wales to &#163;40.7 million. This increase significantly enhanced the capacity of local authorities to deal with the effects of a wide range of emergencies, including terrorism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w11.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_78">The bulk of the &#163;40.7 million was added to formula grant (Revenue Support Grant and national non-domestic rates) which is distributed according to a broadly population-based formula. This is an unhypothecated grant and it is not therefore possible to provide an amount given to each authority for a particular function.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w11.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_79">As a result of the devolution settlement, the National Assembly for Wales is responsible for the payment of funding to local authorities in Wales. &#163;2.263 million was therefore transferred to the National Assembly for Wales for distribution to the Welsh unitary authorities. This is currently being delivered by a hypothecated grant mechanism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w11.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_80">The level of civil protection funding for Scottish local authorities and the way it is distributed is the responsibility of the Scottish Executive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w11.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_81">Local authorities also undertake a wide range of mainstream activities which contribute to the prevention of terrorism (eg CCTV installation, community cohesion). Disaggregated figures for these activities in each of the authorities are not available.

 Private pensions in the form of personal pensions and stakeholder pensions are contractual arrangements between individuals and scheme providers. The Financial Services Authority&#039;s (FSA) product disclosure rules for personal pensions require that point-of-sale literature includes a description of the charges that can be incurred and a projection illustrating the potential fund values along with the effect of charges at various points in the product&#039;s lifecycle. Amongst other things, this is intended to highlight the effects of any transfer penalties in the early years after purchase.

<a name="stpa_88">In 2001 the Government introduced the stakeholder pension to provide good value pensions for people who could not join an occupational pension scheme. One of the features of the stakeholder pension is that where a member wants to transfer out of the stakeholder pension, regulations provide that the scope for charges and deductions is very limited. The FSA&#039;s product disclosure rules for stakeholder products reflect these regulatory requirements.

 The appointment of the chair of the Olympic Lottery Distributor was a public appointment.

The appointment was made following an open competition and taking account of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice. The decision was governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit and by the well-informed choice of individuals whose abilities, experience and qualities matched the need of the public body in question.

<i>[holding answer 7 March 2006]:</i> The use of vaccination against outbreaks of avian influenza in recent years has been well documented in many scientific articles and papers. The reporting of this field use of vaccines has been complemented by more controlled laboratory studies. My officials have examined the published material and consulted with experts at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_151">It has been a frequently recognised feature of the use of vaccine in the field that vaccinated birds can continue to allow spread of the virus, whilst not showing typical clinical signs. This is particularly true if large numbers of birds have been vaccinated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_152">It is therefore widely recognised that the most important factors in any Al control programme are continued biosecurity, early detection, separation of poultry from wild birds, the slaughter of diseased birds and dangerous contacts, and movement controls around outbreaks. However, we keep the policy on vaccination under review in the light of scientific developments in vaccines.

<i>[holding answer 17 March 2006]:</i> Good progress has been made since this Government&#039;s strategy on waste, was published in May 2000. Latest figures for 2004&#150;05 show that recycling and composting rates for household waste have doubled to 22.9 per cent., putting local authorities on course to meet the 2005 national recycling and composting target of 25 per cent. In 2003&#150;04, 28 per cent. of municipal waste had some sort of value recovered from it. Despite expected further increases in recycling the 2005 target of recovering value from 40 per cent. of municipal waste seems unlikely to be met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322w23.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_165">The amount of most kind of wastes going to landfill has decreased&#151;down from 82 per cent. to 72 per cent. for municipal waste (1998&#150;89 and 2003&#150;04) and from 50 per cent. to 44 per cent. for industrial and commercial waste (1998&#150;89 and 2002&#150;03), putting us on course to meet our 2005 target of reducing the amount of commercial and industrial waste landfilled to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998. More detailed information on performance against targets can be found in the annex to the consultation document on the review of England&#039;s Waste Strategy available on: http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/wastestratreview/index.htm

Notes:<br>

1. PDS schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations are estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15 months. There will be a break in the registrations series at the point at which PDS schemes were introduced as the proxy registrations build up. Falls in registration rates will be particularly pronounced in the financial year 2004&#150;05, when the majority of PDS schemes were introduced.<br>

2. Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations, for example, dental access centres, and are therefore not directly comparable with 2004 and 2005 data.<br>

 Drug related crime is generally defined as crime committed by drug misusing offenders to fund their drug misuse. The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) was introduced by this Government as a specific response to the problem. It is part of the largest investment ever in addressing the misery caused by drugs in our communities.

<a name="stpa_197">The intensive form of programme operates in 97 areas, including Peterborough, with historically high levels of drug related crime and provides a route out of crime and into drug treatment. It brings to bear on offenders a range of interventions such as drug testing and restriction on bail to ensure that drug misusers 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2006 : Column 463W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
confront their offending behaviour and receive drug treatment&#151;for which waiting times have been substantially reduced over the past three years.

<a name="stpa_198">The most prolific of these offenders are also targeted by the Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) Programme. In Peterborough both the DIP and PPO schemes are well managed and effective. They have received additional Government funding to work together to ensure their joint operations and working are properly developed. Working closely with the police, the Nene Project in Peterborough is an excellent example of a multi-agency partnership approach that has contributed to a reduction in acquisitive crime and was highly commended in the Office of Public Management Annual Leadership Awards.
</p>

<a name="60322w28.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_199">We continue to make the fight against drug related crime more effective&#151;for example, following the 2005 Drugs Act, drug testing on arrest for a trigger offence (and a required assessment for drug treatment) was implemented in three areas on one December 2005 and will be rolled out to Peterborough on 31 March 2006.

From July of this year, and building on successful pilots, UKPS plan to extend this passport validation service (PVS) to financial institutions who receive passports as evidence of identity from customers opening bank accounts, seeking mortgages or undertaking other financial transactions.

In sum, the advice was that the release of detailed, material commercial information about QinetiQ during the IPO process could possibly result in failure to comply with legal obligations which require the QinetiQ prospectus (published on 25 January) to be the source of information on which investors decide whether or not to buy shares in QinetiQ. The period that this advice applied to ended on 11 March.

 Social Exclusion is a multi faceted problem and there are many Home Office programmes and funding streams that contribute towards tackling it. Fear of crime, antisocial behaviour and community cohesion, reinforce social exclusion, and we are working closely with other government departments to tackle these issues.

decent behaviour. The plan includes measures to tackle the causes of unacceptable behaviour by targeting the most disadvantaged communities and working on a national network of intensive family support projects. This will reinforce government efforts to improve the life chances of those in greatest need and tackle the cycle of inter-generational disadvantage.

Since 2002 the strategy has reached over 10,000 practitioners&#151;and through them an estimated three million people.

Firm Foundations, (Home Office, 2004), sets out the Government&#039;s framework for Community Capacity Building. The Active Citizenship for Active Learning (ALAC) programme also helps adults develop the skills and confidence to make a difference as an active citizen. In addition, we have recently funded a series of problem solving projects to learn more about how to involve socially excluded groups. We are also investing &#163;150 million through the ChangeUp programme to improve the support services available to voluntary and community sector organisations, including those working to tackle social exclusion. And we are working with other Departments and local authorities to foster improved cohesion between different communities. We are providing new resources through the Faith Communities Capacity Building Fund to fund work by faith groups which promote better understanding and dialogue between different faith communities.
