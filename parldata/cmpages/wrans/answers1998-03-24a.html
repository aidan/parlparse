<a name="80324w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Levitt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in how many fatal road accidents in the last three years over-tiredness has been assessed to be a contributory factor.  [34336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 Information is not at present collected on the causation of injury road accidents on a national basis. However, research commissioned by the Department estimated that tiredness is a principal contributory factor in around 10 per cent. of road accidents. Details of this research were published in TRL Report 169 (1995), <i>Driver sleepiness as a factor in car and HGV accidents</i>.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he plans to publish the findings of the English House Condition Survey 1996; and if he will publish a summary of its main findings.  [35710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The findings of the 1996 English House Condition Survey will be published through a detailed and priced report. There will also be a separate summary document of key findings available free of charge. Publication is expected within the next two months.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for local authorities in each of the years 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 <i>(a)</i> the total number of statutory notices served under section 189 of the Housing Act 1985, <i>(b)</i> the total expenditure on grants made to owners of properties on whom section 189 notices were served, <i>(c)</i> the total number of statutory notices served under section 352 of the Housing Act 1985 and <i>(d)</i> the total expenditure on grants made to owners of properties on whom section 352 notices were served.  [35707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Department does not hold information in the form requested. Such information as we do hold is set out in Housing and Construction Statistics 1985-1995, Table 7.9 (Unfit dwellings, England), a copy of which has been placed in the House Library.

<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1998 : Column: 84</I><P>
will be those contained in the answer to the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson) of 4 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>288</i>.  [35857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Yes. We will issue amended housing policy guidance for the West Midlands shortly setting out clear policies that authorities should pursue in their development plans to increase the amount of housing on previously developed land to make provision for affordable housing and to ensure sustainable locations for development within transport corridors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the current regulations controlling the nature, size and location of highway signs in areas of outstanding natural beauty and National Parks; and if he will make a statement.  [35948]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 1994 were framed, and are currently being updated, to balance the interests of road safety, efficient traffic management and the environment in the design and use of signs so that traffic authorities can, as far as practicable, provide signs appropriate to local conditions. My Department has published guidance on designing signs effectively so that they are not larger than they need to be for the information they contain. We are also actively supporting the Countryside Traffic Measures Group's initiative to investigate the extent to which local traffic management and traffic calming schemes--and associated signs--can be effective in meeting their traffic objectives, whilst being designed with sensitivity to the countryside environment in which they are set. This includes projects in two National Parks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 16 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>438</i>, if he will request the Rail Regulator to discuss with <i>(a)</i> Railtrack and <i>(b)</i> TOCs the public provision of national time tables for future years.  [36081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 Railtrack meets the train operating companies to discuss bids for train services which are subsequently incorporated into the national timetable. The Rail Regulator is also involved in the process and he can be approached by either party if they were dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussions. Demand for future services is subject to fluctuation and discussions therefore tend to focus on services that are to be included in the next edition of the timetable rather than for many years ahead.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what provision he is making for the cost of rail services secured by English Passenger Transport Executives in 1998-99. [36330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A special grant Report has been laid before the House today for the payment of Metropolitan Railways Passenger Services Grant in 1998-99 to English Passenger Transport Authorities 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1998 : Column: 85</I><P>
(PTAs). The main purpose of the grant is to provide support to those PTAs for the local rail services secured by the PTAs' Passenger Transport Executives under the terms of franchise agreements with franchise operators and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions by what means and according to what timetable his Department is proposing to consult regional authorities regarding their views on international air service access to regional airports.  [35437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Department is already aware of the support of a broad spectrum of regional interests for a greater degree of liberalisation of international air services to regional airports.

Establishment
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Swinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the (i) location of, (ii) running costs of, (iii) salary costs of and (iv) number of staff based at the Head Office of the <i>(a)</i> Planning Inspectorate and <i>(b)</i> Building Research Establishment; and for these bodies if he will list the percentage of (1) staff, (2) salary costs and (3) running costs which are based in (A) London and (B) Scotland. [36108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Planning Inspectorate is an Executive Agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and of the Welsh Office. As of 2 March 1998, the Planning Inspectorate had 440 staff based at its Headquarters offices in Bristol and Cardiff. The Inspectorate's gross running cost allocation for the current year is &#163;29.254 million. Forecast outturn for the paybill is &#163;18.895 million. None of the staff are based in offices in London or Scotland. The Planning Inspectorate has no jurisdiction for planning appeals and other statutory functions under the Planning Acts in Scotland, for which there is a separate Inquiry Reporters Unit, which is part of the Scottish Office Development Department in Edinburgh.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para0">The Building Research Establishment was privatised in March 1997; the Department therefore no longer has responsibility for its operations.

<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the result of the Transport Council held in Brussels on 17 March.  [36417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 The first Transport Council of the current UK Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers met under my Chairmanship in Brussels on 17 March. My hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London represented the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para1">I particularly welcome the progress the Council was able to make on proposals for establishing a new European Aviation Safety Authority. There is strong support among Member States for these proposals, and it 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1998 : Column: 86</I><P>
was agreed that work should continue with the aim of adopting a Council decision in June. The Council also took note of progress on a draft negotiating mandate for Community membership of the EUROCONTROL air traffic management organisation, again with a view to adoption in June.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para2">The Council discussed the Community's role in EC/US air transport negotiations, in the light of the Commission's existing mandate and a recommendation by the Commission for supplementary negotiating directives. It was agreed that officials should undertake further technical work with a view to more extensive discussion at the June Council. Several Ministers expressed regret that the Commission has recently sent Reasoned Opinions to a number of Member States.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para3">The Council reached a common position on a Regulation on vehicle national identification signs, under which Member States would not require a separate national sign where on is already included (in specified form) in the vehicle number plate, and (with Germany abstaining) adopted a Regulation on the harmonisation of statistics on the movement of freight by road. The council agreed Conclusions welcoming the Commission's recent Communication on satellite navigation systems.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para4">The Council made significant progress in its consideration of the proposed directive on heavy goods vehicle taxation and charging. The Presidency put forward a compromise proposal, with further modifications in response to concern expressed by delegations, but agreement proved beyond reach.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para5">The Commission reported on its negotiations with the Swiss Government on proposals for a land transport agreement between the Community and Switzerland. Following clarification of some outstanding points, a substantial number of delegations were broadly supportive. Presidency Conclusions reflecting the Council discussion were drawn. The General Affairs Council will take the final decision for the Community on a series of proposed agreements with Switzerland.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para6">Several delegations requested a study into the employment effects of the abolition in 1999 of duty-free sales for intra-Community travel. I agreed to forward the comments raised to the Chairman of ECOFIN.
<P>

<a name="80324w01.html_para7">I made a short statement on the Presidency's plans to present a paper to the June Council on the subject of transport safety across the modes. This will set out proposals for exchanges of information and regular reporting by the Commission on safety in all modes and in all EU Member States.

<a name="80324w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the impact on litigants involved in expensive, lengthy or complex cases of the introduction of contracting between the Legal Aid Board and legal service providers.  [35237]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Contracting is a flexible tool, which will allow the Legal Aid Board to test different arrangements to determine which are most suitable for different types of case. We believe that individual negotiated contracts are likely to prove most appropriate in expensive cases.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps his Department is planning to concentrate the legal aid budget on promoting access to the judicial system for the poorest and on cases which raise issues of wider public interest.  [35236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We are consulting on our proposals to begin:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to focus on the priority needs of the poor by concentrating legal aid more tightly on cases that cannot be funded in the private sector and which are of high priority;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to support cases which have a significant public interest and might otherwise not be brought.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80324w02.html_para0"><P>

<a name="80324w02.html_para1">These are the first two steps in the Government's plans to modernise legal aid which are set out in the consultation paper, "Access to Justice with Conditional Fees", which was published on 4 March.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list planned expenditure on hospitality for April and May, indicating the date, location and purpose of each event.  [35120]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no expenditure currently planned for Ministerial hospitality for April or May 1998. It is not, however, possible to provide a comprehensive estimate for total expenditure on Ministerial hospitality as the majority of events and meetings will not be finalised until nearer the time.

 Prior to March 1997, nuclear accident response exercises were categorised as major, medium and minor; descriptions of the scales of these exercises were given in the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1995. They were then recategorised as Grade A, B, C and D. This was done to give external agencies a better understanding of the levels of our exercises by reference to the co-ordination levels detailed in the Home Office publication "Dealing with Disaster". The definitions of these exercises are:

<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The targets I gave on 19 June have not changed but two of them require clarification as follows:
<P>

<a name="80324w03.html_para4">Performance Target (b)--Numerical Weather Prediction Index for the UK (UKNWP). This performance target is intended to be a three year target, which will be set annually for the following three years. However, an adequate baseline is not available on which to set targets for intermediate years. The first target is therefore to improve the UKNWP index by four index points by March 2000 from a baseline of 100.00 in March 1997.




<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1998 : Column: 92</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80324w03.html_para5">Performance Target (c)--Service Quality Index (SQI). It has now been agreed that the target for each year should be directly related to the agreed customer requirements for the component services represented in the index. This means that from a baseline of 100.00 in 1996-97 the target for 1997-98 is to increase the SQI by 3.2 index points (not 1 as stated previously).

 Since November the Committee has been considering two proposals, one from the BBC and one from Channel 4, to make a documentary series about the work of the House. I wish to advise the hon. Gentleman that the Committee has agreed that such a series might be useful in helping to give a clearer idea of Parliamentary practice and procedure, explain the legislative process and to give an insight into the work of hon. Members.
<P>

<a name="80324w03.html_para6">Of the two options, the Committee considered that the Channel 4 proposal was the more appropriate, as the way the series would be structured offered less disruption to the work of the House.
<P>

<a name="80324w03.html_para7">The House authorities are therefore beginning detailed negotiations with Channel 4 and Partners in Production, who will make the series. Subject to a successful outcome to these negotiations, it is envisaged that filming will commence at the time of the Queen's Speech this year, and continue throughout 1999.

 I am grateful for the Food Advisory Committee's advice that there are no consumer safety concerns associated with the use of this pigment in animal feed.

 The Lome Convention has been an important basis for trade, development and political relations between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries of the alliance for over 22 years. The current Lome Convention expires in 2000, and the Government hope that, during the UK Presidency, the EU's negotiating mandate for the successor arrangements will be agreed. The Commission's proposals provide a very good basis for discussion. They contain much the Government agree with, including a commitment to the international poverty eradication emphasis on partnerships and a simplification of the range of aid instruments.
<P>

<a name="80324w04.html_para6">Trade is the most difficult and complex area. The challenge is to design arrangements which will support the integration of the ACP economies into the world economy. The Commission has proposed a 5 year roll-year of current preferences from 2000-05, followed by either Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or integration into the Generalised System of Preferences, with a special window for the least developed. The Government welcome the roll-over period, but wish to see greater emphasis on enhancing the Generalised System of Preferences, in order to promote a genuine alternative to FTAs for the non-least developed ACP countries.

 Procedures are in place to identify prisoners who need in-patient treatment for mental disorder and to effect their transfer to a psychiatric hospital. The care and treatment of mentally disordered prisoners who do not require in-patient treatment in hospital is generally undertaken by prison healthcare staff or by visiting National Health Service specialists, either on a sessional basis or in some cases as part of a contracted-in comprehensive psychiatric service.

 Under the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, 20 per cent. of the proceeds for good causes goes to sport. 5 per cent. of this is distributed by the Sports Council for Wales.

 Before anyone, other than the Crown, can use a site for the purpose of installing or operating a nuclear installation as defined in the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended) they must be in possession of a licence granted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

This includes the generation of wastes, on-site storage of raw and treated wastes, on-site transport, waste processing and long term storage of waste and spent fuels, which are all integral parts of nuclear site operations licensed by HSE.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Environmental Technology Best Practice programme is continuing to encourage companies to reduce their costs and improve their competitiveness through waste reduction and improved environmental performance. The programme provides case studies of firms already engaged in waste reduction or other cost saving environmental good practice, benchmarking studies using environmental performance guides to enable companies to compare their performance, and guides to help companies adopt better environmental practices which reduce their costs.
<P>

<a name="80324w09.html_para0">In addition to numerous articles in trade and other media, since 1 May 1997, the programme has published 51 case studies, environmental performance or benchmarking studies, and guides to good practice; held 40 workshops, seminars and site visits for industry participants; responded to almost 25,000 calls to the Environmental Helpline (a freephone inquiry service); given counselling visits to more than 250 small enterprises; and added the engineering and ceramics sectors to its main themes on waste minimisation and cleaner technology and its focus on volatile organic compounds and the foundries, metal finishing, textiles, printing, paper and board, chemicals, glass, food and drink industry sectors.

 There are currently no plans for the Council for Science and Technology to investigate the technical, economic, environmental and security status of plutonium. However, as the re-launched CST deliberates upon its future work programme, it will be open to the Council to consider this issue. It is for the owners of spent nuclear fuel, including plutonium, to choose their preferred management options subject to meeting the necessary environmental and regulatory requirements. It remains the responsibility of the Government to ensure that all civil plutonium continues to be subject to rigorous physical protection measures and safeguards in accordance with international non-proliferation obligations.

The need for, and nature of, specific environmental appraisals will depend on the final outcomes of the reviews.

 I have considered the responses to my Department's consultative document very carefully.

<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1998 : Column: 114</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80324w10.html_para0">I am conscious of the concerns of those companies that wanted to be able to keep home addresses off the public register on grounds of either security or privacy. However, such concerns would be impossible to allay completely. The particulars of existing directors registered at Companies House are now in the public arena and it would not be possible to prevent access to that information from company information providers other than Companies House. I have also had to consider the views of those organisations that expressed concern over the need for directors to be accountable to their shareholders and creditors. Keeping home addresses off the public record would make it more difficult to locate directors and easier for directors to avoid creditors and to perpetrate fraud. It would also be more difficult to find out whether directors had been associated with companies that had failed or had been made bankrupt in the past.
<P>

<a name="80324w10.html_para1">I have also decided that the requirement for companies to file directors' other directorships at Companies House should be revoked. A computerised register of directors which provides full details of other directorships was set up by Companies House in 1991. Repealing this requirement will relieve companies of an administrative burden but will not result in any reduction of information on the public record.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The review is now complete. The Government have concluded that the Scheme as operated between 1992 and 1997 did provide significant benefits both to the debtor country and to the UK taxpayer and that these benefits could be further enhanced by some small improvements. A revised Scheme is therefore being relaunched and ECGD is, from today, able to consider offers to purchase rescheduled debts owed by up to 32 countries.
<P>

<a name="80324w10.html_para3">Under the revised Scheme ECGD will, as before, be able to receive an immediate cash benefit for debts rescheduled through the Paris Club arrangements. The purchaser of the debt will be repaid by the debtor country in local currency subject to the funds being invested in a suitable project in that country. As a result, the debtor country benefits both from being able to convert a hard currency obligation into a local currency debt and from securing additional investment.
<P>

<a name="80324w10.html_para4">During the period when the earlier Scheme operated, ECGD sold some US$133 million of debts to a number of organisations investing in a range of projects, including in the fields of education, agricultural rehabilitation and healthcare.

<BR>
The total unclaimed prizes accrued in the last 12 months is &#163;1.2 million. Because of the 18 months before a prize is deemed "unclaimed", this relates to prizes drawn during the period August 1995 to August 1996.
<BR>
Over the 40 year life of the Premium Bond Scheme, the total value of prizes paid out has been &#163;3.9 billion. The current amount unclaimed represents less than half of one per cent. of that total.

 Effective local partnerships are essential to the success of the New Deal. Employers and trades unions clearly have an important part to play. The CBI and the TUC have encouraged their members to be involved fully in local New Deal arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80324w13.html_para1">In addition, my officials and I have held regular meetings with the CBI and trades unions. The New Deal Task Force itself contains two members of the Executive Council of the TUC and Sir Peter Davis, the Chairman of the Task Force, has also recently met John Monks. Sir Peter Davis and other members of the Task Force are members of the CBI President's Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will set out the formula for funding sixth-form pupils <i>(a)</i> continuing in the sixth forms of secondary schools and <i>(b)</i> transferring to sixth form colleges at age sixteen.  [33996]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w13.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Maintained schools receive funding for sixth form pupils on the basis of a formula devised by the LEA as part of its Local Management of Schools (LMS) scheme. Under LMS arrangements, the bulk of funding is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. In most cases this funding is weighted for age, with other factors to provide additional funding for schools in particular circumstances. In a small number of cases, LEAs also allocate different levels of funding to reflect the costs of particular courses undertaken by sixth form pupils. Funding for sixth form colleges is allocated through the funding methodology employed by the Further Education Funding Council. Each student attracts a number of units for the college, reflecting in particular the course being followed by the student. The college also receives units for providing the student with appropriate pre-enrolment guidance and for the student's eventual achievement.

<a name="80324w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Welsh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will introduce measures to help students over the age of 50 years by <i>(a)</i> the provision of grants, <i>(b)</i> the waiving of tuition fees and <i>(c)</i> extending the upper age limit of eligibility for student loans; and if he will make a statement.  [36077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80324w14.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Full-time students currently in higher education who were aged over 50 at the start of their course are eligible for free tuition and for a means tested grant towards their living costs and will continue to be so for the duration of their courses. Those aged 50 and over who begin courses in the academic year 1998-99 will also be eligible for a grant at a reduced rate for that year only.
<P>

<a name="80324w14.html_para0">Under the new arrangements applying to entrants from 1998-99 onwards, all students, irrespective of their age, will be eligible to receive means-related help towards their contribution to tuition costs. We have no plans to extend the eligibility for loans to those aged 50 and over for 1998-99, but intend to review the eligibility requirements for 1999-2000 and subsequent years when grants will no longer be available. The recent consultation paper on lifelong learning, "The Learning Age", invited views on extending loans to those in their early 50s who wish to enter higher education, for example, to retrain following redundancy. Final decisions will be taken in the light of the responses to that consultation.

 The Mount Vernon and Watford Hospitals NHS Trust provides plastic and burns services for these areas. A review of these services is being undertaken through joint working with the NHS Executive's regional offices and affected health authorities. Further discussions will shortly confirm a model of care, and criteria against which options for the future provision of services would be assessed. Full public consultation will take place on any significant service reconfiguration.

 The key to improving the mental health of young people is preventing problems from developing in the first place.

 The Department is seeking to ensure that the needs of black and minority ethnic groups are fully integrated into the mainstream of service provision. This is an important part of the Government's programme to tackle inequalities and covers public health and health services, employment and social care issues. Ministers have asked for targets to be set and achieved within given time frames to embed ethnic minority health in the policy and service delivery areas.
