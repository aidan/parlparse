<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="81208w0007.htm_para4"><a name="08120810000066">The figures for 2005-06 are not comparable to 2008-09 because the introduction of the DSG fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The Education Formula Spending (EFS) formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority&#146;s previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG&#146;s Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department&#146;s time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

Recorded sectors on the DTR include maintained schools in England and Wales, independent schools that are members of the Teachers' Pensions Scheme, further education colleges and certain higher education colleges.

 The Tornado GR4 will have the capability to carry the Raptor Reconnaissance Pod from the start of their deployment; however there has not yet been any decision to deploy this capability.
